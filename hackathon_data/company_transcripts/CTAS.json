At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Senior VP of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Hansen","Thank you, good evening and thanks for joining us tonight. With me is, Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2018. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","In a moment, we are going to share with you our third quarter results which represented another strong quarter of execution and performance. There is a lot of noise in our results so we will do our best to help you to decipher the performance of the business. Before diving into the numbers though, we thought it fitting to recognize that yesterday was the anniversary of the closing of G&K services deal."," The past year has been quite transformative for Cintas. Our employees whom we call partners including our partners who came to us from G&K have done some great foundational work over the last year to position us for success going forward. We remain as excited as ever about our future. In early February, we were thrilled to be able to share with our partners a one-time cash payment. The timing couldn\u2019t have been better for us given the work done during the past year since March 21st of 2017.","As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, indicated in today's press release, the recently passed U.S. tax reform legislation is good for Cintas, our shareholders and our customers. And again, our success wouldn\u2019t have been possible without our motivated and engaged partners, and we were excited to share with them.","Moving onto our third quarter results, our revenue for the third quarter which ended February 28th was 1,589 billion, an increase of 26.6% over the last year's third quarter. The organic revenue growth rate which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 7.8%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facilities services segment was 6.5% and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10%.","Reported operating income for the third quarter of 200 million compared to 192 million in last year's third quarter. However, there are some items worth noting that impacted the comparability of results year-over-year. First, our operating income was reduced 10 million in the third quarter of fiscal '18 and 9 million in the third quarter of fiscal '17 by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K services acquisition.","Second, operating income in the third quarter of fiscal '18 was also reduced by the one-time cash payment to Cintas partners that I just mentioned, which amounted to an expense of approximately 40 million. Excluding these two items, our third quarter operating income was approximately 250 million or 15.7% of revenue. This measurement is consistent with the way in which we've reported our first two quarters of this fiscal year.","Keep in mind that operating income includes 12 million of intangible asset amortization expense from the purchase price accounting of the G&K deal and $5 million of incremental depreciation and implementation costs of our enterprise resource planning system or SAP. These two items totaled 1.2% of revenue.","Reported net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of $296 million increased 152.9% from last year's third quarter. Reported earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter were 2.66 compared to 1.06 in last year's third quarter. Again, there were handful of items that impacted the comparability of net income and EPS results to prior year.","First, fiscal '18 and fiscal '17 third quarter EPS included a negative impact of $0.06 from G&K transaction and integration expenses. Second, fiscal '18 third quarter EPS also included a negative impact of $0.24 from the one-time cash payment to Cintas partners. Lastly, more than offsetting these negative impacts was a significant benefit to EPS of $1.59 from the benefits of the new Tax Act.","Excluding these items to provide better visibility to our financial performance, net income dollars increased to 24.1% and net income margin was 9.6% compared to 9.8% last year and EPS increased 22.3%. Note again that net income includes intangible asset amortization expense from the purchase price accounting of the G&K deal and incremental depreciation and implementation costs of SAP. These two items net of tax totaled 0.8% of revenue or $0.12.","In addition to strong execution on the fundamentals, our third quarter was one of solid progress on two important long-term investments G&K and SAP. The integration of G&K remains on track. We\u2019ve now closed 60 duplicate operations which is 95% of the total plant closures. Also 59% of G&K locations have been converted to the Cintas operating system. This is an increase from 47% at the end of the second quarter.","The system conversions are very important as they are necessary for us to achieve numerous operational synergies. These activities helped us in the third quarter to realize about $15 million in synergies, which is in line with our expectations. Regarding SAP, significant advancement continued in our implementation, which remains on schedule. In our third quarter 24 operations were converted, a total of 79 operations have now been converted to date, which is about 25% of the total planned.","As I previously detailed, we had several third-quarter items including the benefit of tax reform that baked the comparability of our full fiscal year results to prior year complex. Rather than provide full fiscal year guidance, we believe is more beneficial for the sake of simplicity to provide specific guidance for our fourth quarter of fiscal '18. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.625 billion to $1.645 million.","I want to reiterate a point we have made in the past, in our upcoming fourth quarter, we will lap the one year anniversary of the acquisition of G&K. For the first time, G&K's growth will be organic as opposed to inorganic. In the fourth quarter, we will report an organic growth rate that is the combination of the strongly growing Cintas legacy business and a significantly sized acquired G&K business that historically grew slower than Cintas and that will have declined year-over-year in the fourth quarter.","We expect this lower organic growth rate to be temporary, just as it was for our First Aid and Safety segment after it acquired ZEE Medical. With the investment in selling resources having already been made to grow the G&K business, we expect the total Uniform Rental and Facility services organic growth rate to accelerate as we move through fiscal 2019. For our fiscal 2018 quarter, we expect EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.69.","Guidance assumes the fourth quarter tax rate of 24%. We anticipate healthy fourth quarter operating margins in excess of last year's fourth quarter. Note that while the EPS guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the fourth quarter as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $10 million to $15 million.","I will now turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Adler","Thank you, Mike. First please note that our fiscal third quarter contains the same number of workdays 64, as the prior year third-quarter. However, on a sequential basis, it had one less workday in the second quarter. One less workday in a quarter has an impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses including rental material costs, depreciation expense, and amortization expense been determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis.","Our upcoming fiscal fourth quarter will contain 66 days, the same number of days as the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. We have two reportable operating segments Uniform Rental and Facility services and First Aid and Safety services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sales business. First Aid and Safety service and All Other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement.","Uniform Rental and Facilities services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restrooms supply and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogues to our customer on route. Uniform Rental and Facilities services revenue was $1.284 billion, an increase of 30.0% compared to last year's third quarter.","Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.5%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility services segment gross margin was 44.1% for the third quarter compared to 45.1% in last year's third quarter. The reduction in margin is attributable to the inclusion in this year's third quarter of the lower margin G&K business. The margin of the G&K business has continued to decline as the top line has lowered.","In addition, we continued to incur the typical conversion costs which impact margins in the short term. While the stimulation of the G&K business continues at a great pace, Mike mentioned 95% of duplicate operations have been closed, more work remains. The G&K gross margins will improve through Cintas legacy levels as we further integrate this business, and we increasingly realize more of the synergies, we are on track.","Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sales and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segments revenue for the third quarter was 137 million, which was 10.5% higher than last year's third quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 10.0%. This segments gross margin was 46.9% in the third quarter compared to 44.8% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 210 basis points.","The third quarter was another outstanding quarter for this business. Strong new business wins and expanding gross margins are evidenced of the value businesses of all types place on having Cintas manage their first aid and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and ready for the work day. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sales businesses are reported in the all other category.","The Uniform Direct Sales business long-term growth rates are generally low single-digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion account. Our fire business however continues to grow each year at a strong pace. All other revenue was 167 million an increase of 17.0% compared to last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate was 14.9%. All other gross margin was 41.7% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41.2% for last year's third quarter an increase of 50 basis points.","All other gross margin expansion was driven by the higher margin fire business. Our uniform direct sales business growth was strong in the third quarter note that the business will face some difficult sales growth comparisons in the fourth quarter. Last year\u2019s fourth quarter benefited from the significant roll out of new uniform styles for the pilots and flight attendance of Southwest Airlines. Large roll outs such as these do not repeat each year as businesses typically rebrand only every three to five years or so. The benefit from Southwest last year will be a headwind of about $13 million to this year\u2019s fourth quarter revenue.","Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.9% in the third quarter compared to 28.6% in last year's third quarter. Please note that the one-time cash payment at Cintas partners Mike mentioned earlier was recorded in SG&A. Excluding this one-time payment, this year\u2019s third quarter SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 28.4% compared to 28.6% last year. SG&A benefited from improved receivables collections and favorable workers\u2019 compensation claims experienced.","On the year-to-date basis, SG&A excluding the one-time payment is up 50 basis points over last year. However, note that current year SG&A is negatively impacted about 100 basis points by intangible assets amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition and incremental SAP depreciation and implementation costs. We are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs and making good progress on reducing general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue.","As Mike stated earlier, our third quarter fiscal 2018 effective tax rate on continuing operations benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. The benefit of the Tax Act to the third quarter EPS was $1.59. Our EPS guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 assumes an effective tax rate of 24.0%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation expense realized each period.","Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 28 was $152 million, and we had $33 million of marketable securities as of quarter end. Free cash flow in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $464 million, an increase of $200 million or 75% from the prior year period.","Capital expenditures for the first nine months of the fiscal year were $196 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the nine month period was as follows: $163 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $21 million in First Aid and Safety; and $12 million in All Other. We expect fourth quarter 2018 CapEx to be approximately $65 million.","As of February 28, total debt was $2,722,000,000, consisting of $187 million in short-term debt and $2,535,000,000 of long-term debt. At February 28, our leverage was 2.3 times debt-to-EBITDA.","Overall, our cash flow remains strong and we expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0 times debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019re happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will hear first from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Greg Bardi","Hi, this is Greg calling on for Manav. I just wanted to hit on G&K first sets okay. Maybe I missed it, but could you give the revenue and growth rate you saw in the third quarter? And then maybe more broadly on touch on any early signs you\u2019re seeing from potential revenue synergy opportunity?","Michael Hansen","Third quarter revenue was slightly over $230 million and it was down about 4.7%. I would tell you, Greg that being able to specifically identify that G&K revenue gets harder and harder as we have -- as you've heard us say closed 60 locations, and now that revenue is really starting to mix in with Cintas locations. So getting a little harder and harder to identify, but those were the estimated third quarter numbers.","From a revenue synergy standpoint, we think opportunities are going to be there. We are moving somewhat slowly on that because we want to make sure that through the large disruption of closing and system conversions that we, that we maintain a very good customer relationship and introducing new things to them in addition to that kind of disruption gets to be overwhelming sometime.","So, we\u2019re moving fairly slowly on that. I would expect it will start to see some benefit in the back half of fiscal \u201919 and certainly in fiscal \u201920. But from our standpoint today, early signs are we feel pretty good about that opportunity in the future.","Greg Bardi","Okay and then from the core Cintas side, I know it's a metric we don\u2019t look at quite as much anymore, but maybe some color on what you\u2019re seeing from the net add stops and hiring from their existing customers?","Paul Adler","Yes Greg, its Paul. So the add stops metric was positive, I think the only thing really of note was that we had some good lift in the dust mats area, carpeted mats, wets and cold winters with a lot of snow good participation definitely give us a little bit of lift, but outside of that nothing significant to add specially in terms of anything in the garment area.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","Just following up on the G&K. You mentioned that was down 4.7% in the quarter. I think last quarter you mentioned in your guidance 8.95 to 9.15 for the year. So I\u2019m just wondering, is that still like a good number for the year? Or was this quarter little bit better than what you're expecting previously?","Michael Hansen","We have been very pleased with the performance of G&K revenue block, so far and it was a little bit better than we expected in the third, and I would say were going to be at around 920 million for the year, which is slightly better than that range that we gave last quarter and we continue to see very positive things from not just the revenue performance but overall performance.","Toni Kaplan","And this quarter I guess the legacy Cintas organic growth decelerated for the second quarter to 6.5%, so I just wanted to get a little bit of extra color on sort of what you\u2019re seeing in that Cintas legacy business like, should we expect I guess the G&K will be inorganic so of course the fourth quarter will be even lower, but just on legacy Cintas businesses, is there something sort of driving the deceleration? Or is it just look the comps are getting harder?","Michael Hansen","We believe that the execution and the performance of the business is still very good, we\u2019re very pleased with it. And as you probably noticed, we increased our guidance for the fourth quarter as well. So, we still feel very good about the performance, look in every quarter, there are puts and takes. For the first half of the year for example, we got a little bit of an energy headwind and in the third quarter -- last year's third quarter was very strong, and so there are puts and takes in every quarter, but we\u2019re still in the range where we want to be and we feel like we\u2019re operating very efficiently throughout this fiscal year.","When you think about our fourth quarter guidance, we effectively raise the bottom end about 67 million and the top end about 22 million, and again a bit of a signal that we still feel good about the business. And generally speaking, if we hit the top of that guidance range in the fourth quarter, I would expect that the legacy Cintas business may see a little bit of an uptick in organic growth in that fourth quarter. We won\u2019t report it that way because we\u2019re comingling the G&K and the Cintas business but we feel good about it.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now go to Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital.","Hamzah Mazari","The first question is just if you could give us a sense of how to think about utilization across your facilities? I realize facility capacity is measured locally versus nationally, but maybe just give us some sense, how many facilities are at say 75% plus utilization? What's underutilized in your platform? I know you're going through a consolidation as well, so just any color, where are we utilization wise, however you want to answer that?","Michael Hansen","Hamzah, as you mentioned, capacity is local and there\u2019re some markets that are reaching their capacity, there\u2019re others that have plenty. When we need extra capacity, we will do certain short-term steps before building a fully new facility like we may add a washer and dryer to our wash alley. We may pump out our wash alley and make it even larger and that will add capacity and we usually do those things, as we start to creep up on the capacity and that allows us to expand the existing capacity.","We\u2019ll continue to do those things we have in the last several years, but we\u2019ll also add I would say something in the way of two to four plants per year. We have done that this fiscal year and I would expect it will continue to do something like that into the future, as we or if we continue to grow like we have been. Is that the answer to your question?","Hamzah Mazari","Yes, that's very helpful. And then maybe any view I know its early days, there is low visibility, but any thoughts on the Trump tariffs? How that impacts your business either directly or indirectly? And anything you are hearing from customers, anything you are hearing from your procurement guys, just any sense early sense of that?","Michael Hansen","Well, we didn\u2019t fair to well in the market today. I still start by that. We're not seeing things from our customers yet and that's too early to tell. Certainly, we do have some things that we sourced out of China, we're keeping our eyes on it and how they may be affected by the list of things that may have a tariff. But I think it's too early to tell because we really don\u2019t know what's on and what's not, quite yet. So too early to tell, we're keeping our eyes on it. Our goal will be, if we do see some things that may be affected into the future, our goal is to do our best to resource or find efficiencies to offset, and I think we've done a fairly good job of that over the years.","Hamzah Mazari","Last question, I'll turn it over. Just any thoughts on how much of your market place is self operated on the uniform side and any change you are seeing in terms of outsourcing trends has that been pretty consistent any thoughts there appreciated?","Michael Hansen","We haven't we talked a lot about the no programmer new business, so that is new customers that weren\u2019t any uniform rental program previously, and we haven't seen a change, we're still having success in finding new businesses to put into uniform rental program. So, it's not much change in our third quarter relative to the previous several quarters.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Two questions. First one, could you comment on sales force productivity and obviously you are progressing nicely through your integration? Could you just talk to some of the developments you had there and what stuff to go and how it's working?","Michael Hansen","Now, we see some encouraging science, Scott. Our productivity has improved sequentially through this fiscal year and that's with quite a few more sales people certainly than a year ago as we brought on the G&K sales team. So, we're seeing some encouraging productivity signs, but certainly, we have our ways to go. We still have productivity improvements to get and then were confident that those will come over the course of the fourth quarter and fiscal '19.","Scott Schneeberger","And my follow-up is on CapEx, if my numbers are right it looks like the guidance reduced by maybe 15 million or 20 million this year, if you can please correct me on that and let me know it? And where is that coming from, is that a push out? Is there anything changing with SAP or if you can tell us where if there is a change where it is occurring?","Michael Hansen","Yes, I think it\u2019s more than anything its timing. We do have a lot going on in terms of the G&K integration and SAP implementation and some projects tend to get pushed a little bit as move through those integrations market-by-market. So I would just call it timing more than anything.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Judah Sokel with JP Morgan.","Judah Sokel","I was wondering if you can give us an update on the four buckets that you\u2019ve talked about in the past of cost synergies, which we have talked about $130 million to $140 million. Where we -- how we're progressing on each of those?","Michael Hansen","So, let me start with the 15 million that we talked about in the third quarter, about half is G&A and the other half would be in the gross margin. So, from a G&A perspective, you probably saw in our third quarter that we\u2019re making some nice progress in terms of leveraging and getting that SG&A down from post acquisitions levels. So we are making some nice progress and we have more to do. So for example, we still have an IT presence from the legacy G&K team as we continue to roll off of that system. And so, there will be some additional things that come but we\u2019ve made some really nice progress.","The other bucket that we talked about our production bucket that is the cost of running our facilities, and as you can imagine, we are in the midst of closing a number of facilities and converting. And so while we have set up a lot of those synergies, there\u2019s some inefficiency that\u2019s going on right now in our third quarter, a little bit in our second quarter, certainly a little bit more in our fourth quarter as we do the things necessary to achieve those.","So for example, we are doing a pretty good job of getting those locations closed and eliminating some duplicate labor and other costs. And we will get more efficient as we move away from the impression market-by-market, but the production has come along very well and we still expect the same kind of results that we\u2019d put out a year ago.","From a service perspective -- haven\u2019t done much of that heavy lifting yet that as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we need to get on the same systems in markets before we can really start to get in route optimization. We have started some of that in some markets. We will continue to do that in our fourth quarter, but likely even more heavy lifting in the first half of fiscal '19. But indications are we still feel good about capturing those synergies that we\u2019ve talked about.","And the last bucket was the sourcing bucket. And we are making progress on that area as well. As you probably know it takes longer to recognize that because we may be able to get new sourcing and new pricing but it takes a little while to purchase it, sold it out, get it into our distribution center and get it into in-service inventory and then it starts amortizing, right? So we are making the -- some really nice progress there. Just takes more time to realize it.","So all-in-all Judah, feel good about all four of those buckets.","Judah Sokel","Those are very helpful color, thanks. And other question about the 2019 comment that you guys have mention that you expect to see acceleration throughout the year. Is that purely a function of the G&K decline moderating and perhaps switching the growth? Or is that in the core legacy Cintas business also you\u2019re expecting some sort of pick up in that business?","Michael Hansen","No more than anything it's seeing the G&K business began to level and then start to grow and more than anything seeing the productivity improving our sales team that I mentioned a bit ago.","Operator","Thank you. We will now hear from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Michael Hansen","Mike, are you seeing a positive impact in the business, overall, just from tax legislation, just from your customers? Maybe any pickup in hiring or being easier to sell, it's now been approximately three months, I was wondering what you're seeing on that side of it?","Michael Hansen","Shlomo, we're hearing some anecdotal thing that the sentiment is good. I would say from the standpoint of impact to the P&L probably, not much yet. You still have to take the time to sell it and get people in the uniform or get the mass out there. And as you know we\u2019re kind of weakly billing business and it takes a little time to accumulate some of that revenue. And so, it takes a little time. So I would say the really impacted in our third quarter has not been very significant. But sentiment seems to be pretty good.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So would you expect that to be a lift in future quarters?","Michael Hansen","I think certainly that if we see our customers spending some of the cash that they are getting from the tax reform, yes, I think that will be a benefit. It's hard to tell how much, but I think that will certainly be a good thing for all of us.","Michael Hansen","Okay, and then could you talk a little bit about just what drove some of the sequentially improved results in the other business? Is it what's going on in fire safety anything in particular, that's going on, you could call out?","Michael Hansen","Shlomo, In fire, I mean nothing and particular a call out, as we mentioned in kind of our remarks that is a business that has growing very strongly organically for some time now expectation is typically a high single digits about 10%, so as Mike said, sometimes you have some puts and takes each quarter, and there might be a little bit of volatility, but you're nothing, nothing to call out so good strong growing business and then the direct sale business.","You know, they did have a very strong third quarter, they did have some nice wins nothing to the extent of a Southwest Airlines rollout that I mentioned in the comments but still some nice good winds and to be told last year's third quarter with a little light. So they had some nice statement comparisons in Q3, as we've talked about in the prepared remarks. Remember that that direct sale business will have a very difficult comp due to southwest rolling out last year.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","And if you don\u2019t mind just a little housekeeping, what\u2019s the pro forma tax rate you\u2019re using for the $1.37 EPS number?","Michael Hansen","It\u2019s 32% for the quarter and so based on where we have -- had guided you previously there's probably about $0.06 of a tax benefit in that $1.37 that is non-U.S. tax reform related.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So, pro forma tax rate pretax income you would use 32% to get down to your 1.37?","Michael Hansen","Yes, for the quarter only, not year-to-date, but for the quarter only.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Andy Wittmann with R. W. Baird.","Andy Wittmann","I guess let\u2019s talk about the 40 million payment to your partners, I assume that most of that was in the rental segment but was there any amount that\u2019s notable that we should know for our models that wasn\u2019t in the other segment?","Michael Hansen","It was a 2.5% of revenue in each segment Andy.","Andy Wittmann","And then maybe just on the guidance looking at it another way, it seemed like, well it looks like if you adjust for the tax rate bump, about $0.25 by our estimates versus what you would have previously and you had some pretty good guidance bump that you\u2019ve mentioned. I was just wondering it sounds like G&K revenues had a plan, can you maybe talk Mike about some of the other factors that helped you get to upside and maybe the significance of them?","Michael Hansen","The good news, I'll start with, there\u2019re two more workdays and that certainly is beneficial two workdays than in the third quarter. Same as last year's year-over-year, but sequentially that'll help us. Andy, it\u2019s continuing to sell. It is working through the integration activities. We\u2019re going to get more leverage as we as we go into that fourth quarter. And we\u2019ve seen some real nice things in the SG&A area, so I think it\u2019s just a -- it\u2019s a lot of the execution along with some healthy revenue.","Andy Wittmann","And maybe my last question is just trying to understand a little bit more detail on the characteristics of your growth in uniform rental, and you guys have answered this question about kind of add stops, new business versus no programmers, and all of things. But one other questions that I want to get a sense from you about, is specifically on penetration of existing customers, if you were to break up that as a bucket of your gross new sales in the quarter. How significant or how much of the growth rate is based on sales to existing customers in particular whether it\u2019s cross-sell, up-sell and maybe not including pricing, if you could just help us understand how important that is to your growth, that\u2019d be helpful?","Michael Hansen","Certainly, Andy, it\u2019s important it\u2019s not as a big of a driver as new business and really has never been, but it is important to us and while we haven't gotten specific in terms of magnitude -- quantifying magnitude. It is certainly second-most to the new business effort that we have. So it\u2019s an important factor. We think there are lots of opportunities remaining in that area as, for particularly, as we continue to penetrate with things like cohort and ship works garments, and with our signature series restaurant product. So, still lot of opportunity left, but it's an important factor.","Andy Wittmann","And maybe my last, last question, I was wondering you commented on last couple of quarters on the pricing environment. You said it's been always competitive, but you are getting some. How would you characterize the price that's realized in the third quarter versus the two single last few quarters?","Michael Hansen","No change to speak off remains pretty competitive, but no change from the last several quarters.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And at this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Mike Hansen for any additional or closing remarks.","Michael Hansen","Thank you very much for joining us tonight. We look forward to talking with you again in our fourth quarter call that will happen in mid-July and have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, again that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all again for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"5560":["Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) Q2 2020 Results Conference Call December 17, 2019  5:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Mike Hansen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Paul Adler - Vice President and Treasurer","Conference Call Participants","Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley","Hamzah Mazari - Jefferies","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","Gary Bisbee - Bank of America","Andrew Wittmann - RW Baird","Daniel Hultberg - Oppenheimer","George Tong - Goldman Sachs","Kevin McVeigh - Credit Suisse ","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","Operator","Good day. And welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.","And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Hansen","Good evening. And thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2020. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements.","This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 was a record $1.84 billion, an increase of 7.3% over last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was also 7.3%. In the second quarter of fiscal '20, the organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 5.8%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 10.6%.","Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '20 of $852.4 million increased 10%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 46.2% for the second quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 45.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '19. Uniform Rental and Facility Services' operating segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved 130 basis points from last year's second quarter to 46.6%, and the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment gross margin improved 40 basis points to 48.4%.","Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal '20 of $334.5 million increased 21.3%. Operating margin was 18.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '20 compared to 16% in fiscal '19. Operating income in the second quarter of fiscal '19 was impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $7.8 million or 50 basis points. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '20 was $246.4 million and reported earnings per diluted share were $2.27.","Excluding the one-time gain on the sale of a cost method investment and the G&K acquisition integration expenses, both in fiscal '19, EPS increased 29%. As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer who's quoted in today's earnings press release, we are pleased with our second quarter and year-to-date performance.","We thank our employee partners for continuing to execute well and take great care of our customers. In addition to the strong financial performance, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value.","On December 6th, we paid an annual dividend of $2.55 per share, an increase of 24.4% over last year's annual dividends. We've increased the dividend for 36 consecutive years. In the past 10 years, the annual dividend per share increased at a compound annual growth rate of 18.2%.","Before turning the call over to Paul for more details, I'll provide an update of our fiscal '20 expectations. We have increased our expectations of financial performance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.29 billion to $7.33 billion. We expect EPS to be in the range of $8.65 to $8.75.","Note the following regarding the guidance. The growth rate at the revenue guidance range is 5.8% for 6.4%. However, our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than our fiscal '19. Adjusting for this one day difference, on a constant workday basis, the revenue growth rate range at guidance is 6.2% to 6.8%. One less workday also has a negative impact on EPS, reducing it about $0.06, which is 90 basis points drag on the EPS growth rate. Adjusting for this, the EPS growth rate range is 14.7% to 16%.","Guidance assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal '20 of 19.2% compared to a rate of 19.7% for fiscal '19. Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. It assumes a share counts for computing EPS of 109 million shares. This consists of diluted weighted average shares outstanding plus participating securities in the form of restricted stock. The guidance does not assume any future share buybacks or any additional G&K integration expenses.","I'll now turn the call over Paul.","Paul Adler","Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than in fiscal '19. One less day will negatively impact fiscal '20 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. To illustrate the magnitude of the headwinds, using fiscal '19's annual revenue, one less workday equates to about $27 million. One less workday also has a negative impact on operating margin and EPS.","Fiscal '20 operating income margin will be reduced by about 12.5 basis points in comparison to fiscal '19 due to one less day of revenue. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses, like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats, are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis. And we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses.","As Mike stated, one less workday is a headwind of about 90 basis points on EPS growth, and about a $0.06 drag on total EPS in comparison to fiscal '19. Each quarter of fiscal '20 contains 65 workdays. In comparison to fiscal '19, our upcoming Q3 of fiscal '20 will have one additional day, and our Q4 will have one less day. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '20 results.","We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All-Other. All-Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All-Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.","The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on ramp. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.47 billion, an increase for 5.7%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 5.8%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 46.6% for the second quarter compared to 45.3% in last year's second quarter, an improvement of 130 basis points.","Operating Income margin was a record 19.5% for the second quarter and it was 19% year-to-date. Profit margins have strengthened for many reasons including strong revenue growth and realization of profit synergies from the acquisition of G&K.","Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. The segment's revenue for the second quarter was $169.7 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 10.6%. The First Aid segment gross margin was 14.4% in the second quarter compared to 14% in masters second quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. First Aid segment gross margins continued to increase with strong revenue growth.","Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in all other categories. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale, however, is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and service from our other business units.","All Other revenue was $204.1 million, an increase of 17.2%. The organic growth rate was 16.5%. The Fire business organic growth rate was 9.6%. Uniform Direct Sales business saw an exceptionally strong quarter, posting an organic growth rate of 25%. Growth was driven in large part due to the rollout of Carhartt branded garments to a Fortune 100 customer. All Other gross margin was 41.8% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41.2% last year.","Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '20 and 28.6% in the second quarter of fiscal '19. Improvement was realized in many areas, including lower G&A labor expense as a percentage of revenue. Last quarter, we mentioned that medical expense as a percent of revenue spiked. It came back in line in the second quarter as we expected.","Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal '20 was 20.1%. Stock based compensation positively impacted the tax rate. As Mike stated earlier, the tax rate can move from period-to-period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30th was $226.5 million. Year-to-date, operating cash flow increased about 66% from last year, because of strong earnings growth and improvements in working capital, particularly accounts receivable, inventories, uniforms and other rental items in service and accounts payable. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $61.4 million.","Our CapEx by operating segments was as follows; $48.6 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $10.8 million in First Aid and Safety, and $2 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '20 CapEx to be in a range of $265 million to $290 million. As of November 30th, total debt was $2,738.4 million. $2,538.6 million was fixed interest rate debt and $199.8 million was variable rate debt in the form of a term loan. At November 30th, our leverage was 1.8 times debt-to-EBITDA.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Toni Kaplan at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Toni Kaplan","You had a pretty solid beat in the quarter, but only a modest 2% raise for the full year. Could you just talk about your expectations around maybe the broader macro and anything else that might be one-time in the quarter, or might reverse as we go through the year? Just wondering why not a bigger raise? Thanks.","Mike Hansen","And Toni, you are speaking of revenue right now. Correct?","Toni Kaplan","Yes.","Mike Hansen","And so, from a -- let's talk about the quarter. We had a very good quarter. The -- all of our businesses grew, and in particular our direct sale business had a really nice quarter. Toni, you'd asked a little bit about the macro first. And I would say not a lot of change during the quarter. We did say at the beginning of the quarter that energy, we were starting to see a little bit of softness in the energy area. We did see a little bit of that during the quarter.","In fact, we had one fairly good sized customer in the space go bankrupt. But I would say, the other thing is, industrials are a bit choppy, generally speaking. Having said that, not a lot of change during the quarter. We are encouraged, as we kind of forward, we are encouraged that we've -- it looks like we've made some progress in the USMCA and China trade and we're encouraged by the movement there and we look forward to getting those results.","It seems like we seen a little bit of a steady direction out of the Fed on interest rates. And so, as we leave the second quarter, I would say there are some encouraging signs, but there's still we're entering the election year, there still is a lot going on in terms of the noise in the marketplace, and whether or not small business and other businesses will continue to invest. And so we still look a little bit with caution as we think about the second half of the year.","As it relates to the guidance, look, we had a very good first half of the year. Our partners did a great job, and the year is playing out generally as we expected. We had growth of roughly 7%. Organic growth of over 7% for the first half of the year, but we also have some things that went our way. I talked a little bit about this in the first quarter where rental probably got a little bit of year-over-year benefit in the first quarter and that certainly helped as we kind of were finding the bottom last year in our rental business as we've lapped the G&K acquisition. So again, a little bit of benefit in the first half there.","We talked about pricing being incrementally positive in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, maybe not quite as incrementally positive in the second quarter but certainly, some benefit in the first half of the year. I would expect that that we'll fall back into kind of the pricing range we've been in the last few years. When you think about the Direct Sale business, we talked about that, we referred of that a few times, had a great year in the first half. In the second half, our expectation is, as this business can be lumpy that we'll be flat to down in that. And so just that alone is about 75 basis points of growth impact when you compare the first half to the second half.","I talked a little bit about the outlook on the macro. And so as we think about the second half, we're thinking about the macro. We're thinking about -- there are some things that really went well in the first half, may not get all of that benefit in the second half. Having said all of that, look, it's -- our same work day growth is 6.2 to 6.8, and the year is shaping up pretty much the way we expected it to. And if we can hit those kind of numbers, that's a really nice year for us.","Toni Kaplan","And just wanted to ask about buybacks, you really pulled back pretty dramatically this quarter. Just wanted to get some color around, how we should be thinking about any sort of change to capital deployment philosophy, or just why it's very minimal buybacks this quarter?","Mike Hansen","Yes, we do have -- we've got the authorization of about 1.2 billion. And we look at that, as we talked about, we look at that opportunistically. One thing to keep in mind is we, in the first week of December, we made $268 million payment related to our dividend, and we also have some debt interest payments. So we're back into CP in the month of December, but we will look at the buyback opportunistically as we move through the rest of the year. And specifically to your question, we have not made any changes to the way we think about capital allocation.","Operator","We will now take the next question from Hamzah Mazari at Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Hamzah Mazari","My first question is just on the SAP rollout sort of just any update there. Specifically, where do you see benefits once that's rolled out in April or May next year? Is that going to be an organic growth through cross-selling, or do we see sort of SG&A come off? Any color as to benefits of that rollout?","Mike Hansen","Hamza, we're about 85% of the way through our SAP journey at this point in time, so we've made some good progress in the quarter. And we're still on track to complete the project by the end of the fiscal year. As far as benefits are concerned, I think the benefits from SAP are going to be kind of throughout the P&L. We've talked about some of them already that that can be achieved by locations individually, better technology in the hands of the people providing the services, better information at their disposal, the ability for our accounting and finance people and operations people to look at data from the very back of the house all the way to invoicing and pricing with the customer. But then there are other benefits to that that we believe will be benefiting the top-line later on and more perhaps impactfully when the entire network is in the system.","But certainly, we believe that putting the Uniform Rental business and our First Aid business in the same operating system will foster more collaboration, more cross-selling, which will help the top-line. And just better, as I mentioned earlier, use the data, looking at our big, large national accounts, from city-to-city-to city to do analyses and make sure that we're getting all the entitled revenue that we should for the agreements, make sure the pricing is appropriate for the contract. So lots of opportunities, but not able to quantify anything at this point in time. As I said, we'll complete that rollout this fiscal year and have more color next fiscal year for you.","Hamzah Mazari","And just a follow-up question and I'll turn it over. When you think about M&A outside of core Uniform Rental and the businesses you're in. What are some of the metrics you're looking at? I know you want to touch more businesses. I assume it's our base. Does it have to be accretive to growth, accretive to margin? I know you guys just did shred it a long time ago and that business got sold. We did G&K that was part of the core. Just any color as to metrics you can share, how you think of our larger M&A outside the core? Thank you.","Mike Hansen","First of all, we work for B2B. We love the recurring revenue nature of our kinds of businesses. Route based is preferred but it's not absolutely necessary. The key is what kind of service, can we add to provide some level of value to the customer. So that's the real key. We would want it to be an opportunity that can add value to many of our customers, not just a small subset, and we would want it to have margin potential.","So you asked, does it need to be growth accretive and margin accretive. We certainly would love it to be, but there really aren't that many out there, we're looking hard for them. But those are the kind of things that we will look for. Recurring revenue streams, can it benefit our current customers, is it a large opportunity for us, or is it very narrow, what's the service component.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Manav Patnaik at Barclays. Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik","My first question is just can you just walk us through why the lower CapEx assumption and then maybe just some context when you look at the -- over the next two to three years, I guess where are your greatest investment means?","Mike Hansen","We -- generally, we are making our CapEx in terms of our growth opportunities, like new routes and then -- and adding capacity. I would say we continue to add the routes. So in other words, buying trucks and that is certainly important for us. But as it relates to laundry capacity, for example, we've got some really interesting projects that are going on that that we think can help us out in certain cases. And so, we're seeing a little bit of a benefit because of that.","I've talked a little bit about G&K auto source that that's kind of a quasi auto source that helps us in certain facilities. And we're moving on rolling out some of those kind of things. We're looking at things like efficiency in the wash alley. And then we certainly still have a little bit of the capacity that we have gotten from the G&K acquisition. So, the combination of all of those things has created efficiency opportunities for us, particularly in the production environment, and you're seeing a little bit of that benefit in our gross margin.","Manav Patnaik","And then just in terms of G&K and maybe tied to the SAP implementation. Are there systems I guess on SAP as well? And is it still too hard for you guys to quantify any revenue synergies that you might be getting from that deal?","Mike Hansen","Well, keep in mind we converted all G&K locations to either the Cintas SAP system or the legacy Cintas system, so that we could fully get off of that system. And that was completed, gosh, probably over a year ago. And so we still have some of those that need to get from the Cintas legacy system to SAP. And so we inserted those locations as it made sense into the SAP rollout. And so we're almost there. Paul said we're 85% of the way there in total in terms of the conversion and we made good progress.","So we have a pretty good handle on in terms of viewing the G&K legacy locations in much the same way that we're viewing the Cintas location. And so we see some benefits, so I would call them anecdotal. We need to get all the way on SAP before we really start taking advantage of the power of that information.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Andrew Steinerman at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Andrew Steinerman","Mike, you mentioned that you just treat G&K legacy locations like Cintas locations. Want to know about the inventory? I mean, how much of the uniforms today are still the G&K uniforms? And when you convert over and introduce Cintas uniforms, which are presumably better uniforms. G&K legacy customers, how they responded and has there been a price adjustment since they are getting better uniforms?","Mike Hansen","From an inventory conversion standpoint, we are in the midst of that. And those happened at different such times, Andrew. So for example, if we have a customer that's got 10 wears, for example, in legacy G&K inventory, we maybe in a style where as they turn, in other words, as they have turnover and they replace their open positions with new hires and we put them into legacy G&K current garments, there's going to be a point in time at which we run out of those garments, whether it's the style or the size. And that happens at very different intervals depending on the kind of garment that they have. And so it is a customer-by-customer approach.","When they start to run out of -- when we start to run out of G&K legacy garments, we will start to put them into Cintas garments and generally, that can be all at once, because we don't want them to have different looks. But as I said, that is a customer-by-customer decision point based on the style. So, it's really hard to give you a full percentage, because it's happening all over the country. We are not finished with that. We are still working our way through G&K legacy inventory.","When they get on to Cintas inventory, as you know, pricing becomes a customer-by-customer conversation as well. And there may be some where we -- there is no change at all and we put them in something that's, let's say, at a work wear type of a garment. There may be others where we give them an opportunity to upgrade into a Carhartt garment, for example. And in that case, there may be times where we will increase the pricing, or adjust the pricing as its necessary. So it is a customer-by-customer decision on when to convert and then it's also a customer-by-customer decision on what does that pricing and what does that contract look like.","Andrew Steinerman","And do you think the customer recognizes that the Cintas uniform on average is a better uniform than the legacy uniforms they had?","Mike Hansen","I can give you anecdotally, the answer is yes. We need to be doing a pretty good job of showing why they're moving into a Cintas garment, and what are the features and functions of that new garment. It may be that it's softer, it may be that it little bit better, it maybe that is -- that the fabric breath is a little bit better. And generally when we explain those kinds of features to the customer, they get it and they understand. And it doesn't take very long for them to be in those garments to recognize that there's a quality difference.","Operator","We'll now take the next question from Gary Bisbee at Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Gary Bisbee","I guess the first question from me, just the Uniform Rental revenue slowed somewhat, obviously, at a much tougher comp, but anything other than that. I guess you mentioned a little weaker energy, anything other than that you would call out as sequential deceleration in the organic constant currency revenue growth?","Mike Hansen","Yes, I don't think it's anything of real significance. But I would point to the three things I mentioned earlier; a little bit of the absence of that lapping; a little bit of the choppiness in the energy and maybe industrials, generally; and pricing maybe wasn't quite as incrementally positive as we've seen in previous two quarters. I think those things kind of capture what we saw in the quarter. Still a good quarter for us, but I think those things capture.","Gary Bisbee","And then you have been asked for a few years about cross-sell potential, both with G&K and just more broadly against your different businesses. And I realized you don't have the data and haven't provided real granular color. But, can you give us any sense like as your salespeople for the main business go out, how often are they targeting people that are customers through your other businesses? How important is cross-sell in terms of how you are trying to compensate the different types of sales people? Is it really something you focused a lot on to-date or should we think that the data that SAP will provide is really going to be the key to unlocking that more broadly?","Mike Hansen","We do spend a lot of time with that today, Gary. You know our SSRs are looking for opportunities. We have our, we call them market development reps, who are looking at that some of our more complex customers and looking for upsell and penetration opportunities there. And we've become a bit better at cross-sell between Rental and First Aid and Fire. I think we still have some ways to go there to take advantage of all of that opportunity. But we are starting to spend more time than in the past.","So it has been important to us. And I think we've been doing a pretty good job at that over the last two years, including in the last probably 18 months with G&K legacy customers. But having said that, SAP will unlock some additional potential that is going to be something that should prove to be a nice opportunity for us.","Gary Bisbee","And then just one more, the initiative have been next quarter or anything like that, but as we think out of the next few years in sort of a normalized economy. How are you thinking about incremental operating margins these days? What's the potential? They have been obviously terrific the last two years, particularly as the G&K savings have flown through. But what's like a long-term target or opportunity there?","Mike Hansen","We still like -- we talk a lot about incrementals of 20% to 30%. We're getting pretty darn close to the bottom of that with our rental division. But as we continue to get success with penetration opportunities, to get success in some of the verticals that can be even bigger types of customers with a service opportunity that's more efficient, we think there are still opportunities. And that incremental, as we move forward, we think that incremental certainly is in the 20% to 30%. And if we can capitalize on some of those different things that we've talked about, the penetration, the sales into these customers with maybe more efficient service aspects, the capacity efficiencies, we think we can get that incremental into that mid-20 type of a neighborhood. So it's a nice opportunity that looks -- that we look forward to.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Andrew Wittmann at RW Baird. Please go ahead.","Andrew Wittmann","Yes, I was looking at the two year growth rate stack in your Rental segment. It looks like the comps prove out at 12.4 over the last two years, both for the first quarter and the second quarter. But kind of brings me to the question you've talked about in the past, which is your sales force productivity. You mentioned the kind of the headwind for the deceleration in the growth rate. But I was just wondering how the sales force is performing for you? I think it was not that many quarters ago, you said even the G&K people that you kept on were producing at record levels. Can you just give us an update, Mike, about what you're seeing out of them in terms of the ability to add for those new customers?","Mike Hansen","Yes, when we think about total, look, we have one sales team. And so that sales team continues to perform well. And they're doing a nice job of adding customers and selling into existing customers. Their productivity levels are still, this quarter was a little bit higher than last year in this quarter. So, we're still making some really nice improvements. So we are still very pleased with the sales rep productivity.","Andrew Wittmann","And then I guess I wanted to maybe, Paul, if you can just help us a little bit on some of the elements of cost structure. I think typically you've given energy as a percentage of your rental segment revenue. How much of a benefit was that? And just any other details that you can call in the cost structure? I think, labor has been something that people have flagged, maybe that would be something you've addressed. You mentioned health care that is back to normal. But just anything else you can help us understand the moving pieces inside the margins, I think could be helpful?","Paul Adler","Yes, Andy. Energy was a 20 basis points benefits year-over-year, flat sequentially. So, I think that's -- if oil continues the price per barrel in the second half where it is in the first half, it will be little bit of a tailwind for us and the cost structure in the second half. Labor, I would say overall in checks, we talked about, gosh, it was probably a year ago now about certain areas of our workforce, particularly in the production area, we were having some labor inflation and we've made some changes. So we believe that that is behind us, and we won't have to make any further adjustments there. But otherwise, inflation is normal, I would say. It's something that we've been able to deal with. It's certainly tight, but it hasn't prevented us from running the business and serving our customers.","Mike Hansen","Yes. And Andy, when you think about our gross margins, for example, we've seen some really nice year-over-year improvement in this first half of the year. And certainly, the growth levels have been good and that helps. So, we're getting really nice leverage. Our sales people are productive and they're selling good profitable business, and that's been good. And we are -- we've done a nice job of capturing the G&K synergies.","But what we're also seeing a little bit of is, as we've talked about over the last few years, there is a lot of inefficiency in running the facilities when you're going through a lot of conversion of incorporating G&K volumes into Cintas legacy plants and closing those plants and rebarcoding inventory. And there's a lot of work that goes on there. And really what we've seen in the first half of the year is we've captured those G&K synergies just as we wanted them to. And we've seen some real nice efficiency gains, because there are quite as many of those projects going on, those are a little bit more in the past.","And so our -- we've -- the timing for us has been kind of fortunate and good from the standpoint of when we were seeing a little bit of pressure in our production labor, for example, we were also making some synergies and capturing some synergies there too. And we've been able to get more efficient in this first half of the year, and I think that's a little bit of what you're seeing.","Operator","And we'll now take next question from Scott Schneeberger at Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Daniel Hultberg","It's Daniel on for Scott. You discussed efficiencies earlier. Could you provide a little bit more perspective on some type of efficiencies to pursue want to go-forward basis besides the route optimization and a little bit color on automation of processes and use the advanced technology and how that is applied and where you could go there with? Thank you.","Mike Hansen","Sure. We are always looking for them. And so when we think about efficiencies going forward, I've talked a little bit about capacity. How can we continue to get more efficient in terms of using our Wash Alley, some of that is automation, I'm sorry, technology and some of that is a Six Sigma like process improvement there are opportunities there. We still have a lot of route optimization to go, that is both a little bit of technology, but just its customer touching and so we're being cautious in that regard.","We've talked about getting through the SAP conversion and as we are able to then pull off of the legacy Cintas system a bit. That's going to create some efficiency just that because we won't have duplicate systems, but also then using that technology for things like sales rep productivity gains and cross-selling and penetration opportunities, so that we do have a number of those different efficiency opportunities as well as then just typically the Six Sigma processes that we're always working on and how can we get better and as the business changes can we get more efficient in the way we move product and through our plants and provide services. We're looking at all of those different things, but we think we've got some nice opportunities ahead.","Daniel Hultberg","Switching gears a little bit, cotton price has been down in the first half of this fiscal year on a year-over-year basis. Could you please discuss half of that is impacting earnings. I mean I know historically you've smooth that out through amortization, but how is that really impacting your earnings presently? Thank you.","Mike Hansen","Not really any impact in the first half of this year. We are, as you mentioned, it takes a while for that cotton price to ripple through into our P&L, if we have to sell the garments, we have to bring the garments into our distribution center. We then ship them from our distribution centers out to our rental locations, and at that point they start an 18 months amortization process, so it takes a while. And then even when it does get through, we're generally smoothing that out as you said, because we've got, if we see a spike for a few months, you might have 118 fourth of that in one month, you may could have two or 318th fourth of that. It's got to be sustained movement in that before it really starts to hit us and keep in mind cotton isn't a -- it's not one of the more significant pieces of our cost structure.","So if you think about our cost structure, our cost of rentals is you can think of it in three buckets, one is material cost, one is production, part of this running of our laundry facilities and the third is our service costs, so the routing. The cotton piece is then part of that material cost, but that material cost includes also the labor content to serve garments, the freight on the garments, the trim on the garments, etc. And so it really takes some sustained large movement in cotton before it really starts to impact us.","Operator","We'll take the next question from George Tong at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","George Tong","Your revenue outlook has certainly improved from where it was a quarter ago, you discussed the macro factors that are impacting this, but can you elaborate on some internal initiatives where you're seeing traction that improves your revenue expectations for the full year?","Mike Hansen","Well, there they are -- things generally George that, that we've been working on for a while and that is we are looking to continuously focus on some of the verticals that have been really powerful for us. So for example, the healthcare vertical, the education government hospitality, those places where the sales are a little bit more complex, the purchasing decisions might be a little bit more complex and we've made some really good progress in those areas and we still are in the early innings and think there are great opportunities as we move ahead. And so those are areas that are really important to us.","The penetration, I mentioned that we have been working more on the penetration opportunities. I think we can get better and more opportunities ahead for that area as well and that penetration is both better coordination between our businesses, but also taking advantage of our newer products and making sure we're getting things like check works in front of all of the right decision makers. And so it's really continuing to move forward with what we believe to be our unique products that create opportunity in the marketplace.","We are doing the same kinds of things in our First Aid and Safety business where we are looking for those penetration opportunities, product adjacencies are great and continue to look for larger national type customers as well, in both First Aid and our Fire businesses. So we're doing all of those things. We've made some really nice progress. And we think we've got a really nice year ahead of us as we move into the second half.","George Tong","Your gross margins expanded about 110 basis points year-over-year in the quarter, can you discuss how much pricing contributed to this margin expansion and how sustainable pricing increases are at the current pace?","Mike Hansen","Pricing, certainly has an impact, I mentioned that it wasn't quite incrementally positive in this quarter as it had been in the previous two quarters. And so I would say the pricing is somewhat in line with what we've seen over the last couple of years, absent the last couple of quarters. Generally, we've been able to when we can show value and when we can have the right conversations with our customers. Generally, we've been able to get some pricing and I don't see that necessarily changing.","But I would -- as it relates to then the margin opportunity and the margin improvement. It's really more about the growth creates leverage, it creates efficiencies in our plants, when we grow in our rental business in particular where we don't use capacity like our restroom and hygiene products, we effectively get some really nice leverage and get more efficient with the capacity. And in addition to that we've pulled out a little bit of inefficiency in the business, so more of the gross margin improvement relates to the revenue of the business, the leveraging and the efficiencies that we're able to gain.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Kevin McVeigh at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Kevin McVeigh","Just to follow-up on the guidance a little bit, I know last year there was some severe weather in the third quarter that was kind of unexpected. Do you have any kind of just thoughts on or any allowance for that in the Q3 guide obviously with -- obviously which would be incorporated into the full year or how are you thinking about just the weather impact as we work our way through the back half of the year?","Mike Hansen","Last year in the third quarter, we talked a little bit about the weather and the holidays. It's hard to predict the weather. And so we are -- I would say, we're not trying to build in any particular weather pattern. As it relates to the holidays, one of the things we talked about last year was Christmas and New Year's falling on a Tuesday, which was the first time in a number of years and that has an impact. This year, the holidays both fall on a Wednesday, and the last time they fell on a Wednesday, I think it was like our fiscal '14 year. So it's been a bit of a time period since we've had a Wednesday.","And so if you think about our weekly flow of volume you can think of it as a bit of a bell curve Monday -- Mondays and Friday's I would call are our, maybe our lower days and our as you go from Monday to Tuesday that when the volume starts to build because customers are just more, they're more easy to see etc. Wednesday tends to be one of our heavier days, and then you start to come back down as you go through the rest of the week. With -- by the holidays, both being on a Wednesday, this year we are considering that we will have any year-over-year benefit because of the comments we made last year during the holidays. We're kind of thinking that look, we're going to still have that holiday disruption a little bit. I don't think it necessarily will be a drag on growth, but it's certainly, it isn't going to help us with an easier comp.","Kevin McVeigh","And then just the margins again really nice and if I have it right, it looks like kind of the other category at least outpaced our estimates that can be kind of uniform sales which are lower margin. Is there anything else in there that's helping boost the gross margins overall despite the mix?","Mike Hansen","We are continuing to make improvements in the fire business. We really like that business and it has performed very well in the second quarter and in the first half. And as we get bigger and we gain scale and that revenue growth allows us to leverage our infrastructure a bit better. It creates more dense routes and that creates some margin opportunity. We've got a long way to go. But certainly have seen some nice performance in the fire business and certainly the heavy volume in our direct sale business was a bit of a help too.","Operator","We will take our next question from Seth Weber at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Seth Weber","Most of the questions asked and answered, but I wanted to see if we could dig into your -- you've made the pricing comments a few times now, just a little bit less robust than maybe what we saw in the first quarter, is there anything you'd call out, is it a mix issue or the comps just getting harder or is there something going on from a competitive front that you would highlight? Thanks.","Mike Hansen","I think it's a bunch of different things, Seth. I think there is a little bit of mix going on. We've had some good performance in a few quarters in a row now, and if that's kind of outperformance isn't sustainable in the long term, and I don't think it's anything that we are concerned about. But just something a little bit of maybe a notch below where we had seen in the last couple of quarters, made up of a number of different things.","Seth Weber","And then just on working capital has been frankly better than what we would have thought given the growth trajectory. I mean do you think that working capital can continue to be just a little bit better than normal. Normally, I think you expect to see a little bit more usage here. Has there something you'd call out that's really helping that or can we expect that to continue? Thanks.","Mike Hansen","Well, look from a working capital standpoint, we certainly have been in a period of disruption over the last couple of years, as it relates to our accounts receivable converting two systems as it relates to our inventory and shutting down DCs, opening new DCs, converting a lot of volume. And we're starting to get some of those inefficiencies and disruptions behind us. And so for example in accounts receivable, we've seen a nice improvement year-over-year and that's part because we've gotten a little bit of that disruption behind us.","There still is some system conversion to go, but we think we're getting a little bit better and better and more efficient at it. If you think about the sort of cash flow for a second, when you think about our operating cash flow, it was pretty strong this quarter and really for the first six months of the year and our conversion of net income to operating cash flow has been over 100%. I would expect that that's going to continue for the second half of the year. Free cash flow was really strong and I think that's going to be strong for the rest of the year.","And so I think more than anything Seth, it's getting a little bit of this disruption of two system conversions, a new business conversion, a little bit of that stuff behind us. But as we've talked in the past, when we are growing we're generally going to use some working capital, in other words, we're going to see AR continue to increase. We're going to see, generally speaking, inventory and in service inventories grow over time, inventory is a little bit different from a standpoint of we do have opportunities there, where some of those opportunities will create more inventory.","For example, if we believe we can have enough volume to bring new products into our distribution center that may create new inventory. However, as we get more efficient and you get the G&K conversion behind us, that's going to create some forecasting and supply chain opportunities. So there's going to be some ups and downs in that inventory line item, but generally the performance has been good. We've gotten a little bit of that disruption behind us, but we're generally going to be a user of the working capital.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to the speakers. Please go ahead.","Mike Hansen","Well, thanks very much joining us tonight. We will issue our third quarter financial results in March, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. And we wish you all happy holidays."],"5501":["Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) Q3 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call March 22, 2017  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Mike Hansen - VP, Finance and CFO","Paul Adler - VP and Treasurer","Analysts","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital","Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets","Joe Box - KeyBanc","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","Minaz Putnik - Barclays","Adrian Paz - Piper Jaffray","Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird","Jeff Goldstein - Morgan Stanley","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Hansen","Thank you and good evening. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","We are pleased to report that revenue for the third quarter, which ended February 28th was $1.281 billion, an increase of 5.3% over last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of work days was 6.5%. New business wins; penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains strong. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment accelerated to a rate of 7.3%.","Third quarter gross margin improved to 44.2% from 43.1% last year. As Cintas Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer stated in this afternoon's press release, this is our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. This and our industry leading revenue growth are indicative of a healthy company, with significant opportunities ahead. We thank our employees whom we call partners for best in class execution and results.","Gross margin of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment improved to 45%, an increase of 100 basis points, compared to last year's third quarter. The First Aid and Safety segment gross margin improved to 44.8%, a year-over-year increase of 260 basis points, due to the realization of synergies from the acquisition of ZEE Medical in fiscal 2016.","Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter, compared to 27.3% in last year's third quarter. 50 basis points of the increase was the result of a difficult comparison due to favorable workers' comp experience in the prior year's third quarter. In addition, labor and related expenses increased as a percentage of revenue as we continue to prepare for the acquisition of G&K Services.","Operating income for the third quarter of $195 million increased 0.9% from last year's third quarter. Operating income margin was 15.2%, compared to 15.9% in last year's third quarter. Third quarter operating income included $9 million or 0.7% of third quarter revenue of transaction expenses related to the previously announced agreement to acquire G&K.","Excluding this G&K transaction related expense, our operating income margin was 15.9%. We're pleased with our incremental profit margins. Note that our third quarter had one less work day than last year. That's had negative impact of approximately 40 to 50 basis points on this year's operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation and amortization being determined on a monthly basis instead of a work day basis. In addition, as Paul will soon discuss in greater detail, energy had a negative impact on this year's third quarter operating margin of 50 basis points. So, to put it in perspective, excluding G&K transaction expenses, operating margin was same as last year's third quarter, despite about 100 basis points of headwinds from one less work day in energy.","Net income and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the third quarter were $119 million, and $1.08 respectively. This quarter's EPS, included a positive $0.03 impact from a change in the accounting for equity compensation, as required under ASU 2016-09. Remember that this benefit shows up in the way of the lower effective tax rate, offset by higher equity compensation expense and share counts. We also had a $0.06 negative impact from expenses related to the G&K transaction, such as legal and professional expenses associated with the regulatory review. Exclusive of these items, EPS was $1.11.","Yesterday, we closed on the acquisition of G&K. First and most importantly, I want to welcome our new partners from G&K. We look forward to getting to know you better and we remain very excited about this opportunity. As we have discussed, we continue to expect annual synergies in the range of $130 million to $140 million in the full year following the acquisition. We will now begin the process of integrating the two companies together.","As Scott Farmer indicated in today's press release, we have pulled our revenue and EPS guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, because we need to complete the purchase accounting process and confirm our assumption used in estimating non-recurring costs. For example, in an acquisition of this size, we are required to use a third party to value our intangibles. There can be a fairly wide range of outcomes in this type of analysis, and we won't know that outcome until the third party completes its process. Another example is that we need to record all G&K fixed assets and inventory as fair value. Much of this work is performed by a third-party firm. Again, we will not know these values until the process is completed. In the absence of this information, providing a meaningful guidance range for our fourth fiscal quarter is not possible at this time.","Paul will soon provide additional details of the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Paul though, I wanted to add that we are very pleased with our third quarter results. Excluding the impact of the G&K acquisition that will come in our fourth quarter, our third quarter results keep us on pace to attain the annual guidance previously provided, and to achieve a seventh consecutive year of organic growth in the mid to high single digits with double digit growth in EPS.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Adler","Thank you, Mike. First please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains one less work day than fiscal year 2016. As Mike stated, it was this quarter, the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that had one less day in the prior year quarter. One less day will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points, and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. The negative impact on the fiscal 2017 third quarter was about 40 to 50 basis points of revenue growth and about 40 to 50 basis points of operating margin. Our fiscal fourth quarter contained 66 work days, the same number in the prior year fourth quarter.","We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All other consist primarily of fire protection services and our direct sale business. First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.","Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $993 million, an increase of 6.1% compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, acquisitions and work day differences, the organic growth rate was 7.3%, compared to 6.5% last quarter. We continue to see the impact of weakness in the oil, gas and coal industry. However, as we predicted on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, the impact has lessened. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 60 basis points in the third quarter. This compares to about a 75-basis point headwind in the previous quarter.","Our Uniform Rental and Facilities Services segment gross margin was 45.0% for the third quarter, an increase of 100 basis points from 44.0% in last year\u2019s third quarter. Energy related costs were about 20 basis points higher than in last year\u2019s third quarter. In addition, job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment\u2019s current year third quarter operating margin by about 30 basis points. So, on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 50 basis points. Keep in mind that margins were also negatively impacted by one less day of revenue. Therefore, gross margin expansion of 100 basis points was achieved despite about 100 basis points of headwind from one less work day and energy.","Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products, and Training. This segment\u2019s revenue for the third quarter was $124 million, which was 4.4% higher than last year\u2019s third quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 5.5%. Last quarter, we disclosed that we believe that the First Aid segment organic growth rate hit the bottom and the segment was positioned for improving organic growth rates. Acceleration in the organic growth rate from 3.3% in the second quarter to 5.5% this quarter was expected.","Route consolidation and optimization have been completed. We previously disclosed that we added sales reps in our first quarter. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base through penetration with our broad range of products and services. We expect improving organic growth rates through the remainder of this fiscal year. This segment\u2019s gross margin was 44.8% in the third quarter, compared to 42.2% in last year\u2019s third quarter, an increase of 260 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses.","Our year-to-date gross margin dollars are up 51% over two years ago, and up 18% over last year. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage is almost back to pre-ZEE levels and our revenue of course is significantly greater. Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $163 million, an increase of 1.9% compared to last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate was 2.4%. All Other gross margin was 39.1% for the third quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 38.9% for last year's third quarter.","The direct sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are such as Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid. Therefore, the growth rates are generally low and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million-dollar account. Our Fire business however continues to grow at a consistently rapid pace. The fire business organic growth rate was just short of 10%. ","As Mike stated earlier, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter compared to 27.3% in last year's third quarter. 50 basis points of the increase was the result of the difficult comparison due to favorable workers' compensation experience in the prior year third quarter. We're self-insured, which can result in some volatility from time-to-time. In addition, labor and related expenses increased as a percentage of revenue, as we continued to prepare for the acquisition of G&K.","Finally, this year's third quarter includes SAP expenses amounting to about 20 basis points of revenue. Regarding SAP, since last quarter's earnings call more locations have been converted. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. Due to the acquisition of G&K, we are planning and adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary. ","Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter was 34.5%, compared to 33.8% for last year's third quarter. This year's third quarter rate is lower than historical rates due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on stock compensation. Note that last year's third quarter effective tax rate benefited from the closing of a federal tax audit with favorable results.","Our cash balances as of February 28, were $147 million, and we had no marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from investing, or rather cash flow from operating activities in the current year quarter was $182 million, and free cash flow was about $119 million. Uses of cash in the third quarter included CapEx and payments of our regular annual dividend. ","Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about $63 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows. $55 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $5 million in First Aid and Safety and $3 million in All Other. As of February 28, total debt was about $1.1 billion, consisting of $399 million in short term debt and $745 million of long-term debt. Subsequent to quarter end, debt increased about $2.3 billion to fund the acquisition of G&K. Sources of acquisition funds included the following; $100 million of G&K senior notes, $50 million of additional existing Cintas senior notes due in 2022, $1 billion of senior notes due in 2027, $650 million of senior notes due in 2022, a new term loan of $250 million and commercial paper of about $250 million. With this additional debt, we estimate that our leverage has increased to about 3.1 times debt to EBITDA. Our goal is to reduce our leverage to 2 times debt to EBITDA within three years. With $300 million of senior notes maturing in December that we will not refinance; $250 million of term loan and $250 million of commercial paper, we have structured our debt appropriately to achieve the goal.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We're happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Hamzah Mazari","The first question is just on customer attrition. Are you guys baking in any customer attrition post the G&K deal? Obviously, that's closed now. And any thoughts on the Uniform market potentially getting incrementally more competitive, as you work to integrate that deal?","Mike Hansen","Well, Hamzah, I would say that the industry is always very competitive and it will continue to be so. As it relates to the customer attrition or retention, I don't know that I expect much of a difference there, but let me speak a little bit towards revenue; our thoughts on revenue in general. So, when we think about the Cintas business as we move forward, we have no expectations for change.","We continue to expect growth in that mid-to-high single-digits. When we think about the G&K revenue though, you can think about it in terms of there's a new business component, there is the kind of customer penetration, and there's a lost business or attrition component, in the normal course of doing business.","And as we move forward, we're going to continue to have that customer attrition that we've seen in -- that G&K has seen historically, and that we'll likely see continue into the future. There will likely be a little bit of an increase due to disruption of the integration, but generally speaking I would say not a lot of change. The difference though will be the new business component.","So as you can kind of think about new business and the G&K sales team over the course of the last seven months, they have been trying to sell in an environment where selling a five-year contract under kind of an uncertain future is, as you could imagine is quite difficult. So the new business component certainly has been pressured quite a bit over the last seven months. As we move into now the post-closing process, that momentum carries into our post-closing process.","In addition, as we think about their sales people, you can imagine that the difficulty in selling new business and contractual new business in the environment resulted in some attrition. And so as we move forward, we will need to hire new people to replace some of those sales people, but also train all of their sales people as we move forward. So training them on selling our products and services, training them on our systems, using our processes et cetera and there certainly will be a productivity -- a negative productivity impact.","So as we look forward, we will continue to probably see the normal customer attrition that the business has seen, maybe a little bit higher. But we will also see some significant pressures on the new business. And so as we think about that moving forward, our experience has been for years and years that we will see some pressure to the point where we may see revenue come down in the 5% to 10% range over the course of the next year or so.","Hamzah Mazari","That\u2019s extremely helpful. And just a follow up question. Are there any divestitures build into your cost synergy target number of 130 to 140 or is that something you are working through right now?","Mike Hansen","There were no divestitures baked into that assumption.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bissey with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jay Hanna","Hi, this is actually Jay Hanna on for Garry today. I was wondering if you guys could give a little more detailed look at what the pace of those cost synergies will be? And maybe a more detailed timeline for the full integration of G&K within Cintas as well?","Mike Hansen","Well, as you probably have seen, we talked about $130 million to $140 million in annual synergies, fully realized in year four. We have also talked about this being fully accretive or accretive in our second full year. That would be our fiscal '19. As we move forward, we certainly have had a lot of assumptions about those synergies, but I will tell you over the course of the last seven months, one thing that I need to make sure is clear, is we have been operating as two separate companies, and that was a requirement, so that we were not jumping ahead of the regulatory process. And I tell you that because we are just now -- we just closed yesterday. We are just now getting into the confirming of our assumptions, and we need to do that before we can provide more timing, more specific timing on the synergies.","But we do feel like we will be accretive in year two, and in year one we are going to have some onetime expenses that are non-recurring in nature; things like rebranding, asset impairments, severance, lease breakage type thing and we're going to be going to work over the course of the next several months, really confirming what those amounts will be. Once we do that, once we confirm our assumptions for the integration plan, we'll have a better idea of what fiscal '18 will look like and our expectation would be we certainly share that in July.","But having said all of that, we certainly do think that there will be synergies in year one. We\u2019re just not ready to provide any specific numbers.","Jay Hanna","Great. And then excluding the acquisition and following in this quarter, you spoke to it a little bit earlier. But do you think full year \u201917 guidance, would it remain the same or possibly increase following third quarter?","Mike Hansen","I would say that we would likely have either left them the same or possibly narrowed by bringing the bottoms up a little bit. So third quarter, we are very pleased with the third quarter. I think we\u2019ve got some nice momentum and execution going on in the business and we are poised to have a good fourth quarter.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Joe Box","Yes. Hey guys. So I was hoping to dig into the 80 basis points sequential pick-up in organic growth for Uniform. Looks like there was about 15 basis points sequential tailwind from less oil and gas drag. So can you maybe put a little bit more color on the non-oil and gas improvement, really just aside from calling out ancillary products and better customer retention?","Paul Adler","Yes. Joe, it\u2019s Paul. You are right, the 15 basis points is part of the math. I would say in addition to that, we had a very good strong quarter from a new business perspective, especially as it related to garments. And so not only do you benefit from the new business in terms of that additional recurring revenue, that you will receive from the garments going forward over these five-year agreements, but we have new business installed related to garments. You also have some good revenue in terms of peripheral charges, incentive fees and emblem costs. So that definitely helped as well.","But really outside of that Joe, there was nothing extraordinary. It\u2019s just the continuation of execution that the game plan, quality service, retention remained strong, a very strong organic revenue growth quarter, something we\u2019re proud of, given all the excitement of the pending acquisition. But just continuation of what we\u2019ve done the last six years of growing top-line and that 5% to 7% organically, and again proud of those growth rates compared to the competition, which has been posting much, much smaller organic growth rates.","Joe Box","I appreciate it Paul. And then just a question on guidance. I guess, I\u2019m just curious, why not provide a non-cash goal post here. So purchase accounting is really kind of the biggest unknown. And then I guess just from an expectation standpoint, should we think about maybe an inter-quarter 8-K with guidance, once you guys get the third-party valuations done or should we be thinking about this as being maybe a more 4Q call type item?","Mike Hansen","As a relates to why not provide some sort of guidance, whether it\u2019s cash or something else. Joe, we\u2019re going to get busy right away and we\u2019re going to get busy on the integration items. And as we do that, the businesses blur. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to go through the next two and slightly over two months and have two distinct businesses still by the end. They are going to get blurred, because we\u2019re bringing them together and we\u2019re going to be doing quite a bit of integration work. And it just -- it becomes very, very difficult to keep those pieces separate. And because of that we're not -- I don\u2019t like the idea of trying to dissect that. If we do come up with the purchase accounting results during the quarter and we feel that we're in a position to provide them, you may see us do that, but our first goal is to really understand it and get it right and then provide.","Joe Box","Understood, and I do appreciate that the lines will get blurred here, but I assume that the fiscal year 4Q revenue guidance for standalone Cintas probably is still generally intact. Is that fair?","Mike Hansen","As we've talked about, yes. We think that's fair and it probably -- we would probably have narrowed it by bringing the bottom up. We feel good about the fourth quarter and the third quarter I think is very indicative of the second half of the year that we expected to have. So yes, the answer to your question is yes. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi, would you be willing to talk how long you think the amortization period will be. And in year one if it wasn't for the amortization, would the merger be accretive?","Mike Hansen","The amortization period will be 10 years most likely. We expect that to be in the range of about 3% to 4% of the deal value. And would it be accretive without that? I think yes. I think the answer Andrew is yes, that you can kind a think about that as a what, $66 million to $88 million annual number. It will be fairly a large non-cash number. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Minaz Putnik with Barclays. ","Minaz Putnik ","Thank you, good evening gentlemen, and firstly congratulations on getting the deal done. So I appreciate -- I think why you I guess retracted the guidance to '17. And just to your point on calling out that amortization as a non-cash number in Q4. Going forward when you guys do initiate '18 guidance, will you be -- if not giving sort of the cash EPS number at least call out all these non-cash charges pretty clearly for us to calculate that?","Mike Hansen","That will be our goal yes. We will likely provide GAAP guidance but we will -- our goal will be to give you some of these large items to give you a sense of what the performance detail will look like.","Minaz Putnik","Okay that would be very helpful. And then just on the organic performance, another strong quarter obviously. Just like how you describe the three components for G&K in terms of new business penetration and retention, or attrition, can you just help lay that out in terms of where the growth is coming for Cintas standalone right now?","Paul Adler","Definitely new businesses continue to be the strongest driver of the growth. As we've said it, new business in terms of new customers; we're still selling that 60\/40 split of 60% of the new business wins, our new programmers versus the 40% taking market share. So that's been very consistent through this year and really in the near past as well. New business also includes the penetration of our existing customers. That is certainly part of our vision and that continues at a very good pace. A lot of the hygiene products that we've talked about in the past, our Sanis signature series, new offering in the last couple of years, that's really helped us with penetration. Retention has been roughly 95%. So still strong, no significant change in that. So, really no significant movement in any of the key component of organic growth drivers.","Minaz Putnik","And that 40% share gain you talked about, does that typically end up being from the smaller regional players or do they -- or is it a broad mix with the national players as well?","Mike Hansen","No, it's a broad mix of wins versus small, medium, large competitors.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Adrian Paz","Hi this is Adrian Paz calling for George. I just have question on the G&K transaction. Can you provide -- on the synergies, can you provide the breakdown of what's going to be revenue synergies versus what's going to be synergies?","Mike Hansen","We have not included any revenue synergies in that $130 million to $140 million. Those are cost synergies and they come in four primary buckets and in no particular order. We think of them in terms of material cost. So, a sourcing benefit. We think of them in terms of production improvements. So, the more efficient use of capacity. We think of them in terms of the route density allowing us to use less fuel because of more dense routes. And then we think about it in terms of overhead and the reduction of duplicate overhead. Did not include any revenue synergies in that amount. And one of the reasons we didn\u2019t is because we need to get through the integration work. We need to get them on to our systems. We need to optimize the routes and we need to have our new G&K partners really trained and comfortable in selling our product line, and that takes a little bit of time.","Adrian Paz","And on the -- so with the SAP implementation, do you expect your cost savings from the SAP platform to be bigger within the G&K transaction or are your estimates since then?","Mike Hansen","We do expect the benefit to be bigger. We are -- first of all the additional revenue certainly provides better leverage over the system. But certainly, operating on one system in total certainly will create additional benefits for us. And the better visibility into all of our new customers will certainly help us in terms of identifying cross seller penetration opportunities, identifying where certain industries we are -- customers in certain industries where we believe we have got a good product mix to provide value, but certain customers in that industry don\u2019t have some of those. We think there is a lot of opportunity, and certainly by adding the G&K volume, that certainly helps it out.","Paul Adler","And to add to that. More benefits and then really not a lot of significant additional costs; that's the beauty of the acquisition. Just another positive is that we get to leverage G&K over that existing $140 million spend. So, we'll have some have additional licensing costs, nominal amount but the capital investment is not going to increase.","Adrian Paz","And if I could just ask one more, on the non-programming market or the no-programmer market, how do you think about that market and how much growth you believe is available there and do those declines have the margin profile as your existing clients?","Mike Hansen","We think there is a lot of runway there. As Paul said about two thirds of our new business comes from that no-programmer segment, and it's been that way for a long time. The -- we have talked a little bit about what that no-programmer may look like. It could be outdoor trades, people that are now renting our Carhartt products. It could be culinary people now renting our Chef Works product, it could be healthcare workers now renting our scrub rental programs. There are lots of opportunities there and there will continue to be.","The margin profile is I would say is not significantly different from any other type of account, but certainly we know that with all of our customers the more penetration that we can take -- that we can have, the product and services that we can add to them, the more valuable those stocks become. Usually the lesser the probability that they leave us because we are more fully penetrated. So once we sell any account, penetration becomes really important afterwards.","Operator","And our next question comes from Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Justin Hauke","I just wanted to talk a little bit more about maybe how does think about revenue synergies, and I guess the reason why I ask is obviously you guys have been very successful in broadening out services that you offered. You are acquiring 170,000 customers here. Is there a difference, and maybe you can give us the number of average services you sell to your current customers and how that compared to G&K; so we can kind of think about what the incremental opportunity to sell into that base is? And I guess related to that also would be, is there any material difference in the 95% retention rate that you have and the retention rate that maybe you are acquiring here?","Mike Hansen","I would -- so first of all, I don\u2019t know the penetration of G&K. Again, we haven\u2019t had visibility and insight until really starting today, and we\u2019ll start to learn that more and more. So it\u2019s hard for me to try to estimate what any revenue penetration might be.","We have told -- we have talked a lot about, if you think about our Uniform Rental customers for example, the highest penetrated item is our mats, entrance mats. And I would say about 60% of our Uniform Rental customers have entrance mats. That doesn\u2019t mean they have as many as we believe that they should we have, but it means they have at least some presence in the entrance mat.","In addition to that, all of our other products are less than 20% penetrated. So we have a lot of runway on our own and I would suspect that G&K\u2019s profile is from a Uniform Rental and match, is probably not a lot different than ours, although that is purely a guess. And I would say that the broader line for us likely in the hygiene and the chemical cleaning First Aid and Safety Fire Protection, those become nice opportunities. I don\u2019t have any kind of information as far as qualifying that, because we just don\u2019t know enough about those customers.","And an example would be, I want to see, or we would want to see the profile of the G&K customers. And that\u2019s when we start to analyze or look for the opportunities in terms of what are the products and services we can provide to that. So we need some time to be able to do that. As it relates to your second question of retention, again don\u2019t have specifics on that, but I would say that they are probably not two different from ours. Although, I would suggest that because our growth rate is so much higher than the industry in general, that our retention is likely a little bit better.","Justin Hauke","Okay, great. No, I understand it\u2019s still early. So that\u2019s fair, and we\u2019ll look forward to learning more about it, as you learn more about it. I guess just two more mechanical questions into modeling purposes. First, are you planning on reporting all of G&K in the rental segment or should we think that some of it goes in the other business? And how much of it would go there? And then second, the SAP cost that you previously outlined, the 40 million to 45 million for 2018, how should we think about that number, now that you\u2019re bringing in G&K? Is that still the right number or does it have to be larger than that?","Mike Hansen","So your first question is, yes. I would say almost all of that revenue and operating income would fall into the rental segment. As it relates to the second question, we will give some thoughts on SAP, when we provide our guidance in July. But I would suggest that it\u2019s going to be lower than 40 to 45 for -- probably because, we\u2019ve seen that we\u2019ve been a little bit more efficient this year than we expected. And the additional -- any additional costs related to an integration of G&K will come in the way of length and integration or implementation process. So I wouldn't expect that it drives up our costs in fiscal '18. I would just -- I think we talked a little bit about it drives the implementation process into fiscal '19. So we'll see a little bit of -- a little bit more expense in '19 than we initially expected, because of the duration with G&K. But again, the process has been going well and we've been spending less than we expected, and I would expect that results in lower numbers for '18. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Jeff Goldstein","Hey this is actually Jeff Goldstein on for Toni. I wanted to piggyback a little bit on an earlier question. One of your primary competitors called out industry weakness in the most recently completed quarter. Can you just comment on what you're seeing in the marketplace, why you think you continue to have more; and if you've seen any type of irrational behavior among competitors, maybe in anticipation of your merger with G&K.","Mike Hansen","I would say from a -- what are we seeing differently. From an economic standpoint, I would say that our third quarter from an economy standpoint didn't really feel any different than our first two quarters of this fiscal year, other than there has been a lot of sentiment about maybe the new administration being a little bit more pro-business et cetera. But I would say I'm not sure that's translated much into what we've seen on the street.","Having said that it's been a constructive environment, and with the exception of the oil and gas vertical, which we've in fact seen get a little bit better, we haven't seen much of a change one way or the other. And because of that, as you've seen, we've continued to execute well and continued at maybe organic growth levels of the first half of the year and in fact even a little bit better. And I think that is simply as Paul mentioned good execution, good new business productivity. Our sales people are doing a great job. ","As it relates to your second question of are we seeing any irrational behavior, I would just say that it's always very competitive. Once we get into the to talk more of our G&K partners, we may find that it's -- it was a probably a little bit more aggressive on G&K customers. But we certainly know when an acquisition is announced the competition gets very aggressive around the acquired customers. And I would say that's kind part for the course.","Jeff Goldstein","Okay. And then can you just provide a little more color on the sequential decline in First Aid margins and what the big driver of that beyond just the one fewer workday? And then just longer term, do you think the First Aid segment could ever close the margin gap with rental or do you see kind of structural differences in those businesses of that.","Paul Adler","Yes Jeff, First Aid we were pleased with the results overall. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we felt like last quarter that we had hit a bottom, and that became reality and then we expect those organic growth rates to continue to climb. That business should grow in the high single-digits. That's what it grew coming into ZEE, and that's what we expect going forward.","In terms of the margins though, we're -- the gross margins continue to improve. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, how much the dollars are up over couple of years, 50 some odd percent, 18% year-over-year increase in gross margin dollars. The incremental gross margins have been very strong. Last year they were in the 30% range. This year last two quarters they were 100%. So gross margins are moving along as we expected, as we continue to realize those synergies. SG&A we do have a little bit of heavier investment in the selling part of that component. As we mentioned in our first quarter we invested in the sales force to be able to grow that acquired big block of ZEE business. And they've only been there what, a quarter or two at most. They'll continue to become more productive; they'll grow that top line, we'll get that leverage and so we are optimistic about not only the top line growth but the margin improvement going forward.","Mike Hansen","I think Jeff, as Paul mentioned, we've made an investment in our sales team there. ZEE did not have a sales team and so we've -- as we came out of the system conversion, it was time to start really selling in a little bit more -- well, in higher volumes and that's what we did. We invested to be able to do that. Do we have the confidence that those margins can get into those mid to high teens? We certainly do and if you go back to our fiscal '15 results, we were at about 13.8 for the year of fiscal '15, but the last three quarters all exceeded 14%. And with the addition of the ZEE business, that certainly is going to benefit us long term and we really like the business. It's doing exactly what we would expect that it should do, and those margins will continue to improve.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Hansen I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Mike Hansen","Well thank you for joining us tonight. We'll issue our fourth quarter earnings in mid-July and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Good night.","Operator","And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"5438":["Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call July 15, 2014  5:00 PM ET","Executives","","Bill Gale - SVP, Finance and CFO","Mike Hansen - VP and Treasurer","","Analysts","","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse ","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer ","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","Nate Brochmann - William Blair","Justin Hauke - Robert W.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Bill Gale ","Thank you. Thank you for joining us this evening. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter results, which include the effects of the April 30th closing of the partnership transaction with Shred-it International. In addition, we will provide our initial guidance for fiscal 2015. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. ","We are pleased to report fourth quarter revenue of $1.157 billion. Keep in mind that this total does not include any shredding revenue for the month of May due to the closing of the shredding transaction on April 30th. Excluding document shredding revenue, our fourth quarter revenue grew 4.7% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Last year\u2019s fourth quarter had one more work day than this year. When adjusting for the impact of the difference in workdays, revenue, excluding document shredding grew 6.3% and it grew organically by 6.1%. As Scott Farmer stated in our press release, after a difficult winter, we were pleased to see our growth rate improve in both our rental and First Aid, Safety and Fire segments.","Excluding document shredding related amounts, our fourth quarter operating income was $165.4 million, which was 15% of revenue. This represents an 80 basis point improvement over last year\u2019s fourth quarter operating margin for the same businesses. Our rental operating margin improved 140 basis points over last year\u2019s fourth quarter operating margin despite having one less work day. We continue to see improvements in both plant and route efficiency as we add more volume. ","Fourth quarter net income was $127.2 million and earnings per diluted share were $1.03. However, excluding the effects of the shredding transaction, our net income was $94.3 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.76. These fourth quarter results bring to a close a very successful fiscal year for Cintas.","Our Rental segment and First Aid, Safety and Fire segment in particular had record years. Our Rental segment achieved record annual revenue of $3.2 billion and it topped $500 million in operating income for the first time, finishing at $507 million. The rental operating income of $507 million was 15.7% of revenue, which was an 80 basis point improvement over last year\u2019s operating margin of 14.9%. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire segment revenue for the year was a record annual level of $514 million topping $500 million for the first time. Operating income was also a record $49 million, thanks to our employees who we call partners for a great year.","I will now turn the call over to Mike for more details of the fourth quarter and the effects of the shredding transaction and then I will provide a few comments on our fiscal 2015 guidance.","Mike Hansen","Thanks Bill and good evening. I will start with a reminder on workdays. There were 65 workdays in this year\u2019s fourth quarter versus 66 workdays in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal \u201815, we will have 65 workdays in each quarter for a total of 260 workdays for the fiscal year. These workday figures for fiscal \u201815 are the exact same as in fiscal \u201914. So we will have no workday differences or adjustments for the next four quarters.","We have four reportable operating segments; Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of our income statement.","The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products\u2019 operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $825 million, which is up 5.1% compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter. However taking into account the one less workday this year, revenue grew 6.7% over last year. Organic growth was also 6.7%.","The Canadian dollar, relative to the U.S. dollar remained weaker than last year during our fourth quarter and it negatively impacted our rental growth rate by 0.6 percentage points. Adjusting for this impact, rental organic growth would have been 7.3%.","As it has done for the last several years, new business continues to be the main driver of revenue growth. Net [add\/stops] [ph] were negative for the quarter which is typical for our fourth quarter due to seasonal changes, but were slightly better than last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Within the rental segment revenue and based on fourth quarter performance, Uniform Rental accounted for 52% of the total; dust control, which is mainly entrance mats accounted for 19%; hygiene and other services which is restroom supply, cleaning services and chemical services was 16%; shop towel revenue was 5%, and linen and other, which is mainly non-person specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats was 8%.","Our Rental segment gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter, an increase from 42.1% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, which had one additional workday than this year\u2019s fourth quarter. Our incremental gross margin has remained strong as we have been able to increase revenue without adding additional processing capacity. Our route efficiency continues to improve as well since adding route capacity in mid fiscal \u201813.","Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the fourth quarter was $118.5 million, which was 5% lower than last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Last year\u2019s fourth quarter included large national account roll outs which did not repeat this year. The fourth quarter revenue of $118.5 million was higher than this year\u2019s third quarter revenue of $107.7 million. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 30% for the quarter, down from last year\u2019s fourth quarter gross margin of 30.8%, mainly due to the lower volumes this year.","Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the fourth quarter was $137.2 million. When adjusting for the workday differential, this revenue level represents an increase of 11.1% over last year\u2019s fourth quarter revenue. Organic growth was 10.2%.","We have seen good adoption by our customers of our new First Aid and Safety Products and Services and our First Aid national account sales have been strong. This segment\u2019s gross margin was 44.6% in the fourth quarter, compared to 43.5% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Energy-related costs were consistent with last year. The gross margin improvement was due in part to improved mix, for example, higher training sales on the First Aid side and good leveraging of our infrastructure.","Let\u2019s move to a discussion of Document Management Services. This segment has included document destruction or shredding and document storage and imaging services. We provided the document storage and imaging services revenue and operating income for the fourth quarter in today\u2019s press release.","We were pleased with the business\u2019 performance. Fourth quarter revenue was $23.1 million and growth over the last year exceeded 20%. Organic growth was 15.4%. Our European business has had good momentum during the fiscal year and it continued during our fourth quarter.","Our Document Shredding revenue for the fourth quarter was $53.7 million. This amount reflects only March and April revenue. Beginning with the months of May and into the future, we will no longer include Shredding revenue in our reported revenue since we are accounting for the partnership investment under the equity method of accounting.","The closing of the Shred-it transaction resulted in the recognition of a gain due to the fair value of our share of the Shred-it partnership being greater than the book value of our investment in the business. Keep in mind that the book value of our investment was recorded throughout our balance sheet, including accounts receivable, property and equipment, goodwill, service contracts, and other assets offset by certain liabilities contributed to the partnership.","The net effect of this transaction in the fourth quarter was $32.9 million in net income and $0.27 to EPS. The investment in Shred-it partnership is recorded within the balance sheet line item entitled investments. Going forward, we will record our 42% share of the partnership income within our SG&A line on the income statement.","We continue to be excited about the partnership with Shred-it. As we discussed on our call in March, we believe the combination of our Document Shredding business with Shred-it will create opportunities for synergies that will benefit our customers, our shredding employees and our shareholders. Having said that, in order to realize the synergies, the partnership will incur costs to transition IT platforms, to convert the operations and the trucks to the Shred-it name, to consolidate certain administrative functions et cetera. We expect the bulk of these transition expenses to be incurred in our fiscal \u201915 year. As a result, we do not expect the partnership to contribute any income to Cintas in fiscal 2015. Instead, we expect to begin realizing synergies and income in our fiscal year 2016.","Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 28.2% as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter, which was up from last year\u2019s fourth quarter figure of 27.8%, due to a number of different items including workers comp claims experience, legal and professional expenses, and slight higher bad debt expense. The fourth quarter SG&A of 28.2% was lower than the third quarter percentage of 29.1%. Payroll taxes reset our third quarter and we generally see a reduction from the third to the fourth quarter as a percent of revenue. Medical expenses were also slightly lower than the third quarter.","Our effective tax rate was 40.5% for the quarter compared to 37.4% last year. This year\u2019s fourth quarter rate included a number of discrete items related to the Shred-it transaction. Excluding the effects of the transaction, the fourth quarter effective rate was roughly 37.1%. We expect the fiscal \u201915 effective rate to be 37.3%.","Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were about $513 million at May 31, an increase of $159 million from the $354 million at February 28, mainly due to strong operating cash flow. Although we received $180 million of cash on April 30, at the closing of the Shred-it transaction, we used $206 million during the quarter for the share buyback program.","As I mentioned a few minutes ago, our investment in the shredding business was reflected in the balance sheet in a number of different items. When comparing our May 31st balance sheet to the February 28th balance sheet, you will notice decreases to accounts receivable, property and equipment, goodwill, service contracts and other assets due to the contribution of the shredding assets to the partnership.","These balances have been replaced within an investment balance of roughly $340 million that is combined with other investments in the balance sheet line items entitled investments. Long-term debt remained at $1.3 billion, representing roughly 1.6 times fiscal 2014 EBITDA. Net cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter was about $222 million, a $38 million improvement over last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","And finally CapEx for the fourth quarter was about $32 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $23 million in rental, less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales, $4 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire protection, and $4 million in document management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million. This range is higher than the last few years because we expect to embark on the SAP implementation for our rental business and expect to add some rental processing capacity during the year.","I will now turn the call back to Bill for comments on our fiscal 2015 guidance.","Bill Gale","Thanks Mike. Our fiscal 2015 guidance is for revenue to be in the range of $4.425 billion to $4.525 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range $3.06 to $3.15. Let me provide some color to this guidance. We have explained that we will not include document shredding revenue in our fiscal 2015 reported revenue. However due to accounting requirements we still need to include the document shredding revenue in our fiscal 2014 reported revenue. This means reported growth rate will look artificially low. In our press release though we provided the table that shows fiscal 2014 base revenue without document shredding of $4.276 billion. This fiscal 2014 base revenue provides a better comparison to fiscal 2015 guidance.","As Scott Farmer indicated in our press release today, while the U.S. employment picture has improved this calendar year, it is a relatively narrow improvement. One third quarter of the new jobs this year are in areas not typically strong in uniform rental, foodservice, professional services, temporary workers in education. We set our revenue guidance with this employment narrowness and the largely inconsistent U.S. economic performance in mind. ","From an EPS perspective as we reported today, our EPS for fiscal 2014 was $3.05. This figure included the net impact of the Shred-it transaction of $0.26. It also included a $0.04 benefit net of tax from the operating income of the document shredding business in fiscal 2014. As Mike just mentioned though, we do not expect any benefit in fiscal 2015 from the shredding partnership. When excluding these two amounts, our fiscal 2014 EPS would have been $2.75 and we believe this provides a better comparison to our fiscal 2015 expected results.","Our fiscal 2015 EPS guidance does include and $0.11 benefit from the sale of stock of an equity method investment that occurred a few weeks ago on June 30th. It also includes the $0.09 benefit from the share buybacks that occurred between April and June of this year. The EPS guidance does not assume any additional share buybacks for the remainder of fiscal year \u201915.","As I just indicated a few minutes ago, we remain unconvinced that the U.S. economy will become consistent. In addition, as a result of the contribution of our document shredding business to the Shred-it partnership, we have less revenue that contributes to covering our SG&A structure. We will continue to control cost as we have always done but we also need to grow back into some of our SG&A infrastructure. We set our EPS guidance with those items in mind.","That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now be glad to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we will take our first question from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Could you tell us some more about the rental capacity that you are adding for the year? I think you\u2019d talked before about adding some more processing capacity?","Bill Gale","Yes, Sara, and we did speak about this in a few other calls, and it was initially our expectation that we would have added some of this capacity in fiscal \u201914, but we did not. What we are adding basically is processing capacity in the form of new facilities, especially because of rapid growth that we\u2019ve had in certain markets and some of those plants will be relatively expensive. For example, we will be adding a new plant in the New York Metro area and as anybody who lives in New York knows, land up there and construction cost et cetera are relatively expensive. So we have several plants that we will be adding. Some of them will come online maybe toward the latter part of this year. Others will not come online until next year, but they will -- a lot of that capital will be spent in fiscal \u201915.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then if you could give an update on add\/stops and pricing trends?","Mike Hansen","As I had mentioned a little earlier, add\/stops were negative for the quarter, which is not unusual given changes being made due to the change in weather, a little bit better than last year, but I would say not -- we\u2019re not seeing much impact from the employment which seems to be a good headline but as Bill mentioned, it\u2019s fairly narrow. So net add\/stops, little bit better than last year, negative for the quarter. Pricing seems to be a little bit better. I would say it\u2019s driven within our new business but generally we saw a little bit better pricing environment this quarter than maybe a year ago.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","And then just last question, you mentioned the SAP implementation for the rental business. Could you tell us some more about that and whether or not there are any concerns that that might be disruptive during the year? Thank you.","Bill Gale","Well, I don\u2019t think it will be disruptive. Let me answer that, because we will do it in phases and the first phase is what they call a blueprint or it\u2019s a design phase and it really doesn\u2019t have any impact on our operations at all but we have to dedicate a lot of resources and capital toward the implementation of this project and the design to determine what we need to do with the software and how they implement it. So we will get through that and then assuming that that is successful, which we expect it to be, then we will start into some more of the detailed programming requirements, data development et cetera that will be needed to run the system. This will be a multi-year implementation. We would not start actually impacting our locations or our customers for some time and hopefully we will be well prepared to handle that. I can assure you we are very careful on these type of projects.","But I think it\u2019s important for all of our investors and analysts to understand that any Company that does embark upon these type of projects, it is a large expenditure, it takes a lot of time and effort to put it in and yet when it is successful and we certainly think at this point it will be, it will provide benefits into the future. And they don\u2019t come right away but they certainly provide opportunities to more efficiently run our business, handle our customers\u2019 needs et cetera. ","Mike Hansen","And the good news is we have just recently, as you have heard us say on prior calls, we have recently finished the roll-out of our First Aid, Safety and Fire business onto the SAP platform.","Operator","","And we will take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Credit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse","Could you give us an update on customer penetration specifically? How many of your customers subscribe to more than one service or several services and has that number changed over the last few quarters? How should we think about where you are in that process?","Bill Gale","Hamzah, I would say we have made some minimal progress in that arena, certainly not to the extent we expect to have. One of the problems that we have with doing that is the multiple types of computer systems we are on. So that\u2019s one of the reasons why we are willing to invest in the SAP system across the entire portfolio of businesses. So, yes we certainly do continue to see some additional penetration but nothing to the extent that we ultimately expect it to be.","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse","","And then maybe just your commentary around growing into your SG&A infrastructure. Do you need cyclical growth for that or how do we think about your comments there and SG&A trends going forward?","Bill Gale","Well, I think what we need is revenue growth that we certainly expect to have in order to replace roughly $300 million of revenue that we no longer have from the shredding business, now that it\u2019s part of the joint venture. So you can think about it in this way. You\u2019ve got certain fixed costs that really don\u2019t go away when you basically don\u2019t have that revenue to cover that anymore. For example, we still have an audit fee that costs just as much now as it did when we had document shredding. We still have certain G&A functions that you just can\u2019t cut out parts of because you no longer have the shredding business. So this goes through the entire organization and while we certainly have reduced staff in certain areas where there is the ability to have a variable level of expenditures associated with revenue, there\u2019s a lot of areas where that just won\u2019t take place.","So, our expectation is that during the course of the next year, we will essentially grow into that SG&A level and then once we reach fiscal \u201816, not only will we have covered that, the reduction in the shredding revenue, but we expect to start seeing some contribution on the bottom-line from the Shred-it joint venture.","Operator","","And we will take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets","","I think it\u2019s been a while since you guys have actually added some plant capacity. So can you maybe just kind of walk us through the process of how that works? Do you typically operate two separate plants or do you wait for a lease to expire and then you consolidate the two?","Bill Gale","Well, what we\u2019re talking about, Joe is primarily the building of an additional plant in markets where we already have plants. So we are not replacing a plant. We\u2019re actually adding a plant. The last time I think we opened a new rental plant was back in fiscal 2008 and then of course we have the great recession and therefore we actually closed a few of our facilities, especially those that had been acquired through an acquisition. So the prior, and by the way we generally own our plants Joe. It\u2019s not a leased facility. We lease our branches or some of our First Aid and Safety operations, but our rental plant because of the extent of the infrastructure within that plant for water treatment, sortations, et cetera, we generally own those facilities. But the idea is, is that we grow so much in a market that we are forced to build another plant to handle the additional volume, and that\u2019s the case here, that we basically have exhausted our ability to squeeze much more out of the existing plants we have and therefore we have to add another one. ","","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Understood, I get that you guys are already in the market and you\u2019ve run out of capacity there and you have to build a new one. I guess ultimately what I\u2019m trying to understand is how we should think about the margin headwinds from adding an additional plant?","","Bill Gale","It depends on, it\u2019s so variable depending upon the cost of what that plant will take and then how many other plants are in that market and as you move volume around you know, generally you\u2019ll start the new plant with a said amount of volume, certainly not your capacity but you\u2019ll also have released some of the capacity constraints in some of the other plants. So Dan, I can\u2019t really answer your question because it\u2019s going to be different if it\u2019s in a New York area versus a Cincinnati, Ohio area.","","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s fine and I can certainly circle up to you guys offline on some other questions but one other quick follow up. I know you guys don\u2019t provide guidance by segment, but can you maybe give us a feel for how we should be thinking about rental margins in FY\u201915? Clearly a strong finish to the year. And are you assuming a lot more leverage to the plant in the first half then maybe when some of these plants start to come online we could be thinking about a little bit less leverage? Any cadence would be helpful.","","Bill Gale","I would say our expectations are that margins, barring any significant cost change which we don\u2019t anticipate should be as good as they were this year but I think you make a good point. They\u2019ll probably be a bit stronger in the first half of the year than the second half of the year depending on how this additional capacity comes online. But when you look at it in total for the year, our expectation is we\u2019ll be good as if not slightly better than this year.","","Operator","And we\u2019ll hear next with George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Going back to add\/stops, can you give some color on how add\/stops are trending so far in the first fiscal quarter and whether directionally we\u2019re seeing continued improvement?","","Bill Gale","You know George, we\u2019re so early that I would say we haven\u2019t seen much of a change from the fourth quarter.","","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","And touching on your comment earlier of the need to grow back into SG&A infrastructure, have you made all the necessary variable cost reductions you need or do you see opportunity for additional cost cuts in fiscal \u201915?","","Bill Gale","I\u2019d say that there was -- some of it has lapsed into \u201915 because you just continue -- the transaction took place on April 30th. So there\u2019ll be a little bit of cost reduction as we move into early \u201915 but it won\u2019t be substantial.","","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","And then lastly, could you share some commentary on how do you expect Shred-it to contribute to Cintas beyond fiscal 2015, reflecting any synergies to growth in margins you\u2019re expecting from the JV?","","Bill Gale","Well, we certainly expect synergies. We\u2019re not prepared at this time to quantify them. I think there\u2019s a lot of work being done on the part of the two organizations that have come together. They certainly are optimistic of being able to achieve more than what the two companies were doing separately, when you add them together. So I think as we get closer to \u201916, FY\u201916, we\u2019ll have clarity and we\u2019ll certainly be able to provide that when we give guidance for FY\u201916 a year from now.","","Operator","We\u2019ll hear next from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer ","I\u2019m curious, with SAP, you mentioned its multiyear and obviously a big step up in CapEx. I know you\u2019re probably not in a position to give guidance beyond fiscal \u201915. But directionally do you think that might come back in \u201916 or you think this is going to be a multiyear elevation?","","Bill Gale","You talking about the CapEx expenditures?","","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer ","Yes.","","Bill Gale","I would say the first two years are going to be relatively capital intensive and then they will -- it should fall dramatically after that.","","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer ","And any OpEx impact from the implementation?","","Bill Gale","I hope not too much. If our experience is similar to what we saw with First Aid, we see a little tick up during the conversion of the operations and shortly thereafter in some of the SG&A or in the G&A expenditures and then over time the benefits start being realized. So it\u2019s, again it\u2019s too early to really tell. We don\u2019t know to the extent of how it\u2019s really going to impact the day-to-day operation itself and until we get through the design phase and start some of the pilot implementations, it\u2019s hard for us to be able to predict that. All we know is that right now, at least going into this, we feel very positive that this is a good use of capital in that the long term return will be very beneficial to the Company.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer ","And kind of on a similar vein, now with this partnership with Shred-it closed, what are the M&A thoughts with regard to the core Cintas business? And just kind of a derivative of that, do you see any further involvement? I\u2019m assuming this is no but any further involvement with infusions to the JV -- is that something that\u2019s been discussed?","Bill Gale","We would not expect any infusions into the JV. So we believe that they will be able to generate sufficient cash on their own in order to continue to grow and do what they need to do. With regards to Cintas core business, yes, we are very interested in making acquisitions as long as they achieve the financial and strategic objectives that we\u2019ve set out. And that includes acquisitions within the Uniform business, the Facility Services business, First Aid, Fire and potentially some new businesses. So we\u2019ve got an active corporate development group. We\u2019ve got a lot of cash and a great amount of debt capacity and we are certainly going to look for opportunities to grow the Company.","Operator","And we\u2019ll hear next from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","I wanted to ask about rental gross margin and the effect of merchandised amortization in end of quarter, and are we at a point where we have to infuse more garments into service that might weigh on gross margins going forward?","Bill Gale","During the quarter Andrew we did not see any change in the trend. So I would say we\u2019ve not hit a point where we need to infuse garments. We still have stock rooms that have a lot of capacity, that have a lot of uniforms in them. And we\u2019re using them very efficiently. So I would say I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a significant change in the injection rate.","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","Good. And would you expect rental gross margins to be up for fiscal 2015?","Bill Gale","Well, as I mentioned earlier to a question Andrew, we would expect there to be a slight improvement in that. It will most likely happen early in the year and then is dependent on the time of when the additional capacity comes online. It may come down a bit. But overall for the year they should be up versus fiscal \u201914.","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","Right. Bill, I was actually little confused by the comment before. So when you said margins should be up for fiscal 2015, you meant total operating margins or did you mean just rental?","Bill Gale","I\u2019m talking specifically about rental because that was what the question was posed.","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","Sure. So, could you just comment, in the guidance what\u2019s implied in total operating margin for fiscal \u201915?","Bill Gale","We don\u2019t break it down like that Andrew but if you look at the growth rates in the top line, they\u2019re a little less that the growth rates in EPS and therefore I would tell you that there has got to be a little bit of margin expansion.","","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair","Just wanted to talk a little bit, you guys have done a really outstanding job of going after and getting some new business from non-programmers as well as kind of penetration with some additional services throughout the organization. Could you talk about like the ability to kind of keep that churning? Obviously I know the market is pretty big out there in terms of the potential, but in terms of whether than has been over the last couple of years, some like low hanging fruit and opportunities or whether it\u2019s something that you\u2019ve done differently, I know that we\u2019ve injected a few more sales people here give or take a year ago to get after that. Could you just talk about in terms of the pipeline and the opportunity in terms of how to keep that going?","Bill Gale","I think it\u2019s very similar. Our expectation, it will continue that way for the next several years. We still have a very large sales force. Our mix of new business continues to be more heavily weighted toward the no-programmer side versus the programmer side. Therefore, we continue to see the market self-expanding. We are looking always for new products to help attract other types of no-programmers and we\u2019ve had several of those things roll out in the last year or two. So right now I would say I feel very good about our ability to continue to sell a lot of new business with the bulk of it coming from no-programmers.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair","And Bill do you think, and I know this might be hard to answer, so I kind of get it. But do you think that anything has changed fundamentally in terms of the percentage of non-programmers that are converting over to a uniform program or is it that\u2019s there is just more overall businesses out there to go after? So maybe not necessarily the percentage of programmers versus not has changed or do think that the -- that the share of the pie is increasing in terms of the conversion?","Bill Gale","I think the share of the pie is increasing because there are more products that we have that enable us to go after certain types of businesses that maybe in the past we never would have gone after.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair","Okay. So, I think that\u2019s an interesting point in terms of why it might be a little bit better that it was in the past in terms of the conversion rate?","Bill Gale","The conversion rate, though I just want to make sure, the conversion rate has not changed that dramatically since I\u2019ve been with the Company other than during the recession. So I just think that we\u2019ve gotten a lot bigger. We\u2019re $3.2 billion now in the rental division and yet I still think we feel like there is just tremendous opportunities out there, because in the past maybe there was a limited number of businesses that we would have gone after, but now given our wide spectrum of different types of garments, different type of facility services products and services, there is more types of businesses we can go for.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair","Okay, that makes sense. And then specifically within the Fire and Safety opportunity, are you guys pretty much everywhere you want to be at this point. And is further growth at this point just continue to build off of the locations you have and scaling that in terms of continue to increase profitability there or are there more locations and more sales people to go in terms of relative investment?","Bill Gale","There are -- certainly within the Fire business, we are not nearly to the point of being everywhere we want to be. So there are many, many, cities that we believe we still need a presence in and we would like to make acquisitions and to get into city. Short of that we certainly feel that if it\u2019s important enough we will start Greenfield in those cities. Therefore, I would say the geographic expansion is primarily within the fire business. As far as the uniform rental and the first aid businesses, we\u2019re by and large in most of the largest metropolitan areas, but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not acquisition opportunity. So tuck-ins are opportunities and relatively profitable and therefore we will continue to go after those too.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird.","Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird","Yes. So what\u2019s the rationale for running the joint venture income through SG&A as opposed to just adding a separate equity income contribution? I\u2019m just, I\u2019m trying to understand, are we going to be able to have any visibility into performance of the joint venture from here?","Bill Gale","Justin for the first year as we\u2019ve said, we don\u2019t expect any contribution from it anyway. So it\u2019s going to be so small that it\u2019s really not worth reporting out into a separate line. Starting in fiscal \u201916, if we feel like the contribution is something that is significant, we\u2019ll pull it out and put it into a separate line.","Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird","Okay. But for right now we should just basically think it as like a negative offset to your SG&A?","Bill Gale","Well, you should think of it for fiscal \u201815 as kind of a zero.","Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird","Right. But going forward in \u201816 in terms of thinking about it?","Bill Gale","Yes.","Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Just one clarification. On the guidance, I know you said that \u201815 includes the $0.09 contribution from share repurchases in the fourth quarter and so far in the first. And then there was $0.11 benefit as well, that you mentioned. What was that?","Bill Gale","That was a gain on the sale of an equity investment that we had, that was closed on June 30th.","Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird","So if you net those two out \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that with your comments that you\u2019re expecting margins to be up next year. Because if you kind of take both of those out, it looks like the EPS and the revenue growth are about the same?","Bill Gale","It depends what base you start at Justin, but, again Mike tried to -- we tried to share with you that you got to back out of fiscal \u201814 some things like the shredding contribution et cetera and all the transaction costs. But then you take that and you take out the -- go to the top end of the guidance knock out the two items, the share buyback impact and the investment gain, I think you\u2019ll find that there will be a larger increase in EPS than there would be in the top end of the revenue guidance.","Justin Hauke - Robert W. Baird","I guess my last one is just on healthcare, I know that was a concern for \u201914 and it sounded like your healthcare expense on a dollar basis is actually lower year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Is there any additional healthcare impact that we should be assuming in \u201815 or is that the -- the impact\u2019s mostly gone through at this point and it\u2019s more or less a flat assumption going forward?","Bill Gale","First off, our medical expenses were about the same year-over-year. So I don\u2019t know where you might have gotten less then. Regarding our expectations, who knows? I really \u2013 I\u2019m having difficulty predicting it, because the rules keep changing. There is just too many uncertainties. So right now, I think we\u2019re surprised that it did not go up more dramatically in \u201814 versus the prior year. Next year I would say if I were a betting man, I would think it would go a up a little bit, but I hope it won\u2019t be more than a little bit, because again until we get clarification from the healthcare providers and from the government, it\u2019s hard to predict. ","Operator","And we will take our next question from Dan Dolev with Jefferies.","Dan Dolev - Jefferies","When I look at your guidance, your top-line guidance this year, excluding shredding, so 3.5% to 5.8%, I would say it\u2019s like 1 point lighter than similar guidance that was given in July of last year through this year. Where is the slower growth coming from? Is it shredding or is there someone else, something else?","Bill Gale","Well, shredding was certainly a big contributor. Even though it wasn\u2019t -- it was like less than 10% of the revenue, it still was a rapid grower. But to answer the guidance, Mike and I anticipated that there would be some questions on this. And I think it\u2019s important for everyone to understand that first off, there is a lot of inconsistency in this job growth and the economy and therefore we are trying to take that into consideration. We don\u2019t foresee there being any big catalyst to really getting things going. And I would tell you that we tend to be conservative, especially at the beginning of a fiscal year. I would rather make sure that the expectations -- that we can meet expectations. So we tend to be on the conservative side. Therefore I hope that as we go through the year, if we see growth better than what we are currently giving you in the guidance, we will certainly adjust the guidance upward as we go through the year.","Dan Dolev -Jefferies","Thanks. And is that conservatism also reflected in your commentary about not expecting any EPS benefit from shredding this year. ","Bill Gale","That one is a real tough one to say. They\u2019ve got a lot of things they have to go through and changing an IP platform and rebranding the trucks and everything else. I think it\u2019s too early for me to say that that\u2019s conservative or not. I would say right now, I think our expectation of no contribution is maybe realistic.","","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question with Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus","I just have a few housekeeping type questions in general. The SG&A from the shredding that you said to expect as zero. That\u2019s from a total year perspective though, right? I mean if there is going to be a lot of investments to go after the synergies, I would expect that at least for part of the year that you would have some -- to the extent that there is some losses, that might be reflected and you guys have called that out for us, is that the right way to think of it?","Bill Gale","Yes, I think if we saw -- so for example, we may see because of the timing of some of these transitional expenses, we may see some ups and downs from quarter-to-quarter and we would likely point those out to you, yes.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus","","Okay. And then the SAP system, I know you guys went through -- in the fiscal year \u201810 timeframe there was a roll out of SAP and you guys had built up some inventory in advance of that. What was that for and how many other parts of the business are there left to roll this system out to?","Bill Gale","We started the SAP -- the first thing we did were our financial systems and that was done several years ago. That was back in probably the \u201909 timeframe. Very successful and that was phase one. Phase two was we took our global supply chain, essentially the manufacturing, the ordering of garments and other products, we put that on SAP. That\u2019s where the buildup of inventory was, in anticipation of converting the vet system and we didn\u2019t want any disruption. Then we embarked upon the SAP implementation at our First Aid and Safety and Document Shredding operations, and that just concluded just at the end of this past fiscal year. So now we are moving forward into the rental business and then yet to be done would be the Direct Sale business and the Fire business.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, great. And then in terms of the document storage, that\u2019s such a tiny part of that business. Does it make sense to think about that as an ongoing business for you guys?","Bill Gale","At this time, yes. As we mentioned in March, we are evaluating strategic options for that business. We had a very nice fourth quarter. We are very encouraged by the growth rate. But we will continue to evaluate alternatives and if and when we should decide to something differently other than to continue to operate them, we will certainly let everyone know. ","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus","Are they concentrated in particular geographies for?","Bill Gale","Primarily, they are located in the Midwest and in the UK and in the Benelux countries.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And then internally, how are you evaluating -- how are you valuing the Shred-it transaction? In other words what you contributed in there? And the reason I\u2019m asking that question is it seems like the transaction cost of $26.3 million is like -- at least versus the investment, it seems like you paid a fee of 7.2%. That sounds like an IPO fee unless you valued the transaction much higher than net investment?","Bill Gale","Mike you want to take him through a little details there?","Mike Hansen","Sure. Shlomo, we did not use any investment banking firm to do this. Instead the transaction costs that you refer to, a large portion of it relates to the stock compensation expense because we early vested stock options and restricted shares for those employees who move from Cintas to the joint venture. We also had some costs, certainly some legal and professional costs related to public accounting, firms looking at the tax side of things and looking at the valuation for our accounting purposes. We had some IT contracts that had to be canceled that were specifically related to the Document Shredding business. So those are the kind of costs that were incurred as part of the shredding transaction itself.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Sean Kim with RBC Capital Markets.","Sean Kim - RBC Capital Markets","I guess sort of looking back at fiscal \u201914, I think your results for the full year came in probably at the high-end or ahead of what your initial guidance would have suggested a year ago. So I guess, what do you think drove the better performance? Because it seems like if we think about what your comments about add\/stop trends during the year, it doesn\u2019t seem like much has changed. So I was just wondering what do you think drove the better performances here?","Bill Gale","I think Sean, it was really an excellent execution on the part of our Rental business and our First Aid and Safety business. They were able to squeeze more capacity out of existing operations. They did very well on new business. As Mike mentioned, we saw a little bit of an uptick in the pricing environment, which helped. And I think that was really the reason that we surpassed our initial feel of guidance on both the revenue side and EPS side.","Sean Kim - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And in terms of share repurchases, assuming no major M&A activity, do you think it\u2019s safe for us to assume a similar level of stock repurchases that you done over the past couple of years?","Bill Gale","Sean, that's hard to say because I would tell you that we want to make acquisitions, but obviously if we don\u2019t then we would anticipate that we would use that cash to purchase our own stock. I would not model it that way. I would hope that we would be able to make some acquisitions, but again you know and I know that you just can\u2019t predict when that will happen.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Gale and Mr. Hansen; I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Bill Gale","I would just like to thank everyone for joining us this evening. It was a very complicated quarter, but you all are pretty smart people because you all pretty much figured it out. And therefore we appreciate your support. We will anticipate providing our first quarter update sometime in the latter part of September. So thank you again. Have a good rest of the summer.","Operator","And this does conclude today\u2019s Cintas quarterly earnings results conference call. We thank you again for your participation."],"5499":["Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call  September 27, 2016  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Mike Hansen - VP of Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Paul Adler - VP and Treasurer","Analysts","Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley","Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets ","Greg Bardi - Barclays Capital ","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Research Equities ","Dan Dolev - Nomura","Nate Brochmann - William Blair","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","John Healy - Northcoast Research ","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Hansen","Thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1.294 billion, an increase of 7.9% from the prior year first quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 5.7%.","First quarter operating income was $207 million, an increase of 11.6% over last year's first quarter. Operating margin improved to 16% of revenue, compared to an operating margin of 15.5% in the prior fiscal year. The Uniform Rental and Facilities Services segment led the way with an operating margin of 18.5%, a 90 basis point expansion from the prior year. ","Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $138 million compared to $106 million in the prior year, an increase of 30%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue was 10.7% compared to 8.9% of revenue in last fiscal year's first quarter.","Earnings per diluted share or EPS, from continuing operations for the first quarter were $1.26 versus to $0.93 for the first quarter of last year. First quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 35.5% over the prior year.","During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 entitled Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting was adopted. Under ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits and deficiencies associated with employee share-based payments are no longer recognized as additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet but instead recognized directly to income tax expense or benefit in the income statement in the reporting period in which they occur. Other financial statement items impacted include share-based compensation expense and the computation of fully diluted shares outstanding. The first quarter of fiscal 2017 net benefit to EPS from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 was $0.14, consisting of a reduction of income tax expense of $0.16 partially offset by a $0.01 negative impact from additional employee share-based compensation expense reducing operating income and a $0.01 negative impact from an increase in the number of diluted shares outstanding. ","Also note that our first quarter of fiscal 2017 operating income includes almost $3 million of transaction expenses related to our recently announced agreement to acquire G&K Services. The impact of adopting ASU 2016-09 and the G&K transaction expenses make year-over-year comparison somewhat challenging. So I want to provide some figures to help you better understand first quarter performance. Excluding these impacts, operating margin for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was 16.3%, an increase of 80 basis points from the prior year period. Net income from continuing operations was $125 million and EPS was $1.14. The increase in net income and EPS over prior year periods excluding the impacts of ASU 2016-09 and G&K transaction costs was 17.7% and 22.6% respectively. ","As our CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's earnings release, this strong start to the fiscal year positions us for another year of record breaking results. As a result of our first quarter results, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be in the range of $5.160 billion to $5.225 billion and fiscal 2017 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.55 to $4.63. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy, future share buybacks, or any future financial impact from our acquisition of G&K, including any transaction expenses. It does include the impact of one less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. It also assumes a negative impact in the remaining quarters of fiscal 2017 from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 such that we expect to end fiscal 2017 with an estimated net benefit to EPS of $0.07. Again, please note that the net benefit to EPS from ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of $0.14 is expected to be only a $0.07 benefit for the full year as the impacts are negative in the second, third and fourth quarters of the year. ","Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to provide a brief update on our acquisition of G&K. We remain excited about this opportunity and a long-term value creation for Cintas, its employee partners and its shareholders. When we announced the transaction in August, we indicated that the merger was subject to approval by G&K shareholders, regulatory clearances in both the US and Canada and other customary closing conditions. We and G&K have begun the process for satisfying these closing conditions. And at this stage, we don't expect the closing timeline to change materially from what we previously disclosed. In order to avoid creating speculation, we will not be providing any additional commentary on the process. We will however update the market as appropriate. ","I will now turn the call over to Paul for additional information. ","Paul Adler","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains one less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has one less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016.","As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 5.7% in the first quarter. This solid growth rate continuous to be driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and strong customer retention.","Total company gross margin was 45.1% for the first quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 43.7% last year. ","We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.","Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment included the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.","Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1 billion, an increase of 6.5% compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth was 5.9%. ","We continued to see the impact of headcount reductions in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 110 basis points in the first quarter.","Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.9% for the first quarter, an increase of 120 basis points from 44.7% in last year's first quarter. ","Energy related costs were 30 basis points lower than in last year's first quarter. However, job losses previously mentioned in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year first quarter operating margin by about 55 basis points.","So, on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 25 basis points because the benefit of lower prices at the pump for our fleet of trucks was more than offset by the negative impact to operating margin resulting from headcount reductions in our oil, gas and coal customers.","Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products, and Training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $125 million, which was 25% higher than last year's first quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for this segment was 5.4%.","Our legacy First Aid business continuous to grow strongly. The reduction in overall segment organic growth is due to the continued assimilation of the ZEE Medical business. Route consolidation and optimization continued in the first quarter as expected. These efforts had a short-term impact to growth rates as we onboard and goodwill the acquired customers and train the SSRs on our products, services and processes. Our integration gain plan remains on track and we expect to end this fiscal year with stronger growth rates. This segment's gross margin was 45.8% in the first quarter compared to 42.3% in the prior year period, an increase of 350 basis points. Also, we are pleased to note that gross margin improved on a sequential basis by 290 basis points. Our margins benefiting from improved sourcing and from the leveraging of existing warehouses which are among the synergies we anticipate at realizing. ","Finally, now that we are nearing completion of consolidation and route optimization, we've added sales reps. ZEE Medical have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relied only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps will help us grow the acquired customer base by penetrating with our broad range of products and services. ","Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $170 million, an increase of 5.4% compared to last year's first quarter. Organic growth was 5.2%. All Other gross margin was 45.1% for the first quarter, an increase of 150 basis points from 38.6% in last year's first quarter. ","Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.9% as a percentage of first quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's first quarter of 28.2%. Of the 70 basis point increase in SG&A year-over-year about 10 basis points is due to additional employee share based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of ASU 2016-09. Another 10 basis points consist of SAP cost related to the piloted operations. In addition, Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 20 basis points higher in this year's first quarter. Finally, SG&A was impacted by the investment in First Aid sales reps previously mentioned. ","On June 1st, $250 million of debt, with a coupon of 2.85%, matured. We refinanced this debt in the form of commercial paper. By staying short in commercial paper, we were able to reduce interest expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 by about $2 million, and avoid a headwind that would result from financing with long-term debt.","Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter was 28.4% compared to 37.2% for last year's first quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate year-over-year is attributable to adoption of ASU 2016-09. However, as Mike stated earlier, we estimate a negative impact to EPS in the remaining quarters of fiscal 2017 from this accounting standard. We expect the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 to be about 34.7%. ","Our cash and marketable securities were $163 million as of August 31st, a decrease of $46 million from the balances of May 31st. Cash flow from operating activities increased 10% from the prior year period and when excluding last year's positive impact from document management transactions, it increased 13%. Uses of cash in the quarter included CapEx and repayment of debt. ","Capital expenditures for the first quarter was $78 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows, $67 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $8 million in First Aid and Safety, and $3 million in All Other.","We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation.","Regarding SAP, we continue with our pilot process which is progressed as expected. We believe that we will begin depreciating the project around December. Our fiscal year 2017 will include about a half a year of depreciation. It will also include about half a year of system maintenance costs. The conversion of our hundreds of operations to SAP has begun and will extend through fiscal 2018.","Training costs, which are expensed when incurred as opposed to amortize over time, will exist in both fiscal 2017 and 2018. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely off-line.","We are pleased with conversion and based upon our experience to date, we are updating our SAP impact to guidance. We now estimate that the investment in SAP will result in about $25 million to $30 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $40 million to $45 million of expense in fiscal 2018. The estimated fiscal 2017 expenses are included in our 2017 guidance.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Before opening it up for questions I'd like to reiterate Mike's earlier statements about the G&K acquisition process. In order to avoid speculation, we will not provide any additional commentary on that process. We will update the market however as appropriate. ","And with that we are happy to answer your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","We will hear first from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. ","Toni Kaplan ","Hi, good afternoon. It looks like you are raising your guidance by about $0.19 at the midpoint, and you mentioned the $0.07 benefit from the tax change. Could you just give a little bit of color on the main drivers behind the rest of the increase? Is it more margin driven? I saw uniform margins were extremely strong this quarter, so just wanted to get a little color on that -- the remainder of the increase in guidance?","Mike Hansen ","Sure. So there are a couple pieces. First of all as you indicated the ASU 2016-09 is about $0.07. That is again not simply a tax change but a guidance -- FASB guidance change that affects stock comp, shares and taxes. So about $0.07 is from there. Our share count is a little bit lower than we anticipated and Paul maybe you can give the share count that we are going to model. ","Paul Adler","Yes. We are modeling a 108 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. ","Mike Hansen ","And so keeping in mind that you will have to take into account participating securities when you calculate EPS but that's a little bit lower than we expected. So that has some impact. There is a little bit of an impact when we think about SAP. And then there is certainly margins got off to a good start and then we are very pleased with that first quarter performance. So those are a little bit of different pieces. ","Toni Kaplan ","Okay, fantastic. And then I know you mentioned you don't want to talk about the G&K process, so if you don't want to answer this that's fine, but just wanted to ask in terms of -- assuming the deal were to close, how high would you expect sort of retention of G&K's workforce in light of the integration? Do you have specific retention targets for the workforce and\/or for their revenue? If that's a little too close to the process, I understand.","Mike Hansen ","Well, we certainly have some thoughts on synergies that we gave when we announced the transaction. This is a fairly large merger for us and we talked about a couple of the benefits being that in certain markets we need capacity. And G&K has some capacity that we certainly can take advantage of that may allow us to defer some building of plants. We also look forward to the -- when we incorporate their route structure into ours, we expect improved route density. So improvements in terms of the fuel usage and certainly less time driving from customer to customer. In order to those things, we need a lot of people from G&K. And so while I don't have any specific numbers to shares, we won't be able to get into that level of detail until we close the transaction. We certainly anticipate that many of those employees of G&K will come over to become Cintas partners. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. ","Jay Hanna","Hi, this is Jay Hanna on the line for Gary today. Regarding gross margins, they seemed to expand pretty dramatically across all the segments, particularly within first aid? Could you just explain what some of the main contributors were to this expansion?","Paul Adler ","Yes. I mean at first stage Jay as we noted in the script, we are excited to finally see some of the synergies that we banked on. They come from many different areas. For example, one is insourcing. Our ability to source the various products is much better with our scale than with ZEE. We expected to be able to have better ability to purchase and we are seeing those benefits in cost of goods which translate into that gross margin. We also are seeing benefits from distribution. They had five distribution centers. We've closed almost all of them. And so we are leveraging our fixed cost structure, our distribution supply chain for that. And other example was we mentioned warehousing in the script which is the location, physical operation that we run the routes of. As we had talked about previously with our scale even though this is a sizeable acquisition for the First Aid segment, it was largely a tuck in and by tucking this business in to those existing locations we were starting to realize those synergies. And that's really what's pushing those margins forward as I said we expected. ","Jay Hanna","Great. And then lastly, G&K released a proxy couple of weeks ago which included some of their internal forecasts which included sales growth at 6% plus, and EBITDA growth in the low double-digits. Would you be willing to comment on these? Are they similar to your expectations going forward?","Mike Hansen ","We don't have any comments on those. Those were G&K numbers and we'll let their proxies speak for itself. ","Operator","And we will go to Manav Patnaik with Barclays. ","Greg Bardi","This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I just want to talk a little bit more about the part of the guidance change that isn't the tax change, the SAP and specifically what's driving there. And also kind of curious, if the fact that you're waiting on this G&K deal impacts how you're thinking about hiring for Cintas standalone and if there is any impact there in guidance?","Mike Hansen ","So let me make sure I understand the question. What was your first question or your first part of the question was more color on the SAP?","Greg Bardi","No. The question is on the part of the guidance change that isn't related to SAP or the tax. ","Mike Hansen ","Okay. Yes, when we think about the guidance that we provided it excludes any impact from G&K. And that would be any benefits, any synergies, any transaction costs et cetera. So the guidance that we are providing is based on Cintas performance. ","Greg Bardi","Okay. I guess my question was more along lines of does that -- has it impacted how you think about hiring I guess new sales force or what have you because you know or you are thinking that G&K will come online. ","Mike Hansen ","Well, I'd say Greg that we certainly have thoughts about how the integration will occur once the transaction closes but we need to close the transaction first. ","Greg Bardi","Okay. Fair enough. And then I was hoping for a little more color on the lower growth in First Aid. What are the moving pieces there? Are you exiting less profitable parts of the medical or any color to help us with what's going on there? ","Paul Adler","Yes, Greg. I mean I don't think there is anything much else to add. I mean this is in the scheme of things for that segment. Again, it is a significant chunk of the segment that added one third of the volume. And just think about the math with getting to that 5% organic growth rate two thirds of that business the legacy business it's growing strongly. But the other, the acquired business I mean the focus has been on integration and goodwill and training those SSRs. You have to get the stability in the customer base, establish that foundation that takes time to build those relationships before you can make the emphasis on growth. And so there hasn't been much growth in that acquired business which is as expected but as we mentioned previously we do intend to grow it. And we are implementing, not implementing but we've hired some sales reps, getting them trained because we are at the end of -- near the end of the consolidation, the integration and the optimization process so that these sales reps then would be able to hit the ground running and start penetrating with the other products and services that we have in First Aid that ZEE did not previously have. ","Mike Hansen ","Yes, Greg. This is a bit of unique opportunity for us in that I think Paul mentioned in his opening remarks that their drives or SSRs are the -- they were the sellers of that organization. And while we are going through the system integration, it doesn't make a lot of sense to bring on sales people to try to sell product on a different system and then retrain them on our system. And so this is a logical progression and a logical investment for this particular acquisition. ","Operator","Thank you. We will go to new one to Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. ","Hamzah Mazari","Good afternoon. Thank you. Just had a question around adding dedicated sales reps that you highlighted on ZEE Medical. Should we expect other businesses aside from uniform to have direct sales reps too as those businesses either gain critical mass or is this sort of more differentiated or how should we think about that going forward? ","Mike Hansen ","Sure. This is -- you should think about this first aid investment in sales people as a unique example. We are in our other businesses and even in the first aid business; we are generally investing in the business every single quarter. So in other words we are adding routes for growth, we are adding sales people. We are investing in all of our businesses and it happens at generally fairly steady pace. This is a unique example where we are now that we are on the system platform; it makes all kind of sense to add the investment. And we'll start -- our expectation is that we will start to see productivity as we throughout the year. ","Hamzah Mazari","Great. And just a follow up if you could just update us pro forma on your capital structure post G&K and how to think about capital allocation post that deal closing. Thank you. ","Mike Hansen ","Yes. Sure. So we are -- our expectation is to pay for that transaction in cash. So in other words we will be borrowing with part short term, part long term borrowings. Our goal is to -- that was certainly get us to leverage levels that are not typical for us. And our goal over the next two to three years is to bring that leverage level back in line with where we've historically been and that is generally at about 2x EBITDA. ","Operator","And we will now go to Dan Dolev from Nomura Securities. ","Dan Dolev","Hey, guys. Hey thanks for taking my questions. If I go back to last year the same time you also raised your revenue guidance quite significantly. I think by about 220 basis points. What should we read into the no increase to the revenue guidance? Thanks. ","Mike Hansen ","Last year's first quarter revenue guidance was increased quite a bit because of the ZEE acquisition. We closed that deal on August 1st of last year. And that was the primary reason for the change. ","Dan Dolev","Got it. So there is nothing to be read into that this year.","Mike Hansen ","I think our raising of the low end of the guidance today is a bit of reflection that we feel better today than we did 60 days ago about the revenue performance. Generally it is in line with where we expected to be but maybe slightly better. So I don't think there is anything to read into but I would say this Dan we -- let maybe talk a little bit about the economy and thinking in terms of -- it's been -- it remains a challenging environment and I'd -- I think I called it stable without momentum in July and I would say the same thing today. And if you look at the last three quarters of GDP in US, the average is slightly under 1%. The three quarters preceding our first quarter last year that average was 2.3%. And so we've certainly seen a bit more of a challenging environment. But having said that, we are operating a high level we believe and that organic growth of 5.7% in total is a reflection that even in a bit of more challenging environment today than a year ago, we are still growing at pretty good levels. ","Dan Dolev","Understood. And how do you feel about this growth rate throughout the rest of the year? ","Mike Hansen ","Well, I think our guidance would suggest that we feel pretty good about it. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nate Brochmann","Hi. Good evening, gentlemen. So just follow up on that little bit Mike if we kind of think about like about add stop metric I would assume that's still somewhat neutral if we exclude the oil and gas folks in terms of that end market. And one if you could comment on that and two when you think about the oil and gas sector are you starting to see the incremental negative decline kind of plateau a little bit so as we think about over the next 12 months that should be a little bit more of stable impact rather than a drag?","Mike Hansen ","Yes. Our hope is that we've seen the bottom. I know we've kind of hope that would have been the case for last several quarters but I would suggest that top line impact -- negative impact is somewhere in the 80 basis points to 100 basis points for the fiscal year. That's a little higher than we talked about in July but a little bit better than our first quarter experience. That said, we also talked a little bit about the prices at the pump getting a little bit higher as the years go on. And I would suggest that based on our first quarter experience it might not be as high as we thought it to be originally. So let me talk two things. First of all, yes, the revenue we expect that impact will lessen as we go through the year. From a net standpoint when you think about prices at the pump plus the negative impact of the revenue, I'd suggest that it's about the same as we thought it to be in July. One last point if I go back to Dan's question about revenue for the rest of the year. One thing to keep in mind is in the first quarter we now have lapped that ZEE acquisition. And so now our future growth -- our future revenue growth for the rest of the year will not have the revenue, the acquisition benefit going forward from that ZEE deal. ","Paul Adler","And Nate, answer your question specifically about add stop, so you are correct that in that metric outside of the FRC related to the energy customers there is nothing really noteworthy, the metric is slightly positive but it typically is positive. This time of the year we have some seasonal impacts with schools and other summer type business is coming on in June. It is less positive than a year ago however. ","Nate Brochmann","Okay. That's helpful, I appreciate that. And then in terms of the pricing environment, I mean obviously I know it's always competitive out there and a little bit more competitive on renewals rather than new wins, but anything at all in terms of any changes that you have seen, particularly maybe after or since you've announced the acquisition?","Paul Adler","No. Nate, as you said it's always very competitive, no, nothing remarkable in the environment that indicates any change one way or the other. ","Nate Brochmann","Okay. And then just finally, just one technical question on the ASUs, and not to get too deep into accounting knowledge here, but why, just out of curiosity, why do you get such the big positive benefit in this quarter and then it turns negative the remaining quarters? And then when we look at next year should the comps be about equal? What kind of -- obviously I know the underlying number of employees and how well the bonus pulls do and whatever, I'm sure that would have an impact. But how should we think about that dynamic and why that change?","Mike Hansen ","Yes. I think that's a good question, Nate. We will generally see a bigger impact in our first quarter because our restricted shares that we have generally vest in the first quarter, our stock, we have more stock option exercises just for whatever reasons it is the end of our -- it is getting end of the year our fiscal year and into our new fiscal year. So we have more stock option exercises. In this quarter, we also had a nice increase in our stock price. So when that the volatility is created by stock price movement, option exercises, vesting of restricted shares and we generally have more of that in the first quarter, as we move through the rest of the year we generally don't see as many of those exercises and vestings but we still carry the additional stock comp expense and we still carry the additional shares created by this new guidance. ","Nate Brochmann","So essentially then, the expense outweighs the tax benefit in the upcoming quarters, versus the huge tax benefit in the first quarter? Is that essentially the way to think about it?","Mike Hansen ","It is. That is our expectation. Now as I said, there are -- we can't control the stock pricing, we can't control when options are exercised necessarily and so there can still be volatility but you are correct in the assumptions that you just stated.","Nate Brochmann","Okay. And just one less cleanup thing just to ask and I think it was something that you had mentioned before. But now with the new rule that is going into place in terms of the overtime and where the thresholds are, I assume that you have kind of thought about that at this point and are pretty comfortable that the impact from that will be fairly minimal, if anything?","Mike Hansen ","We have thought about that. And yes we don't see a significant impact to us. ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","George Tong","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you discuss any new findings from your due diligence of G&K that either confirm or change your expectations for total synergies that you previously guided to $130 million to $140 million? And any incremental color on how this will split between revenue and cost synergies?","Mike Hansen ","George, we don't have any new commentary to add on that process at all. ","George Tong","Okay. And then related to your comment on adding to ZEE Medical sales force, can you elaborate on how much you are adding to the sales force and how much of a lift to revenue performance these additions will drive? ","Mike Hansen ","George, we don't like to get into specifics about sales expenses or counts. But we can tell you that our expectations are incorporated into our guidance.","George Tong","Okay, got it. And then lastly, can you discuss how you expect your route efficiency on a standalone Cintas basis to evolve over the next four quarters? ","Mike Hansen ","On Cintas standalone basis I would say I think I mentioned a little bit ago that we are constantly investing in the business. And one of those investments is to add routes to allow for continued growth in all of our businesses. And we will continue to do that. And when we add those routes, it creates more density and so that means we are having less windshield time and so there are certainly some incremental benefits every time we add new routes. We also expect that the productivity of our drivers or SSRs will improve over time as we add those routes and have more time to spend with our customers. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Sara Gubins with Bank of America.","Sara Gubins","Yes, hi, thank you. You lowered the cost hit from SAP this year, but you mentioned that the pilot had been going as expected, so I'm wondering, is it that you expect lower cost related to SAP specifically or are you finding cost savings elsewhere to help offset that what you were originally expecting?","Mike Hansen ","Yes. I think I heard you properly so if I am missing the question please let me know. But to answer your question, we are finding that we are just simply spending less on the integration so far than are initially expected. It doesn't really have to do with offset; it is more about the specific SAP integration. ","Sara Gubins","Okay, great. And then hopefully you can hear me. Could you comment on expected wage cost and any trends you might be seeing there? ","Mike Hansen ","We are seeing in certain specific markets there are more pressures than in others. We operate in many, many markets around the US and Canada. And I'd say that we are not seeing specific themes nationally. But there are certainly are some markets here and there that are more -- that are tighter than others. We deal with those all the time, that's not something that is particularly new. And it's our job to execute and to get the right people at the right places and time. ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to John Healy with Northcoast Research. ","John Healy","Thank you. Mike, I wanted to ask you a question, just from a top line perspective. I think it's pretty impressive as you continue to put up this kind of organic growth this late into what could arguably be described as late into an economic cycle. Is there anything, when you look at the business that maybe we don't get by just looking at the organic growth rate? Do you see a segment of the marketplace, whether it's healthcare or hospitality or some sort of end market that is just doing something that's exceptional as well as just from a regional performance when you look at the company today? I believe the West Coast had always been a tougher region for all the uniform companies, but is there anything that's driving this growth rate that would surprise us or not be obvious to us?","Mike Hansen ","I think it's the things that we talked about in the past, John. And the exciting thing to us is it is not necessarily vertical driven, it is really about the innovative products and services that we've been able to create over the last several number of years. And it's about the great execution by our partners. We believe that we can add value to any business in the US and Canada with our products and services. And we are going about doing that and that is kind of vertical agnostic. We believe every kind of business is a potential customer. And we are targeting them as such. So we want to continue to look for new opportunities to sell our for example our signature series hygiene products. We want to look for new innovative solutions and ways to sell our Carhartt products for our scrub rental programs, for our chemical cleaning solutions. We've got a lot of innovative products and services that we created and they can really add value to lots of different kinds of businesses. And so I think it's that. It's the execution by our partners and it's a great product line. ","John Healy","Got you, and I want ask on the acquisition of G&K. You talked about the $130 million to $140 million in synergies, is that kind of a big picture number? And would you expect the synergies to be less than that post purchase accounting?","Mike Hansen ","Well, I'd say that when we announced in August we talked about the $130 million to $140 million in annual synergies. That is looking at their cost structure primarily. And there certainly are things that will let say subtract from that like the interest cost related to the financing like the amortization of intangibles. So that's a bit of a big picture what are the synergies and we would not -- we did not include the interest expense and the intangible amortization as a net against those --. ","John Healy","Was there an assumption for the inventory, the garments in the stock rooms and things like that?","Mike Hansen ","Well, we have thoughts on that. We didn't share any in August and I am not ready to do that today. We need to get the deal closed and that when we can dive into more of the details. And really get more specific. ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks, good afternoon, guys. A couple clarification questions first. With regard to the SAP number down a little bit, this was asked earlier, but is it going to be pushed out, or is it just the less on integration spend? And why I'm asking is I'm wondering if you're holding things up waiting for the closing of the G&K acquisition, or it's just pure integration savings?","Mike Hansen ","I think it's just we are spending less on the integration in the early periods that kind of lead us to think we maybe more efficient over the course of the integration. ","Scott Schneeberger","All right, thanks. And then a real quickie, on the accounting change you mentioned that fiscal first quarter is typically going to be the big one, and obviously it's going to be a headwind in the coming three. In our modeling, should we just equal weight the next three quarters, or is there any seasonality to that we should think about?","Mike Hansen ","I think that's a reasonable assumption to equal weight.","Scott Schneeberger","All right, thanks. And then obviously we have the election coming up, so I will be that guy and ask the question, but it sounds like infrastructure is probably going to be strong under either candidate. Thoughts on that and then trade maybe not so much. I'm not sure that would have an impact, but if you could address those two if meaningful or anything else you think are resulting from what you have heard thus far. Thanks.","Mike Hansen ","I think it's -- I would say that it's a little unclear for us to get specific on any kind of future benefits. We will certainly operate in whatever environment occurs after the election. And it's too early to tell and too early to try build any kind of specific assumption. ","Operator","Thank you. With no additional questions in the queue, I'll turn things back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. ","Mike Hansen ","Well, thank you very much for joining us tonight. We appreciate it. We will issue our second quarter earnings in the end of December. And we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. ","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, again that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all again for your participation."],"5433":["Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) Q3 2013 Earnings Call March 19, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","William C.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","William C. Gale","Thank you for joining us this evening. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC. We are pleased to report third quarter revenue of $1,076,000,000, which represents record quarterly revenue for Cintas and growth of 6.3% from last year's third quarter. Organic growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and the impact of 1 less workday compared to last year's third quarter, was 6.9%. As we noted in the press release, the organic growth in each of our 4 operating segments improved from second quarter levels. We indicated in last quarter's call that we expected our uniform direct sales segment to have a good second half of the fiscal year, and that was certainly true in our third quarter. The execution of our global accounts and strategic markets and our global supply chain teams during the third quarter was outstanding as we rolled out several large new programs on our way to over 15% growth in the uniform direct sales operating segment.","Third quarter net income decreased by 1.7% to $75 million, and there were a number of factors that contributed to this decrease. Our third quarter had 64 workdays, which is 1 less than last year's third quarter. Keep in mind that a number of our large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation and amortization, are determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis, and 1 less workday results in 1 less day of revenue to cover those expenses. In addition, we have discussed on our last few calls that strong new business sales and the absence of meaningful customer hiring over the past few years have resulted in increasing rental material cost and capacity pressure on our routes. As a result, rental segment material cost exceeded last year's third quarter material cost, just as it also did in this year's second quarter. We also continue to add route capacity during this quarter to ensure that we have the ability to continue providing excellent service to our customers.","In our selling and administrative expenses, our cost associated with employee-related medical benefits increased by roughly 60 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. Keeping in mind that we are self-insured, this increase was due to new claims experienced during the quarter. Medical costs have historically been in the range of 3% to 4% of revenue, and this third quarter expense continued to be in that range. In addition to higher medical costs, our expenses associated with auto and other liability claims increased roughly 50 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. Despite these added costs during the quarter, our earnings per diluted share for the third quarter did increase over last year's third quarter. This year's earnings per diluted share were $0.60, a 3.4% increase over last year's third quarter of $0.58. This was due to the positive impact of our share buyback program.","During the third quarter, we purchased roughly $28 million of our stock, bringing our total purchases during the last 12 months to $309 million of Cintas stock. As of February 28, we have $191 million available under the current board authorization for future shares repurchases. As we enter our fourth fiscal quarter, we are updating our fiscal 2013 guidance based on our third quarter performance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.325 billion, and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.54. The guidance assumes the current U.S. economic environment continues and does not worsen going forward. It also assumes no impact for additional share repurchases. Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hansen for more details of the third quarter.","J. Michael Hansen","Good evening. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 6.3% from the third quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 6.9%. Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 41.1%, which is down from last year's third quarter gross margin of 42.1%, but slightly better than this year's second quarter gross margin of 40.7%. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, let me remind you that there were 64 workdays in our third quarter, which is 1 less than last year. Our fourth quarter will have 66 workdays, which is the same as last year's fourth quarter. As a planning note for fiscal '14, we will have 65 workdays in each quarter for a total of 260 workdays. This creates year-over-year workday differences in each quarter except the second, and results in 1 less workday for the entire fiscal year. We have 4 reportable operating segments: rental uniforms and ancillary products; uniform direct sales; first aid, safety and fire protection services; and document management services. Uniform direct sales, first aid, safety and fire protection services and document management services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement. The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental uniforms and ancillary products revenue accounted for 70% of company revenue in the third quarter and totaled $748.9 million, which is up 3.9% compared to last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 5.5%, which is a nice uptick from the 4.5% organic growth rate in the second quarter. Sales rep productivity continued to be strong and we did see a slight pickup near the end of the quarter in our net adds stops metric. Our rentals segment gross margin was 41.9% for the third quarter, a 120 basis point decrease from last year's third quarter gross margin of 43.1%. Energy-related costs were down 10 basis points from last year's third quarter. Bill touched on the primary reasons for the decreased gross margin: the impact of 1 less workday, the higher material cost and service costs associated with added route capacity. The third quarter gross margin of 41.9% was the same as the second quarter. The negative impact of 1 less workday in the third quarter was offset by the impact of the processing system write-off in the second quarter. Our uniform direct sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform direct sales revenue accounted for 12% of company revenue in the third quarter and totaled $126.1 million, which represented sales growth of 15.6% compared to last year's third quarter. As Bill mentioned, we had several rollouts in the third quarter in our Fortune 1000 business, including the largest single customer rollout in Cintas' history. Uniform direct sales gross margin was 29.2% for the third quarter, down from last year's third quarter gross margin of 30.5%. This segment's gross margin can move from quarter-to-quarter due to changes in mix of product and timing of program rollouts. And this year's third quarter revenue included a much higher mix of Fortune 1000 national account sales, which tend to have slightly lower gross margins than our hospitality and gaming business. Our first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First aid, safety and fire protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the third quarter. Revenue was $112.9 million, which is up 11.3% over last year's third quarter revenue. Organic growth was 6.9%, which is a nice improvement over the 4.8% organic growth rate in the second quarter. This segment's gross margin was 44% in the third quarter, which is up 80 basis points from the 43.2% in last year's second quarter, and the 42.4% in this year's second quarter. Our first aid and safety gross margins were very strong due to continued efficiencies gained by the good performance in this business. Our document management services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services and that accounted for 8% of third quarter total company revenue. Document management revenue totaled $87.8 million, which is 8.9% higher than last year's third quarter. Revenue increased organically by 5.8% compared to last year. We have lapped last year's steep drop in recycled paper prices and now have better year-over-year comps. This year's third quarter average recycled paper price remain relatively low at $140 per ton, but this is slightly higher than last year's third quarter average of $135 per ton. This $140 average price also remained lower than our expected third quarter paper price of $160 per ton. Our updated guidance for the fourth quarter assumes that recycled paper prices will stay roughly at the $140 level. The third quarter gross margin of 47.1% is comparable to last year's third quarter of 47%. Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 28.7% as a percentage of revenue in the third quarter, which is up slightly from the 28.5% in last year's third quarter. As Bill mentioned, medical and auto and other liability claims were up a combined 110 basis points. Offsetting these increases were better leveraging of our G&A functions and constant challenging of our cost structure. Our effective tax rate was 36.1% for the quarter compared to 37% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. For the full fiscal 2013 year, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 37%, which is slightly higher than last year's 36.8%. Last year's rate was impacted favorably by the resolution of federal audits.","Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were $246 million at February 28, down $30 million from the $276 million at November 30. This decrease was due to the $80 million payment of our annual dividend in December, offset by cash generated from operations. Included in the $246 million at February 28 was $54 million of cash located outside of the U.S. Accounts receivable increased by $16 million since November 30 due to the higher sales level in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. DSOs were roughly 40, which is the same as at last year's third quarter. New goods inventory at February 28 was $247 million, up $11 million from November 30 due mainly to inventory associated with several large uniform direct sales customers. Despite higher sales this year, the inventory level of $247 million is down $29 million since last year at February 29 due to improved inventory management. Accrued liabilities decreased $87 million compared to November 30, primarily due to the $80 million December payment of our annual dividend. Long-term debt at February 28 was $1.3 billion. As of February 28, our total debt to EBITDA remains slightly below 2x.","Moving on to cash flow, cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter was $141 million, which is up from last year's third quarter amount of $132 million. CapEx for the third quarter was $52.7 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $38.3 million in rental; $1.4 million in uniform direct sales; $2.5 million in first aid, safety and fire protection; and $10.5 million in document management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now take any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You saw a nice pickup in the organic growth trends. I'm wondering if you could talk about the tone of your clients. And any details on types of clients maybe by industry that are adding programs or expanding their programs?","William C. Gale","Sara, what we saw was -- we saw a weak beginning of our quarter. December was relatively weak. January, first couple weeks started out, and then things got a little bit better. And as we got into February, I would say the latter part of February began to show a little bit of life in the add-stop metric among existing customers. I would say the general tone that I'm hearing from our operating and sales management is kind of a little bit of relief that we got through some of these big issues that the year-end fiscal cliff and some of the other things that were going on. And while I don't think there is a robust attitude that things are going to be really great, I think that there's just kind of a relief and maybe a little bit more optimism in the marketplace.","J. Michael Hansen","And so I would say that we did not see any significant -- one segment has significant improved performance over another. It was generally pretty broad.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then it's a little hard to compare because of the year-over-year days not matching, but if I look at the guidance for the fourth quarter, it looks like you could be expecting a slowdown in the organic growth rate. So first, is that correct? And second, if so, could you talk about why?","William C. Gale","I'm not sure that's totally correct. The low end of our guidance would show growth of about 5.6% and the top end about 8%. But there -- I would say, within that guidance, we're looking at kind of a quarter relatively similar to what we saw this quarter.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question, any update on the pricing environment? Is it getting any marginally easier now that there's some incremental optimism?","William C. Gale","I would say the answer to that question is no. It's no different -- the pricing environment appears to be no different than what we've seen for the last several quarters, which is a pretty competitive environment.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to talk 2 things. I mean, one, kind of following on that question, I mean, I'm definitely encouraged to see kind of the organic growth picking up. And I would assume that despite of probably a little bit of a weather impact, too, I would assume, and some of your regions seen a couple of loss days because of weather compared to last year where we didn't really have much weather, would that be fair to say that, that was kind of a little bit of a headwind during the quarter?","William C. Gale","I'm not sure I could really say that. There were a couple of those winter storms, but I didn't hear a lot of problems among our locations with deliveries and that sort of thing. So there's always a little bit of that in the third quarter in different parts of the country, but nothing out of the ordinary.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then in terms of adding some of the route capacity back to handle the new business, would it -- I mean, how do you feel about where you are with that right now? Do you have more to go based on the level of business that you have right now? And then also, would it be fair that if we did see some pick-up in the economy and the employment rate, and that add\/stop metric kind of shoot up a little bit at, hopefully, some point, that we could see even a little bit greater route density than we normally would see in a rising environment like that?","William C. Gale","Well, Nate, that's certainly our hope. What we have seen, we've had just some really nice new business over the last year or so. And as we spoke in the last couple of quarters, we've had to add some routes because we have more stops and we just needed to have the capacity in order to handle that new business. And there's no doubt that when we see adds consistently taking place at our existing customers, that is going to be very beneficial to route density, and thus, it's going to have a nice marginal impact positively on our results because not only will we get more revenue from a stop, but we'll be able to utilize with adds more of our existing stockroom inventory as customers do add employees to their headcount. Now is that going to necessarily happen in the fourth quarter? I don't know. I hope that we'll begin to see some of that, but it's still been a pretty sluggish employment growth, especially in the uniform rental wearing sectors. But with the little bit of uptick we saw at the end of February, maybe that will continue. I know there's been a few analysts who had put out some reports of their surveys with private customers that indicate there might be some trends of that. So we'll have to wait and see, but we'll certainly going to have the capacity on our routes to handle that, those adds if they do occur.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So you put up 2 consecutive years of solid SG&A leverage, and obviously, that abated this quarter. And I get it, the medical cost and liability were up a combined 110 basis points. I guess I'm just curious, do you see those headwinds reversing in the coming quarters or could we be looking at an ongoing drag? And then I guess, more importantly, how should we think about SG&A leverage going forward?","William C. Gale","Joe, I don't think we expect those type of spikes to continue. Of course, we're self-insured for medical benefits and you are going to have quarters when you'll have some relatively expensive cases and this happened to be one of them that we had several that must have hit, but I'd say that we would expect, if you look over the average cost of our medical benefits over the past year or so, it's been lower than what we saw this most recent quarter. So I've no reason to expect that to increase, at least this year. Obviously going into '14, all companies are going to face some additional costs associated with some of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. But that's going to be -- every company is going to feel that. As to these cases, again, I think that's kind of an aberration. I can't say that it won't happen again, but it's more likely not to happen than to happen. So with all that said, I'd say as long as we continue to see that top line growing, we're going to see some additional SG&A leverage, not necessarily to the same degree we've seen over the last 2 years, but some marginal continued leverage improvement in the SG&A line.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. That's helpful, Bill. And then maybe switching gears to the merchandise amortization component, can you maybe just help us understand the different moving pieces? Was there a benefit from lower cotton, but yet that was more than offset by newer uniforms going out? Just kind of curious for some color there.","J. Michael Hansen","Sure, Joe. When we look at material costs, as we mentioned, it was higher this year than last year. But what we did see is that the increase in the third quarter over last year was less than the year-over-year increase in our second quarter. And we talked numerous times in the past about how we expected cotton to peak mid-fiscal '13. And so we probably did get a bit of a relief coming off of that. But also, just saw a little bit of a decrease in the rate of the material cost increase. So it was a positive sign during the quarter.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And maybe can you just talk about some of the garments that you put out into service post recession? And we're coming up against a couple of years of pretty good growth. Are you starting to replace some of those uniforms and products now or is that not really coming up yet?","J. Michael Hansen","So I think that certainly can come up. And it just depends on the type of the customer and how they use their garments. And we will always be replacing garments. But I wouldn't say that it's -- we've seen a serious uptick in the amount that we're pulling from the stockroom based on these new accounts put in service over the last couple of years. I would say more of the impact has been we're just continuing to sell new accounts.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, got you. Last question then I'll turn it over. On the direct sales side, clearly, you stand out. Can you just talk to the longevity of some of these programs? I mean, are they meant to last a few quarters, last a year or are they generally more seasonal in nature?","William C. Gale","Well, I wouldn't say they're seasonal, but they're more related to a specific customer requirement to do the rollout. So our sales organization is constantly working on replenishing these type of big account rollouts, but obviously, it's dependent somewhat on the customer themself. So what you saw this quarter is probably not repeatable in the short term. We would expect there still will be positive growth in the direct sales segment in our fourth quarter, but this certainly was kind of an unusual event, one that we knew was coming. And that's the nature of direct sale. We see this all the time where we can have these very, very high-growth quarters followed by flat to somewhat down quarters. And it's just the nature of the business.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So you talked about the extra workday setting up for comparisons on the revenue side. It's kind of harder to peel out what the margins would be adjusted for that. Is it fair to kind of gross up the revenue from this quarter by that extra day, look at the same cost structure and then compare that to last year? Is that a fair way to look at it or if we do that, are we missing something?","William C. Gale","Well, that's a little too simplistic, I think, Andy. I mean, you can do a little bit of that, but -- like when you look at maybe some of the rental gross margins. But the problem we have is the quarter gets kind of complicated when you have some of these things that we talked about in SG&A. When you have a different mix percent of the direct sale business than you had in previous quarters versus the rental business, and the direct sale business tends to have a little less margin. So you just have -- you have to be low-cost or something. Suffice it to say, that we certainly are impacted negatively on a margin standpoint when we have fewer workdays. Because as Mike mentioned, with material cost, depreciation, amortization all being done on a monthly basis, that can have 50, 60 basis point differential just on the margins. And then you get other things that are being factored in there.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. I guess that makes sense. But it sounds like if you were to do it, the only segment that you'd even have a chance would be the core rental segment. And I guess if I do that math, I see kind of a 20 basis point gross margin hit and a 30 basis point rental hit, which it's not up, but it's not -- there's clearly a very big impact from the extra day.","William C. Gale","Yes, but I think I wouldn't make too much out of a 20, 30 basis change. I mean your mix of new business, the mix of the types of the business, that's -- those type of variations are going to happen quarter-to-quarter.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, okay. That's good. And just in terms of the routes, you kind of talked about this a little bit, but you've split some routes. Is the business supportive of a continuation of that or is it now, have you done the splitting of the routes and now it's just making those happen? Or should we see the kind of the routes splitting as maybe an ongoing headwind to near-term leverage with the long-term benefits?","William C. Gale","Well, I think -- let's keep in mind. I think the splitting of routes is a good long-term strategic move to enable us to serve more customers. And we will continue to, I think, be very successful in selling new business, and therefore, we need to stay ahead of the game and having the routes available to handle that new business so we can properly take care of our customers. So I see it going on. What I hope will happen is obviously, we'll see some improvement in the attitude of businesses to hire additional people at existing stops and just increase the amount of revenue without increasing the number of stops in all our routes, but with a very large sales force that is very productive, and what we think we have a -- some competitive advantages with product and with service systems, we'll continue to see robust new business. And when you have new business, you have to have the route capacity to handle it.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Is there any one of your segments that's getting a disproportionate amount of new routes still?","J. Michael Hansen","The rental -- no, I'd say any of our route-based businesses were all adding routes.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just final question. Mike, document kind of some currency x paper. What was that for the quarter?","J. Michael Hansen","We had a nice improvement in the quarter to 7.1%.","Operator","Moving next to James Samford with Citigroup.","James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to touch on a few things. Fuel prices, natural gas, they're on the rise here. You're still seeing some leverage on the energy cost side. I just wondered if you could comment on whether -- how we should think about Q4 in terms of energy cost with the current levels of commodity prices. And how does adding new routes impact the sort of energy cost line and just in general?","William C. Gale","Right now, our energy cost as a percent of revenue were relatively consistent with what we saw in the second quarter. We're a little over 3% of revenue. And the natural gas prices, they have shown a little bit of uptick, but not significant enough that I would think there would be a big change. Quite honestly, James, it's the price of the gas and diesel that the more dramatic change in those prices have a bigger impact on our energy cost overall, because that's the biggest percentage of our energy cost by far. As to the route capacity, well, the more trucks you have on the road, the more gas you're going to use. So you certainly will see an increase in utilization of gasoline and diesel by -- because you have more trucks, and therefore, we'll have that cost going on. We won't get the leverage necessary on the revenue line that we would if we were not adding route capacity. We're just seeing revenue increases at existing accounts.","James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's fair enough. That's what I was trying to get at. But on a -- from a capacity perspective, where do you stand right now in terms of your total wearers versus prior peak, and maybe comment on what the mix of rental wearing versus other products is at this point.","William C. Gale","Well, we still have fewer wearers today than at the peak. I won't get into the details anymore than that. But because of that, we still have capacity, generally speaking, and more than we did in '08. Now capacity is certainly a local issue and there are some spots that have grown faster than others in the last couple of years, and we may have some capacity needs from a plant standpoint in the next few years. But generally speaking, we have some pretty good capacity, and the -- when I talked about the fewer revenues -- fewer wearers today, our revenue is higher than it has ever been, and that is because we've replaced those, the revenue, from those lost wearers with other things like cleaning chemical solutions and hygiene products that don't require a lot of capacity. So to answer your question, plant capacity is still pretty good.","James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess one quick question on the Affordable Care Act. I know that you've talked about sort of some impact on your business. Any sort of update on where you're thinking as the impact in 2014 might be and what kind of offsets you have or leverage you have to change, to absorb some of that cost?","William C. Gale","Well, I think everyone is aware that it's getting a lot more press. There was an article on the journal about a week ago that talked about the $63 charge that everyone is going to have to pay for every covered individual and their dependents. And so the rules are just getting announced and written. There is certainly going to be an increase. So what is our strategy? Well, our strategy has got to be to provide our employees with a decent medical program, but because of the significant increases in cost, they're going to have to share in some of that through higher weekly cost of their share of the cost. Maybe higher co-pays. We're offering some high deductible plans and inducing employees to get into those that we think would help us control our costs. And we continue to work with our various suppliers in trying to get the best deal possible in terms of the amount we have to pay for prescription drugs, for medical coverage, et cetera. There is just no doubt that there's going to be some increase in overall cost, both to the employee and to companies, and we'll do our best to keep that cost to a minimum. But there's still a lot to be resolved yet in terms of what the government is going to be forcing companies to do, and we're just watching it and then we'll try to react accordingly.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the rental gross margin line, which is down 120 basis percentage. Explain the reason. If it was not for the 1 less day, how close to even would rental gross margin be in the third quarter? And is there a shot that rental gross margin will be up in the fourth quarter given your comments about add-stop and even days?","J. Michael Hansen","Well -- if you would adjust for the workday in the third quarter, as Bill mentioned, we would see the rental gross margins likely go up about 50 basis points because of that 1 less workday. It was about a 50 basis point impact. Last year's fourth quarter gross margin and rental was 43.3%. And do I think we can get to that? It depends a bit, again, on how our revenue comes back. If we continue to see a movement, a positive trend in add-stops like we saw at the end of this quarter, then certainly, we can see a very good gross margin in the fourth quarter. If, however, that doesn't play out and we turn to a negative trend or a flattened trend, then because of the increase in routes, we may have a little bit more difficultly matching that gross margin from last year's fourth quarter.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Good. That's very helpful and promising. And if you could go over the acceleration of rental revenue growth in the third quarter, which pieces your revenue growth accelerated year-over-year?","William C. Gale","It really came through both the uniform wearer, as well as the facility services. It was kind of consistent. We're seeing some very nice growth continuing albeit from a relatively low base in the chemical dispensing and the tile and carpet cleaning. But I was encouraged with seeing kind of an across the board improvement with pretty much the core business, the dust business, the rental garment business. We've expanded into some different segments like healthcare with some microfiber mops and wipes and scrub rental, and I think that has been somewhat of a benefit for us also. Again, it was not consistent through the whole quarter. We had a tough, as I've mentioned earlier, we had a tough December, but we began to see a little life in mid-January and then it kind of picked up as we moved through the end of February. So I am -- I like to say I'm very optimistic for the fourth quarter but I can't because I just don't know what's going to happen. But at least the trend was more positive as we exited the third quarter.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And, Bill, often, you described that same thing in terms of new business, loss business. So if you take the third quarter as a whole, did new business accelerate, did loss business ebb?","William C. Gale","Loss business ebbed a bit. New business, again, was very strong especially in the second half of the third quarter.","Operator","We'll go next to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Daniel Hultberg - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","This is Daniel Hultberg filling in for Scott. Can you take us a little bit deeper on the strategy employed to drive some of that cost leverage in the business, please?","William C. Gale","Well, the strategy has been always to get as much capacity revenue on our routes. And as we mentioned earlier, route density is a key to that. Utilization in our plants is certainly something that we're always looking for and then the SG&A leverage. So our strategy had always been add routes as needed to handle additional stops and then do whatever we can to increase revenue at those stops.","Operator","Moving next to Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Bill, is there anything that is different about the add-stop change at the end of the quarter? We've had a number of head fakes with the add-stops. It was clearly the biggest lever potential for your business. Is there any sense that you have yet at this point in time, we might be feeling the real thing as opposed to kind of the head fakes we got a couple of times in the last few years?","William C. Gale","I can't. I couldn't tell you that convincingly. I wish I could, but I can't. I agree.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And how long -- I guess when you talk about the end of the quarter, I guess how long did you see it for? You guys manage your business, I assume, on kind of more of a weekly basis. So how -- what part of the quarter did you see that in?","William C. Gale","The last 2 to 3 weeks.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And did that continue going into this quarter?","William C. Gale","We looked -- we really don't have anything yet. It's pretty early in March, so I would say I don't have anything that I could really look at and tell you whether it did because it's just difficult that we're so early in the month.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then the trends in the business have been improving. I'm trying to bridge that with the EPS guidance kind of being narrowed down to the lower half. Like what are you expecting to change in the fourth quarter?","William C. Gale","Well, a couple of things. One is, of course, the paper price. As Mike alluded to, we've now reduced our expectation on paper price in the fourth quarter from what we had assumed back in December when we gave you that updated guidance. And that probably cost us, in that quarter alone, $0.015 or so. We're also a little bit concerned that maybe we will not have a repeat performance of the medical -- the lower medical expenses that we saw last year. And therefore, based on what we saw in the third quarter, we picked that up a little bit. We continue to expect there to be more impact, the material cost impact, although we've seen that trend come down a little bit. We still think that will be higher than last year's fourth quarter. And so I think the tax rate's a tad bit higher. So I'd say those are the major factors. But with all that said, we're still looking at fourth quarter, our guidance still indicates a fairly nice improvement in operating income in the fourth quarter over last year, even looking at the low end of the guidance. So I feel pretty good that it's going to be a decent quarter assuming that the revenue comes in.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So just to quantify some of that, is it fair to say that the tax rate in total is $1.05 per quarter, so like $0.03 the differences, and not the tax rate, I'm sorry, the paper pricing?","William C. Gale","The paper price was, yes, based on what we thought it was going to be in December, it's like $0.015, yes.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So $0.015 per quarter or $0.015 per...","William C. Gale","Per quarter.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So $0.03 out of the $0.04...","William C. Gale","Right, $0.025 to $0.03, Shlomo.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then tax rate is kind of a fraction of a cent?","William C. Gale","Yes. Okay. You're getting into the minutia. I...","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","[indiscernible] that. The bulk of it, it sounds like it's the -- the paper pricing is what it sounds like.","William C. Gale","The bulk of it, I would say, is the paper prices and a little less -- a little more concern on some of these expenses like medical benefits, liability claims, that sort of thing, that we just -- because we saw a little uptick in the third quarter.","Operator","We'll go next to Gary Bisbee with Barclays.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you -- you were kind enough to give us the impact of the 1 less workday and the rentals gross margin. Can you give us a sense, either the actual numbers or directionally, the other 2 issues, how much they contributed, the new customer impact and the route investments?","J. Michael Hansen","No, Gary, we haven't gotten into those, to that level of detail and would prefer not to.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's not very helpful, but I'll move on to the next one. How about some color on how the new business has trended over the last 12 to 18 months, and in particular, what I'm getting at is when will some of those amortizations start to roll off? And this really picked up a lot like in the quarter, so that expense is going to be there for a while or is this the combination of new business having improved over the last year? And so as you're rolling out quarters where it wasn't as strong and adding in several where you've had good growth, that's sort of the impact. I'm trying to think how long is this a headwind is really the question.","William C. Gale","Well, I guess I would answer that question by saying if we were to stop selling new business, it wouldn't become a headwind. But the fact is we still have an awful big sales force and they're continuing to be very productive. So we're always going to have new business. And as a result of that, you're always going to have that kind of injection of products. So I'm not sure you're going to see a significant drop in the material cost because the amortization drops.","J. Michael Hansen","As I mentioned, Gary, though, the rate of increase year-over-year in our third quarter was less than our second quarter. And so we started to see a bit of that start to happen. In other words, the headwind was a little bit less in the third quarter than in the second quarter. And if we get a little bit of help with net add-stops in the fourth quarter, we might get a little bit more help in the fourth quarter. We did see some of that with cotton from the second quarter to the third quarter. But again, we saw a little bit of an improvement in the rate of increase, and I would say, rather than all of a sudden the headwind going away, it's probably going to be something that goes away very slowly over time, unless we see a real change in net adds-stops.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, all right. Fair enough. Can you give us any color on where the improvement in add-stops came from? Was it more the wearers or more potentially bad weather leading to more jackets, which I've heard you referenced in the past, or anything like that just to help us understand exactly where it improved?","William C. Gale","It was more wearers and more facility services product adds.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question for me. I know I've asked you this a lot over the last couple of years, but at what threshold do you think about breaking out the hygiene and facility services business into its own segment? I think with the fourth quarter of last year when you gave us the mix, it looks like it's getting close to that 10% threshold at which companies start to do that. Is that something you might do next fiscal year? And if not, why not?","William C. Gale","No, because we cannot properly split out the costs since they are housed in the same facility and often on the same route. So there's -- it would be a beset with a tremendous amount of allocations in order to split out the cost side. And as a result of that, we are not going to do that in the near-term.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Is there -- I thought the Sanis business, when you acquired that many years ago, had its own route. And a lot more of that was going off on different trucks. Is that not the case?","William C. Gale","It's a mix. There's a lot of trucks that are mixed trucks. There's trucks that are exclusively facility services, but it's not that clear cut.","Operator","And our final question comes from Jason Rogers with Great Lakes Review.","Jason Rogers","I just wanted to get an update on your business internationally, as well as growth opportunities there, currently.","William C. Gale","Well, our business internationally right now is, I think we've said about $40 million, a little over $40 million of revenue in document management in Europe and not doing very well. They have experienced some difficulties in growing the business over there. In fact, they shrunk a little bit from the third quarter last year. Profitability has improved somewhat, and we've been spending resources trying to improve the profitability, but we've had some issues with that and I think it really caused more by the macro issues of Europe in total than by anything else. As far as other international business, we do sell uniforms into many of our U.S.-based customers, our North American based customers throughout the world. We are seeing a pickup in that, more interest in having to service them. But again, it's a relatively minor piece of our overall business. Our focus continues to be, in North America, 95%, 98% -- between 95% and 98% of our business is North America, and that's really what our ongoing focus is going to be.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to you presenters for any closing comments.","William C. Gale","Thank you, again, for joining us. Mike and I appreciate everybody's interest and we will look forward to speaking with you on our fourth quarter earnings release sometime in mid to late July, and we look forward to talking to you then. Good night.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead.","Michael Hansen","Good evening. Thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2018. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","Our revenue for the fourth quarter, which ended May 31, was $1,670,000,000, an increase of 9.1% over last year's fourth quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 5.1%.","The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 5.3%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 9.4%.","Note that the lower rate of organic revenue growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was expected and as we have previously communicated, was due to the inclusion for the first time of the acquired G&K Services business and organic as opposed to inorganic revenue.","Reported operating income for the fourth quarter was $265 million compared to $177 million in last year's fourth quarter. Operating income was reduced $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '18 and $63 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal '17 by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. Excluding these items, our fourth quarter operating income grew 16.4%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.8% compared to 15.8% last year.","In March, we gave fourth quarter EPS guidance in the range of $1.64 to $1.69. That excluded G&K integration expenses, and it assumed an effective tax rate of 24%. Against this guidance, fourth quarter EPS was $1.77.","Our tax rate was slightly better than the guided 24%, and this resulted in a benefit of $0.04. The remaining beat of guidance was primarily due to higher revenue than expected.","We're pleased with these fourth quarter results and our full year performance. Our fiscal '18 results extended our record of success. We have now grown revenue and profit 47 of the past 49 years with the only exception being the two years of the Great Recession.","For the eighth consecutive year, organic growth was in the mid- to high single-digit range, and we continue to grow revenue by multiples greater than both gross domestic product and employment.","Strong execution on the fundamentals is a hallmark of Cintas, but fiscal '18's achievement was especially noteworthy given that it occurred in a period of extreme change management. While delivering solid returns to shareholders in 2018, we also made significant progress on two important investments, G&K and SAP.","The first year of the integration of the largest acquisition in Cintas history required the expertise of every part of the organization, including sales, production, service, global supply chain, IT, engineering, HR and finance. Very important tasks included winning the hearts and minds of acquired employees whom we call partners and earning the trust of acquired customers through our outstanding service.","Our partners ran our acquisition playbook and effectively adjusted where necessary. We have now closed nearly all operations necessary to eliminate redundancies, which is 63 operations to date.","All G&K locations, 148 in total, have been converted to Cintas operating systems. About 1,500 G&K trucks have been painted and rebranded as Cintas. Important integration work still remains for fiscal 2019, but after our first year of integration efforts, we are still on track for the achievement of our synergy commitments.","When we acquired G&K less than 18 months ago, our debt to EBITDA ratio rose to about 3.1 times. Our commitment was to return our leverage to a target of about 2 times in 3 years. We are now there and are thrilled to have delivered on this commitment well ahead of expectations.","Fiscal '18 was also a year of tremendous technological change. In addition to moving G&K locations to Cintas systems, we continue to convert our operating system from a homegrown system to that of SAP. And information system conversion is like an acquisition integration in that it requires the involvement of experts from all departments of the company, including operations, sales and corporate support.","The conversion of each operation to SAP is an eight month process. Our employees are coached on change management. Data standardization activities are performed. Garments are scanned and inventoried, and employees are trained and certified. Customers are notified of changes to invoice appearance and introduced to improvements in doing business with us because of the technology enhancements.","Training and care continue for two months following the go-live date of the new system. A total of 108 operations have now been converted to date, which is about 34% of the total planned.","Looking ahead to -- looking ahead, fiscal 2019 will share some similarities with fiscal '18. We will continue to integrate G&K and realize more of the $130 million to $140 million in anticipated annual synergies.","We expect to realize $90 million to $95 million in synergies in fiscal 2019 or $32 million to $37 million in incremental synergies. In addition, efforts will continue to convert more operations to the new SAP ERP system.","Like fiscal '18, inefficiencies will exist as our partners make further progress on acquisition integration and system implementations while executing on the day-to-day for our customers.","However, we expect to extend our streak of profitable growth to 48 out of the past 50 years. We will accomplish that via the solid execution of our -- our shareholders have come to expect.","One important area in which fiscal '19 will differ from fiscal '18 is in capital allocation. With $600 million of acquisition debt repaid and our leverage target achieved, we returned to our historical priorities for deployment of cash, which are CapEx, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.","We are honored to have been recently included in the Fortune 500 as number 500. As our CEO, Scott Farmer, has stated, this accomplishment is built on our strong sense of culture, principles and values and reflects our strong financial growth, expanding line of products and services and innovative technologies. It's a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employee partners.","We're not satisfied with being number 500, though, and our continued progression higher into that ranking starts in fiscal '19. Our expectations for fiscal '19 are for annual revenue to be in the range of $6.750 billion to $6.820 billion.","I stated earlier that in our fourth quarter of fiscal '18, we lapped the one year anniversary of the acquisition of G&K. For the first time, G&K's revenue was organic as opposed to inorganic. This resulted in a lower organic growth rate due to the combination of a strongly growing Cintas legacy business and a significantly sized G&K business that historically grew slower than Cintas.","We expect this lower organic growth rate to be temporary just as it was for our First Aid and Safety segment after it acquired ZEE Medical. With continued investment in selling resources, we expect the total Uniform Rental and Facility Services organic growth rate to hit bottom in the first quarter and then strengthen as we move through fiscal '19.","We expect fiscal '19 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $7 to $7.15. Let me make a few comments about this EPS guidance. It assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Keep in mind that this tax rate can move up or down from quarter-to-quarter based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation benefits.","The guidance assumes a diluted share count for computing EPS of 114 million shares. It does not assume any G&K integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $15 million to $20 million in fiscal '19. The guidance does include the impact of a change to our Cintas partner retirement policy in which the retirement age and tenure requirements were reduced.","This change results in a shorter time period over which future stock-based compensation grants will be amortized. It is a non-cash impact, and it is expected to increase stock-based compensation expense by roughly $20 million in fiscal '19.","And lastly, the guidance also includes the impact of adoption of the Accounting Standard Update 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. With the adoption, we expect the following. Fiscal '19 revenue will be negatively affected by roughly $8 million along with the loss of the incremental operating margin associated with that revenue.","SG&A, however, will benefit from the capitalization of sales rep commission payments and the subsequent amortization of those commissions over the expected service period of our contracts. This is also a non-cash impact, and we expect the net benefit to be roughly $16 million to $19 million.","Overall, these last two non-cash items included in guidance will both be recorded in SG&A and generally will offset each other to have only a minor negative impact.","Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to say thank you to Phillip Holloman, who is retiring from Cintas this month. Phillip has been with Cintas for 22 years and has been our President and Chief Operating Officer for the past 10 years.","In our press release last month in which Scott Farmer thanked Phillip for his many contributions, Scott said, those of us who have had the privilege of working with Phillip know that Cintas is a better company because of him, and he will be missed. Thanks again, Phillip.","Phillip's retirement has led to several other leadership changes at Cintas. Scott Farmer announced the promotion of Todd Schneider to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer with the responsibility of leading all of our business divisions.","Todd has been with Cintas for 29 years and has been our Rental division President and Chief Operating Officer for the last 5 years, leading our largest business through a very successful period and most notably, leading us through the integration of G&K.","Scott also announced the promotion of Mike Thompson to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Administration Officer. Mike has been with Cintas for 24 years and has been Cintas' Chief Information Officer for the last five years, most notably leading us through our SAP conversion.","Mike will continue to lead our IT efforts and will also be responsible for our global supply chain and our safety and engineering groups. These changes are part of our normal succession planning process, and as we move into our fiscal '19 year, we remain as excited as ever about the future of Cintas.","I'll now turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Adler","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal fourth quarter contained the same number of workdays as the prior year fourth quarter. Looking ahead, there will be no workday differences next year as each quarter of fiscal '19 contains the same number of workdays as the comparable quarter of fiscal '18.","We have 2 reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.","The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.","Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,342,000,000, an increase of 10.1% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 5.3%.","As Mike stated, the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by the inclusion of G&K and organic as opposed to inorganic revenue for the first time. We expect the organic growth rate to hit bottom in the first quarter of fiscal '19 and strengthen as we move through the fiscal year.","Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.0% for the fourth quarter compared to 44.6% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 40 basis points.","While we continue to experience the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation, we are realizing the expected cost synergies, which are benefiting our margins. These synergies plus better-than-expected revenue also enabled us to overcome an almost 20 basis point increase in energy expenses.","Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $147 million, which was 9.9% higher than last year's fourth quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 9.4%.","This segment's gross margin was 47.0% in the fourth quarter compared to 44.5% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 250 basis points. The significant amount of margin expansion was fueled in large part due to the realization of synergies from the ZEE Medical acquisition. With the synergies now realized in full, we expect margin expansion to continue in fiscal '19 but at a normalized rate.","The fourth quarter was another outstanding quarter for this segment. Organic growth continued to be strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national account wins.","The solid revenue growth plus expanding gross margins are evidence of the value businesses place on having Cintas manage their first aid safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy and safe. The future of the first aid business segment remains bright.","Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. The Uniform Direct Sale business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million-dollar account. Our fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace.","All Other revenue was $179 million, an increase of 1.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate was 0.2%. The fire business organic revenue growth rate was double digits.","However, the strong performance was offset by a difficult revenue comparison for the Uniform Direct Sale business. In last year's fourth quarter, Uniform Direct Sale revenue included the rollouts of new uniform styles for the pilots and flight attendants of Southwest Airlines.","Large rollouts such as these do not repeat each year as businesses typically rebrand every 3 to 5 years. The benefit from Southwest last year was a headwind of about $13 million to this year's fourth quarter revenue.","All Other gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.8% for last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 80 basis points. All Other gross margin expansion was driven by the fire business.","Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 28.6% in last year's fourth quarter. SG&A benefited from favorable workers' compensation claims experience. In addition, we are getting leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs.","Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation. The effective tax rate, excluding G&K integration expenses, was 22.1%.","Our EPS guidance for fiscal 2019 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period.","Our cash and equivalents balance as of May 31 was $138 million. Free cash flow in fiscal '18 was $692 million, an increase of $201 million or 41% from the prior year period.","Capital expenditures for fiscal '18 were $271 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the year was as follows: $225 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $28 million in First Aid and Safety, and $18 million in All Other. We expect fiscal '19 CapEx to be in the range of $290 million to $320 million.","In the fourth quarter of fiscal '18, we repatriated about $110 million of international cash. We used the funds to pay down debts and to buy back stock. In the quarter, we purchased about $90 million in Cintas stock, and $410 million remain on the share buyback authorization approved by the Board of Directors. As of May 31, total debt was $2,535,000,000. At May 31, our leverage was 2.1x debt to EBITDA.","As Mike stated earlier, when we acquired G&K less than 18 months ago, we committed to return our leverage to a target of about 2 times in three years. We are pleased to have delivered on this commitment well ahead of expectations. We are excited to have returned to our historical priorities for deployment of cash, which are CapEx, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital.","Hamzah Mazari","Good afternoon. Thank you. The first question is just on consolidation in the space broadly. I know you've sort of outlined cost synergies. Maybe if you could touch on -- there's been another uniform deal in the space. Could you maybe touch on the revenue side?","Do you expect pricing to get better in the space post-consolidation? I realize it's a local business, so there may be some nuances there. So maybe if you could just touch on that and then how to think about G&K revenue synergies?","Michael Hansen","Sure. So from the standpoint of pricing, the pricing environment, I would say, hasn't changed much in the last 90 days since we spoke last. And quite honestly, I don't expect that the consolidation that has happened will have much of an impact on the pricing environment. It's still a very competitive environment.","We face legacy like competition as well as other catalog type competitors, and so that's not going away. So I don't think that's going to have much of an impact on the pricing environment.","From the standpoint of the revenue synergies, we're moving cautiously as we have as we've talked about in the past. But we have begun to introduce some of the products where we can, where we have converted systems or where we have integrated routes into Cintas locations.","And while it's early, and we haven't seen any notable impact, it's anecdotally positive so far. So I would say, as we continue to move through this year, we've got a lot of integration activity left, and we're going to continue to introduce Cintas products and services to those customers. But I would not expect much of an impact at this point in time.","Hamzah Mazari","Okay. And then just on the SAP, I know you sort of gave color on the integration of the SAP and time line. But maybe you're not ready quantitatively, but qualitatively, should -- once SAP is implemented, should we expect that 28% of sales SG&A run rate to come down materially? Or how are you thinking about sort of benefits of SAP maybe just qualitatively if you want to address that?","Michael Hansen","Yes. I think we'll see once we get through that implementation effort, which we expect to be by the end of fiscal '20. We do expect some expenses to roll off, certainly, those that are part of the integration and implementation effort. So we will certainly see some benefit from that in fiscal '21.","But more than anything from that system, we like the information and the power of that information. And we're not necessarily looking for a significant cost reduction. What we are looking for is more opportunity to make our selling team more productive.","So how can we create warmer leads with better information? How can we use that information to be more directive in the way we approach our customers with our various products and services? So we're not looking necessarily for a significant SG&A reduction. We really want to help our selling partners become more efficient.","Hamzah Mazari","Okay. Just a follow-up. I'll turn it over. Any updated thoughts on the tariffs and how that impacts you either directly or indirectly through customer demand?","Michael Hansen","From a direct standpoint, we have -- certainly have some impact like hangers, but overall, it has not been significant. From an indirect standpoint, and when I say indirect, I mean from the vendors -- from our vendors, it remains to be seen how they will be impacted and how that might in turn impact us. We're certainly keeping our eyes on that, but we need a little bit more time for that to play out. From a customer perspective, too early to see much of an impact.","Hamzah Mazari","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","Hi, good afternoon, guys.","Hamzah Mazari","Hi, Toni.","Toni Kaplan","So you mentioned a couple of times now you've hit your gross leverage target in this quarter. Your capital priorities are returning to historical ones. How should we think about the level of share repurchases this year or if you want to just talk directionally as sort of what the algorithm would be in that?","Or - and then also just with tax reform, how should we -- should we expect 5x to be above the historical average that you've been running at?","Michael Hansen","Well, we -- as Paul mentioned, CapEx is very important to us, and we will make sure we spend and invest in the business. We also will likely be more aggressive than we were in the last 2 fiscal years in acquisition activity. From the standpoint of share repurchases, we have a $410 million -- we have a $500,000 authorization, where $410 million is remaining.","And I would say that we're going to continue to do what we have done in the past, and that is be opportunistic about the way we use that. And so that -- I'm not ready to say whether that will increase where we have historically been. But I would say our expectation is to get back to something of that historical type of environment.","Toni Kaplan","Terrific. And I know it might be difficult to parse this out. But could you give us some color on what kind of G&K growth is incorporated into the '19 guidance?","Michael Hansen","That is very difficult to parse out. And you may have noticed when we gave guidance, we didn't include any specific G&K information because it's pretty difficult to take the business that is so co-mingled into our legacy business. But if you kind of think about the revenue guidance and you just make an assumption that it's flattish, that opening guidance is pretty much in the range of that 5 to 6.5 where we've been in the last few years.","So we think that's right where we want to be. That -- we believe that's our -- that's kind of our sweet spot as we opened the year and feel good about it moving into this first quarter.","Toni Kaplan","That's helpful. And just lastly, historically in the fourth quarter, you've given revenue growth by product within the uniform business. Is that something that you'd be able to provide for us today?","Paul Adler","Yes, Toni. We do have that, and this is the mix of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment. Uniform rental was 50%. Dust control is 17%. Hygiene is 14%. Shop towels are 5%. Linen is 10%, and then catalog revenue was 4%.","Toni Kaplan","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","George Tong","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. You've indicated that, over time, G&K's revenue growth can approach Cintas' historical revenue growth in the uniform rentals business. Can you think of any potential structural barriers that might prevent G&K organic growth from reaching your historical levels? And maybe talk a little bit about the initiatives you have in place to improve G&K's growth outlook over the near to intermediate term.","Michael Hansen","I don't see any roadblocks. And George, as we move in to this year, you -- it's hard to think about that business as being separate at all. It's -- so many of the locations have been absorbed into legacy Cintas locations or have traded volume. So it's really hard to look at it separately.","However, as we were working through the integration of last year, one of the biggest pieces was coming out of the closing of that deal. We had a sales team at G&K that had been -- had a tough environment, and we wanted to pull them out of their positions so that we can train them, get them to understand our systems, our products and services. There certainly were open positions that we had to fill, and that has gone very well.","But as we've talked about in the last several quarters in our business, when you lose that new business momentum for a number of quarters, it takes a little bit of time to reverse that trend. We have done a very good job of training our new salespeople. We have seen the productivity tick up slightly each quarter throughout fiscal '18.","And so the thing that will get us back to the Cintas like levels of growth will be a combination of those sales partners being more and more productive and our ability to penetrate the G&K customers like we do with all of our other Cintas customers.","So as we mentioned, we expect our first quarter organic growth to be somewhat similar, maybe slightly lower than what we reported here in this fourth quarter for our rental business.","But we expect to see some improvement as we then go through the year to the point where fiscal '20, I would expect, we'd be back to our historical like levels, barring any change in the macro environment.","George Tong","Got it. That's very helpful. And then on the topic of revenue synergies and cross-selling, I know it's still very early days. But can you provide a progress report on how cross-selling initiatives are progressing? And what, in your view, is the longer-term revenue opportunity from bundling?","Michael Hansen","Well, we are -- and I'll speak to our total business now, not just G&K. But we have opportunities. When we first sell a new account, we don't normally sell everything. And so we continue to look for ways and opportunities for our drivers, who we call SSRs or service sales reps.","Our SSRs and our salespeople, we look for opportunities for them to penetrate existing customers. And we're getting better at that, but we can always improve and especially when it comes to getting First Aid and Safety and fire into our uniform and facility services customers.","So we're continuing to work on ways to improve the efficiency there in the -- or while we are waiting for SAP to come. And once we get SAP, we do believe that, that will make the visibility for all of our people better, and this should allow us to improve that penetration even more.","George Tong","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is actually Greg dialing in. First, just wanted to hit on the G&K guided synergies. Can you talk to the buckets that are showing up in the $35 million or so synergies you expect to realize in '19? And then what are the other buckets that are going to be seen in year three and year four?","Michael Hansen","Sure. I think we've talked a lot about the 4 buckets in the past. And as we move into year two of that integration, I would expect that we will get more production synergies. We did a lot of that heavy work in fiscal '18, and we're still not quite as efficient as we want to be in our plans, but we're moving through that.","And I would expect that production is a big component. We will do a lot of route optimization. And while we have only just begun that, that's going to be the largest activity that we have going on in fiscal '19. So we'll start to see some of those routing benefits.","And when I talk about routing benefits, what I really mean is improved fuel utilization. We are not looking to eliminate routes. What we're really looking to do is make all of our routes more efficient and give them -- give our SSRs more time with our customers.","But that's going to be a big project, and there will be -- we will start to see some of that benefit. We have already gotten a lot of G&A benefits, and we still have some more to go. But that will be a lesser component in year 2 than the production impact.","And then we'll start to see some sourcing synergies, but I would expect more of those to be in that year 3 and 4. So thinking about that prioritization, I would expect production to be the largest piece followed then by those other 3 where we're touching now on the routing and the sourcing and also getting a little bit more incremental G&A.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to quickly ask how you guys are thinking about inflation pressures and what's embedded in guidance. And how you're thinking a rising labor and raw material cost backdrop, how you think about your ability to pass on that pricing to customers?","Michael Hansen","Well, when we think about the economy as we stand today and looking forward from today, we feel like it's a positive environment. The activities are good. Our team has been fairly successful in both selling new business and in penetrating. And so it's a positive environment. There are certainly those things that you mentioned that we're keeping our eyes on.","Certainly, the tariff uncertainty is a wildcard, and as we -- as I was mentioning a little bit earlier, the indirect pieces of those, we're keeping our eyes on, but again, it's a wildcard about how that'll impact us. From an energy perspective and fuel perspective, we have modeled that we will see about a 20 basis point increase in fuel in fiscal '19, and we're seeing that already in June in our prices at the pump.","And from a labor perspective, we certainly are starting to see the tightening of labor. It's not affecting us widespread, but it certainly is an impact. And we're keeping our eyes on how do we manage the best we can and be as efficient as we can. And one way to do that is to really work on our partner retention.","That is very important for us, and it certainly makes this tighter labor market easier to deal with if we can retain our current partners. That's very important to us. But those things are certainly starting to creep in. They are included in our guidance, but we're -- those are things to keep our eyes on.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. All very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just following up on that last question, it looks like cotton's gotten expensive again. Could you remind us -- you considered synthetics last time. You weathered the storm pretty well, though, when those prices increased a few years ago. Could you just remind us how maybe this time compares to last time and how you think about that?","Michael Hansen","Yes. I don't think we've seen the spikes that we saw last time quite yet, but in any event, cotton is something that just takes a long time to get into our P&L. When you think about the standard garment that we have, certainly, the fabric is a component of that.","A bigger component is the labor. And you also have things like trim and freight into our distribution centers. But certainly, the fabric is a component of that, and cotton is a component of that fabric. So when you break it all down, it's not a significant amount of the cost, but there is an impact.","But when we see these spikes, in order for it to impact our P&L, it's got to be a long time of that spike. In other words, it has to last through the production of our garments, the shipping of those into our distribution center, sitting in our DC for return, then getting out into our rental locations where it begins to amortize generally over 18 months.","So in that first month of shipping into the rental location, we see 1\/18 of the impact. So as you can imagine, that cotton has to spike and stay elevated for quite a while before it has a real meaningful impact, and we haven't seen any of it yet.","Scott Schneeberger","You guys have referenced that the low watermark for the organic growth progression is going to be in the first quarter. I don't know if you're comfortable getting into more detail, but just curious how it might compare to fourth quarter and kind of the cadence of next year.","Michael Hansen","Yes. I think it's going to be slightly -- from a -- I'm speaking from a rental perspective now. I think it's going to be lower than this fourth quarter, but then in the second quarter, should see a move upward and followed by the second half of the year that it's getting closer to the 5.5 to 6 level.","But we're a ways from there. I would expect, if the economy continues to perform like it is, I would expect that we should be near that top of that guidance that we gave, and that should play out quarter-by-quarter in the way I mentioned.","Scott Schneeberger","Appreciate that. One more similar question, kind of housekeeping. You talked about the full year tax rate guidance and that it would fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Any rules of thumb on any particular quarters that we should follow being above or below that just for the modeling purposes?","Michael Hansen","Yes. I think that's a good question, Scott. I would expect from an EPS quarter-to-quarter perspective, we're going to have -- I mentioned the change to our retirement policy and an increase in our stock-based compensation. We're going to see a good chunk of that in our first quarter, and so it's going to pressure our first quarter margins.","Because of that, we also get a benefit, a greater benefit on the tax side of things. So I expect that our first quarter tax rate will be quite lower than the remaining 3 quarters, all of which will probably be closer to that 24% like range.","Scott Schneeberger","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with RW Baird.","Andrew Wittmann","Thanks for taking my question, guys. I was just looking at the guidance, and it looks like bridging between EPS and revenue that somewhere in the low 16s is the EBIT margin assumption that you have implicit in your guidance. I guess, with the moving pieces of roughly $35 million of cost synergies that you're expecting this year, it does look like you're putting up some incremental margins.","But I was just wondering how you expect this year to play out versus your normal expectation for around 30% incremental EBIT margins. Is that what's implied here, Mike?","Michael Hansen","Implied from the low end to the high end is certainly margin improvement, operating margin improvement, and I would say, I think of it in -- a little bit higher than you had said. I think you had said in the low 16s, I would put it more in the mid-16s and at the high end, maybe even a little bit higher than that. So ex synergy, still some nice margin improvement at the top.","Now Andrew, we talk about 20% to 30% incremental margin, and clearly, with all of the integration and implementation work that we have, this is not a normal year. And I -- inclusive of all of that, that incremental is going to be a little bit different this year than we would normally think of.","When you think about incremental -- when you think about the inefficiencies of the implementation and the integration, when you think about a little bit of a higher energy number, it's not your normal incremental year certainly.","Andrew Wittmann","Got it. So just in terms of like the in-specific integration costs, if you will, like the things that you weren't able to back out, now that you're more than a year into owning G&K, does that become a slight tailwind as well because you're like not relabeling garments? Or is there still or maybe more of those types of costs that are in your guidance?","Michael Hansen","More of those types of costs are in the guidance. So when you -- I mentioned earlier that we're -- one of the heavy projects is the route optimization. So I'll give you an example of a market route optimization.","In a market where we've got Cintas facilities and G&K facilities that will remain open, we're going to take a look at all of the customers in that marketplace, and we are going to then take those customers in that marketplace and effectively reroute them to make all of our routes in that marketplace more efficient.","Now we are certainly cautious because the -- our goal through this process is to minimize the disruption to the customer. And so we always have to keep that in mind, but we will make those routes more efficient. And sometimes, that means moving the processing of certain customers from one location to the other.","And when we do that, that means we have to pull garments out of one location and transport them to the other location. That receiving location then has to rebarcode all of those garments, enter them into the system, and they have to do a little bit of that production integration all over again.","That's an important part of what we're doing. And we're going to be cautious about it because, again, we're not -- we want to make sure that we don't disrupt the customer or minimize that.","And again, we're not looking at a route reduction. We're looking at a route efficiency opportunity. But as you can imagine, moving those garments in between those facilities creates, again, the same kind of inefficiency that we talked about last year.","Andrew Wittmann","I wanted to ask one final question here, and that's just regarding kind of the revenue trends in the core rental segment, specifically, just getting some subjective comments from you on the level of sales force productivity, particularly those G&K folks who stayed with you that are now more accustomed to the suite of products and services that you're selling as well as get some sense from you about the level of retention that you're experiencing in your customer base today, any comments on add-stop? Or the level of no [ph] programs would also be welcome.","Michael Hansen","Let's see. That was a lot, Andrew. From the retention standpoint, look, we talked about it all year long and it's been better than we expected. And we are very, very pleased with that. Again, the legacy G&K business was a very good business. They took care of their customers well.","We've continued to do that, and we try to make that disruption of the integration as minimal as -- of a disruption as we can. And that has -- that's led to some real nice retention. From the legacy salespeople standpoint, look, we -- they have some very good selling skills.","It's just more a matter of making sure they understand our environment, our systems, our products and services and our expectations. And that can take a while to retrain and ramp up. But we like -- as I mentioned, we like the trend that we've seen in each quarter in fiscal '18, and we're encouraged by what we've seen and encouraged by the opportunity that we have moving forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi, thank you. I don't usually ask questions about M&A. But given some of the commentary you made about being more selective or opportunistic in share repurchases together with the significant capacity that you now have on the EBITDA side.","I was just wondering if -- when you are looking, and I'm sure you're paying more attention to deals that are coming your way, should we expect more of the same in terms of companies more in the uniform rental business? Doesn't seem like there's a ton at least in the first aid side or is there an adjacency or something that you guys are entertaining as well?","Michael Hansen","We would love to continue to be acquisitive in our rental business, in our First Aid and Safety and in our fire businesses. We like all of those opportunities, and we will have an opportunity to be more aggressive in fiscal '19 than we have been in the last few years.","And those acquisitions are important to us. Would we look for a different type of opportunity? It depends on the characteristics of the business. And it can -- can it help us continue to grow? And can our current customers take advantage of that new offering?","A lot of things that we would have to take into account and the value would have to be at the right place. Having said that, if those things do happen, we'll absolutely be aggressive in looking at it if we feel like it is the right opportunity.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So is there anything like particular out of the wheelhouse that you think would surprise us? Or really, hey, you feel like this as a company that wants to stick to its knitting and that's what we should expect?","Michael Hansen","Well, Shlomo, we -- when we think about our business, we think about the opportunity to create value to over 1 million businesses that we currently serve and many more that we don't currently serve. And that value can come in the way of image, safety, compliance.","And so there are a lot of different ways that we can provide benefits to businesses, and that also then allows us to kind of expand what we currently do, both in our current businesses and maybe then in some type of new offering.","In the past, we have moved from the rental business to a first aid to a fire to document management to deep cleaning. There have been opportunities, and we've taken advantage of those.","And again, if those kind of opportunities exist, we would certainly love them. I don't know if some of those kinds of services would be surprising to any of you. That I can't answer. But we're not satisfied with simply staying in our swim lanes and not being aggressive in terms of adding value to our customers and to other prospective customers.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi. Mike, looking back at the fourth quarter in terms of uniform rental organic revenue growth, could you tell us how G&K did versus the Cintas space? And did the upside in rental revenue growth come from G&K better than expected or the Cintas space?","Michael Hansen","Andrew, it's really hard to pull it apart, but our expectation was that we certainly still did see shrinkage in that G&K base but likely a little better just based on the top line, likely a little bit better than we had expected.","I would say more of the beat of our guidance was our legacy business, and that's operating very, very well even in the midst of lots of moving parts within those locations because of the integration. I can't give you a specific number though, Andrew.","Andrew Steinerman","So did you think that G&K declines narrowed from the third quarter declines? Because you did give us third quarter declines of mid-single digits.","Michael Hansen","Yes, I would say if I had to -- I am guessing. I would say it's fairly similar to that third quarter number.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.","Tim Mulrooney","Good afternoon. Can you guys hear me okay?","Michael Hansen","Yes, I can.","Tim Mulrooney","Hi. Just a couple of questions here. So with non-pharma employment continuing to grow, I'm sure you guys are benefiting from that to a degree. In thinking about new customer growth, are there any areas, other end markets or regions where you see particular strength?","Michael Hansen","Well, we -- first of all, I would say it's been broadly a positive environment. But we talk a lot about health care in the last few years, and health care remains an exciting opportunity for us for many of our products and services.","And that industry vertical continues to grow at very good levels. But I would say, generally, Tim, it's been a fairly broad performance, and we're real pleased with it.","Tim Mulrooney","Okay. Thanks. And then on a dollar basis, can you share with us how much acquisitions added to both the uniform rental and other segments in the quarter?","Michael Hansen","Let's see. From a dollar perspective, in the quarter, it's, let's call, at about $53 million for rental and a very small number for the others, less than $5 million, only really a couple million dollars.","Tim Mulrooney","Got it, okay. And then with SAP, you've converted 34% of the base so far with plans to be complete in fiscal 2020. Where do you guys expect to be by the end of 2019 if you're willing to share?","Michael Hansen","We've got a lot of moving pieces, and I would say we're going to make significant progress. But I don't have a schedule in front of me, and I don't know that I'm -- I want to get to that level of specificity just simply because it changes quite often. It changes based on what we've got going on in each market from an integration standpoint, from a customer perspective.","And as I mentioned a few times, our goal is to minimize customer disruption. And so that might mean moving a little bit from one market to another. So it's hard to pinpoint that, and I'd rather not.","Paul Adler","But Tim, I guess, I would add from like a modeling perspective, like we don't anticipate that in fiscal '19, the SAP expenses, anything much different than fiscal '18, so we don't expect the expense to be a headwind.","Tim Mulrooney","Okay, that's essentially what I was looking for. Two more quick housekeeping ones, guys, number one, the change to the retirement policy. Did you say higher stock comp would impact by $15 million to $20 million in 2019?","Michael Hansen","I said $20 million roughly.","Tim Mulrooney","Roughly $20 million. And you said that a big piece of that, Mike, might hit in the -- will hit in the first quarter. How should I think about modeling that? Is it most of it in the first quarter? Half? Any detail would be helpful?","Michael Hansen","I'm not -- I don't want to get into the very specific level. I don't have it in front of me nor do I want to get into that level of detail. But in our first quarter, we are generally wrapping up our fiscal -- our prior fiscal year compensation plans.","And so that's generally when we provide the grants. And because of that, that is when a lot of the activity happens. But I can't get into the level of detail, that level of detail that you want.","Tim Mulrooney","No, that's still helpful. One last one. Did you say shares outstanding of 114 million in 2019?","Michael Hansen","We did, yes.","Tim Mulrooney","So you were at 111 million at the end of the fourth quarter. Is that increase related to the change in the retirement policy? And then if you -- could you share the cadence of how should we think about that through the year?","Michael Hansen","We were over 111.5 million. We're modeling a little bit higher. Tim, when our stock performs as well as it does, the effect of diluted securities really starts to rise. And while there aren't additional shares out there, the effect of those securities increases. So that's why we're seeing that number at that 114 million level.","Operator","All right, gentlemen, there are currently no further questions in the queue.","Michael Hansen","Okay. Thank you very much, and we will be with you at the -- near the end of September for our first quarter results. But thank you for joining us, and have a great rest of your summer.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference, and you may now disconnect."],"5430":["Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) Q4 2012 Earnings Call July 16, 2012  5:00 PM ET","Executives","William C.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","William C. Gale","Good evening. Thank you for joining us as we report our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2012. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results and our fiscal 2013 guidance, we will be happy to answer questions.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","We are pleased to report record fourth quarter revenue of $1,054,000,000. In an increasingly sluggish U.S. economy, fourth quarter revenue grew 4.1% from last year's fourth quarter. Fourth quarter net income increased by 11.1% to $79 million, and earnings per diluted share were $0.60, a 22.4% increase over last year. Mike will provide more details shortly on the fourth quarter performance.","This fourth quarter concluded a very successful fiscal 2012 year for Cintas in which our revenue topped the $4 billion mark for the first time at $4,102,000,000 and our earnings per diluted share hit a record level of $2.27. Our employees, who we call partners, did a great job of executing our game plan throughout this past 12 months. Congratulations to our partners on their achievements this year.","We remain confident in our business' opportunities and our ability to execute our game plan. As such, during our fourth quarter, we purchased 3.3 million shares of Cintas stock at an aggregate cost of $129.6 million. Since these purchases were made so late in the fiscal year, they had no impact on our fourth quarter results. However, we expect it will positively increase fiscal 2013 earnings per diluted share by about $0.06. This impact is incorporated into our fiscal 2013 guidance. Our board authorized a $500 million share buyback program in October 2011, so we now have $370.4 million remaining of that authorization.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on the fourth quarter, after which I will provide additional comments on our fiscal 2013 guidance.","J. Michael Hansen","Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 4.1% from the fourth quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 4%. Total company gross margin for the fourth quarter was 42.1%, which is down from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 42.8% mainly due to lower recycled paper prices. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment. Before doing so, please let me remind you that there are 66 workdays in our fourth quarter, which was the same as last year. Looking forward to fiscal 2013, our workdays will be as follows: 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 64 workdays in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in fiscal 2013 will be 261, which is one less than fiscal 2012. The difference occurs in the third quarter, where there were 65 workdays in fiscal 2012. The one less workday in fiscal 2013 will negatively impact fiscal 2013 total revenue growth by about 40 basis points.","We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement. The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the fourth quarter.","Within Rental, based on fourth quarter revenue levels, uniform rental accounted for approximately 52% of the revenue; dust control, which is mainly entrance mats, accounted for 19%; hygiene and other services, which is restroom supply, cleaning services and chemical services, was 16%; shop towel revenue was 5%; and linen and other, which is mainly nonperson-specific garments, such as aprons and butcher coats, was 8%.","Fourth quarter rental revenue was $749 million, which is up 5.2% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was also 5.2%. Growth continued to come in the form of new business, and sales rep productivity continued to be good. However, just as we have seen worsening trends in U.S. employment and in the general U.S. economy, our net add\/stops trending worsened throughout the quarter. This worsening trend contributed to a slowing of the revenue growth rate from 6.5% organic growth in our third quarter.","Our Rental segment gross margin was 43.3% for the fourth quarter, a 30-basis-point decrease from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 43.6%. Energy-related costs were down 50 basis points compared to last year's fourth quarter. This benefit, though, was offset by an increase in material costs due to the high level of new business during the year, as well as the expected higher cotton impact. The worsening trend of net add\/stops resulted in a greater percentage of revenue coming from new business, which requires injection of new inventory.","Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenue of $111.2 million represents an increase of 2% compared to last year's fourth quarter. There were no acquisitions in this segment.","Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 30.7% for the fourth quarter, which is down slightly from last year's fourth quarter gross margin of 30.9%. The gross margin of 30.7% was a slight improvement over the third quarter gross margin of 30.5%. This segment's gross margin can move from quarter-to-quarter due to changes in mix of product and timing of program rollouts.","Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the fourth quarter. Revenue was $108.9 million, an increase of 9.3% versus last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 9%. This segment had a very good fiscal year, growing 10.1% and topping $400 million for the full fiscal year.","This segment's gross margin was 42.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 41.7% in last year's fourth quarter. Energy-related expenses were 20 basis points lower this year compared to last year. In addition, improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes continue to drive the gross margin expansion.","Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of fourth quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue decreased 8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Revenue decreased organically by 8.2% compared to last year.","Our Document Management fourth quarter performance was adversely affected by 3 things. First, the recycled paper prices stayed at roughly $150 per ton during the quarter. This resulted in a decrease of over 30% compared to last year's fourth quarter. This lower price negatively impacted revenue for the quarter by $7.4 million, and this impact also directly affects the gross margin and operating margin of the business. Bill will discuss our fiscal 2013 recycled paper price assumptions in his guidance discussion.","The second item to negatively affect performance was continuing difficulty in Europe. We have made operational and efficiency improvements in our businesses during this fiscal year, but revenue growth in the current environment is a challenge.","And the third item to negatively affect fourth quarter results is the performance of our imaging business. The imaging business is largely a project business, and last year's fourth quarter benefited from several large onetime projects that did not reoccur this year.","Despite the challenges of lower recycled paper prices, we continue to be pleased with the North American document shredding side of the business. We continue to move forward with our game plan of managing the business for the long-term benefit of our customers, selling profitable business and creating efficiencies from off-site shredding opportunities and from process improvements. Since the impact of lower recycled paper prices falls directly to the bottom line, the Document Management gross margin dropped to 46.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 51.4% in last year's fourth quarter.","Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 28.8% as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter. This is an improvement from last year's fourth quarter of 30.1%. This 130-basis-point improvement from last year is due largely to managing our cost structure while continuing to grow revenue. Fourth quarter selling and administrative expenses of 28.8% of revenue were higher than the 28.5% in this year's third quarter due to a 50-basis-point increase in the cost of providing medical benefits to our employees.","Our effective tax rate was 36.2% for the quarter compared to 39.5% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. For the full fiscal year, our effective tax rate was 36.8%, which is slightly lower than our expected rate of 37% due to the resolution of federal audits of our fiscal 2009 and 2010 years.","Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash balance was $340 million at May 31, down $13 million from the $353 million in cash and marketable securities at February 29 primarily due to the share buyback of $130 million during the fourth quarter. Included in the $340 million at May 31 was $52 million of cash located outside of the U.S. During the fourth quarter, we took advantage of a onetime opportunity to bring $110 million back into the U.S.","Accounts receivable increased by $11 million since February 29. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, which is the same as at February 29. New goods inventory at May 31 was $251 million, down $25 million from February 29. This decrease was expected as the relatively high levels of the past year due to the SAP conversion normalized. Accrued liabilities increased $33 million compared to February 29 primarily due to higher accrued bond interest and higher accrued profit sharing.","Long-term debt at May 31 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We repaid $225 million of 6%, 10-year debt that matured on June 1, 2012. And we issued new 10-year debt on June 5 with a coupon of 3.25%. We issued the new debt due to the attractiveness of the interest rate levels. As of May 31, our total debt-to-EBITDA is slightly below 2x.","Moving on to cash flow, cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was $162 million, which is up from last year's fourth quarter amount of $133 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in inventory during this year's fourth quarter added to the improvement over last year.","CapEx for the fourth quarter was $43.1 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $31.2 million in Rental; $1.6 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $2.7 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $7.6 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2013 to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million. I'll now turn the call back over to Bill for comments on our fiscal 2013 guidance.","William C. Gale","Thanks, Mike. Our fiscal 2013 guidance is for revenue to be in the range of $4.25 billion to $4.35 billion and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.47 to $2.55.","Let me walk through a few assumptions so you can better understand the guidance. This guidance certainly considers the current economic climate, which is not healthy. We have had 3 consecutive months of poor job creation. In fact, only 225,000 jobs were created in that time, about half of which were professional and administrative positions. The Institute for Supply Management indicated in June that exports fell and new factory orders dropped at the fastest pace since 2001. We've seen numerous U.S. GDP forecasts that show growth of less than 2% during the next 18 months. As Mike mentioned, our net add\/stops trending worsened during the -- our fourth quarter, a reflection of our customers' concern and uncertainty at this time. Clearly, there is little momentum in the economy.","Despite this lack of momentum, though, we remain encouraged by our business' performance and continue to expect our revenue to grow organically in the mid-single digits in this type of environment. As we have discussed on the last few calls, recycled paper prices have been quite a headwind during the last 2 quarters. We expect it to remain this way for the next 2 quarters. We have assumed that recycled paper prices increase about $10 per ton each quarter in fiscal 2013 from the $150 a ton level at May 31. Last year's first quarter average price was roughly $275 per ton, and the second quarter average price was roughly $225 per ton. Keep in mind that this pricing difference impacts both revenues -- both revenue and falls directly to operating income. Our energy-related expenses for fiscal 2012 were roughly 3.3% of sales. Our guidance assumes that fiscal 2013 energy-related expenses remain at this level.","We recently issued $250 million of 10-year debt with a 3.25% coupon that essentially replaced the $225 million of debt that matured on June 1. Including all fees and the impacts of interest rate locks, this new debt will reduce overall interest expense by about $3.5 million. However, much of this benefit will be offset by a higher effective tax rate. We expect our fiscal 2013 effective rate to be 37.3%, which is higher than the 36.8% in fiscal 2012. As Mike discussed, the fiscal 2012 effective rate benefited from the resolution of audits.","And finally, keep in mind that the guidance incorporates the share buybacks from our fourth quarter but does not contemplate any additional buybacks. As I mentioned earlier, this will benefit fiscal 2013 earnings per share by approximately $0.06. Hopefully, this additional color adds perspective to our guidance. With that, we will now be glad to take any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Samford with Citi.","James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a couple of questions on the guidance. It looks like you're still guiding to margin expansion for next year, if I back into it, of roughly 40 to 50 basis points. Just trying to understand, how much of that is a function of increasing paper prices that you sort of built in there? And what gives you confidence that paper prices can be up $10 per quarter going forward?","J. Michael Hansen","Well the -- James, if you take a look at that, the guidance for our paper prices were actually -- including guidance, that would be a 13% -- almost a 13% reduction in year-over-year paper prices. So that -- our guidance assumes about an average of $175 per ton, and fiscal '12 was about $200. So we will see a negative impact for the full year. That will certainly be front-end loaded. The first 2 quarters, as Bill mentioned, will be negatively affected by paper. And in the back half of the year, we should see a small benefit. And we're basing this assumption on talking with our partners in the industry and other people who are familiar with the paper.","William C. Gale","But with that said, James, our margins are anticipated to expand overall in the company primarily as a result of the improved margins in the Rental, First Aid and Safety and Uniform Direct Sale divisions but just being offset by the Document Management segment.","James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. And I guess on that Rental piece, are you assuming some sort of return to normalcy or at least some hiring occurring? Or is that still taking into account an increasing mix of new versus the additional new wearers from existing accounts?","William C. Gale","We're actually continuing to expect most of that growth primarily coming from new business. We do not expect to see much growth in our existing customers' headcount.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you talk about what you're seeing in Uniform Direct Sales? The year-over-year growth rate slowed in the fourth quarter and I'm wondering what the tone of your client base is there.","William C. Gale","Sara, the growth rate was lower, as you point out. But that segment, we've always said, will grow over time in the mid-single digits. So if I could remind you, last year, the growth rate was over 8%. This year, it's a little around 3%. Therefore, it's not unusual for that to fluctuate. We have not seen a lot of, I guess, communication from customers indicating any big concern in the environment. But on the other hand, as a result of lack of orders in the quarter, I would say they're being cautious just pending the outcome of what's going to happen in the economy.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then within the guidance for next year, how are you thinking about SG&A? You've gotten great leverage recently.","William C. Gale","We're seeing SG&A being approximately at the same levels that we saw this year.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On a dollar basis?","William C. Gale","On a percent of sales basis. It did increase in dollars, but percent of sales should be roughly the same levels.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then if you could just provide us with the ending share count at the end of the year, that would be great.","William C. Gale","Yes, it's on the face of the balance sheet. And if you'd just give me a second, I can...","J. Michael Hansen","126,000,519 is the outstanding -- that's the outstanding shares at May 31.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the Rental segment, just kind of talking about the amount of new business that's out there and the pricing for these new customers, how maybe that's changed here over the last couple of months or quarters, if at all.","J. Michael Hansen","I would say that pricing, while it hasn't changed much in -- from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, remains competitive. And we're seeing our competitors be very aggressive, particularly at national account levels.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Just digging more in the Rental segment, by some of the end markets that you break out here annually, it looks like there was a pretty material step up in the hygiene segment. It also looks like the core uniform rental portion of the core segment was also up just modestly. Is that the right way to think about it? Is that, first of all, accurate? And then second of all, can you just talk about the traction you're getting in the hygiene segment there and kind of what your outlook is for what appears to be outsized growth there for the year ahead?","J. Michael Hansen","Andrew, the hygiene number includes some of our newer products and services, like our chemical services and tile and carpet. And so we're getting a boost by some of our newer products and services in that hygiene bucket. And we continue to be very pleased with the rollouts of those items and continue to expect very good growth in those. The uniform rental had a very good year. We saw some great performance in our fire-resistant clothing line. We also saw very good performance in other lines like our women's wear, and our Carhartt continues to perform well. So we did see a very good year out of uniform rental.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. I guess maybe one final question on the Document side. There's been some talk in the industry that there's maybe a modest expectation of enhanced M&A activity. Just wanted to get your thoughts on are you seeing that? And do you expect that segment is probably more active than maybe other segments for you in terms of potential M&A?","William C. Gale","I would say it is more active than other segments at this point, but I am not really sure that the expectations of sellers and buyers have yet reached the level to generate a lot of dealmaking.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And any change in terms of the way you're thinking about that business? Are you still very, very focused on the shredding side? Or are you becoming increasingly open to the storage business maybe?","William C. Gale","I would say we're primarily continuing to focus on the shredding side. The storage side is less attractive to us.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","No change, it sounds like.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can I just follow up on the guidance? Of the mid-single digit growth that you guys are expecting, can you maybe just give us a sense of where you expect this to come from relative to your different businesses?","William C. Gale","Well, our expectation is all the businesses will grow. Even the Document Management business will grow on the service side, albeit at relatively modest rates due to the economy. The Document Management, though, will still have the headwind, as Mike mentioned, on the paper prices. So if you pull out the change in paper price, you'll see growth in the service side of the business. But none of the businesses are expected at this time to grow robustly because of the economic environment that we anticipate will be in place now for the next 9 to 12 months.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And can you just maybe give us a little bit more color on the end markets that drove the add\/quit metric into the negative territory for the quarter? And then maybe highlight some areas where you're actually seeing some positive momentum?","William C. Gale","Well, the positive momentum is primarily coming in the energy sector from a lot of the oil and gas exploration that's going on in this country, and we're servicing many big customers there. So there -- that's the positive side. I would say the deterioration in the add\/stop ratio was really outside the energy industry, everywhere else. There was really no one area that's causing it. I just think you have seen a real pullback on the part of","[Audio Gap]","continue to be a focus of ours going forward.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","What was the Document Management organic growth excluding the recycled paper? Did that dip negative this quarter because of those other 2 things you mentioned? Or was that positive?","J. Michael Hansen","It was about 1%, Gary. So it did not dip negative. But it certainly continues to be affected by the European economic environment and, in this case, in the fourth quarter, the imaging projects.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","How do the imaging comps look over the next couple of quarters? Is that one-off a year ago? Or is that likely to be an area that just economic weakness will hurt demand for a while?","J. Michael Hansen","Well, it's difficult to predict. We're actively pursuing opportunities. We would like to focus on more recurring-type revenue. We've had some success with that with some companies. But we certainly will also take advantage of projects as they come about. Most of our project work had -- a lot of it had come from the banking side. We continue to think that we've established a strong reputation in this area and that we'll continue to look for those projects. We just are having difficulty predicting exactly when they will come, but I know our salespeople are actively pursuing several things right now.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then how much of the cautious tone that you're giving around the guidance is impact that you're already actually seeing in the business versus feeling it's prudent to take a cautious tone? I hear you on the add\/stops, but that was never a big driver of the revenue growth acceleration, as I understand it, over the last year or so. It was much more new business was getting better as opposed to existing customers adding products and employees. So are there other signs than that? Is it getting tougher to sell new business? Or is a lot of this just cautiousness because you're reading the tea leaves of all the data having weakened?","William C. Gale","Well, I'd say it's a combination of both. But certainly, we're reading the tea leaves and looking at things. But we saw a trend in our fourth quarter that caused us to have some concern on the overall economic environment. And as a result of the -- yes, the add\/stop ratio going negative is not as significant, but we also see the caution just in the economy on doing anything. So as a result of that, that's why we felt it prudent to basically give guidance that we think is achievable, and we'll certainly adjust it upward if we prove to be a little too conservative as we move through the year.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just can you -- you had commented a year ago or so that cotton prices would remain a headwind in fiscal '13. Given the pullback there, is that still the right way to think about the gross margin? Or is it likely to be more of a push and maybe even a positive later in the year?","J. Michael Hansen","Yes, Gary, we expect that it will continue to be a slight headwind for the first half of fiscal '13, after which we may start to see a bit of a benefit. But keep in mind, that moves very slowly as we amortize.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right, okay. And then just last question. Does a weaker economy in your mind mean that M&A would be -- there'd be more opportunities? Or have you historically seen more that people don't want to sell when they feel like things are getting a little more difficult? I ask mostly just because with the -- a quarter ago, I think you said you were optimistic that maybe the environment was filling out a bit, and certainly you're very well capitalized to pursue something.","J. Michael Hansen","Gary, I think there's 2 factors here that I think will be interesting to see how they play out. One is, yes, in a deteriorating environment, some of the people who were interested in selling their businesses are seeing top line reductions and, therefore, they feel like they can't get as much value for their business. So they might tend to hold out until things get better again. At least that's what we saw in the last couple of recessions. So that would say there'd be less M&A. On the other hand, I don't know what people's expectations are with regard to the change in the tax laws and how that will play out. But there certainly would be some benefit of people wanting to sell now before the end of the calendar year based on what seems to be the prevailing opinion of what's going to happen with tax rates.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","To go over Rental gross margins again in the quarter, it sounded like merchandise amortization, which includes a cotton contribution there, was a larger drag than the energy benefit in that to minus 30. Was there anything else that influenced the Rental gross margin? And then my question is for fiscal year 2013, since you expect the mid-single digit growth to be primarily driven by new business, so what does that mean that Rental gross margin will be down for 2013 with that assumption?","J. Michael Hansen","Well, in the fourth quarter, the energy impact and the material cost movement generally offset each other. It was pretty close. And there were a couple of other things, very minor. But generally speaking, it was material cost that was moving towards the negative. Going into fiscal '13, if we continue to see new business as the driver, then we would expect that material costs may continue to be a bit of a headwind. Our challenge will be, can we offset that with operational improvements and routing improvements like we have over much of the last couple of years?","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And so in your guidance assumption, are you expecting Rental gross margin to be down? Or do you expect that you could offset it and it could be closer to flat?","William C. Gale","Well, with the range of guidance, I would tell you that it's probably a little bit of both. I mean, we're -- we got a range there, and if -- depending on what happens with our assumptions that we've made on new business versus growth in existing accounts, the material costs that Mike mentioned, energy, I think you're going to see either a slight reduction in gross margins or a slight improvement in gross margins depending on what happens.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Healy with Northcoast Research.","John M. Healy - Northcoast Research","Bill, I want to ask you a little bit more about the paper prices. To the degree that those move in the spot market, is there a lag in terms of how they impact your P&L? And is there any sort of hedging or in terms of contract price that you guys get from buyers out there? And have you used contracts in the past? And has the -- if you have, has that changed materially in terms of the price points and then whether it impacts your business?","William C. Gale","Our contracts with the companies that we sell our paper to basically are all pegged. The price we receive is all pegged off the spot price. So generally, we receive what the spot price is plus whatever contract premium that we have negotiated. We've been with contracts with the paper consumers for some time. So that's nothing new for us. We continue to do that. As far as hedging, we've looked -- we're looking at it. We have looked at it. To date, we have not determined that it was beneficial for us to do so, but we'll continue to evaluate it. It is not a very robust hedging market. But as a result of that, you're really taking more of a gamble than really hedging anything based on what we're seeing so far. But we continue to evaluate it, and we've got some potential opportunities to do so with parties outside the U.S. and we're looking at those.","John M. Healy - Northcoast Research","And then I wanted to ask from an M&A perspective. When you guys look at returns on capital or returns on the business, what business unit, whether it's the uniform business or the Document Management business, do you think you get the best returns on in terms of the deals you look at? And where are the most -- what business has a better synergistic value to you in terms of deploying -- maybe looking at some M&A deals?","William C. Gale","I would say, well, our criteria for evaluating an M&A opportunity, we have the same basic expectations regardless of the business unit. So we're not going to take necessarily a lower return on one unit versus another. As far as synergies, it so much depends, John, on the nature of where the customers are coming from, the size of the customers. If we have a deal whereby we have capacity in existing facilities in a region and we buy a local competitor that perhaps serves multiple cities, we can get a lot of synergies because we can deploy that new volume pretty easily in multiple facilities. The more concentrated the volume is that we get, the more likely it'll take a little longer to get those synergies because we'll have to maybe build some capacity or take over their capacity and then bring it up to our standards. So I would tell you, though, we really believe that when we use M&A capital, our shareholders are expecting a certain return. And by and large, we stick to those requirements regardless of the business unit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I want to focus a little bit more on the paper and shredding business. Usually, the market dynamics are when you have a collapse in the paper prices, that the actual price that you are able to charge your customers for the shredding, at some point in time, you should be able to go up in the smaller competitors that are giving away the services in order to get the commodity paper start to pull out of the market. Are you starting to see that happen and that was contributing to your expectation in the increase in paper prices during next year?","J. Michael Hansen","We're starting to see a little bit of that. We've had some price increases that we've been able to institute, and they have stuck. I think there's a couple of other dynamics that are going on in the industry, though, that may be unique. We've got a couple of large players that perhaps are not as committed long term to the business based on some recent items that they've been involved with. So I'd say that there's a little disruption due to that. I think also that the time frame -- it takes a little longer for that dynamic to work through, Shlomo, where you'll see prices really balance themselves out. I think we're still a little early in the process. When we gave guidance back in March for our fourth quarter, I think several people thought that we were being overly conservative with what we thought the paper price was going to be. So the expectation in the market was that it was going to increase a little quicker. Well, it didn't turn out to do so, at least through our fourth quarter. We've seen some improvement here in June and July. So perhaps, the paper price will start rising a little bit, and that will perhaps temper people's willingness to raise their service price until they see what really shakes out.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So the sequential $10 a ton that you're expecting through the year, you say you talked to people in the industry, what exactly is it based on? Is it based on the fact that you're already getting some pricing lift? I mean, can you just give us some color on that?","William C. Gale","Well, I think it's an estimate or prediction of demand primarily from overseas. When the demand's going to come, when it's going to pick up, that's what's going to increase the price. And that's what we're hearing from the various brokers, that there is a lot of talk that the demand will be picking up as the year progresses, thus increasing the price.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then last quarter, you guys talked a little bit about rep turnover was normalizing. And has that continued? Or has the trend towards more normalized rep turnover kind of slowed down with the economy slowing down?","William C. Gale","No, it's basically been about the same level. It certainly is worse than what we were seeing in '11, but it didn't get any worse nor much better than where we saw in the third quarter. The difference in the fourth quarter is that we were able to replace some of those turned reps that we had in the third quarter and the normal rep turnover that happened in the fourth. So our actual headcount on sales reps was higher at the end of the fiscal year than it was at the end of our third quarter, which positions us better going into this current year for new business growth.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","How much time do the new reps that replaced the ones that were leaving -- how long does it take till they -- you believe that they're fully productive? Is it 9 months? Is it 12 months? What is it?","William C. Gale","Yes, 9 to 12 months is generally the time frame it takes for a new rep to get up to average productivity.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then on the more competitive pricing on rentals in national accounts, this seems to me to be kind of a change in tone from the last few quarters when in general, you guys were talking about a little more stability in the marketplace from the competitors. Is this a factor of the competitors looking at cotton pricing coming down and saying, oh, we're going to start to get more profitability, we can become more aggressive? I mean, what do you attribute this to?","J. Michael Hansen","Shlomo, neither Mike nor I really recall a difference in our commentary. I apologize if we left that impression. I thought we had been saying that pricing had stabilized except on large national accounts where we continue to see aggressiveness on the part of several big players. I'd say we certainly saw an improvement in the pricing environment from fiscal '10 and '11, but I'd say it's always been very competitive and the national account business is very much sought after by several of the large players.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So just to make sure I understand then, there is no change and it has been competitive and it remains competitive in the large national accounts?","William C. Gale","Yes, it does, yes. It remains ...","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And what about the accounts outside of those large national accounts where you guys were noting through last year that there was more stability? Has that remained the same?","William C. Gale","It has remained the same. There has been no improvement but no real deterioration either recently.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just following up on the last question with regard to rep turnover. So I guess interesting time in a fiscal year end. Could you update us, just going back to projects won and I don't recall how many years ago that was but just what you've seen over the past, I guess, 2 or 3 years now that you've gone through that transition, what's different, what worked, what didn't out of that?","William C. Gale","Well, I think it's worked very well in that we've got a cohesive sales group now that works together well, is not siloed by business unit, is under one management structure. And so I think that has been a big success. The turnover rate that we talked about was really more due to the economy. We have very attractive, trained sales reps that are of interest to other industries. And therefore, that's what caused that turnover. But I thought -- but I think what we have been able to at least accomplish is stem the turnover in that there is no further increase in it and we've been successful in replacing some of those turned reps, especially in the fourth quarter.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Shifting up a bit. In an earlier question, you mentioned energy industry and exploration as a boost. I think the scope of that question was on add\/stop. I assume you're seeing a lot of activity in new there as well. And I'm just curious. And I think you touched on this, but I wanted to be clear. It sounded like that's one of the only end markets that's really producing. I'm just curious, within the guidance, is it a maintained level? Is it an increased level? You had mentioned you weren't sure what the forward persistence would be, but I'm just curious how you think about it within the guidance.","William C. Gale","I think we'll see energy continuing to be one of the positive spots in the U.S. economy and the Canadian economy. I mean, it's up -- going on up there, too, and we're participating in that. I would say that the level is not a significant increase in the headcount. It's just that as you have more exploration and frac-ing going on, more companies are doing it. And therefore, it's not necessarily adding to an existing operation but rather just increase in number of locations where this energy exploration is occurring. So we being the largest provider of FRC garments in the country and in -- I think we will participate as that segment of the economy continues to do well.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And just for clarification, I think it's probably obvious. But curious, maybe it's hitting something of which we're not aware, is that predominantly just uniform rental, Carhartt? Or are you -- is oil and gas exploration helping in other areas of the business as well?","William C. Gale","Well, it's probably helping in our First Aid and Safety business also. Is that what you mean?","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Yes, yes. Just -- yes, I mean...","William C. Gale","Yes, I think there's some benefit we'll get from that side, from that industry and that business also.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And one more from me real quick. On cash availability, for any type of transaction, could you update us where -- what is abroad, what is domestic as far as cash balances?","William C. Gale","I think Mike mentioned in the comments that we have about $50 million now outside the U.S. So the remainder of the cash is here in the U.S. We still have access to the debt markets. We have significant capacity available to us should a transaction make sense. We've got a untapped commercial paper line of credit. And so I would say that we would have no problem making a big deal if it makes sense for us.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Wanted to kind of just ask a little bit. Obviously, we can clearly see with the add\/stop metric kind of declining here sequentially over the last couple of months in line with the general macro numbers. But just wondering, in terms of your conversations with your customers, whether they're still kind of upbeat potentially on their business opportunities but just are really reluctant to do anything right now and backing on certain environment, or whether it's gotten really a lot more pessimistic than that in just kind of the general conversations you're having.","William C. Gale","Nate, I have to be honest, I don't have many conversations with our customers. You talk to our operating \u2026","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Well, with the salespeople.","William C. Gale","Yes, well, I haven't specifically asked that question. I would tell you the tone that I hear is more one of caution, and I think there's just a lot of uncertainty right now. And until that gets resolved, I'm not sure we're going to see much activity.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then if things did get a little bit worse, and this just as a kind of a pause and caution but there's an underlying current of some broader issues at work, are there more levers that you have left in your firepower on the cost side after doing such a great job during the downturn of really kind of making your overall business a lot more efficient?","William C. Gale","I think every company always has some things that can be done depending on what the circumstances are. I think you -- we have continued to operate at headcount levels that are significantly below where we were at the peak even though our revenues now exceed where we were previous. So we've gained a lot of efficiencies in our operations. But if there were another significant recession and the loss of a lot of revenue, we would have to take another look at how we do things and see if we could even make more efficiencies. So I think it's incumbent upon all management to always be ready to adjust depending on what the environment is.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","I don't know if I heard an estimate for your capital spending or your plans there for fiscal '13.","J. Michael Hansen","Our CapEx, we expect to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","That sounds like a decent uptick from the $161 million for this -- or fiscal '12. Anything specific in there?","William C. Gale","We had a few -- we actually thought we'd spend a little bit more in fiscal '12, and we've now moved a few things into fiscal '13. So that's our expectation is, is that really, it's just a little delay of some things that we were going to do that now we're going to do in '13.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","All right. And you had commented with the new debt where your interest expense should be about $3.5 million lower, and I presume that's over the full year fiscal '12. And is that net interest expense? Or is that broken out just by the interest expense, not factoring in the -- any interest income?","William C. Gale","Yes, well, there's basically hardly any income. I don't think we -- you've got any good investment safe, we'll look at it. That's the reduction in the interest expense or interest cash outlay in fiscal '13 versus what we had in '12.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","All right. And for the quarter, you had $18.3 million in interest expense. For the prior 3 quarters, it was in the $17 million range, and I'm just wondering why the step-up in the quarter. Were there some kind of fees associated with the...","J. Michael Hansen","Well, in the fourth quarter, the only difference was we had an extra day of accruing. So otherwise, nothing.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Okay. And the figures you gave on the dust control and hygiene and shop towels and linens and so forth, was that for the quarter or for the full year?","J. Michael Hansen","That was for the quarter.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Do you have those for the full year?","J. Michael Hansen","No. We have -- in the last couple of years, we've been updating based on fourth quarter levels. And so we've not provided the full year.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Okay. Similar question but relative to your vertical markets served for fiscal '12. Would you have those available or at least maybe the top couple?","J. Michael Hansen","We have not provided that other than to say we don't have any verticals that account for more than 10% of our business. So we've got a pretty spread -- a pretty diverse customer base.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","And that would be like the car parts or car repair would probably be one of the largest?","William C. Gale","Automotive certainly is one of our larger verticals. Hospitality is a big vertical for us. Health care is becoming a larger vertical for us, and it certainly is an area of focus. Specialty trade contractor-type is a good vertical for us, maintenance-type positions.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Okay, that's helpful. And when I do a calculation on your net income divided by the diluted share count, I get $0.61 or $0.609 for the quarter and $2.29 for the year. Can you explain the difference there?","J. Michael Hansen","You have to take into account the participating securities. So a couple of years ago, some new accounting guidance came out that requires an adjusted EPS calculation to incorporate the impact of participating securities like restricted shares. If you went to our Q for the third quarter and looked at our EPS footnote, you'd see the calculation that I'm talking about. So we have to essentially allocate some of our net income to those participating securities.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Okay. And one last one. We've noticed that Uniforms To You has opened up a second retail store in the Chicago area, and just wondering what the prospects are for that particular area, if you want to call it that, to expand in other parts of the country.","William C. Gale","No. No plans to do that, Greg. But that store was basically part of the original company that we purchased. It was under a different name there. They've reopened it now to service the North Side of Chicago, but it's very small. It's just locally driven and it's really just more of a legacy from the old company that was bought. We have no intention at this point of rolling out any retail operations anywhere else in the country or expand in Chicago beyond the 2 we already have.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel Nicolaus.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a few stragglers here. Just you talked about oil being a kind of a bright spot out there. Do you have a -- can you give us any sense as to how big the oil industry is for you guys?","William C. Gale","Shlomo, I don't have that at this point. We'll look into it and see if we can provide it as part of our overall review of what we have by industry.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, I'm just trying to get a sense. Does it stand out because it's large? Or does it stand out because it's the only one that's doing well?","William C. Gale","I'd say the latter. Not so much that it's large. It's one of the only bright spots in the economy.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then can you remind us, as of the last quarter, how big is Europe as a percentage of revenue? And is it primarily all in the Document Management area?","William C. Gale","It is all Document Management, primarily storage and imaging. And it's about 1% of our overall revenue.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Samford with Citi.","James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'll make this a quick one. If I just take some of your mix in the uniform rental segment, it looks like the Rental Uniforms are sort of high-single digits, 7%. But you've got a pretty dramatic difference here between hygiene and actually shop, the aprons and such being actually down negative for the quarter. I was wondering, what are you doing to turn that around. Or is it -- is there something in that industry in particular that's a drag on the overall growth of the segment?","J. Michael Hansen","Well, I'll say that all of those areas that I mentioned have grown. It's just that some have grown faster than others. And when you take a look at that hygiene bucket, that includes our newer products and services, which have grown very well in the last year. That growth is certainly exceeding the shop towel growth as well as the linen growth. But those areas are still growing, and we expect them to continue to grow.","James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. I guess just looking at them -- I think shop or linens was 11% of revenues last year. Maybe there's something else that's mixed in there that just makes it look not apples-to-apples. It's the only thing that caught my eye, but I'll go off-line with you on that.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","William C. Gale","Just would like to thank you all again for joining us this evening, and we'll look forward to speaking with you in late September when we report first quarter results.","Operator","That concludes today's conference.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Hansen","Thank you and good evening. Thanks for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and treasurer. We will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal 2015. In addition, we will provide guidance for fiscal 2016 and after our commentary we will be happy to answer any questions.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","As we reported today, in today's press release, our results for continuing operations adjusted to exclude all impacts of the document management businesses and the first quarter benefit from the gain on the sale of stock in an equity method investment are more representative of our ongoing performance. Therefore our discussion of the Company's performance will exclude these items.","We are pleased to report fourth quarter revenue of $1.142 billion. Organic revenue growth which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency and the Shred-it transaction was 6% for the quarter. Full fiscal year revenue was $4.476 billion representing organic growth of 7.1% over the prior fiscal year. While revenue in our Uniform Direct Sales segment was unchanged compared to fiscal 2014, our two largest segments, Rental Uniforms and First Aid, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection grew organically for the year by 7.7% and 9.2% respectively.","The performance of our sales force in both businesses were strong. We saw profitable business and penetrated existing customers with our broad line of products and services. Fourth quarter operating income was $177 million which was 15.6% of revenue compared to an adjusted operating margin of 15.4% in the prior year. Full fiscal year operating income was $696 million or 15.6% of revenue. This represents a 120 basis point improvement over last year's adjusted operating margin.","We are pleased with our ability to leverage our infrastructure and with the results of our increased focus on managing our cost structure following the Shred-it transaction. Additionally, we benefited from lower energy-related costs compared to last year. Paul will discuss the energy-related costs in more detail.","Earnings per diluted share as adjusted for the fourth quarter were $0.86 representing an increase of 11.7% over last year. For the full fiscal year EPS was $3.35, an increase of 21.8% over last year. As our CEO, Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, we also demonstrated our continuing commitment to providing shareholder value through our stock buyback program. We purchased 4.4 million shares of our common stock during the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of fiscal '16 for $370 million.","Fiscal 2015 was a very successful year for Cintas. We thank our employees, whom we call partners for their hard work in ensuring this outcome.","Yesterday, the Company announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its investment in Shred-it for approximately $550 million to $600 million before taxes. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2015 subject to obtaining regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. These proceeds will be in addition to the $180 million received at the closing of the partnership transaction on April 30, 2014 and the $113 million received in May 2015 in the form of a dividend from Shred-it.","Looking forward to fiscal 2016, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.700 billion to $4.780 billion. We also expect double-digit EPS growth in the range of $3.74 to $3.83. This guidance includes the impact of having two more workdays in fiscal '16 compared to fiscal '15. Our guidance does not include any EPS impact from the recently announced agreement to sell our investment in Shred-it nor does it include any deterioration in the U.S. economy or any additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in a table within today's press release.","I'll now turn the call over to Paul for more details on Company performance.","Paul Adler","Thanks Mike. First, please note that there were 65 work days in this year's fourth quarter which is the same as last year's fourth quarter. Full fiscal year of 2015 had the same number of days as fiscal 2014 of 260 days. Fiscal year 2016 will have 262 work days, two more than fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016 the number of work days by quarter are 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second and third quarters and 66 in the fourth quarter.","As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.0% in the fourth quarter and by 7.1% for the full fiscal year. Total Company gross margin was 42.6% for the fourth quarter of this year compared to 42.2% in last year's fourth quarter as adjusted. Total Company energy-related expenses for this year's fourth quarter were 2.2%. Last year's fourth quarter energy-related expenses were 3.0% excluding document management.","For the full year total Company gross margin was 42.9% an increase of 120 basis points over the prior year adjusted margin of 41.7%. For the full year total Company energy-related expenses of 2.5% or 40 basis points lower than fiscal 2014 as adjusted to exclude document management.","I will discuss gross margin and energy-related expenses by segments in just a moment. Before doing so, let me remind you that we have three reportable operating segments, rental uniforms and ancillary products, uniform direct sales and first aid, safety and fire protection services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services are combined and presented as other services on the income statement.","The Rental Uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels, and other related items. The segment also includes restaurant supplies and other facility products and services.","Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $873 million an increase of 5.8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes was 6.5%. Organic growth was higher than total growth because of continued weakening of the Canadian dollar. For the full year rental segment total road and organic growth were 7.2% and 7.7% respectively.","Rental segment revenue mix for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 was unchanged from the prior year quarter. The revenue mix was as follows: uniform rental accounted for approximately 52% of revenue. Loss control comprised mainly of entrance mats accounted for 19%, hygiene and other services including restaurant supply, cleaning services and chemical services were 16% of revenue. Shop [ph] towels were 5% and linen and others which is mainly nonperson specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats was 8%.","Our Rental segment gross margin was 44.0% for the fourth quarter, an increase from 43.6% in last year's fourth quarter. Energy-related costs were 90 basis points lower than our last year's fourth quarter. For the year Rental segment gross margin was 44.6% an increase of 130 basis points compared to the prior year, about 50 basis points of which was due to lower energy-related costs.","Our Uniform Direct Sales operating statement included the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers including product sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog.","Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the fourth quarter was $118 million an increase of 0.3% compared to last year's fourth quarter. When adjusting for foreign currency exchange rate changes organic growth was 1.1% for the quarter and flat for the full fiscal year. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 29.8% for the fourth quarter compared to 30.0% in the prior year quarter. For both the full fiscal years of 2015 and 2014 gross margin was 28.5%. The decrease in energy-related costs benefitted gross margins 30 basis points and 10 basis points in the fourth quarter and full-year periods respectfully.","Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Service operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the fourth quarter was $150 million which was 9.8% higher than last year's fourth quarter. Organic growth was 7.3%. For the full-year segment total growth and organic growth was 10.5% and 9.2% respectively. This segment's gross margin was 44.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 44.6% in the prior year. Energy-related costs were 60 basis points lower than in last year's fourth quarter.","For the year First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection segment gross margin was 44.1% an increase of 30 basis points compared to the prior year. Energy-related costs were 40 basis points lower than fiscal 2014. Regarding selling, and general and administrative expenses, total Company SG&A was 27.0% as a percentage of fourth quarter revenue compared to a total Company SG&A and last year's fourth quarter of 27.8%. When excluding the impact that document shredding had on last year's fourth quarter SG&A and revenue, last year's adjusted total Company SG&A were 26.8% as a percentage of the adjusted revenue.","We had an increase in legal and professional expenses in the fourth quarter. Full year SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 27.4% for fiscal 2015, the same percentage as in fiscal 2014 when adjusted for document shredding. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 37.6% compared to 40.4% in the prior year period. The full year 2015 effective tax rate was 37.2% compared to 38.3% in fiscal 2014. The higher fiscal 2014 effective tax rate was the result of a number of discrete items related to the Shred-it transaction. We expect the fiscal 2016 effective tax rate to be 37.3%.","Our cash and marketable securities were $433 million at May 31, an increase of $30 million from the $403 million at February 28. Cash provided by operating activities was $202 million in the fiscal fourth quarter driven by net income and increases in working capital resulting from the timing of vendor and other payments compared to the previous quarter. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we received a dividend from Shred-it of $113 million. And finally, the company paid $237 million in the fourth quarter to repurchased common stock.","Capital Expenditures for the fourth quarter were $54 million. Our CapEx by operating segments was as follows: [Indiscernible] $4 million in rental, 3 million in uniform direct sales, and $7 million in first aid, safety and fire protection. We expect for fiscal 2016 in the range of $250 million to $300 million.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from George Tong from Piper Jaffray.","Adrian Paz","Hi this is Adrian Paz on for George Tong. And I want to I guess driving to the rental uniform segment and there has been a bit of deceleration there from prior quarters. Maybe you can touch on trends that you are seeing there that contributed to the deceleration there? And also I want to know if you are maybe seeing softness from the manufacturing sector due to the stronger dollar?","Mike Hansen","Sure, so our rental organic growth, it did come down a bit from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and there were several things that accounted for that. First of all we did see a little bit of softening in our net add-stops performance, a little pullback from our customers. I would say in the middle of the quarter we started to see a little bit of a worsening trend and that actually continued into our first quarter.","We also a little bit of a pull back from our national account customers, especially in our emergency services business. We saw a little bit of a negative impact from the oil and gas that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, and then lastly I would say, we did see a little bit of an impact from pricing from the standpoint of the year-over-year impact. So let me talk a bit about pricing.","Last year, in the fourth quarter we talked about how we saw an improvement in the pricing environment and that carried throughout our fiscal 2015. And we really didn\u2019t see much of a change in our fourth quarter, but one thing to keep in mind is, we did lap the beginning of that what we saw was a bit of an improved environment. So the year-over-year growth was affected by a little bit. So I would say those four things contributed to a little bit of a deceleration in that rental organic growth.","From a manufacturing segment standpoint I can\u2019t say that we saw anything unusual or any significant trend or noticeable trend.","Adrian Paz","Hey great. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. And I guess can you touch on, I guess your capital allocation plans with divestiture or the sale of the Shred-it transaction, it seems like you guys have a really strong balance sheet at this point. Maybe you could touch on what you are \u2013 if you are looking at any particular segment for M&A plans in general?","Mike Hansen","Well, so certainly when we think about our cash usage we want to make sure that we\u2019re growing organically and we\u2019ll spend what we need to on CapEx. Secondly, we really do like acquisition opportunities if they are at the right value and they create synergies and long-term benefits for the Company.","We certainly would be actively involved in looking at acquiring business in our current businesses if the value was there, if we felt like synergies were available. And so we certainly have an active corporate development team and certainly are open to making acquisitions again that are at the right value and that can provide long-term value for us.","Certainly after that, we\u2019ve shown that we will increase the dividend. We\u2019ve done so every year since we went public in 1983 and so dividends are an important part of our capital allocation. And then lastly as you\u2019ve seen in the last quarter or so, the buyback program in very important to us and as we mentioned we acquired $370 million of our stock in the last quarter and into the first quarter.","So when we think about capital allocation, those are thoughts. Now certainly, with the Shred-it transaction, that will close in the fourth quarter, our board will be busy thinking about how to deploy that cash, what\u2019s the appropriate way to use that and we\u2019ll certainly be actively thinking in terms of how to use that.","Adrian Paz","And looking at perhaps your M&A pipeline, are you really looking for larger transactions or are you happy with maybe just bolt-on opportunities?","Mike Hansen","We would look at both bold-ons. We certainly love bold-ons because they create some great synergies for us. But we certainly would be open to larger transactions again as long as they created a value that we felt like we needed, the synergy opportunities and long-term value for Cintas.","Adrian Paz","Great, thank you. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Greg Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.","Greg Bisbee","Hi, guys, good afternoon.","Mike Hansen","Hi, Greg.","Greg Bisbee","A couple questions, if I could. The first aid, fire safety organic growth slowed a little more and my sense coming out of last quarter\u2019s call was that there has been a little weather impact that may be would bounce back, is there anything more specific you\u2019d fall out and any thought process in how that might trend given this recent period of deterioration organic growth? Thank you.","Mike Hansen","Yes. We are still pleased with the performance of the business. On the fire side of that business, there does tend to be a little bit more project work and we did see a little bit of pull back in that project work in the fourth quarter. So there are repairs that we do, there are new product sales like fire extinguisher sales to customers and we saw a little bit of pull back in the fourth quarter nothing that we believe to be creating a trend. We still feel very positive particularly about the service side of the business. It's been performing very well. So I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen in the business in the last quarter, but in our minds nothing to be concerned about.","Greg Bisbee","Okay. And then on the gross margins, it looks like both rentals and first aid if you back out the benefit from energy would have seen a gross margin decline somewhat year-over-year that's obliviously change from what\u2019s been a real strong trend for quite some time. Is there anything in particular going on there? I guess comps probably won\u2019t really be, but are you spending more, is there anything else and I guess how do we think about that flowing into your guidance for next year?","Mike Hansen","Yes I think, first let me say, we feel like we had a great year in those businesses where the gross margin in rental went up about a 130 basis points, in first aid it went up about 30 basis points. We continue to invest in both businesses and I think in the fourth quarter, we saw a little bit may be of pulling repair and maintenance into the fourth quarter that may have happened in the first quarter. I think we started hiring a little bit early for the businesses, on the Ralphs [ph] particularly. So we added Ralphs maybe a little bit more aggressively in both businesses than we have and probably just setting the table for fiscal 2016.","So, as we think about the guidance I would say we still believe that there is gross margin opportunity. We think incremental margins are going to be healthy. As it relates to our rental business we've talked a little bit during fiscal 2015 about pushing some capacity growth into fiscal 2016 that goes into our guidance thinking a little bit. And the other thing is, when we \u2013 from the standpoint of energy so gas fuel prices for us, we\u2019ve included an expectation, that fuel prices for the year would be about the same in fiscal 2016 as in fiscal 2015. Both years would be about 2.5%.","On the flip side though, as I mentioned from a rental organic growth standpoint we did see a little bit of negative impact from our oil and gas customers in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ve also included in our guidance into fiscal 2016 that that kind of performance would continue as long as we see the fuel in that 2.5% range. And so the point is on a net basis, while we got a benefit certainly in fiscal 2015 from net, oil and gas in the fuel costs, we think it might turn around a little bit in fiscal 2016. ","Greg Bisbee","That sounds prudent and then just one other one. I assume you have a pretty good sense of what your cost based for the shredding businesses, so should we think of taxes eating up a big piece of those proceeds or is it fairly minor and I guess I\u2019d say the same for the dividends?","Mike Hansen","Yes. So we\u2019ve got a fairly complex transaction. So we\u2019re going to be working on taxes up to the point of time that we close that transaction. But as of May 31, our book value was $219 million and that came down because of the dividend. So we have to record that dividend as a reduction in our book value of our investment.","So you can kind of think of the cash that we received, let\u2019s call it the midpoint of 575 compared to a book value of as of May 31, 2019 that\u2019s a $350-ish million gain and so we\u2019ll pay taxes on that gain and probably an easy way to think about that at the moment is using our 37.3% against that.","One thing from a cash standpoint to keep in mind is that the gain we recognized a year ago was a deferred tax gain, so we didn\u2019t pay taxes on that piece of the gain, so we\u2019ll have to do that as well when we receive the cash at closing. Does that make sense? So I would say it is going to be a fairly good sized tax bill, but we'll have a lot of cash left over. And we\u2019ll certainly provide more details as we get through those calculations and we firm up the amount of the proceeds.","Greg Bisbee","Perfect, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins","Hi, thank you good afternoon.","Mike Hansen","Hi Sara.","Sara Gubins","A couple of questions about guidance, could you help us think about how much of a benefit from the Shred-it JV is in your fiscal guidance?","Mike Hansen","Yes, as Paul mentioned there is no benefit in the fiscal 2016 guidance as it relates to Shred-it.","Sara Gubins","So, yeah.","Paul Adler","So let me make a couple of points on that. We are going to continue to own 42% of Shred-it until that transaction closes. So roughly for the first half of the year we will record our share of the Shred-it income just like we did in fiscal 2015.","We, because of the transaction and you probably had seen that there was an IPO process as well. We didn\u2019t \u2013 we just didn\u2019t have clarity on what that performance might look like and so we\u2019ve not included any impact from the Shred-it net income performance that we will share in and then once we haven\u2019t received the cash yet.","We need to close that deal first and until we do that we\u2019re not ready to provide any other guidance on how that cash may impact us. One thing about the first particularly the first quarter as it relates to our share of the Shred-it income they have the IPO process going as well as this transaction that we announced yesterday and there will likely be a fair amount of transaction related expenses that we will share in.","Now, when we record that, when we record our share of those expenses in the first quarter and in the second quarter, keep in mind those are non-cash \u2013 That\u2019s a non-cash entry for us. And the impact is it increases our book value even more. So it\u2019s just an offset we get that gain back when the transaction closes.","Sara Gubins","Got it okay, so just to make sure that I understand it, in the first quarter we\u2019ll see some expenses, which are not incorporated into the guidance, but at the same time in the first part of the half of the year we\u2019ll see a benefit from the JV which is also not incorporated into your guidance?","Paul Adler","No I would say that in the first quarter we\u2019re going to see more than likely a negative impact, because of the transaction expenses and I\u2019m not ready to comment at all on what we will see in the second quarter, but regardless none of that impact is contemplated in the guidance that we\u2019ve given.","Sara Gubins","Okay, and could you tell us what the share count is that you are using for the guidance?","Mike Hansen","Sara it is $115 million for fiscal 2016.","Sara Gubins","Okay, and could you now just think about what might drive you to the higher end of the revenue range for the guidance at 6.8%?","Paul Adler","I think the continued execution by our businesses I think our partners have done a fantastic job in fiscal 2015, and we need to continue to execute well. So our sales performance needs to continue as it has done.","We need to continue to be able to penetrate existing customers and we believe that we\u2019ve got a lot of penetration opportunities left. So we need to continue to penetrate our customers and we need to execute.","So I think the range of guidance that we\u2019re giving is certainly what we believe to be an achievable range and I think if we execute well like we have this year we can get to towards the top end of that range.","Sara Gubins","Okay, and just last question, you mentioned that you were seeing a bit more pricing pressure after having had it improve for the last year. Is it coming in particular regions or from particular types of competitors? I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s driving the change there?","Paul Adler","So I\u2019m sorry, maybe I wasn\u2019t clear. We haven\u2019t seen a change in the pricing environment of any significance. Pricing is still competitive. It always has been in our business. It always will be. So pricing is still competitive. But we haven\u2019t seen much of a change in our fourth quarter compared to our third quarter, second quarter, et cetera. What my point was, in the fourth quarter of last year we saw a bit of a change at that point where we saw an improved environment for pricing.","And we quite honestly, we talked a little bit about training our people to speak to our customers about the great value that we are providing to our customers. And so a year ago we saw a bit of a change from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in terms of that pricing environment and now we've lapped that change. And so what that does is it has a little bit of an impact on our year-over-year growth as it relates to the third quarter growth compared to the fourth quarter growth.","Sara Gubins","Got it, thanks very much that's helpful.","Paul Adler","Sure.","Operator","We will go next to Nate Brochmann from William Blair.","Nate Brochmann","Good evening gentlemen.","Mike Hansen","Hi Nate.","Nate Brochmann","Just wanted to talk a little bit obviously with the document management business you guys did a great job kind of growing that with a few acquisitions, but then kind of growing organically and then getting the fairly positive shareholder wealth creation event out of that. And I was just wondering when you think about the business now as it stands in terms of the portfolio of services what do you expect to have and be able to grow in terms of replacing that business and what could be the next big opportunity or what else is in the hopper in terms of things to think about?","Mike Hansen","Well, the great news is our growth this year has replaced it. Our revenue in fiscal 2015 is almost the same as in fiscal 2014. So the good news is we have replaced it now. Now clearly, how do we continue to grow into the future, from a rental business we need to continue to create solutions for our customers that are of high value.","We need to get more known programmers into uniform rental programs, things like new types of Carhartt programs, fire resistant clothing offerings. So we need to continue to create innovation. We need to create innovation with our facilities, services products and services and we need to continue to penetrate. We've got quite a, we believe to be quite a penetration opportunity in our customer base.","And the nice thing about having about a million customers is we've got a lot of warms leaves out there that we can continue to work to penetrate. From a first aid, safety and fire business standpoint, it is a bit of the same. We need to go out and capture new customers and we need to continue to look for adjacencies under the umbrellas of safety and protection and we've done a very nice job in creating product adjacencies that we can then sell into existing customers.","So it is the answer to your question about how do we continue to grow and what is the business? We feel like we've got a lot of opportunity in our existing businesses. Now having said that, we certainly would look for other ideas that might be wholly new businesses, but it has got to be a business that can create some good long-term value for us.","Paul Adler","And you know Mike I think that's actually there is actually one point and like the rental segment is that it is not just the traditional uniform wearer based. As you develop these new fabrics that you are able to attack a whole different suite of end markets, correct?","Mike Hansen","Yes that is correct and more retail inspired offerings certainly helps as well.","Nate Brochmann","Correct, okay. And that is actually a good read and then I apologize for asking another question on guidance, but I am presuming as you mentioned that there is probably a little bit of pessimism in terms of just looking at the revenue line both on the oil and gas customers as well as just kind of looking at some of the add-stops I know that we have gone from negative to neutral a little positive here and there and now back to negative and we\u2019re not really getting that run rate. So I assume that most in the guidance is probably a little bit of pessimism around the oil and gas and the add-stops with the optimism coming from the new customers and the penetration et cetera in terms of the same playbook, correct?","Mike Hansen","Yes that is correct and Nate, I should probably point out one additional item. We\u2019ve seen a fair amount of movement in the Canadian exchange rate during the year. Keep in mind our guidance is total revenue growth for the current year. So for fiscal 2015, our average currency exchange rate was about a $1.15 Canadian and we have seen that now go to closer to 1.20, 1.25. And so our guidance assumes a 1.25 for fiscal 2016 and so that does have about a 50 to 60 basis point negative impact on total revenue growth.","So having said that, let me put that aside and make sure that I\u2019m also talking about, look we feel really good about the business. We\u2019ve had some really nice momentum and so we believe that we do have some real nice opportunities. But you\u2019re right, we've got a little bit of headwind in the Canadian currency, got a little bit of headwind in the oil and gas impact and a little bit of headwind in the net add-stops area.","Nate Brochmann","Okay. So obviously if any of that kind of changes and we get a different flow, we could get a little upside there. And then just in terms of the bottom line, you've talked about the incremental margins and the gross margin opportunity and maybe even pulling some growth investment maybe into this quarter relative to next year. But is there any additional catch-up and any additional investment at this point that we need on either the hiring front on the sales side or an extra layer of new routes that we are playing catch-up on in terms of thinking about or is it kind of just normal growth investment with that level of revenue in mind?","Mike Hansen","Yes, I would say it is normal investment that we have made with the exception that we have talked a little bit about the processing, rental processing capacity. But aside from that, we have been continuously investing in routes in the rental business and the first aid, safety and fire business; we will continue to do that, but generally it is a bit of business as usual. I don\u2019t see any need for an accelerated rate of investment unless something changes like we do see a dramatic change in net add-stops or a dramatic change in the economy.","Nate Brochmann","Okay. Great, I appreciate the time.","Operator","We will go next to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks, good afternoon. I was just curious on all the discussion on bit of the decline in net add-stops inventory in the quarter and moving into the first quarter, I understand it is incorporated in the guidance [ph] I think, but might be just could you take us a little bit further into what you think is driving that or what you are seeing beyond what you had said already or is it really not much of that?","Mike Hansen","Well, I don\u2019t know that there is much to add other than to say we have seen a little bit of a bumpy economic ride. There have been some ups and downs in employment. Some months have been narrower than others. We have seen some macro events that have probably given businesses pause. We have seen a stronger U.S. dollar. We have got the prospect of interest rates. So I think we have seen a little bit of a bumpy ride and I would say aside from that bumpy ride, I don\u2019t have a lot of additional color to add other than the oil and gas impact certainly.","Scott Schneeberger","Great, thanks. And then, just I have two others both they are kind of quirky. You guys mentioned legal and professional was elevated in the fourth quarter. I'm curious, was that just associated with what was going on with Shred-it or is there something else particularly on the legal side that we should be concerned or aware about?","Mike Hansen","Yes, that was generally a good part of that related to the transaction.","Scott Schneeberger","Okay. Thanks and then lastly, just an update on the ERP and its influence on CapEx where we are in that cycle, just want to make sure we are aware of where you are on that on that?","Mike Hansen","Yes, we talked about that being about a $100 million project. We have spent about half of that in fiscal 2015. The project is right where we wanted it to be. We are still very optimistic that that will continue on that calendar that we've talk about and so I would expect that we could see another $40 million to $50 million of CapEx during fiscal 2016. We've talked about fiscal 2017 would be the year when we start the rollout and start to see some impact potentially mid-year to the end of the year.","Scott Schneeberger","Excellent, thanks very much and nice work.","Mike Hansen","Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew Wittmann","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to Mike ask a little bit about the strategic decision on the exit of Shred-it. I mean, first time you contributed in the joint venture, you got the synergies and created the value. You really worked substantially selling the business, but now you are likely to sell it you could have been the buyer and bought it back in. So what were you seeing in the business as it related to the rest of your business that made it the right decision for you to exit that today?","Mike Hansen","Well, if we go back a year ago, some of the things that we\u2019ve talked about relating to that business, we really do believe that it was a good business for us. We took a business, changed the business model from onsite to offsite shredding. We added our people, our culture, our processes and we felt like we really made a - created a great business.","But there were some things that we didn\u2019t like as much and that is generally what we found was the decision maker was different than the decision maker for most of our businesses.","The commodity impact was a bit of a bumpy ride through the years and we weren\u2019t crazy about that. We felt like we were a little concerned that there weren\u2019t many product adjacencies for us in that business. So the growth was coming from volume primarily and so, for those reasons, we and then finally we weren\u2019t seeing enough or improvement quickly enough and that was one of the main reasons why we also wanted to do the transaction with Shred-it a year ago.","When we think about how that\u2019s gone over the last year as I\u2019ve mentioned several times in the last few quarters, we've been very, very pleased with how the business has progressed, how the integration has progressed. But when we think about our investment, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the macro environment. There is a lot of uncertainty about how commodities will continue to affect that business.","There is uncertainty in a way of the stock market as it related to the IPO alternative with Greece and China creating some wild rides. There\u2019s uncertainty as it relates to being a minority owner and having a bit of a limited influence. And then finally there was uncertainty as it relates to the impact that it would have on our P&L. And so generally speaking, the thoughts that we had a year ago for making the transaction and the uncertainty about the position that we were in led us to believe that taking the certainty of this deal was a great opportunity for us.","Andrew Wittmann","Was there a $50 million that you\u2019re highlighting Mike as you look up to number?","Mike Hansen","The total purchase price is $2.3 billion for the entire company, but we have to pull out debt and some transaction expenses and so there can be a little bit of movement in those. And as in most deals there\u2019s a little bit of a hold back and so that\u2019s the reason for the range.","Andrew Wittmann","Is it a fair playbook to look at the first time you contributed this to the joint venture where you wound up doing a decent sized special dividend and then kind of followed up some buyback, is that you think decent [indiscernible] are going in assumptions as to how the capital redeployment may go?","Mike Hansen","I hate to speculate on that Andy. We haven\u2019t closed the deal yet, so it\u2019s we don\u2019t have the cash. Our Board so we just announced it yesterday, so our Board will certainly have that on their agenda and give a thoughtful process to how we put that cash to work. So I can\u2019t speculate on that yet. But as you know we\u2019ve shown a very much of willingness to put that cash to work.","Andrew Wittmann","And then my final question from me one more is, just your comments on the sales productivity, it sounds like it must have been really strong in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense about how the sales productivity this fourth quarter compared to the sales productivity last fourth quarter?","Mike Hansen","We do see some very good productivity from our sales reps, it was probably relative to the prior year our best quarter of the year. I\u2019d rather not get into too much detail, but it was a good quarter for us. Our people and our partners have been very productive. Our training processes have gone very, very well. We have very good products and services to arm them with and they\u2019ve done a very nice job.","Andrew Wittmann","Okay well, that seems like it would have an implication then for the revenue growth rate since that wasn't all captured as new business in the fourth quarter, that should give you at least some visibility into the revenue growth that you have next year. Is that fair? ","Mike Hansen","It is fair. It does give us a bit of a nice start to the year.","Andrew Wittmann","Okay, thank you very much.","Mike Hansen","Sure.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Hi good evening guys and firstly congratulations on the way you guys did your portfolio realignment I guess. The one question I had I mean is just around the M&A your appetite, you said you\u2019d love to do tuck-ins and maybe even the larger one occasionally.","But if I look at the history, I mean, in uniform, you guys haven't done a deal in the last two years, really. In first aid, also it's been like two or three a year, I guess going back the last three years if I look at the disclosures. So maybe if you can just help us understand the pipeline that you see, like are there opportunities? I know you'd love to do it, but does it seem like there's a lot out there?","Mike Hansen","There are opportunities, now I would say that in our rental business and probably our first aid business there are as many opportunities as there was 15 years ago and probably not, but there are opportunities, they are very good opportunities and we\u2019ll continue to explore them.","But they have to be at the right value for us. We generally need a willing seller and so far we just haven\u2019t seen the alignment, but we\u2019re certainly active and we\u2019ll not hesitate to make an acquisition particularly in our existing businesses that we believe has good value.","Manav Patnaik","Okay and is the, I guess the preference for the larger deal, like what is the, I mean is there an active consideration to look at the larger ones versus the smaller ones or not really?","Mike Hansen","I would just say that we certainly would be involved if there was a willing seller or a process and we think a large acquisition could at the right value be accretive for us. And so we would certainly take a look.","Manav Patnaik","Okay and then just last one from me, I know you talked briefly about some of the trends and for the net add-stops, but generally speaking, is there any way for you to characterize based on what you guys have seen historically, where we are in terms of on innings or however you want to characterize it in terms of the upsets and just employment -- I mean improvement on the employment front?","Mike Hansen","I am not sure that I can give you a specific in terms of innings or where I think we are. We've had a fairly nice stretch of economic performance albeit bumpy, but we've had a fairly nice stretch of economic performance over the last several years. How long will that continue, I am not sure. What I do know is that we will do our best through any economic cycle to continue to penetrate existing customers and then find ways to create value to know programmers. But I am not sure I can give you a specific inning or timeframe Manav.","Manav Patnaik","Okay, all right fair enough thank you guys.","Operator","We'll go next to Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi thank you for squeezing me in here. Most of my questions have been answered. I just want to touch on two items that were brought up a little bit earlier. Just on the add-stops metric what has the trajectory been? No I'm not talking about the last quarter, but just the last few years and has there really been more of an upswing if you would kind of chart that and where do we stand versus let's say where we were seven or eight years ago before we had kind of the great depression or the great recession, where do we stand versus that because there was always just kind of a lever are we back to levels that we had seen prior to things going bad or where do you see it right now?","Mike Hansen","I would say that the performance has certainly been more choppy in the last several years. Going back prerecession, I don\u2019t have that at my fingertips but I will tell you over the last few years, because of the choppiness that we've seen in the adds and stops, we've talked a lot about seeming to have a positive trend only the churn next quarter and to a bit of a negative trend because of the choppiness that we have seen.","The overall impact to the business I would say has been a bit muted and there still is opportunity to see a better impact. I was just looking at -- if you think about the jobs that are in the historically strong uniform rental sectors. Some are still at lower levels than prerecession. And I think that is just a reflection of the bumpiness and inconsistency that we've seen in the last several years.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And then one other thing that was brought up before and I just want to touch on, do you have any recent new introduction of products or services that have been added like what you did with Carhartt and what you've done with [indiscernible] kind of agreement and what you've done with kind of the floor washing, is there anything recent that's been added that seems like it is another potential opened end market for you guys?","Mike Hansen","Well we're always working on innovation Shlomo, but I will tell you that our chemical business, our Carhartt business, they are still relatively small and we've got a lot of growth opportunities still in those. And we have the other one that I could mention is a our signature series hygiene products and even though we've introduced those a few years ago, it takes a little bit of time to get those penetrated throughout the country and so we're still working on those.","We're focused on continuing to drive penetration. I don't have any new things to talk about. We certainly know that innovation is important and we're working on it. But I don\u2019t have anything new to talk to you about. We're just focused on continuing to penetrate with some of these newer products and services where we've got a lot of room.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay great, thank you so much.","Mike Hansen","Sure.","Operator","And at this time, we have no further questions in the queue.","Mike Hansen","Well, thank you very much for joining us tonight. We will be issuing our first quarter earnings in late September and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Hansen","Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas\u2019 Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2019. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. ","This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company\u2019s current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $1.68 billion, an increase of 5.9% over last year's third quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 6%. In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 6.2%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 8.6%.","The organic growth rates of both segments were negatively impacted by a greater number of customers being closed for business in this year's third quarter compared to last year\u2019s third quarter due to severe winter weather and the timing of the holidays, Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve fell on a Monday this year compared to on a Sunday in the prior year.","Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 of $755.2 million increased 7.8%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 44.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, compared to 44.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved 80 basis points from last year's third quarter to 44.9%, and the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment gross margin percentage improved 130 basis points to 48.2%.","Reported operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 of $278.3 million increased 39.1%. Operating income margin was 16.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 12.6% in fiscal 2018. Operating income was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $800,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and $9.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Operating income in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was also reduced $39.7 million by a one-time cash payment to Cintas employees following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into legislation on December 22, 2017.","Excluding the integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition and the one-time cash payment to employees, operating income increased 11.8% and operating income margin improved 90 basis points to 16.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 compared to 15.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Reported net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was $200.9 million, and reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 were $1.83.","Please note that there were a few items impacting the comparability of reported financial results. First, G&K acquisition integration expenses negatively impacted reported EPS in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 by $0.01 and $0.06 respectively. Also, reported EPS in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 included a negative impact of $0.24 from the one-time cash payment to employees.","Finally, reported EPS in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 included a positive impact of $1.59 from benefits under the Tax Act, primarily due to a one-time re-evaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Excluding these items, net income dollars increased 31.7% and net income margin was 12% compared to 9.6% last year. EPS increased 34.3%.","As Scott Farmer, our Chairman and CEO stated in today's press release, we're pleased with our third quarter financial performance. Our employee partners are working diligently to exceed customer expectations while also making significant progress on integrating the G&K acquisition and converting more operations to our new enterprise resource planning system.","And while our employee partners are focused on getting customers ready for the work day, we remain committed to efforts to increase shareholder value. In this year's third quarter, we paid an annual dividend totaling $220.8 million. The dividend of $2.05 per share was an increase of 26.5% over last year's dividend. Also in the quarter, we purchased $100 million of Cintas stock under our buyback program. As of February 28, we have now purchased $546.6 million of Cintas stock during fiscal 2019, and the amount remaining under our buyback program is $863.4 million.","We updated our annual guidance for fiscal 2019, we expect revenue to be in the range of $6.87 billion to $6.885 billion. This implies a strong finish to our fiscal 2019 year, with fourth quarter revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7%, and operating income margin in the range of 17% to 17.5%. We expect EPS from continuing operations excluding certain items to be in the range of $7.42 to $7.48. Note the following regarding the EPS guidance, it assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 of 20.6%. This implies a fourth quarter effective tax rate of 24.5%.","The reported effective tax rate in last year's fourth quarter was 21.5%. The higher tax rate expected in the fourth quarter of this year will have a negative impact of $0.07 to $0.08. Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period-to-period based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation benefits.","Our guidance assumes that diluted share count from -- for computing EPS of 111.5 million shares. It does not assume any future G&K integration expenses and it does not assume any future share buybacks.","I'll now turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Adler ","Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal third quarter contained the same number of work days as the prior year third quarter. Additionally, there will be no work day differences in our fiscal fourth quarter.","Looking ahead to fiscal 2020, please note that there will be one less work day than in fiscal 2019. Each quarter of fiscal 2020 will contain 65 work days. One less day will negatively impact fiscal 2020 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points. To illustrate the magnitude of the headwind using fiscal 2019\u2019s third quarter revenue, one work day is about $26 million. One less work day also has a negative impact on operating margin.","Fiscal 2020 operating income margin will be reduced by about 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2019. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses, like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis, and we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses. Please keep these headwinds in mind when modeling our fiscal 2020 results.","We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our businesses included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services, and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement.","Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.","Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,358 million, an increase of 5.7%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.2%. As Mike mentioned earlier, the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by customer closures caused by the severe weather and the holiday calendar.","Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.9% for the third quarter compared to 44.1% in last year's third quarter, an improvement of 80 basis points. Energy expense as a percentage of revenue was 2.4% compared to 2.5% in the prior year quarter. We are pleased with the gross margin expansion and our ability to overcome the weather and holiday challenges, as well as continued wage pressures, increased commodity costs such as for hangers which are sourced mostly from China, and the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation.","Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, safety products and training. This segment\u2019s revenue for the third quarter was $149.2 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 8.6%. This segment too was negatively impacted by severe weather and the timing of the holidays.","The First Aid segment gross margin was 48.2% in the third quarter compared to 46.9% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 130 basis points. Note that First Aid segment gross margins are at record levels and had been marching higher since the acquisition of ZEE Medical three and half years ago.","National account new business continues to help drive high-single digit organic growth. Penetration of existing customers with more products and services is also a major contributor to top line growth and it results in above average gross margins.","Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low-single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale however is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from other business units.","All Other revenue was $174.8 million, an increase a 4.5%. The organic growth rate was 2.3% and was driven by 11.3% organic growth in the Fire business. All Other gross margin was 42.3% for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41.7% for last year's third quarter.","Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.3% in the third quarter compared to 30.9% in last year's third quarter. Note that the one-time cash payment to employees in last year's third quarter that Mike mentioned earlier was recorded in selling and administrative expenses. Excluding this payment, last year\u2019s selling administrative expense as a percent of revenue was 28.4% compared to 28.3% in this year's third quarter.","Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 20.1%. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018 we realized a significant tax benefit from the Tax Act, primarily due to a one-time revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.","Our fiscal 2019 EPS guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 20.6% this implies a fourth quarter effective tax rate of 24.5%. The effective tax rate in last year's fourth quarter was 21.5%. As Mike stated previously the higher expected tax rate will have a negative impact on fourth quarter EPS of $0.07 to $0.08. ","Our cash and equivalents balance as of February 28 was $80.9 million. Operating cash flow in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 increased 15.7% from the amount of operating cash flow in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $70.2 million, our CapEx by operating segment was as follows, $55.8 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $8.1 million in First Aid and Safety and $6.3 million in All Other. We expect fiscal 2019 CapEx to be in the range of $270 million to $285 million.","As of February 28, total debt was $2,754.5 million, $2,537 million is fixed interest rate debt and $217.5 million is variable rate commercial paper. At February 28, we are at our targeted leverage of 2 times debt to EBITDA. ","That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan ","Hi, good afternoon.","Mike Hansen","Hi, Toni. ","Toni Kaplan ","Uniform Rental was a bit below what we'd expected this quarter. Could you just give us the organic growth ex the holiday shift and ex the weather closure? And is it possible that any sales were bumped into the fourth quarter?","Mike Hansen ","We expect that the impact was about 60 basis points to the growth of both rental and the total company. And I would say that we don't expect much to be bumped to the fourth quarter, and that's why you see the guidance coming down from a revenue perspective a little bit greater than the 60 basis points for the third quarter, 60 basis points is roughly $10 million in the quarter. When we think about that quarter, this is the first year since fiscal 2015 that the holidays weren\u2019t either on a Friday or a Monday. A Friday, the weekend or a Monday.","And we just found there were many of our customers not only took off for holiday, but took off the Monday before the holiday, took off a day or so after the holidays as well. And when that happened, it just created a lot of disruption to our -- for example our new business effort where appointment setting for our sales reps became very, very difficult, and the momentum that they had going into the holidays was really stopped. And they had to regain that momentum with the decision maker meetings, et cetera after the holidays.","The other thing was the weather, I mean, we -- if you think about the polar vortex for example, we had customer shutdowns from Minnesota all the way to the East Coast. And again, that creates real challenges for our sales people to get continued momentum of meeting with decision makers, et cetera, and it also has an impact on our drivers. Our drivers we call them service sales reps or SSRs. ","When our customers close, our SSRs have to squeeze more stops into a fewer number of days. And when that happens, our SSRs have less time to look for revenue opportunities. There's less -- because the customers are closed, there is less customer traffic to use our restroom products, for example. So, it certainly did have an impact on the quarter.","Toni Kaplan ","Okay, great. And then I wanted to understand all other a little bit better. It sounds like fire was really strong with 11% organic growth. So I'm guessing that means that direct sales were sort of weaker. Was it fire that drove the strong margins in that segment? I know that they jump around, but given last quarter was a little bit on the weaker side, was this sort of a catch up or was it the mix shift; just wanted to understand all other margin a little bit better? Thanks.","Paul Adler","Yes, Toni, it's Paul. You are right, fire had a very strong quarter organically. And so, then the corollary is that Uniform Direct Sale did not perform as well. You know, that that direct sale business, it's non-recurring revenue, so it's a little harder to forecast, it's lumpier, it depends on rollouts, and it's tougher to forecast and the sales cycle is longer as well. So it's UDS, the Uniform Direct Sale business did come in lighter than we expected, and of course that suppressed margins as well.","The Fire business overall, still continues to perform very well, high-single digit organic growth is the expectations and those margins will continue to improve rather as the organic growth continues to tick up.","Toni Kaplan ","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.","Manav Patnaik","Good evening, guys. I just wanted to see if I could reconcile this right. So you said the impact in the quarter from both weather and I guess two less days was $10 million, but then for 2020 one less work day impacts you $26 million for the full year. So I mean is -- like is it just because it was in that holiday period maybe and it was less of an impact?","Mike Hansen ","Well, Manav when we have customers close, our goal is to reschedule the visit to them. So it's not like we completely lose one full day of revenue. We will still get the rental revenue. We just have to reschedule the stop so that we can pick up for example, dirty uniforms drop off clean, and we will still generate revenue because of that. But when we are doing that, it's the things like continuing to look for the penetration opportunities that suffer a bit. It's the new business that suffers a little bit. ","So we don't lose all of the days\u2019 revenue. Because we have to still visit and serve the customer, it\u2019s just that the penetration opportunities and the new business productivity was challenged a bit. And despite all of that, 6.2% organic growth rate is still a pretty good performance by our rental business despite the challenges that we have.","You're right though, as we think about 2020 that's a full day that we lose and don't get back in terms of the revenue within that fiscal year. And so that $26 million that Paul referenced, that's just an example of if you take our total revenue, divided by the number of workdays this past quarter, that's effectively the impact that it would have next year.","Manav Patnaik","Okay, got it. And then maybe just the latest on the G&K integration, I guess just what's the next milestones we should be looking to hear from you guys?","Paul Adler","Yes, Manav, the integration continues to progress very nicely. It doesn't mean though, that there's not heavy lifting going on in our operations still. That heavy lifting is typically now in the form of rerouting. And we expect that to continue into fiscal 2020. What we're really trying to do Manav is, in certain markets to minimize the disruption kind of sync up the rerouting for the G&K acquisition with the SAP conversion. So to minimize disruption to the operation, to the customers kind of handle all that change management at one-time. ","So yes, still some inefficiencies exists in those markets where they're going through that. As I mentioned, that'll continue into 2020. But, the operations are doing a very nice job of taking care of the customer. And I think that the solid financial results are kind of a testament to that fact.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities. ","Andrew Steinerman ","Hi, guys. You're going to hate this question, but I'm going to try it. When you look at the legacy G&K portfolio business, how fast do you think it's growing relative to 6% organic overall. And if you could talk about, sales force productivity in getting that G&K legacy business cross selling, et cetera? ","Mike Hansen ","So, you're right, Andrew that's a really tough question. But I would say that the growth isn't quite near the legacy Cintas levels yet. We are seeing some nice performance in things like our hygiene penetration. And so we really do like the direction, but I would say we're likely not where legacy Cintas locations are just yet, but it's really hard to tell, because we have we have transferred so much volume from close locations to Cintas locations, we have as we optimize routes, we are moving G&K volume into Cintas and Cintas into G&K. So it's really -- it\u2019s very muddy when you try to parse that out.","As it relates to the sales rep productivity, we have one sales team. Let's make sure we're clear on that. And the productivity is still very, very good. It's better than a year ago, it's not quite as high as it was in the second quarter because of some of the challenges that I mentioned a few minutes ago. But we're still very pleased with that performance.","Andrew Steinerman ","Any milestones ahead on crush selling that you could talk about into that G&K legacy business.","Mike Hansen ","I would say, because the business is so blended, Andrew. Our goal is just continuing to manage the business location by location, but we'll be reporting on it in total because it's so difficult. And we'll do our best to give some color like we have in the last couple quarters of that we like the revenue performance in former G&K customers. But it's going to be -- there's going to be a little bit more anecdotal as we go forward because of the blending of that.","But if you think about the impact that I mentioned in terms of the weather on holidays, that's kind of turns of 6.2 into about a 6.8. And that performance we really like and certainly there is some help compared to where we were a year ago in terms of penetration at legacy G&K customers. Pretty hard to give a specific number, but we know there are some -- these certainly are signs of success.","Andrew Steinerman ","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gary Bisbee","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I guess the first one just following up on Andrew\u2019s question. This is the question, I think we all get all the time about the cross sell and you've never really provided any disclosure of any metrics consistently that would help people think about it. Have you -- and I know you have historically said, competitive reasons you didn't want to give too much. ","But I mean, have you thought about, potentially, at some point introducing some metrics to help us track the success that you're having, whether it's customer accounts that we could look at revenue per customer or any other metric, it seems to me it would be helpful to your investor base if you were to provide something.","Mike Hansen ","Well, I certainly can appreciate that, Gary. We -- as you said, for competitive reasons, we don't like to give too much of that information. But I will tell you practically, if you think about what we've had going on over the last few years, we're talking about the largest integration that we've had in our rental business, the largest integration we've ever had in our First Aid business, and an SAP conversion. There's a lot going on and to try to get the kind of data that we would be comfortable enough providing externally out of the three different systems that we've been on that would be very, very challenging.","And I understand your request and as we get fully on to SAP, we will certainly give that some hard thought. But gosh, we're in the midst of a lot of things going on that would make that kind of reporting pretty challenging.","Gary Bisbee","Yes, fair point. I'll ask you again once SAP is fully up and running. That's a good point. ","Mike Hansen ","I will expect that question in a couple years.","Gary Bisbee","Fair enough. A couple of other ones. So a quarter ago, you said fairly strongly that you are seeing no signs of economic weakness from the customer base in the U.S. and Canada, do you have the same level of conviction or is that same statement ring through today or give -- has the trade impact and some of the other things that have been out there? Have you noticed any impact in the last three months that would change that kind of statement? Thanks.","Mike Hansen ","Gary, we still like the environment that we're operating in. Aside from the weather challenges, we like the environment and our customers seem to be very healthy. They're investing. There are lots of job openings. And GDP is still at a level today and expected for the rest of the calendar year where we'd like to operate. So we haven't seen a lot of change other than the weather disruption, which was certainly real.","Gary Bisbee","Thank you. And then just one last one, the amount of SG&A leverage if we back out the one-time payment a year ago, still positive but narrowed relative to the last few quarters. I would guess that the revenue impact this quarter had -- was part of the reason. But is there anything from your perspective changing in the ability to deliver operating leverage in the near-term or was that anything else to explain that? Thank you.","Mike Hansen ","Yes, the weather that we\u2019ve talked about, the revenue challenge that we\u2019ve talked about probably took 20 basis points of additional leverage in SG&A. So we probably would have been 30 basis points better than last year in total. No, there are ups and downs we are self-insured we get some things that are -- that go up and down. We invest for example in our First Aid and Safety business where we've been growing so nicely. But there's nothing that I would look at as a challenge as we move forward to continue to see that number tweak down.","Gary Bisbee","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Hauke with R.W. Baird. ","Justin Hauke ","Yes, great. Thanks guys. Two questions here, I guess one, I think the positive that we can take away from this is the margins were pretty good considering the revenue shortfall. And, you called out some of the factors that are still out there the inflationary costs and whatnot. But I guess I was curious on the labor costs specifically, if you could just comment on maybe where that's trending were net pricing is trending? How those have changed from maybe three or six months ago?","Mike Hansen ","Yes, labor pressures, I would say, are about the same as we've seen in the first two quarters of this fiscal year. I wouldn't call it any worse. But they still remain. And as we've talked about in the past, we work diligently to deal with those. First of all, we want to retain our partners. And so, we do as much as we can to keep our partners engaged and satisfied in terms of working with us. We want to pay them the right wages for sure so that we can, again help keep them engaged.","And that's -- partner retention, which remains high for us is such an important part of managing our labor. But in addition to that, we look for opportunities for process improvement, we look for automation and other types of efficiencies and we've been doing a pretty good job of that so far, not to mention the fact that the synergies that we're getting off of the G&K integration certainly help and are timely. But they remain. And our goal is to continue to perform well despite them.","As it relates to the pricing environment, we haven't seen a lot of change from quarter-to-quarter in that environment either. And I don't look for that to change a whole lot as we move forward, at least in the next quarter or so.","Justin Hauke ","Okay, great. Second one here, just maybe more numerical, but the G&K integration expense was pretty light and your guidance to $0.09 looks like it's probably going to stay fairly light in the fourth quarter as well from the -- I think you were saying $18 million to $22 million was the total for the year. So is it because you're just ahead of schedule, and there's not more expense or those moving into 2020? Or just how should we think about the level of integration expense that remains?","Paul Adler","Yes, Justin. I mentioned earlier about the integration activities, and it's largely rerouting and then our supply chain is still hard at work. Realizing synergies as well. But, rerouting does not really drive significant costs. The purpose of the rerouting is to get those routes more dense that lowers energy costs provides us with more time to spend with the customers. So, it's a smallest bucket of the synergies. And the fact is that the larger expenses related to the integration came when the plant closings occurred, closing the plants, decommissioning them, severing and we just don't have any of that left.","So we would expect another maybe $2 million to $3 million of integration expenses in the fourth quarter. So we'll probably end the year at about $16 million in total. And then looking ahead to fiscal 2020, it's going to be very small, very nominal amount of integration expenses. But again, we're not finished with the integration activities. We're still rerouting. A lot of challenges out there for our operations, but it just doesn't drive the significant expenses that the other activities did.","Mike Hansen ","And just to be clear, there are still expenses and inefficiencies for example duplicate routing, training overtime and attempts. But the expenses Paul talking about are those that are identifiable that can be really called out into that integration line. The heavy lifting in the route optimization remains and the inefficiencies and the costs associated with it also remain, they're just really hard to call out.","So for example, when we're training SSRs to -- on new routes, we've got a little bit of duplicate labor going on when we're training and pulling them out of their off of their routes. There's a little bit of inefficiency in duplicate labor. When we've got overtime, it's hard to tell how much of that is the day-to-day and how much of that is the true integration work. So there are expenses and inefficiencies that remain. They're just much harder to call out specifically.","Justin Hauke ","That makes sense. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Dolev with Nomura Securities International.","Dan Dolev","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate it. So sorry to harp on this, but if I think about the organic growth even ex. the impact of weather, et cetera, the 6.8 it's about a 20 basis points acceleration. And if I look back your comp was getting about 80 basis points easier if I'm not wrong. Is there anything to read into that and what is driving that as far as I remember back in like 2017 you put out like 8% comp quarters like what are the odds of us getting back to those rates and what's driving the meter acceleration ex. weather? Thanks.","Mike Hansen ","Yes, the -- I mean, Dan, the 8% that you're referring to they were strong and they were without any G&K in them that was prior to G&K becoming inorganic. And so we're -- we -- I had a question from Andrew a little bit ago about how much is the legacy G&K business growing and while it's very, very difficult to tell, it's also pretty clear that that they are not growing quite at the legacy Cintas levels yet. We certainly believe that they can get there over time, but that doesn't happen overnight.","As we look to the fourth quarter, the range of revenue that we've given is a 6% to 7%. We think it's a very, very healthy range. And at the midpoint there's some acceleration there. And so we're very, very pleased with the progress that we've made. We got a little bit of a hiccup with the weather and the holiday challenges, customer closure challenges, but gosh, we're right where we wanted to be.","Dan Dolev ","Got it. And just 6% to 7% overall not just uniformly, right?","Mike Hansen ","6% to 7% overall, yes. ","Dan Dolev ","Got it. And then my second question is -- sorry.","Mike Hansen ","Go ahead.","Dan Dolev ","No, I was going to ask about the synergies in the quarter and like if you can give us I think last time you had $25 million.","Paul Adler","Yes, Dan, the synergies and we began the fiscal year and we said got it to $90 million to $95 million in total for the year. And we're on track to achieving that, we'll actually probably wind up a bit above the top end of that range. And then next fiscal year, think about incremental synergies of maybe $30 million to $35 million. So, the bottom line is that we continue to track very nicely what we committed to in the beginning, which was the $130 million to $140 million of synergies within those four years.","Dan Dolev ","Perfect. Good stuff, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.","George Tong","Hi, thanks, good afternoon. You\u2019ve previously indicated that ancillary products such as First Aid and Fire Safety have less than 20% penetration among Uniform Rental customers, can you help frame where that number can go as cross selling increases not only at G&K, but also the broader Cintas customer base?","Mike Hansen ","Yes, we haven't really talked about that a lot publicly and the reason is it's -- that's a difficult thing to specifically target, we certainly think about that in the different verticals. And some verticals are better than others for that penetration. But George, we're not really ready to give goals and targets. I would say this, the standalone businesses are still growing very, very nicely. And we think there's a lot of runway in just simply growing each business on their own. But there's no question there's more penetration opportunity available, but I'm really hesitant to put that -- put us in a box and say there's a goal there just yet.","George Tong","Got it. And then drilling down into the SAP implementation, can you give us an update on how many branches have undergone the conversion and when you would expect to start seeing margin benefits?","Paul Adler","George, we are about 57% now through the conversion, and that's about 202 operations that are now on SAP. If you remember, like this time last quarter, we were at 48% converted. So, a lot of good activity obviously in this past quarter. As far as the margin benefits, we haven't quantified any of the benefits, we've talked about and given examples in terms of the power of the system, and what it can do for our route people with a satellite based type of handheld device, the efficiencies that that brings, opportunities in our stock rooms with managing inventory and sharing it and having visibility.","But then also a lot of benefits in terms of opportunities to cross sell and look into the system of First Aid and Safety to better understand national accounts and just a lot of opportunities around big data and being able to do profitability analysis and price reviews and all that type of stuff. ","So we will have more commentary on that as we continue to get through the rollout, but a lot of those benefits for the system, especially as they relate to the top line and some profitability improvements. You need the entire network to be in and we're just over half of the way. So nothing that we can quantify for you at this point in time in terms of the benefits.","George Tong","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital.","Mario Cortellacci ","Hey guys, this is actually Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Could you give us any color on your net add stops during the quarter. And actually just curious how relevant that metric is to-date compared to it was -- compared to history because the portfolio has changed with the time. So once you see if that's actually relevant anymore.","Paul Adler","Yeah, the add stops metric, is a real -- we consider it a very old legacy Uniform Rental type of metric that, we use decades ago when we were predominantly providing uniforms and entrance mats, it might be meaningful still to some of our comp competitors. But it's not as meaningful to us because we have such a huge breadth of products and services that we have more to offer to customers than just uniforms and mats. ","And we are not also dependent upon the customer base, just adding jobs and going along with GDP and kind of being propelled or held back by employment you look back at our results and we have grown consistently in multiples of excess of GDP and jobs.","So the add stops metric, which is more about kind of same store sales, how is that particular customer growing? Are they adding or subtracting? It's not as meaningful to us. We're trying to drive the growth through penetration and through attacking new verticals like scrub rental with new products and services. ","So long winded answer to say, it's not meaningful to us, there wasn't anything significant to note in add stops. I would say that, to Mike's point earlier, we rely on penetration of our existing customers. And it was clear in looking at our operational data, that the weather and the holidays did impact that our ability to penetrate and then that's part of that 60 basis points headwind that we had this quarter.","Mario Cortellacci ","Got it. And just one more, I'll turn it over. I guess just given the portfolio changes, since the last major slowdown. Could just give us a sense of how Cintas might perform in a decelerating macro environment? I'm sure a piece of your business could be a little considered late cycle, I assume that First Aid would be a little more resilient. And I just didn't know I guess obviously a piece of the business is still levered to the employment cycle. But I guess what would that look like if there was slowdown?","Mike Hansen ","Mario, I typically answer those questions by -- with starting out with it depends on how deep and how broad that next slowdown would be. We have a very diverse customer base. We've got customers of all types in all types of verticals, customers of all sizes. And so we've got a very diverse customer base, and that helps us when things like a few years ago, the oil and gas customers really were suffering with low oil prices helped us a few years ago when there were some measurements of an industrial recession. And we still grew through those kind of things.","But it really depends on how deep and how broad. If we can hit our revenue guidance, and our EPS guidance, it will be 48 out of the last 50 years, where we have grown sales and grown profits. And that would be growing through six out of the last seven recessions. So how do we stand in the next one, depends on how deep and how broad. We have done some things since the great recession that we think are beneficial to our performance through the next slow down and that would be a broader product line, so that we have more things to offer to our prospects and our existing customers.","We have a sales team that is a little bit more sophisticated than it was prior to the great recession where we specifically attack specific certain verticals. And we sell to existing customers a little bit more proactively. So we look to drive more revenue that way. And we have probably even more diverse customers today than we had prior to the last recession where we\u2019ve really targeted things like health care and education, which are a little bit more recession resistant.","So we've made some changes since the great recession. But we've also performed very well over the course of the last 50 years in all kinds of economic cycles. But I would always go back to dependent on how deep and how broad.","Mario Cortellacci ","Got it, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Good evening, guys. You just gave synergy guidance for next year as well on an earlier question. I found it interesting because it sounds like you're trending really well on the 90 to 95. So, the inferences you're at the high end of that. And then the incremental guide 30 to 35 the high end of that gets you to the 130 the low end of the total. So, just kind of curious, is there might you finish a year earlier than originally anticipated? Or might be there -- might there be incremental upside that we see in this? And, if so, where the areas sourcing, routing, you touched on a little bit books, where the areas that maybe you're progressing ahead of that are worth addressing at this juncture? Thanks.","Mike Hansen ","Yes, great question. Scott. I would say this, we have some sourcing synergies that we are still working on. And as we've talked about, they come a little longer because we had to burn through G&K inventory. And then we have to source from either our new supply chains or put the volume, the greater volume into our existing supply chains. We have to then get the inventory to our locations and put it in service where it becomes -- where it begins to amortize. And so there will be synergies in our fiscal 2021 that still are from that global supply chain effort. And it's hard to pull those forward.","So getting back to your question, I think there may be a little bit of upside, and I think that upside, you may have heard me say a few times in the past, I think the biggest bucket for the upside is that sourcing and supply chain. Where we kind of built that opportunity off of the G&K inventory and supply chain. And the opportunity -- the upside opportunity might be does that impact the Cintas sourcing and supply chain. In other words, does the combined volume then help even the Cintas pricing to drive lower as well.","I'm not ready to give any kind of numbers, but I think that's where the opportunity lies. And as you suggested, we expect to be at the low end of that range next fiscal year and driving towards the high end and possibly through the high end in fiscal 2021.","Scott Schneeberger","Great, thanks. It\u2019s good progress. More a housekeeping question for my follow up, tax rate has been jumping around and just for our benefit in modeling fiscal 2020, how would you think about it for the annual and quarterly as we model out ahead, just some rules of thumb because I think without a little guidance that could be all over the place?","Mike Hansen ","Yes, you're right about that, Scott. I think with the with the change in the stock compensation a few years ago, this tax rate has really been bouncing around because we don't -- we can't control the exercises of options and we can't control the stock price. We talked a little bit about a 24.5% in the fourth quarter. So that is our expectation there. And as we look to finish this year, if we do that 24.5% in the fourth quarter, that would put us at a 20.6% for the full fiscal 2019 year. That's lower than we would expect our typical run rate to be.","With our stock performance, we had a tremendous amount of exercises this year. And it's hard to say that those are going to repeat next year. So I would expect that our tax rate would be right in the range of 22% next year, with a fairly low tax rate in the first quarter because we generally get more stock comp benefits followed by a higher rate in Qs two through four. And I would suggest maybe using fiscal 2019's quarterly rates that we've talked about as maybe a bit of a guide to ratably get you there. But I would say for the full year, I think a 22% type of a number would be right, where I would say that's currently our expectation.","So obviously then that if we are at a 22% next year and a 20.6% this year, that puts a little bit of pressure on us with that increase.","Scott Schneeberger","Great, thanks. I appreciate that incremental color. Good job, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.","Tim Mulrooney","Yes, good afternoon, guys. Pretty much hit on everything. But maybe I'll talk -- ask about the balance sheet, a 2 times leverage it seems like a good point to check in on your capital allocation priorities. How should we think about capital deployment after CapEx between the dividend, share repurchase and M&A?","Mike Hansen ","Yes, so our cash flow remains healthy. In fact it was very good in the third quarter and we expect it to continue to perform well into the future. That creates opportunities obviously. We want to continue to invest in the business, we will do that by growing the business via things like adding routes, adding sales people and doing advertising and R&D. Those things will run through the P&L just like they have, but those are very, very important pieces for us. Our CapEx, I would expect to continue kind of in that 4% to 4.5%. And that's very important to us. We want to make sure we are creating the capacity for growth. Those are our two highest priorities.","Aside from that, we certainly love the tuck-in acquisitions, and we will continue to look for opportunities there as best we can in our Rental, First Aid and Fire businesses. We will also look at there are larger opportunities, particularly in our existing businesses, we would love to take a look at those. So we'll be as aggressive as we can be on looking for great value out of small and larger types of acquisitions, particularly within our businesses.","That's going to leave us though with some cash. And so, we certainly love to increase the dividend we've done so every year since 1983. I would expect that the Board will continue to look very strongly at that, and then there may be buy backup opportunity. And as we've shown so far this fiscal year, where we've acquired almost $550 million through our first three quarters. We like that program, we like the momentum of the business. And I would expect that we'll continue to look at that opportunistically.","In addition to all of that, our EBITDA continues to grow and we like that 2 times leverage neighborhood. We are there right now and our expectation is we\u2019ll continue to be in that range.","Tim Mulrooney","Okay, Thanks, Mike. Thank you for the thoughtful answer. Just on the M&A front, are there still areas in the U.S. where you feel there may be more room to grow through M&A in your Rental business? And also what's your position with respect to expanding internationally? Thanks for your time.","Mike Hansen ","Sure, from a U.S. perspective, it's more about the opportunities and it is the geography. We are in almost all geographies in U.S. and Canada, but there are still 600 or so independent operators out there. And so the opportunity really is more about the location of those independent operators and having a dialogue with them and understanding if we can team up and create long-term value together. So we will, will continue to look for those opportunities, no matter the geography in the U.S. and Canada.","From an international perspective, I would say this, we love the U.S. and Canadian opportunities. We think there are a lot there, we will continue to invest heavily in those businesses. I think there may be a time in our future where we get in into other international geographies. It's not our highest priority. But I think that's something that we\u2019ll keep our eyes on. I would say that in our business, startups are pretty difficult. And so it would likely be through some sort of M&A, but it would have to be with the right partner, in the right geography, and one in which we felt like we could operate successfully.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber ","Hey, guys, good afternoon, and thanks for keeping the call going here. Most of the questions have been asked and answered, but maybe just going back to the CapEx commentary for a second. I think, earlier this year, you had brought the CapEx number down a little bit because you had sort of message that you're able to extract some of the -- some benefits from the G&K business. ","So how should we be thinking about CapEx going forward? Is it brick and mortar? Are you -- do you feel like you need more capacity here? Or is there anything that you could point to that you'll be spending money on specifically? Thank you.","Mike Hansen ","Well, we -- you're absolutely right, Seth, we did get some benefit from the G&K acquisition in terms of capacity, and it allowed us to delay certainly some CapEx related to new capacity both in plants and in our routes. But we're continuing to grow and we're continuing to grow well. And capacity is really a local thing. And so there are certainly still geographies where there may not have been a G&K presence, where we're growing well, where we need capacity.","And so we'll continue to look for or we will have a CapEx related to laundry capacity and routing capacity. I would say from a growth perspective most of our CapEx growth will be in that form, laundry facility capacity and routes and i.e. trucks. Same goes for our First Aid and Fire businesses as well. We are growing very, very nicely. And the growth will come primarily in the way of additional trucks. We\u2019ll certainly have some maintenance CapEx too, but from a growth perspective, yes, certainly bricks and mortar and trust.","Seth Weber ","Super, that's all I had guys. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And we have another other questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Mike Hansen for any closing remarks.","Mike Hansen","Well, thank you again for joining us tonight. We will issue our fourth quarter financial results in","July, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect."],"5564":["Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call December 20, 2018  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Mike Hansen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Paul Adler - Vice President and Treasurer","Analysts","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley","Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","George Tong - Goldman Sachs","Andy Wittmann - Baird","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel","John Healy - Northcoast Research","Tim Mulrooney - William Blair","Operator","Good day, everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Hansen","Thank you and good evening. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas\u2019 Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2019. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company\u2019s current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","Our revenue for the second quarter, which ended November 30, was $1.718 billion, an increase of 7% over last year\u2019s second quarter. The organic revenue growth rate which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was also 7%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.6%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10.2%. Since the announcement of the G&K Services acquisition nearly 2 years ago, we communicated our expected trajectory of the acquired revenue and its impact on Uniform Rental and Facility Services growth rates. We have discussed that the organic revenue growth rate would reach bottom in the first quarter of this fiscal year, due to the lapping of the G&K acquisition, and we expect the organic growth rate to accelerate during the remainder of fiscal \u201819.","Our second quarter rental organic growth rate of 6.6% rebounded as expected from the first quarter\u2019s rate of 4.9%. In fact, this organic growth rate of 6.6% exceeded our internal expectations. We have seen our sales rep productivity reach pre-acquisition levels, and we have seen good performance in penetrating legacy G&K customers, particularly in the hygiene space.","Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal \u201819 of $775 million increased 8.2% from last year\u2019s second quarter. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 45.1% for the second quarter of fiscal \u201819 compared to 44.6% in the second quarter of last fiscal year. Uniform rental and facility services gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved to 45.3% from 44.7% in the second quarter of last fiscal year. Gross margin improved in the quarter and year-to-date despite some cost headwinds we cited on last quarter\u2019s earnings call, including wage inflation and higher costs for certain commodities.","Reported operating income for the second quarter was $275 million compared to $235 million in last year\u2019s second quarter. Operating income was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $7.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201819 and $13.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal \u201818. Excluding integration expenses, our second quarter operating income grew 14.2%, resulting in an operating margin of 16.5% compared to 15.5% last year.","Net interest expense was $4 million lower in the second quarter of fiscal \u201819 compared to last year due to debt reduction. Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal \u201819 of $243 million increased to 76% from last year\u2019s second quarter net income from continuing operations of $138 million. Diluted EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal \u201819 were $2.18, an increase of about 76% from the EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal \u201818 of $1.24.","Net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a lower effective tax rate in this fiscal year second quarter compared to last year\u2019s second quarter, primarily from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Net income and EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal \u201819 benefited $0.47 from a gain on the sale of a cost method investment. Also net income and EPS from continuing operations were negatively impacted in the second quarter of fiscal \u201819 and \u201818 by $0.05 and $0.07 respectively from integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition. Excluding these special items, our second quarter EPS from continuing operations were $1.76 compared to last year\u2019s EPS from continuing operations of $1.31. We\u2019ve provided these figures in a table in today\u2019s press release.","As a result of our second quarter results and forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, we are increasing our annual guidance. We are raising our revenue guidance from a range of $6.8 billion to $6.855 billion to a range of $6.87 billion to $6.91 billion and EPS from continuing operations from a range of $7.19 to $7.29 to a new range of $7.30 to $7.38. Note the following regarding the EPS guidance. It assumes an additional $2.5 million to $3 million of interest expense from last quarter\u2019s guidance due to having some commercial paper. It still assumes an effective rate of 21.7% for the year. This is the same rate guidance as last quarter. It assumes a total diluted share count for computing EPS of 112 million shares. It does not assume any additional G&K integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these in the range of $18 million to $22 million for the full fiscal year. As our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Scott Farmer was quoted in today\u2019s press release, we are pleased with our progress on the integration of the G&K acquisition and the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system.","We are on track to achieve another year of solid revenue and earnings growth. And additionally, we continue to generate strong cash flow and commit to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. As a reminder on December 7, we paid an annual dividend of $2.05 per share, an increase of 26.5% over last year\u2019s annual dividend; and through the end of our second quarter, we purchased $447 million of Cintas stock under our buyback authorizations.","I will now turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Adler","Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal second quarter contained the same number of work days as the prior year second quarter. Additionally, there will be no workday differences the remainder of the fiscal year as each quarter of fiscal \u201819 contains the same number of work days as the comparable quarter of fiscal \u201818. We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement. ","Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.390 billion, an increase of 6.3% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.6%.","Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 45.3% for the second quarter compared to 44.7% in last year\u2019s second quarter, an improvement of 60 basis points. Energy expenses as a percentage of revenue was 2.4% equal to last year\u2019s second quarter. We are pleased with the gross margin expansion this quarter and year-to-date and our ability to overcome wage inflation increased commodity costs such as for hangers which are sourced mostly from China and the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an ERP system implementation.","Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment\u2019s revenue for the second quarter was $153 million, which was 10.3% higher than last year\u2019s second quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 10.2%. This segment\u2019s gross margin was 48% in the second quarter compared to 46.9% in last year\u2019s second quarter, an increase of 110 basis points. Organic growth continued to be very strong and was benefited by penetration of existing customers and national account new business, solid revenue growth and expanding gross margins are confirmation of the value that businesses in all sectors of the economy place on outsourcing to Cintas, the management of their first aid, safety and training programs to help keep their employees healthy, safe and productive.","Our fire protection services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. Uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low single-digits and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multimillion dollar accounts. Uniform direct sale however is a key business for us and its customers are offing significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All other revenue was $174 million, an increase of 9.3% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. The organic growth rate was 6.9% and was driven by 14% organic growth in the fire business. All other gross margin was 41.2% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42.1% for last year\u2019s second quarter. Improvement in the fire business gross margin year-over-year was more than offset by lower gross margins in the uniform direct sale business.","Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.6% in the second quarter compared to 29.1% in last year\u2019s second quarter. In the second quarter of fiscal \u201819, it was a benefit of $6.1 million from lower commission expense resulting from the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 revenue from contracts with customers. We discussed this on our July earnings call when we provided our initial fiscal \u201819 guidance. In addition to this benefit, we are getting good leverage from increased revenue covering fixed costs. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter benefited from the new U.S. tax legislation.","Our EPS guidance for fiscal \u201819 assumes an effective tax rate of 21.7%. Note that the effective tax rate will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to discrete items, including the amount of stock compensation benefits in each period. Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30 was $88 million. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $73 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $58 million in uniform rental and facility services; $10 million in first aid and safety; and $5 million in all other. We expect fiscal \u201819 CapEx to be in the range of $270 million to $285 million. As of November 30, total debt was $2.710 billion, $2.536 billion is fixed interest rate debt and $173 million is variable rate commercial paper. And November 30, our leverage was 2.1x debt to EBITDA.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Well, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you. Good evening gentlemen. First broader question obviously is, -- just curious obviously you have seen the market reacting in a fearful manner. Just curious from what you are hearing from your customers, any signs of things slowing down or any signs of worry based on what you are hearing and seeing there?","Mike Hansen","No, Manav. I think from based on our results, which we believe are pretty good, we have seen a pretty good economic environment for the last quarter, and we are not hearing signs of slowdown right now. And I would suggest that our guidance is pretty strong as well and reflects confidence that we are going to finish the year pretty strong, so no.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. And then on the G&K side, you talked about making some progress, I guess on the revenue synergy side, especially in the hygiene area. I was just hoping you could help maybe quantify or give some color there and how we should think about what the future opportunities there are?","Mike Hansen","Well, we haven\u2019t quantified that specifically other than to say certainly that Cintas percentage of hygiene revenue is greater than G&K\u2019s was prior to us acquiring them. We are making some nice progress on that. I don\u2019t have a specific number to share with you, because many of the accounts are kind of blended in, but we certainly know that we are getting some traction there, and we like that restroom product opportunity. We like this substituting our entrance mats for theirs. We think there is still an opportunity in the future for Carhartt garments and other things, but making some progress so far and we like what we have seen.","Manav Patnaik","Alright, got it. And then just last question, just moving pieces on the energy side with obviously the oil prices down, any color on how we should think of that or if you\u2019ve factored that -- some of that in your increased guidance today?","Paul Adler","We have assumed that we may still have just a slight touch of pressure for the rest of the year, even though we didn\u2019t have any in the second quarter. It\u2019s hard to predict what that\u2019s going to look like for the second half, but right now we haven\u2019t really changed our outlook and that was to be up slightly in the second half of the year.","Manav Patnaik","Alright. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And next will be Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just looking at the guidance, this quarter you bought back just under $370 million of stock and in the back half of the year that should be a pretty nice help to you just given the lower share count from that. I am calculating somewhere around, call it $0.08. You beat consensus this quarter, I know that\u2019s not necessarily your internal target, but let\u2019s just say you beat by at least a couple of cents there, and then obviously you mentioned the higher interest, so maybe $0.02 from that as an offset, but basically a $0.10 guidance raise sort of implies to me that either maybe there is some conservatism there or just trying to get a sense of -- I know you just mentioned that you are expecting a good back half of the year, but like basically, why not raise by more? Sorry for the longwinded question.","Paul Adler","No problem. Toni, the low end of our guidance now is higher than the high end of our guidance last quarter. You are right on it in terms of the second half of the year buyback impact. But Toni, the second half of the year, last year we did operating margins of 16.3%. The guidance that we have provided would suggest the high \u2013 mid-to-high 16%, so there is still going to be some nice margin improvement in the second half of the year. The revenue is looking very good. That was a pretty good increase as well, where the low end of the range is higher than our previous \u2013 I am sorry the low end of the range is higher than our previous high end of the range. We think it\u2019s a pretty nice second half of the year. And if we can achieve that guidance, that\u2019s a pretty darn good year with margin expansion, continued G&K integration, SAP integration, and increasing organic growth.","Toni Kaplan","Okay, great. And then just one more on buybacks, just given you have 744 authorization remaining in your program, just given where the stock has been trading recently and you just did a lot of buybacks in this past quarter like how should we be thinking about sort of your views on timing of repurchases or your \u2013 going forward? Thank you.","Mike Hansen","Well, our remaining authorization is a little bit over $800 million, it\u2019s about $860 million. We did run out a previous authorization during the quarter. We expect it to continue to have pretty good cash flow. We obviously think that the stock price today is an opportunity, but we also like our leverage level, we\u2019re at 2.1 times, that\u2019s right at our target. And I would suggest that we\u2019re going to continue to be right around that level unless we see something different change, something new come about. We certainly have seen it to be a buying opportunity though, and I think that there\u2019s been certainly an overreaction to our stock in the last 90 days.","Toni Kaplan","Thanks. Happy holidays.","Mike Hansen","Thank you. You too.","Operator","And our next question will come from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gary Bisbee","Hey guys, good afternoon. I guess the first question, just last quarter you talked about the second half of the year getting back to 5.5% to 6% organic revenue in rentals, obviously you blew right through that, and you\u2019ve taking the guidance up. But as we look at it, it appears like the comps get easier on a year-over-year basis. Is there anything that would lead to any deceleration from that or was there anything that was a benefit this quarter? Just trying to think if this is a good run rate in the near term?","Mike Hansen","Well, when we think about this quarter, we think about the impact of better sales rep productivity than we initially expected, so I don\u2019t see that changing much. We also talked about the penetration opportunities with all of our customers remains pretty strong. So that guidance range that we gave is something in the way of 6% to the low 7%, and we think that\u2019s a pretty good range for us to be in. That\u2019s right in our sweet spot.","Gary Bisbee","You \u2013 on the last couple of calls, you\u2019ve mentioned the national accounts opportunity of First Aid and Safety. Is that \u2013 I don\u2019t remember hearing you mention that a lot over the last few years. Is that a newer opportunity or just something that you\u2019re calling out now and I guess, I\u2019ve always thought as much \u2013 mostly a local business, what are you doing on the national account front?","Mike Hansen","It\u2019s not necessarily a new opportunity. It is one that we have started to talk about and we love the opportunity and it is the same as you might think in rental, where we have \u2013 we have the ability to provide large multi-location customers with a consistent Safety \u2013 First Aid and Safety Program and that\u2019s important to these large customers. It allows them to track their locations a little bit better, to understand their compliance on a more consistent basis. And so we\u2019ve got an offering that not many others can provide and that has become a real nice growth opportunity for us in the business, and one that we started to call out a little bit more.","Gary Bisbee","Great. And then just on the tax rate, can you help us flush out what sort of the statutory rate or the normalized rate post-tax reform now that we\u2019re almost a year into that? And how much is the tax rate benefiting from that equity comp accounting change of year and a half ago or so? And I guess, I\u2019m just trying to think over the next few years, what could the tax rate go up to if that accounting change benefit around the equity comp were to flatten out?","Mike Hansen","Yes. It\u2019s a real good question, Gary. We certainly with the new accounting guidance, we\u2019re going to see a little bit more fluctuation in our tax rate. I \u2013 we expect it to be in a 24-ish type of a percent range. And again that can move now, not all of that difference from 24% to 21.7% is the equity comp, but it certainly is a good chunk of that. If that turns around, we could see it get closer to 24% and in some cases may even get higher than 24%, but that\u2019s kind of where we see a steady range. And what you saw in the second quarter of 24.2% roughly is a quarter without a big stock compensation benefit like you saw in the first quarter.","Gary Bisbee","Great. And then if I could just sneak one other. Is there any update on that accounting change benefit for this year, I think you said 16 to 19, the higher end of 16 to 19, is that still a good run rate? Thank you very much.","Mike Hansen","The benefit I think Paul called that out, it was $6.1 million in the quarter.","Gary Bisbee","For the year [Multiple Speakers] \u201818 [ph] still \u2013 ","Paul Adler","Yes, in that range.","Mike Hansen","I think given that it\u2019s been what 11 in the first half of the year, it\u2019s probably going to be closer to that type of 20 to 22 type of a range.","Gary Bisbee","Thank you very much. Happy holidays.","Mike Hansen","Thanks. You too.","Operator","And moving on, our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie.","Hamzah Mazari","Good evening. Thank you. My first question is just on cross-selling as well. Maybe if you could just frame for us how many customers are buying multiple services from you today versus sort of historically, and where does that number go through, or what can it go to, any thoughts on penetration there?","Mike Hansen","Yes, we don\u2019t have those numbers to share with you, Hamzah. But we think there\u2019s certainly is a big opportunity there. As we\u2019ve talked in the past, the biggest penetration is with our uniform rental and entrance mat products. But all of our other products would then be under 20% penetrated, and we certainly think that we can get above 20% with many of those. So we still have a lot of run rate. And we \u2013 that certainly has been beneficial to the growth over the last few years.","Hamzah Mazari","Yes. Got it. And then just on First Aid, one of your competitors said recently that they are going to get into that market. Just maybe frame for us, how sustainable is that 10% organic growth number and sort of the competitive dynamic you see in First Aid today just sort of update us there?","Mike Hansen","Sure. We \u2013 when we think about that business, we like the high singles and low doubles digits in terms of organic growth run rate and do we think it\u2019s sustainable, we do, certainly in the next \u2013 for the next several years, absent a big change in the macro environment. You know in this business the biggest competition is what we might call in the rental business the no programmer or the customer that\u2019s doing it themselves, there are still many of them out there and we believe we\u2019ve got a great value to provide to them. So we do think there are many opportunities out there for our service and we think there\u2019s a great value in our ability to deliver that compared to the do-it-yourself [sic] and the catalog purchasers and that kind of thing. So we like the \u2013 we love the business. We like the organic growth rate. We think that can continue.","Hamzah Mazari","Great. And then just last question, you talked about buybacks, your debt is pretty low on leverage sort of 2.1. How are you guys thinking about M&A? Do you have too much on your plate with the synergies and ERP or are you sort of ready to look at M&A maybe in a different vertical? Any thoughts on M&A? Thank you very much.","Mike Hansen","We are looking at M&A, we are ready, and if \u2013 the thing about M&A is, we can\u2019t always predict when those opportunities come along, and so we want to make sure that we are ready and we\u2019re looking at \u2013 we\u2019re looking in our \u2013 certainly in our rental business, in our First Aid and Safety business and our Fire business, if we can find tuck-ins or even larger than tuck-in opportunities, we will certainly take a look at them. We think there is a lot of long-term value in that kind of investment.","Hamzah Mazari","Great. Have a very good New Year. Thank you.","Mike Hansen","Thanks. You too.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi. When you mentioned what was driving the strength in rental organic revenue growth, you mentioned penetration of existing accounts and some national account wins. I was wondering if you just give us directionally the other typical drivers of revenue growth, how was retention year-over-year, is net realized pricing accelerating at all, and, of course, just a quick comment on add-stops?","Mike Hansen","That was led by our new business as it usually is, but we\u2019ve seen some real nice productivity out of our sales team. That sales team also as we\u2019ve talked about over the last several years, that sales team also sells into existing customers and that\u2019s been going very well also. And so that has helped to the historical net add-stop metric that we talk about in our industry. It certainly has been positive from the standpoint of getting some benefit from our sales team. Retention is right where we want it to be and it\u2019s as good as it\u2019s been. It\u2019s in the mid 90% range and has not changed a bunch over the last couple of quarters. And pricing remains favorable pricing environment. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s changed much in the last several quarters, but still a pretty good environment nonetheless.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, just clarify what you meant before when sales productivity is back to pre-merger levels. Did you mean that both the Cintas legacy sales force and now you inherited G&K sales force were back to Cintas levels of sales productivity, I didn\u2019t quite understand if you meant both?","Mike Hansen","Well, let\u2019s be clear, it\u2019s one sales team now.","Andrew Steinerman","It is.","Mike Hansen","And so we measure it altogether and it is higher combined than it was pre-acquisition. So in other words, our new partners and our recently hired partners from that deal, they have made some real nice progress and are certainly being productive in a way that we want them to be productive.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question will come from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.","George Tong","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. You\u2019ve indicated that you\u2019re assuming a touch of pressure for the rest of the year from energy. Can you elaborate on whether you\u2019re internally planning for oil prices to stay at current levels as you think about the demand impact and how you expect gross margins to be impacted by energy?","Paul Adler","Well let\u2019s talk about the pressures, the cost pressures that we\u2019ve cited. From an energy perspective, it was flat in the quarter year-over-year and we\u2019re expecting it to be just up slightly. We don\u2019t get specific enough to provide you an oil price, but we think it will be up slightly for the back half of the year. We have talked a little bit about the labor. We\u2019re seeing that in pockets as we\u2019ve said over the last several quarters, and that\u2019s certainly is within our numbers for the first half of the year and it is contemplated in our guidance for the second half of the year. So the great news is, we\u2019ve been able to increase gross margins in this quarter and for the year and expect that to continue despite some pressure from labor. We also talk a little bit about some commodities that you can kind of think of this as the trade impact, right, and last, if you think about China for example, we\u2019ve seen a bucket announced in July of tariff increases on a certain set of products and services, we were not impacted by that. The second bucket came in September. We were slightly impacted by that and we touched on that last quarter. And again, it\u2019s a pretty small amount, but that may continue.","And certainly, then it\u2019s too early to tell on anything else that may change with China. We also \u2013 we didn\u2019t touch on it last time, but certainly NAFTA has been in the news quite a bit. And if we can continue to see the structure to replace NAFTA or continue NAFTA, but if we can see the structure to replace NAFTA in the USMCA, they\u2019re not much of a change there either. So the really good news is, while we do see a little bit of an impact, it hasn\u2019t been significant and it is certainly within our guided numbers. And really while we\u2019re on-trade, if we think about our supply chain, we\u2019ve got a really good global supply chain, and we\u2019ve talked about how we control much of what we purchase and when I say control, we either have owned manufacturing to a lesser extent, but we also control then fabric purchases and the shipment of those fabrics around the world to different sowing suppliers. We have the ability to be flexible with that and as trade \u2013 and as trade changes we have the ability to be flexible where many of our competitors do not, they are either tied to their own manufacturing or tied to third-party suppliers, we have the flexibility to be much more flexible than that. And so as we think about all of these different pressures, we like the way we are able to perform, we like the way we\u2019re able to leverage our infrastructure to find efficiencies, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in this guidance and in our current results, we\u2019re able to increase our gross and operating margins despite some of these pressures. Now that could change if the macro environment or trade significantly changes and we\u2019ll certainly let you know about that. But as we stand today, we like the way we\u2019re able to adapt to some changes in the environment and still improve margins.","George Tong","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And as a follow-up, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the manufacturing verticals and in the oil and gas verticals given the recent move in oil prices, if the pipeline looking out over the next several quarters has changed at all, especially when you compare to earlier oil cycles with that have experienced similar levels of decline?","Mike Hansen","Yes, I can\u2019t say that we\u2019ve seen much of a change at this point in time, it may be a little early. But we\u2019ve seen at least our business be pretty healthy in those and many other verticals.","George Tong","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And next will be Andy Wittmann with Baird.","Andy Wittmann","Great. Thanks. I just thought I would ask and maybe I missed it in the script, but could you talk about the SAP implementation, Mike, can you talk about maybe an update on where you are in terms of the number of locations or maybe the percentage of revenue that is now operating under that system and kind of what your outlook is here on the implementation in terms of timing if the endpoint of that has moved?","Paul Adler","Andy, it\u2019s Paul. We did not comment on SAP in particular in the script, but we are still making nice progress. I think last quarter we mentioned, but I can\u2019t remember the number of locations, but we said that we had implemented about 42% of them and we\u2019re now at about 48%, so just about halfway through. So again like we\u2019ve talked about previously, things are going very well because of the nature of the implementation and how our existing operating new IT system is with a series of new AS400s boxes all over, it takes time to go from one to the other to the other, but everything is going well and we\u2019re still on track to complete the implementation in fiscal \u201820.","Andy Wittmann","Great. Thanks. And maybe just a kind of a similar question given that a lot of this is concurrent. But just on the G&K integration, this was the year with a lot of the re-routing, which is obviously a very tricky thing or can be. Can you talk about where you are on that key thing, process in terms of how much has been re-routed and how that\u2019s going? And then maybe just more broadly on G&K overall, as you get more intertwined here, how are you feeling about that synergy number and what was recognized in the run rate maybe that synergies that you recognized in the quarter in the run rate that you are on today?","Paul Adler","Sure. The route optimization continues, but as we\u2019ve talked about, we remain cautious in doing that because of that, really touches the customers it\u2019s movement of volume, it\u2019s affecting our SSR relationships and so we\u2019re being very cautious I don\u2019t have a percentage or $1 revenue number to share, Andy but, we are continuing to move forward with that and it\u2019s going well and I think the cautious approach is certainly helping us from an overall G&K standpoint as you mentioned, it continues to get more and more intertwined and part of the re-routing and route optimization is even more intertwining so I think, I\u2019ve talked a little bit about this, where if we have multiple locations, legacy Cintas and legacy G&K part of that route optimization, results in volume possibly moving from one plant to another so even a legacy G&K facility today that has participated in route optimization may have some legacy Cintas volume in there so it gets more and more intertwined however, we certainly like the performance that we\u2019ve seen out of the business, out of the integration activities and we still feel very good about the synergy numbers that we\u2019ve put out there we estimate that the current quarter is about $25 million in synergies that continues us very well onto our expectation for this fiscal \u201819 year and we still feel very good about hitting our targets for the overtime for the entire acquisition.","Andy Wittmann","Great, I will leave it there. Have a good evening.","Mike Hansen","Thanks.","Operator","And the next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Good evening guys. Actually, three. I want to slip one here in front in Uniform Rental Facility Services, I\u2019m just I\u2019m curious, you may have said it, I might have missed it the fiscal second half organic growth because the 6.6 was last year than you had expected I\u2019m just curious what is the expectation in the second half, are we talking high sixes or better or should be tempered because you said, kind of I just kind of curious if there are any more clarification, if I missed it?","Paul Adler","We don\u2019t give guidance by segment, Scott but, the guidance range that we do have for the total company is about 6 to 7.2, I think and that would certainly suggest that there is room for continued acceleration in that range.","Scott Schneeberger","Right, thanks. Appreciate it. That\u2019s helpful. So, visibility is my question. It\u2019s been asked a lot, obviously you guys and you mentioned some new business wins in the way that maybe trickles into the back half it sounds like you\u2019re very confident for the back half I\u2019m curious if you could talk maybe to some of your end markets, what the visibility would be out, you know, you have to speak to your current business conditions but what visibility is typically can you see out more than six-months and if so how far? Thanks.","Paul Adler","Well, we try to see out as far as we can and that\u2019s we prep from an external point of view, we generally keep our guidance to the current fiscal year internally, we are certainly looking ahead and how we expect to perform in fiscal \u201820 and \u201821 and going forward I would say this, Scott absent a significant change in the macro, we like the way we are performing right now. Our sales force is performing very well, our integration continues and we as we get more and more of that behind us, we can get more and more efficient in the way we operate we like our products and services, we think it\u2019s a broad opportunity, we are not certainly not fully penetrated and so we continue to like the opportunity to sell to existing customers so, we feel like the business is running very well and I don\u2019t see a change in our ability to execute, unless something happens in the macro that throws a wrench in the works but what we are we all here at Cintas look forward to is getting more and more of the integration and the SAP implementation behind us so that we can even become a little bit more efficient in the way we operate.","Scott Schneeberger","Okay, great answer. Thanks. And lastly, the CapEx guidance went down this quarter from last quarter, which went down from the prior quarter not huge, but it\u2019s trickling down I\u2019m just curious, is that maybe SAP related or is it something else, just kind of curious on that development?","Mike Hansen","It\u2019s purely timing, Scott. We are continuing certainly to invest where we need to, some of it is timing from the standpoint of when we may need to bring a new plant online that can move a little bit here and there, depending on the situations in those local markets so, more than anything, it\u2019s just timing.","Scott Schneeberger","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And the next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi, thank you for taking questions. Hi, Paul. Just wanted to ask a little bit on the free cash flow, it\u2019s down first half like 40 million AR. DSO is up 3 days sequentially. Is there a build in anticipation of future sales or something, is there a timing thing or just kind of build up as you\u2019re expecting continued sales execution if you give us some clarity on them?","Paul Adler","Yes, I mean as you can see it\u2019s on working capital and there is really two, I guess two larger categories that are driving it and both are temporary so we don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything structural here and that we\u2019re concerned with one is, accounts receivable I mean, you can certainly see that on the balance sheet and on the cash flow statement and we don\u2019t have concerns about collectability our customers is really need and once what we provide and they do pay, but Mike has talked many times on prior calls about the inefficiencies that exist within the organization when you have two significant projects going on at same time the G&K integration, the SAP implementation, we have a lot of system conversions, customers are impacted, billing changes, invoices look different and because of that disruption it is causing some slowdown in cash coming in a little bit of a build of AR but again, we believe it\u2019s nothing, but temporary and we will collect.","Mike Hansen","And let\u2019s not forget, we\u2019ve got some really nice growth and that\u2019s certainly increases the AR and there was about close to a $20 million impact from the rev rec adoption.","Paul Adler","Yes. And to build on Mike\u2019s comment about the growth the other bucket is inventory and we talked last quarter about the fact that to support our growth we have a new distribution center facility services distribution center that came online, we\u2019re building inventory to ramp that up and get ready to put that operation in place so we\u2019re still burning off that inventory it\u2019s a little bit elevated at this point in time and then finally Shlomo we have a little bit of inventory build, because what we\u2019re finding is we\u2019ve had skews historically with just Cintas stand-alone that were not sufficient enough in the demand for us to inventory them in stock of them in our distribution centers so what would happen is our operations would just order these items from various vendors directly and they would ship back to those operations, but now with the increased volume from G&K, it does make sense to put more skewed in the distribution manage it centrally negotiate better cost by doing that, and so that is a little bit of an inventory build, but ultimately again that\u2019s a timing thing and that\u2019s a measure we\u2019re putting in place because we believe that will help us manage cost and lower them enough.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, great. Thanks for the color. And then just, it\u2019s been close to a year since Aramark and AmeriPride, I was just wondering if you are seeing any change in terms of their competitiveness there kind of a year into their integration. It was mentioned that they are planning to get into First Aid and Hygiene. I was just wondering from your guys in the ground, the ones that are actually talking to customers and noticing who else is driving around, are you seeing any changes from them that you\u2019re kind of monitoring?","Mike Hansen","Well, we always like to monitor what our competitors are doing? And that\u2019s not just Aramark and AmeriPride, but all of our competitors I would say nothing significant that we would call out at this point.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And moving on to John Healy with Northcoast Research.","John Healy","Thank you, Mike. I wanted to ask a question, just trying to look at legacy Cintas customers and what Cintas customers now, but acquired through G&K, if you look at the revenue per staff per the revenue, per where however you kind of maybe boil that metric down what would you say is the difference between the Cintas legacy customer and what you acquired from G&K and if you look out over the next year or two how much of that gap do you think you still has potential to close?","Mike Hansen","Well, we our revenue per stop certainly was greater than G&K was prior to the acquisition, and we think there certainly remains that opportunity we are, I would say we\u2019re closing the gap, but that\u2019s going to be a very it\u2019s a slow trip I guess, and it will take some time and one thing to keep in mind is we\u2019re still adding many new customers every year and those customers, we want to continue, we have the opportunity to continue to penetrate as well so I don\u2019t have a very specific metric that I can share, but certainly our revenue per staff was greater and there still is more opportunity both in our existing our legacy customers and the legacy G&K customers we like that penetration opportunity.","John Healy","Okay, fair enough. And then I wanted to ask what is the movement in oil and doesn\u2019t sound like you guys have seen great change in the business was there much difference between how the U.S. and the Canadian operations performed in the quarter, just kind of curious if you\u2019re seeing much deviation there?","Mike Hansen","No, I mean there\u2019s a lot going on in both countries in terms of implementations and integrations and I would say no, nothing to call out.","John Healy","Okay, great. And then just kind of one big picture question for you, Mike, I feel like every business leaders comments are extremely scrutinized right now in terms of how they feel about the economy and pace of investments and things all along those lines when I hear your call and look at your numbers, there really isn\u2019t much to be negative about I mean quite strong across the board and you guys are buying a ton of stock back beneath the surface though, are you doing anything different versus 3 months ago, than you thought you would be in terms of hiring people? Making any sort of internal investments? Whether it\u2019s in the technology or logistics or operations? I was just curious, from a CFO\u2019s perspective, are you doing anything different versus what you thought maybe 3 months ago?","Mike Hansen","The only thing we are doing is the revenue and the growth has been better than we thought 90 days ago certainly as you can tell from our guidance raise and we continue to invest for the future we like the way that the economy is operating right now it creates and provides a lot of opportunity for our products and services in all of our businesses and we\u2019re continuing to move forward the last thing we want to do is start pulling back on our growth levers, it\u2019s simply to try to predict a change in the economy, we are continuing to invest and grow like we set out to do at the beginning of this fiscal year.","John Healy","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And the next question will come from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.","Tim Mulrooney","Hi, guys. Thanks for fitting me in at the end here. So, now that you basically got half your branches converted to the new SAP system do you have any early takeaways that you can share with us, with respect to the new system? Have you been positively surprised by anything? Finding new opportunities and how are these branches responding to change management which I know can be difficult, sometimes any extra color here would be great?","Mike Hansen","Yes, I think the further we get into the integration the implementation of SAP, I would say, the easier it gets because we are getting better and better at it we have, as Paul said, we\u2019ve got a lot of locations in a lot of different markets and we learn from everyone and each one becomes a little bit more efficient so it is, certainly is still a big change management project and like I said, we\u2019re learning with each market that converts and that means we are getting ahead of the conversion we do a lot of communication we do a lot of training we do a lot of, not just training in terms of looking at documents and understanding but actually doing and working in the system so we\u2019ve gotten and we believe to be pretty efficient in pretty good at getting our locations prepared having said that certainly is still a disruption and it takes time to get through, it takes time to get our customers used to seeing that different kind of invoice etcetera. so, disruption will continue until we\u2019re finished with it, but we get better and better with each one from a standpoint of what have we seen out of the system we really do like the efficiency that brings to our SSRs our SSRs are our drivers, they have handheld computers, they are much better and much more efficient than they used to be and so we like how those are working our First Aid and Safety business has been on SAP for a few years and we like the knowledge and the information that gets to that business, we\u2019re starting to see a little bit of that in the rental business and as you can tell from the First Aid and Safety business we like how our growth is going there so we, I wouldn\u2019t say that, we have seen a lot of surprises from the standpoint of things that we didn\u2019t expect, but we like what we see.","Tim Mulrooney","That\u2019s great.

Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Hansen","Good evening and thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our second quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss.

The organic growth rate which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 5.7%. Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment accelerated to a rate of 6.5% from 5.9% in our first quarter.","Second quarter gross margin improved to 44.1% from 43.3% last year. Scott Farmer, Cintas' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated in today's press release that this is our 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement. As Scott mentioned this accomplishment plus our industry leading organic sales growth is a great reflection of the significant opportunities we have ahead of us and of the great execution of our employees whom we call partners. Gross margin of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment improved to 44.7%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to last year's second quarter.","The First Aid and Safety segment gross margin improved to 46.1% representing both the year-over-year and the sequential increase of 290 and 30 basis points respectively, due to the realization of synergies from the acquisition of ZEE Medical in fiscal 2016.","Operating income for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 of $203 million increased 1.3% from last year's second quarter. Operating income margin was 15.6% compared to 16.4% in last year's second quarter. Second quarter operating income included $3.3 million or 0.3% of second quarter revenue of transaction expenses related to the previously announced agreement to acquire G&K Services.","Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter was $123 million compared to $115 million in last year's second quarter. Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter were $1.13 which included a negative $0.02 impact from G&K transaction expenses, compared to $1.03 in last year's second quarter.","Second quarter net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 6.9% and 9.7% respectively compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the negative impact of the G&K acquisition expenses net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 8.8% and 11.7% respectively compared to last year's second quarter, and net income margin from continuing operations improved to 9.7% compared to 9.5% in last year's second quarter.","We're updating our annual guidance, we expect fiscal 2017 revenue to be in the range of $5.180 billion to $5.225 billion, and fiscal 2017 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.57 to $4.65. This guidance includes the benefit from our adoption of accounting standards update 2016-09 entitled improvements to employees share based payment accounting, and the impact of one less workday in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.","This guidance also includes second quarter year-to-date G&K transaction Expenses, but does not include any future G&K transaction expenses. Please refer to the table in today's press release for more information. ","As Scott Farmer was recorded [ph] in today's press release, we are pleased with our second quarter results. They've put us in a solid position to again achieve record revenue and to grow our EPS double digits for the seventh consecutive year. We thank our partners for striving to exceed expectations and in doing so delivering best in class results.","Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to provide a brief update on our acquisition of G&K. We are excited about this opportunity and the long-term value creation for Cintas, its employee partners and its shareholders. When we announced the transaction in August, we indicated that the merger was subject to approval by G&K shareholders, regulatory clearances in both the U.S. and Canada and other customary closing conditions. The merger was approved by G&K shareholders in November.","We continue to work toward obtaining regulatory clearance and completing the other closing conditions. We remain optimistic that the deal will close no later than the end of the second calendar quarter of 2017. In order to avoid creating speculation, we will not be providing any additional commentary on this process. We will update the market going forward as appropriate.","I will now turn the call over to Paul for additional information.","Paul Adler","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 contains one less workday than in fiscal year 2016. It is the third quarter of fiscal 2017 that has one less day than the prior year quarter. We estimate that this will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016.","For those of you modeling our results by quarter please keep this in mind. Our third quarter is generally not as strong as the fourth quarter due to reasons including the resetting of payroll taxes, and this year it will also be negatively impacted by one less day of revenue. In addition energy comps will be very difficult in our third quarter as gasoline and diesel prices were at their lowest levels in last year's third quarter. And finally we will spend more on the branding campaign in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter. ","As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 5.7% in the second quarter. Driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and strong customer retention. Total company gross margin was 44.1% for the second quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 43.3% last year, an improvement of 80 basis points.","We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.","Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment included the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.","Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was a little over $1 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions. The organic growth rate was 6.5%. We continue to see the impacts of weakness in the oil, gas and coal industries, however, we believe that we have hit the bottom. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from affected customers lowered our organic growth rate by about 75 basis points in the second quarter. This compares to about 110 basis point impact in the previous quarter.","Our Uniform Rental and Facilities Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the second quarter, an increase of 80 basis points from 43.9% in last year\u2019s second quarter. Energy related costs were 10 basis points lower than in last year's second quarter. However, job losses previously mentioned in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year second quarter operating margin by about 40 basis points. So, on a net basis, the low price of oil had a negative impact on our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin of 30 basis points because the benefit of lower prices at the pump for our fleet of trucks was more than offset by the negative impact to operating margin resulting from weakness in our oil, gas and coal customers.","Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products, and Training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $125 million, which was about 4% higher than last year's second quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 3.3%. The reduction in overall segment organic growth is due to the continued assimilation of the ZEE Medical business. Route consolidation and optimization continued in the second quarter as expected. However, in examining the monthly organic growth rates of the second quarter, we believe that we saw the bottom followed by an upswing in the growth rates in the final months of the quarter.","We previously disclosed that we added sales reps in our first quarter. ZEE Medical did not have a dedicated sales force as the business previously relayed only upon SSRs to grow the business. The added sales reps were help us grow the acquired customer base by penetrating with our broad range of products and services. As a result of this investments in addition to a bottoming of growth rates in the second quarter, we expect improving organic growth rates through the remainder of this fiscal year. This segment's gross margin was 46.1% in the second quarter compared to 43.2% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 290 basis points. Also, we are pleased to note that gross margin improved again on a sequential basis, this time by 30 basis points. Our margins are benefiting from the realization of acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of existing warehouses.","We have about 16 months of results since the ZEE acquisition. There is more work to be done and exciting opportunities ahead. However, we are very pleased with progress and performance to date. Large acquisitions have a short term impact to growth rates as we on board and good will the acquired customers and train the SSRs on our products, services and processes. This is typical, and we know that growth rates will soon improve. In the interim we have made significant strides in expanding gross margin. Our year-to-date gross margin dollars are up 53% over two years ago and up 22% over last year. Our year-to-date gross margin percentage is almost back to pre-ZEE levels and our revenue of course is significantly greater. ","Our Fire Protection Services and Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. All Other revenue was $167 million, an increase of 3.5% compared to last year's second quarter. Organic growth rate was 2.8%. All Other gross margin was 38.5% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 39.6% for last year's second quarter. As we have mentioned previously the Direct Sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are, such as Uniform Rental and Facilities Services and First Aid. Therefore the growth rates are generally low and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. Our Fire business however continues to grow at a rapid pace, the Fire business organic growth rate was a little over 10% and operating margin expanded.","Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.2% as a percentage of second quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's second quarter of 26.8%. The increase was the result of strategic investments, as well as the 70 basis point increase in employee medical expenses. The strategic investments include a new enterprise resource planning system, the national branding campaign ready for the work day and sales resources to grow recently acquired customers and our First Aid and Safety segments. ","Regarding the increase in medical expenses, note that we\u2019re self-insured and we had a handful of atypical very expensive claims in the quarter. I mentioned that SG&A was impacted by our investments in an enterprise resource planning system, namely SAP. SAP amounted to about 20 basis points of expenses related to the piloted operations. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system. Since last quarter\u2019s earnings call, more locations have been included in the pilots, also with the upcoming acquisition of G&K we\u2019re planning and adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary. ","Our internal SAP resources are involved in this effort, as a result we expect SAP expenses in fiscal 2017 to be less and estimate a range of $20 million to $25 million. As of November 30, short term debt was comprised of commercial paper in the amount of $66 million. We expect this amount to be temporally higher as of the end of the third quarter due to payment of our regular dividend. On December 2, we paid an annual dividend of $1.33 per share, an increase of 26.7% over last year\u2019s annual dividend.","We\u2019ve increased this dividend for 33 consecutive years, which is every year since we went public in 1983. The annual dividend is an important part of our capital allocation strategy and illustrates our enduring commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement with a notational value of $550 million for our forecasted debt issuance, in anticipation of debt issuance for the closing of the G&K acquisition and to protect same cost from rising interest rates. We recent entered into interest rate lock agreements with a notional value of $950 million.","Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 34.9% compared to 37.4% for last year's second quarter. The decrease in the effective tax rate year-over-year is attributable to both the favorable settlement of a prior year federal tax audit and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 on stock compensation. We expect the annual effective tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal 2017 to be about 34.7%.","Our cash balance as of November 30 was $143 million and we had no marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash and marketable securities decreased about $20 million from the balances of August 31st. Cash flow from operating activities as of November 30 year-to-date increased 14% from the prior year period. Uses of cash in the second quarter included CapEx and repayments of debt. Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $76 million our CapEx by operating segment was as follows, $66 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $6 million in First Aid and Safety and $4 million in All Other.","We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $290 million to $310 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation. Finally, in the second quarter we received a payment from the buyer of our investment in Shredit, proceeds were about $26 million and recorded in the investing section of the cash flow statement.","That concludes our prepared remark. We are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We do have our first question from Minaz Putnik with Barclays Capital.","Minaz Putnik","Good evening gentlemen, thanks for the call, first question is just around the acceleration in the Uniform Rentals business, maybe just a little bit more color related -- was it broad based, was it a couple of -- was it selling more mat and towels, anything there, how sustainable do you think that is?","Mike Hansen","Well we saw our organic growth from the first quarter this second quarter accelerated about 60 basis points as Paul said about 35 basis points was because of the lessening oil and gas customer impact and so I guess I would say you know we've seen quite steady performance except for that vertical for some time now and I would say that that is sustainable as we move forward in this economic type of environment, if we see the economy change one way or the other we may see some change, but we feel very good about our execution and that's kind of where we've been, that's where our results have been for a number of quarters except for that one vertical.","Minaz Putnik","And I think Paul has said that you think oil and gas is at the bottom, 75 base impact in 2Q, how should we think of that impact in the quarter lessening going forward like is 35 basis points the right number like you saw this quarter?","Paul Adler","Yes Minaz, this is Paul. We estimate that that headwind that went from 110 to 75 will continue to step down in Q3 and Q4 such that you know for the full year the headwind would probably be in the 75 to 85 basis point range for the full year.","Minaz Putnik","And then just on First Aid and Safety, your comments on improving growth rate for the remainder fiscal year, again just some color on -- from 3.3 how do we step it up? I know you talked about monthly it was better, I was wondering if you could maybe put some numbers on those monthly rates, or any color on how we should model that?","Mike Hansen","Paul mentioned that we saw some acceleration through the quarter, in the last month of the quarter we were about 4.5 and I would expect to see step up from there in the third and then little bit more step up in the fourth. We're not ready to give particular guidance, but we expect that to return to that high single-digit low double-digits overtime, and we certainly expect to make progress on that in the back half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","SG&A was a little bit higher than we had expected in the quarter even adjusting for the transaction expenses and you called out SAP in the national branding campaign and medical expenses as been big drivers there, SAP you're going to keep investing in this year, but just when we think about the other two would you expect those to come down at all, or would you expect sort of double-digit SG&A expense growth for the rest of '17 as well?","Mike Hansen","I would say this, first of all Paul called out medical and certainly medical was a spike of 70 basis points this quarter, again as he said, we had some -- we had a combination of a handful of high dollar claims that hit us this quarter. We don't see that as a trend going forward. As it relates to the other items that Paul pointed out in terms of -- let me speak to SAP for a second, we certainly have guided for more SAP expense in the back half of the year, as we kind of move out of the pilot and into the full implementation.","The spend that we have talked about tonight $20 million to $25 million, you can imagine the bulk of that is in the second half of the year. But it is lower because we're starting to combine a little bit the SAP and the G&K system conversion and so we're going to make sure that we've a coordinated effort to move forward in the right way with both of those projects. If you kind of think about the first half of the year, the first quarter we were up about 70 basis points over last year. Second quarter without that medical spike we're up 70 basis points and we will continue to invest in SAP in preparation for the G&K closing. And we'll have some of that ready for the workday.","So, yes, Toni, we will see some heightened SG&A as we continue to prepare for these two large projects. We want to make sure that we are providing the right resources for each of them.","Toni Kaplan","Can you talk about how you're anticipating the impact from the new administration will be, whether it's on taxes, labor growth, wages or anything else that you think will be especially impactful to your business.","Mike Hansen","Certainly we've seen a lot of positive sentiment and at this point in time it's just sentiment and so we've got ways to go before we see anything impactful, but having said that, look if we see lower corporate income tax rates that will be certainly beneficial for us because we're mostly a U.S. based company. If we see a repatriation opportunity certainly that's not significant for us, but if we see a lot of cash coming back and flowing into the economy that's going to be good for our customers and ultimately good for us.","And then if we see some infrastructure spend that's going to be good for construction, for equipment and certainly that's going to benefit our customers and eventually benefit us. But I would say again Toni, we are a ways away from seeing anything yet and I -- as we think about our year, we are not including any benefits from changes from the new administration, we absolutely like how our year is going so far, we've got a very good organic growth rate, we've seen Rental continue to be strong First Aid is going to continue to be strong in the second half of the year. We've seen some really nice gross margins and gross margin improvements, so we feel like we've got a very healthy business that's executing very well and boy if we get some help in the back half of the year from changes from the new administration that will be even better. ","Toni Kaplan","Okay, thanks for the answers, and happy holidays.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair. ","Nate Brochmann ","So I wanted to ask a couple of things. One, obviously over the last five years you've really kind of changed the direction of the company in terms of developing new end markets and new services and what not. Could you talk a little bit about how the culture has evolved along with that in terms of supporting those new entrepreneurial efforts? And also two, just kind of looking forward, where do you think the next milestones are over the next three to five years post integration at G&K and the SAP in terms of some of the ongoing efforts to continue those various growth drivers.","Mike Hansen","Well you're right Nate. I think today and over the last five years, we've been a more innovative company than maybe 10 and 15 years ago. I think, if you go back kind of prior to the last cycle. We were kind of building the footprints still, we we're adding sales reps and we were getting a lot of growth in that manner. And as we fully build out that footprint, and as we got into the great recession, we started certainly to recognize that we can't wait for employment to come back and we have to be more innovative and we have to create products and services that our customers really value and want to use, we've got to create garments that our customers want to wear, not just have to wear. I think we've done a great job of that. And we\u2019ve got some active channels of feedback from our customers, from our service sales reps, we\u2019ve got an active R&D program, we are looking for vendors to partner with like Carhartt.","And so we -- there is no doubt we kind of changed from a company 10 and 15 years ago where we were building a footprint to a company that really looking for more and unique ways of serving businesses. So as we move forward then, we\u2019ve got some exciting thing ahead obviously and that is the SAP and the G&K integrations. And as we move forward from there, I think there still are many opportunities to create products and services that pull even more types of customers into our customer base and to provide them with broader products and services. So we\u2019re going to continue to look for those kinds of opportunities.","And Nate, I would say one of the biggest assets that we\u2019ve got certainly the biggest assets are our people and our culture, but really when you think about it, one of the biggest assets we have got is a great infrastructure to provide services close to a million businesses and we\u2019ve got that infrastructure that can reach many more businesses as well. And so we are a nice avenue for many vendors to provide products and services. And I think that\u2019s something that we can continue to take advantage of as we move forward.","Nate Brochmann","Thanks, that\u2019s very helpful for the insight. And just one little bit of quick clarification, last question but, talking about the encouraging sentiment, I mean clearly we feel that throughout the market in terms of the economy and some of the larger corporations out there, when you say positive sentiment, are you referring to just kind of that nuance, are you hearing that out of your customers as well in terms of kind of maybe some of that individual positive sentiment percolating up a little bit from your sales force?","Mike Hansen","Well, I think -- I would say more of it is coming from just kind of the general economic discussions, the rally in the stock market, the rise in the interest rate environment. I would say more of it is coming from that. When we think about the business, our specific business, in the second quarter, I would say if you kind of push aside a lot of this sentiment and noise, the economic environment for us in the second quarter didn\u2019t feel a whole lot different than its felt in last few quarters with the exception of that oil and gas vertical, not deteriorating anymore and maybe stabilizing a little bit. But generally speaking I would say the economic environment doesn\u2019t feel a whole lot different today than it has over the last few quarters.","Nate Brochmann","Fair enough. Thank you very much for the time. Appreciated.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan.","Andrew Steinerman","You presented the way you have your fiscal year 2017 EPS guide little bit differently in the second quarter press release and the first quarter press release, I just wanted to make sure, I was getting the math correct here, I believe that Cintas lowered the range of the 2017 EPS -- range of EPS before the accounting benefit and before the G&K transaction cost by $0.03, I could calculate, why I think it\u2019s $0.03, but I was just wondering is that the way you see the difference between the range before today and the range after today, when looking at EPS before counting benefit and before G&K costs?","Mike Hansen","And just to make sure, did you say lowered by $0.03?","Andrew Steinerman","EPS, yes I think you lowered the range by $0.03.","Mike Hansen","That\u2019s not the way I see it. So when we think about the -- and by the way we added the table because it is a little bit -- there are some moving parts and we wanted to make sure that we were as clear as we could be about it. So when I think about the first quarter, our range overall was 455 to 463, and that included a negative $0.02 from G&K in the first quarter and at that time, we had told you, we thought that ASU impact was $0.07, would be $0.07 for the year. That kind of gets us to 450 to 458, compared to tonight\u2019s range or today\u2019s range of 451 to 459. So I would see it as, I mean it\u2019s really about the same but a penny higher.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Capital. ","Hamzah Mazari ","Mike just wondering, on your next financing cost, you spoke about locking in financing and interest rate, certain interest rate. Could you give us a sense of how we should think about pro forma and that financing cost and would that be an offset to your 130 million to 140 million synergy number you\u2019ve put out there for G&K?","Mike Hansen","So back at August, when we announced the transaction, we had talked about a, roughly a 4% rate and I would expect that we\u2019ll be a little bit better than that. We have locked some of the rates, but not all of them. So there will still be some movement, but I would expect that we may be a little bit better than that.","Hamzah Mazari ","Okay and just last question, with the newer administration if there is a higher tariff on overseas sourcing, does that impact you guys at all or is that not material, and any color there would be great? Thank you.","Mike Hansen","Well, we certainly have an active global supply chain and we source from all over the world and we do our best to take advantage of existing trade agreements. I would say if the new administration pulled back on existing trade agreements or made changes to existing trade agreements, there could be some impact and we\u2019ll do our best to work around that.","So for example we have production in Haiti and we take advantage of the trade agreements with Haiti, we have some NAFTA benefits and if those go away then we\u2019ll certainly have to determine how to adjust. Having said that, when you think about the cost of materials for us, in specifically garments, let\u2019s keep in mind rental revenue is about 50% of the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment. When you think about the cost of rentals we have the material cost, the production cost and the service cost, and so the material cost is certainly not the majority of that. When you think about then the material cost, the biggest cost in there is labor and so we'll work to see how can we manage that labor input as best we can.","And so I guess what I am telling you is, it's a large part of our cost structure but it's not, it\u2019s not significant and it happens over a long period of time. So for example we have to go source it, then we bring it into our distribution center where is stays for a turn, then it gets shipped to our rental locations where we put it into service and we amortize it over 18 months. So it takes quite a while to see the full impact of changes to our sourcing, and while we're going through that long supply chain timeframe we would be working towards improving our sourcing capability. So we're keeping our eyes on it, no question about it, and we'll react appropriately.","Operator","Next question comes from Andy Whitman with Robert W. Baird.","Andy Whitman","Great so, hi guys I wanted to just -- a little bit more on the guidance question, I agree with you it\u2019s a I guess a penny raise, if you go a step further I guess you cut the SAP investment this year by about $5 million, that's $0.03 the other way, but then Healthcare looks like a surprise that was about a $0.04 hit in the positive direction if you add it back. So I guess those if you just assume SAP and Healthcare then you kind of, you\u2019re still back to the kind of flat to maybe a penny pick up, would you agree with that Mike.","Mike Hansen","Yes, I would say its right around there Andy. You know when we think about our guidance for the second half of the year we think about, look we feel very good about the revenue, we feel very-very good about the gross margin, we have a healthy business and its executing well. We also have two very large and important projects ahead in SAP and in G&K, and we're going to make sure that we are investing in the right way to make sure that we implement those in the best way that we can. And so as I mentioned to Tony a little bit ago, we will continue to see some elevated SG&A because we're going to make sure we're ready for both of those projects and all of that's incorporated into that guidance.","Andy Whitman","You know and you brought up the two big programs that you're running. It sounds like, you didn't say it this way, but sounds like you're moderating some of the spend this year on SAP because there's going to be a whole lot more work next year when G&K gets done. Would you agree with that?","And then I guess the question is, is there an implication about the spending on SAP I think last quarter you said it was going to be $40 or $45 million that was cumulative not incremental to this year's number but $40 million to $45 million cumulative, do you still like that number as you look into 2018 or does that one move as well as you look at the G&K integration next year?","Mike Hansen","I would say that it's getting a little bit combined with -- those two projects are getting fairly connected, and while we're not ready to say that that 40 to 45 is going to be different, we're going to have to continue to work on these as a coordinated effort. And so we may come and say, look when you combine the Cintas legacy effort along with the G&K, we may change the amount of spend, but I'm not ready to say that we will yet.","I guess maybe one way to look at it from just a systems spend, is to say, we had originally looked at that SAP integration for ourselves as being the second half of fiscal '17 and then all of fiscal '18. And I think Paul and I have said over last couple of calls, as we insert G&K into that, it's likely going to go into fiscal '19, and we still believe that. And so there's probably going to be the same effort in fiscal '18 but just a little bit more effort in fiscal '19. That additional effort is incorporated into our thoughts on the G&K deal, and as you know we've talked about one of the longer polls in that in the synergy effort with G&K as that system conversion. And so we're going to be continuing to work on it, I'm not ready to change from the 40 to 45. But I think it will go into '19, just because we've got more locations. Does that answer your question?","Andy Whitman","Yes, I think that does, it gives it a character of how you are thinking about it and thank you for that. I guess maybe the last question that I have then is stepping back and just looking at the fundamentals of the marketplace, I would like to hear some of your commentary on the AdStop [ph] trends that you're seeing in the marketplace, as well as any comments that you can give us on the overall level of competition as it relates to the pricing trend, recognizing that they're always competitive, but maybe they\u2019re less or more competitive today? That would helpful to give us some context of some of the drivers into that acceleration into organic growth.","Paul Adler","The AdStops, the metric was positive this quarter, but it's typically positive. We get some benefit from seasonal items like jackets and some extra mats coming into the late fall into the early winter. The only thing noteworthy in AdStops was that the flame resistant garments FRC, that was more positive and that helps us support our conclusions that we think we have seen the bottom of that weakness in oil, gas and coal. Outside of that nothing noteworthy in AdStops, and in terms of pricing no change, it\u2019s still very competitive but nothing significant to speak off.","Operator","Next we've George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","George Tong","You indicated the bulk of your SAP spending this year will be in the back half, can you share how you're thinking about the timing of investments between 3Q and 4Q this year?","Mike Hansen","I would say that there is going to be a little bit more in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter as we really get into the ramp up and -- so, I would say if you think about that remaining, I guess it's about 15 to 20 in the back half of the year, a little bit more of it is going to come in the fourth quarter.","George Tong","Got it, and then secondly, can you discuss how much additional investment you need to make in the sales force to support accelerating revenue growth in ZEE Medical?","Mike Hansen","Well we've already made that investment, we made it in -- primarily in the first quarter and so you are seeing that in those First Aid and Safety numbers that they are that investment that we made in the first quarter is now starting to become more productive and I don\u2019t expect to see any additional investments other than kind of the routine.","George Tong","Go it. And then lastly as it relates to your medical claims costs. You saw some elevated atypical medical claims in the quarter. Can you maybe elaborate on why you believe the claims are atypical and then from an actuarial perspective if you'll need to accrue claims costs at a higher rate in future quarters?","Paul Adler","The typical claims were just simply certain claims that were very high dollar because of the specific situation of the person. Because we don\u2019t expect a continued spike of this high dollar claims we generally don\u2019t need to necessarily include that in our IB&R [ph] going forward.","George Tong","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Next we have Joe Box with KeyBanc.","Joe Box","So, obviously there is lot of commentary around why the organic rate in Uniform stepped up sequentially. But I was actually hoping that maybe you could deconstruct where the 6.5% organic growth is actually coming from. Maybe just give us the sort of commentary or directional feel on how much of that might have been price, how much of that might have been volume and then just anything maybe you can tell us about the Uniform specific growth rate versus the ancillary?","Paul Adler","Well Joe, we don\u2019t usually get into the specific details. I can tell you, new business remains strong and we feel very good about reaching that new customer base through what we call no programmers or new customers that haven\u2019t had a Uniform Rental program. New business remains strong penetration remains strong with things like our signature series hygiene products and services with our entrance mats and I would say that we haven\u2019t seen much of a change in the mix of the revenue growth other than to say that oil and gas at customer base, the stops or the reduction in revenue at those types of customers has subsided a little bit.","But aside from that it is continuing to execute the way we have for quite a while now and that is no programmers being very strong, new business efforts in total being strong and continuing to find penetration opportunities. ","Joe Box ","Okay, appreciate that. And then we may or may not be coming out of the period of lower diesel costs. Have you guys given any consideration to maybe pushing through a surcharge mechanism to your customers or maybe doing hedging on that front?","Paul Adler","We don\u2019t, that diesel or gas surcharge is not something that we do. And we are buying gas everyday all over the country and a hedging program is very, very difficult, it's not like we\u2019ve got large bulk buys at specific points in time and so no we don\u2019t typically get involved in a hedging program because it's just very, very difficult to do so.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Could you guys address the branding campaign, maybe I am watching less TV, but I haven't seen as much as that as I did initially. Just curious what's going on and a little rehash of the quantification, past and forward, and also favorable impacts you think you may have seen thus far?","Mike Hansen","Scott, you need to watch a lot more college football. But I mean, the rebranding campaign is going very well. We\u2019re still not far enough along that, we have enough of full body of work to be able to analyze and come back to you with return on our investments. But anecdotally what we are hearing from our partners, the customers, it\u2019s all very positive.","In fiscal '16, we spent for the year about 25 basis points on the branding campaign and we expect that to be about the same impact here in fiscal '17. And as I said in the end of prepared remarks we will have a little bit heavier spend in our third quarter than in the fourth quarter.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. And then with regard to the new sales folks at ZEE, you answered a prior question saying that the spend is done, the initial change and now I guess you have -- I guess I\u2019m curious see how much of that is variable, might we see that pick up or will it be commiserate with production and you\u2019re obviously only giving guides to the fiscal yearend, I believe you said something like progressive improvement in each of the next two quarters, but based on Anniversarying if we look at the full calendar '17, we should see that continue to trend up in the back half of the calendar year and ideally thereafter, is that a fair assessment?","Paul Adler","Yes, yes, it is. We made a larger than typical investment in the first quarter, those partners are now starting to become productive. But we will continue to add selling resources just like we always do. So it's going to be more routine over the course of the next year or so, and -- but yes, to your question. Not only do we see or we expect some improvements sequentially in the back half of this year, I would suggest that\u2019s going to continue in the first half of next fiscal year as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Healy with Northcoast Research.","John Healy","I wanted to ask just a little bit more on explanation on the ZEE Medical business and some of the deterioration in the First Aid and Safety organic growth, could you help us understand kind of what was going on with the sales force and it is now simply that Cintas sales people were trying to go in and retain the business and weren't focused on kind of growing and selling because we\u2019ve seen the organic growth come down for about three or four quarters in that business, I\u2019m just trying to understand, kind of the mechanics of what happened in the field?","Mike Hansen","Sure, so we -- lets go back to, we made that deal in August of 2015 and the first thing that we needed to do was get that business on to our systems. When we\u2019re operating on their system, it hard for us to go and hire a sales rap, and put them on to their system because that would require them to sell ZEE Legacy product. And as you can imagine one of the things that we try to do is start to work our way out of the ZEE products and start to work into the Cintas products.","This in ZEE\u2019s case they didn\u2019t have sales people, they have their drivers, their service sales raps or as we call them SSR\u2019s, they had their SSR\u2019s do the selling. And they didn\u2019t have a dedicated sales force, so as we brought them on the first thing we needed to do was convert them on to our system. That as we\u2019ve talked about took us really through the entire fiscal 2016 year and so as we are doing that conversation on to our system then we have to make sure that we train those SSR\u2019s on our products and services. And then we do what we\u2019ve talked about is a route optimization and that route optimization then takes those ZEE Legacy route, now that they\u2019re on our system and now we look at the whole market and we reroute the market.","And that puts us in a position then to most efficiently serve the customer, and that\u2019s when we really like to then start to see the sales people start to drive revenue. And so in this case, in the case of ZEE, we didn\u2019t invest in sales people early on, because it would have required us to sell for some period of time, the ZEE product and that was something we were trying to work our way out of.","So it was something that we expected and now that we are through the system integration, we are through almost all of the route optimization. We\u2019re ready to really begin aggressively selling and we should see that organic growth improve.","John Healy","That\u2019s helpful, and Mike to just kind of along the same lines, when you think about the G&K acquisition, obviously they have sales people and I guess we call it SSRs as well. Is it reasonable to think that you might see organic in the laundry business, macro conditions stable, maybe do the same thing as you go through a digestion period or do you not typically see that same thing when you do it fairly good sized Uniform deal?","Mike Hansen","With every deal that we do, we will expect to see some revenue reduction in the legacy business and that\u2019s true for every acquisition that we\u2019ve made and that is because a combination of things such as, there is some disruption certainly and that disruption sometimes creates the customer -- or creates the environment for the customer to look at other providers. But in addition to that, it\u2019s hard to sell; it\u2019s hard to come out of the gate selling a lot of new business, because we need to train the legacy people, the SSRs and the sales people how to sell Cintas' products, how to sell using our policies, our procedures and our tools. And so there is a natural reduction in new business sales shortly after the closing of the transaction, while we are doing training and integration. And as we get through that training and integration period we then start to expect that those resources, those legacy resources will become more and more productive.","So it is just natural that we will see some pressure on sales growth in our rental business post-closing of that transaction, but the really good news is as Paul mentioned in his prepared remarks going back to Z for a second. Our gross margin dollars are up 56% over pre-acquisition dollars, and so while there is some pressure on the topline we are really creating synergy opportunities and really creating cash flow because of the synergies we're able to create.","John Healy","Thank you, and just one final question, when you look at the acquisition of G&K, I know you guys had put out the 140 -- 130 million to 140 million cost savings number, but I believe that's before any sort of revaluing of the inventory and amortization of the merchandize, is there a way to think about how much of the synergies would be leaked away because of that?","Mike Hansen","You know I'm not quite sure I understand the question and I would just say John, that I think we're still very comfortable with the 130 to 140. There is some work that remains to be done in an acquisition of this size, all that purchase price accounting is performed by an independent party and so there could be some movements there, but at this point in time I think we understand the economics well enough that we're still comfortable with that 130 to 140. So nothing related to your question that causes us pause at this point in time.","John Healy","Right, but is that 130-140 before or after any purchase accounting associated with the merchandize that's been fully amortized that's still in the field that would get revalued higher and put on your balance sheet once the deal closes.","Paul Adler","It includes our understanding our estimates based upon experience of doing deals as to what we believe that purchase price accounting to be. But as I said [multiple speakers]. Yes, we reflected it to the best of our knowledge, but as I said we don't determine that ultimately, we'll have an independent accounting firm come in and sign off on that.","Operator","And next up we have Gary Bissey with RBC Capital Markets.","Gary Bissey","Hey guys, just a couple of quick ones, I know it's getting late here. The -- what is the cost of the swaps or the interest rate activity you did between now and actually you getting the financing to closing the deal, should we think that interest expense changes because of these things you are doing how to prepare for taking on that debt or is that not going to be material?","Mike Hansen","Generally there is not a cost and there is a true up at the time that we would do the financing. So, the answer to your question briefly we won't expect any change in our interest expenses.","Gary Bissey","And then on the third quarter headwinds that you mentioned I just wanted to ask about those quickly. So the one less workday, we know the SAP have been very clear about that, the branding spend you said similar for the year, but in the second quarter, it was up year-over-year, so I guess the mix of timing within the year, it's the third quarter or is that on a year-over-year basis the branding spend likely to be more and is that something that'll be a drag on margins?","Mike Hansen","Year-over-year, I think probably the third quarter is probably similar. The fourth quarter would probably be a little bit better year-over-year. But when you're thinking about our Q3 and Q4 there is still more in that Q3 then in the Q4 of fiscal '17.","Gary Bissey","And then just last one on that, the energy comps, can you give us a sense how much do you think that changes from this quarter you just reported in terms of energy costs, fuel costs?","Paul Adler","I think if you kind of view an annualizing of that 75 to 85 basis points for the year, I think that gets us down in the fourth quarter to probably something in the way of 40 to 50 basis points of drag.","Gary Bissey","I'm sorry, I was just asking about the fuel costs. I think you said that gasoline and diesel prices were the low was the third quarter a year ago. So, [multiple speakers] materially different sequentially, February versus the November you\u2019ve just reported?","Mike Hansen","I don't have the data with me by quarter, but I can tell you this, because we've already given you -- our Q1 energy was about 1.9% of revenue, Q2 was 2%. We think we'll end '17 in like the 2% to 2.2% range. So, we're expecting prices at the pump to rise. That compares to about 2% for fiscal '16.","Paul Adler","But all in the second half of the year for us was about 1.8%. So, you can see we're guiding a little bit of an increase.","Operator","And our final question comes from Dan Dolev with Instinet.","Dan Dolev","Can you just give me a sense of the incrementals on rental on the gross margin side? I feel like it was -- the second quarter kind of broke a little bit of a trend, you were running at 63%, its maybe like in the 56% range, what should we expect sort of looking at third quarter and fourth quarter in terms of gross margin incremental in rental?","Mike Hansen","I would say this Dan last -- for fiscal '16 our incremental gross margin in rental was about 58% for the year. In the second quarter it was about 56% last year. It was almost the exact same this year in the second quarter. And if you look at our incremental gross margins for the year, it's something in the way of just under 60. So I think we're continuing to have the performance that we've seen over the last year or so.","Going into the second half of this year the only thing that I would say is we will be a little bit more aggressive in making sure that open positions in our rental business are filled, so that when we are ready to close the G&K transaction we're not trying to both fill our open positions and perform integration. We want to make sure that we are fully staffed as much as possible and so that's the only think I would say, it may put a little bit of pressure on that second half of the year, but generally speaking we think they will be healthy.","Dan Dolev","That pressure versus the second quarter or pressure versus kind of the --?","Mike Hansen","Pressure versus what we saw in the second half of last year I guess or relative to this 60% -ish.","Dan Dolev","Got it, and what about the other incrementals, they was actually much healthier in First Aid, any trend to be called here?","Mike Hansen","I would say that I'm not ready to give you a specific number. We've seen some really nice improvement over the last two quarters, and we expect to get back to and exceed pre-ZEE gross margins and as we grow the revenue I think we\u2019ll make progress on that, but I'm not ready to just call it out specifically yet.","Dan Dolev","Got it, thanks so much. Happy holidays.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike Hansen for any closing comments.","Mike Hansen","Well, thank you for joining us tonight. And we wish you all a wonderful holiday season. We will issue our third quarter earnings in the latter half of March. And we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.","Operator","Once again that does conclude today's call. We appreciate your participation."],"5561":["Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) Q1 2020 Earnings Conference Call September 24, 2019  5:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Mike Hansen - EVP and CFO","Paul Adler - VP and Treasurer","Conference Call Participants","Toni Kaplan - Morgan Stanley","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital","Kevin McVeigh - Credit Suisse","Gary Bisbee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets","George Tong - Goldman Sachs","Andrew Wittmann - RW Baird","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal '20 was a record $1.81 billion, an increase of 6.7% over last year's first quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and differences in the number of workdays, was 8.3%.","In the first quarter of fiscal '20, the organic growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 7.5%, and the organic growth rate for the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment was 13.8%.","Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '20 of $849.1 million, increased 9.6%. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 46.9% for the first quarter of fiscal '20, compared to 45.6% in the first quarter of fiscal '19.","Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment gross margin as a percent of revenue improved 150 basis points from last year's first quarter to 47.2%. And the First Aid and Safety Services operating segment gross margin percentage improved 110 basis points to 49%.","Reported operating income for the first quarter of fiscal '20 of $306.1 million increased 15.4%. Operating margin was 16.9% in the first quarter of fiscal '20, compared to 15.6% in fiscal '19. Operating income in the first quarter of fiscal '19 was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $4.9 million, or 30 basis points.","Reported net income for the first quarter of fiscal '20 was $250.8 million, and reported earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal '20 were $2.32. Excluding the G&K acquisition integration expenses in fiscal '19, EPS increased 20.2%.","As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer was quoted in today's press release, we are pleased with our start to our fiscal year. We thank our employee-partners for continuing to execute well on our important initiatives.","Before turning the call over to Paul for more details, I'll provide an update of our fiscal '20 expectations. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.28 billion to $7.32 billion. We expect EPS to be in the range of $8.47 to $8.57. Note the following regarding the guidance. The growth rate at the revenue guidance range is 5.6% to 6.2%.","However, our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than our fiscal '19. Adjusting for this one day difference, on a constant workday basis, the revenue growth rate at guidance is 6% to 6.6%. One less workday also has a negative impact on EPS reducing it about $0.06, which is a 90 basis point drag on the EPS growth rate for the year.","The guidance assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal '20 of 20.3% compared to a rate of 19.7% for fiscal '19. The higher effective tax rate in fiscal '20 negatively impacts EPS growth about 80 basis points and total EPS by about $0.06. Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period to period, based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation expense.","The guidance assumes a share count for computing EPS of 109 million shares. This consists of diluted weighted average shares outstanding, plus participating securities in the form of restricted stock. And it does not assume any future share buybacks, any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or any additional G&K integration expenses.","I'll now turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Adler","Thank you, Mike.","Please note that our fiscal '20 contains one less workday than in fiscal '19. One less day will negatively impact fiscal '20 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. To illustrate the magnitude of the headwind using fiscal '19's annual revenue, one less workday equates to about $27 million. One less workday also has a negative impact on operating margin and EPS.","Fiscal '20 operating income margin will be reduced by about 12.5 basis points, in comparison to fiscal '19 due to one less day of revenue. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis. And we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses.","As Mike stated, one less workday is a headwind of about 90 basis points on EPS growth, and about a $0.06 drag on total EPS in comparison to fiscal '19. Each quarter of fiscal '20 will contain 65 workdays.","In comparison to fiscal '19, our upcoming Q2 of fiscal '20 will have the same number of days. Q3 will have one additional day, and Q4 will have one less day. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal '20 results.","We have two reportable operating segments Uniform Rental and Facility Services and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consist of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.","Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.","Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1.45 billion, an increase of 5.8%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate changes and differences in the number of workdays, the organic growth rate was 7.5%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 47.2% for the first quarter compared to 45.7% than last year's first quarter, an improvement of 150 basis points.","Energy expense as a percentage of revenue was 2.20% compared to 2.45% in the prior year quarter. The gross margin expansion was driven in large part by the strong revenue increase covering certain fixed production and service department costs.","Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $172.1 million. The organic growth rate for this segment was 13.8%.","The First Aid segment gross margin was 49.0% in the first quarter compared to 47.9% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 110 basis points. First Aid segment gross margins continue to increase with stop - with a strong top line growth. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category.","Our Fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The Uniform Direct Sale business growth rates are generally low single digits, and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. Uniform Direct Sale, however is a key business for us, and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross-sell and provide products and services from our other business units.","All Other revenue was $184.5 million, an increase of 8.8%. The organic growth rate was 9.7%. The Fire business organic growth rate came in at 12.5%. Uniform Direct Sale business had a good quarter too, posting an organic growth rate of 5.8%. All Other gross margin was 42.8% for the first quarter of this fiscal year, compared to 42.9% for last year's first quarter.","Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 30.0% in the first quarter of fiscal '20, and 29.7% in the first quarter of '19. Lower labor expense as a percent of revenue was offset by increases in other expenses, particularly an 80 basis point increase in medical expense. We are self-insured and therefore subject to some volatility in medical expense from quarter-to-quarter.","Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal '20 was 10.1%. Stock based compensation positively impacted the tax rate. As Mike stated earlier, the tax rate can move from period to period, based on discrete events including the amount of stock compensation expense.","Please note three new line items on our balance sheet, resulting in an increase in assets and liabilities by about $165 million. These relate to our adoption in the quarter of the Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, entitled Leases. The adoption does not have a material impact on net income or cash flow.","Our cash and equivalents balance as of August 31 was $102.1 million. Operating cash flow in the first quarter of fiscal '20 increased about 70% from the amount of operating cash flow in the first quarter of fiscal '19, and benefited from strong earnings growth, and improvements in working capital. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $64.7 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows; $53.0 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $8.1 million in the First Aid and Safety, and $3.6 million in All Other.","We expect fiscal '20 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $310 million. As of August 31, total debt was $2,876.9 billion. $2,538.1 billion was fixed interest rate debt, and $338.8 million was variable rate debt in the form of a term loan and commercial paper. At August 31, our leverage of 1.9x debt-to-EBITDA was slightly lower than our target of 2x.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","The Uniform gross rental margins were really strong this quarter expanding by about 144 basis points. Was there anything one-time in there, or I guess how much could be attributable to synergies? And how should we think about the pacing of synergies this year?","Mike Hansen","Nothing really one-time. We did as Paul mentioned, we got a little bit of a benefit 25 basis points from energy. So we got a little bit of benefit there. The synergies - our expectation is that they will be generally consistent from quarter-to-quarter.","So call it roughly $35 million. That would - if that happens, that will get us right through that $140 million for the year, which we - as we talked about a few months ago. We're going to be right around that range, $135 million to $140 million.","And so we feel pretty good about our ability to capture those synergies. I would say the rest of it is nice execution, getting through a little bit more of the integration activities and seeing some efficiencies at play. The environment for pricing was similar to the fourth quarter where we sat a bit incrementally better than we had seen. So got a little bit of revenue help from that standpoint as well but not really any one-time items.","Toni Kaplan","And now that you've reached your target leverage, can you talk a little bit more about what you would look for in an acquisition? Would you prefer sort of domestic or international for uniform versus ancillary services? And lastly would you expect any regulatory issues just given your size at this point?","Mike Hansen","So from an M&A perspective, we love M&A and our - in the businesses that we're currently in, certainly. Anything from a tuck-in in our Fire, First Aid and Uniform Rental businesses to something larger. We certainly - if there were any M&A opportunities in our space, we certainly want to be involved and would have a great interest in - in pursuing that at the right value.","And we certainly like from a geographic standpoint, it's easier to capture synergies for example, with acquisitions in the U.S. and Canada because we have a presence here, and it allows us to get density in markets to combine capacity if those opportunities present themselves. So we would prefer acquisitions where we can capture better synergies.","Your last question of, do we expect any regulatory issues? That certainly depends on what type of acquisition and the size of that acquisition, but, let's assume a large acquisition in the workwear space for example. If one came available, we love to take a look at it.","And when - I would say something that you may not be considering, others may not be considering is, we have so many people that look at our business from a served market perspective. And we view the market is so much bigger than that.","So for example, we compete in the workwear space, there is a lot of competition in the workwear space. Some of our competitors in workwear are from a retail standpoint. So in other words, they simply sell workwear.","Walmart and Amazon each sell over $5 billion annually of workwear. So they are large competitors in the space. And we have other competitors that provide workwear and design and shipping capabilities. They manage programs to a certain extent. So there are those kind of competitors. And we happened to provide workwear through manage programs. We source, we deliver, we maintain, we launder for our customers.","And so there is a lot of competition in the space. We've kind of told you for many years, over 60% of our new business comes from no programmers. And who are those no programmers? They are retail space, they are direct sellers. They are people who do it themselves. But we've shown year after year, that we, that is part of our market space.","Now we can also lose business to those kinds of - let's call it non-traditional competitors. My point in telling you all of this is, the opportunity is really large and much larger than our served market.","And so, look, if there is an opportunity that's large in our space, we certainly would have interest, we want to understand it, it would have to be at the right value, and we'd have to - we'd have to articulate that competitive set, which we think is quite large.","Operator","Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.","Manav Patnaik","My first question is obviously, the first quarter growth was pretty impressive and well above your full year guidance ranges I guess. Could you just help us maybe walk through, if there is any quarterly cadences that we should be looking at?","Mike Hansen","Well. Sure. So maybe we'll start with the first quarter. We did have a really nice first quarter. Our non-rental businesses performed really well. Paul, maybe - Paul gave a little bit of comment on those, but maybe you can give a little bit more color on those business.","Paul Adler","Yes, sure, Manav. So let's start like with First Aid. We mentioned the organic growth at 13.8%. That's a business that has executed very well. We typically expect organic growth to be in high single digits, maybe 10% is what we've talked about for that business. So they came in a little bit stronger. Of course, there is a lot of blocking and tackling a lot of variables that go into the performance in the quarter.","But of note, we did have a new item that we rolled out in the quarter. A new item in the cabinet and it's kind of like a - kind of like a rollout of a direct sale program, for example in Uniform Direct Sale business where you're putting that into the cabinets, you get a lot of revenue, and then you're counting on some smaller trail of that revenue going on in the lapping quarter.","So a little bit of a boost because of that new product rollouts, and so outlook for First Aid is going to be continuing to have a great year, but probably the latter quarters more in the high single digits where we historically have been.","Fire. That business, impressive organic growth rate of 12.5%. Again a lot of pieces to that with execution of the sales force and great quality service. But they did have a little bit of an easier comp, Manav. I think their growth rates a year ago was about 8%, so little bit higher than 8%. So I think some of the 12.5% was a little bit of that easier comp.","And in that business, the Fire business, there is really two types of revenue streams. There is a more reoccurring revenue stream that we call test and inspection, testing and inspecting fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems, et cetera. It tends to repeat more often.","But we also have another revenue stream when things break, when alarms don't work, you have to perform repair and maintenance. And we had some national account repair and maintenance type revenue in the first quarter that was a little bit larger than we expected, and we don't expect that to repeat. So I think the 12.5% was a little bit higher than we typically expect.","And then finally kind of rounding out the other business units. You'll note - well you can't - I mean we might have mentioned in the prepared remarks that the Direct Sale business had a good growth rate of 5.8%. A year ago, the growth rate was rather weak, in fact it actually had some shrinkage of about 1.8%.","So that's a business that I think benefited from that easier comp in the first quarter. And as we've talked about previously in our prepared remarks that Direct Sale business is typically more of a 3% grower, long-term.","Mike Hansen","Yes. So, Manav when you look at the performance, I would say the non-rental businesses had great quarter, maybe outperformed our expectations a little bit, and probably don't expect that going forward. From a rental perspective, again had a really nice quarter. We had some really good execution by our rental partners. I mentioned a little bit of - the pricing was similar to the fourth quarter, which was incrementally good.","So, got a little bit of benefit there. Probably got a little bit of a year-over-year benefit. Keep in mind, last year in the first quarter, that was our lowest organic growth. So we were - our volumes were still kind of finding the bottom. So probably got a little bit of benefit in that regard too.","So as we look out over the next three quarters, we don't look at - we don't - there shouldn't be a lot of inconsistency in terms of the growth, but you know things can happen from quarter-to-quarter, but don't see a lot of movement from one quarter to the next for the rest of the year.","Manav Patnaik","And then if I could just ask in terms of the G&K revenue synergies. I know, I don't think you are looking to quantify anything. But any anecdotal color on, if you're starting to see that - the needle mover in terms of your results?","Mike Hansen","Well, we started talking about this a little bit. We saw signs of benefit in the first quarter of last year, and saw some nice execution throughout last fiscal year. And so we did see some benefits throughout last year and saw a little bit of that in the first quarter.","As we move forward from a lapping perspective, I don't know that I would expect anything that is significant, but we're - it's something that we're constantly, every week that we visit those customers, we're talking with them, we're educating them on what we do, and sometimes these take time. And we're going to continue to cultivate those relationships as we go. I wouldn't expect any significant amounts in any one particular quarter. But it's certainly is a nice benefit for us.","Operator","Our next question will come from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.","Kevin McVeigh","At this point, given the gross margins, is it fair to say and I know we\u2019re not just interviewing G&K. But is G&K up to the corporate average at this point, or would you expect that to continue to kind of narrow relative to where Cintas is relative to G&K?","Mike Hansen","Well, as you referred to, it's really hard to say. So for example, a lot of that G&K volume resides in legacy Cintas locations. So when you think about that volume, it certainly has helped us in those kinds of locations, create more capacity utilization, create little bit more density and so there certainly is a benefit.","From stand alone locations, many of them have inherited some legacy Cintas volumes, but they're not quite to where we would see the rest of the Cintas legacy locations, but they're making nice progress. So we hope to continue to see improvements as we move forward.","Kevin McVeigh","And then just with the benefit from energy, was that - was there any organic growth headwind, i.e., would there have been maybe a benefit last year from surcharges and you don't have those surcharges, or it would have all been on the expense side?","Mike Hansen","We started to see a little bit of softening towards the end of the first quarter in the energy space. Keep in mind, it's not a big part of our revenue base, but we started to see a little bit of softness, I would say no headwind in the quarter from a revenue perspective. We're keeping our eyes on it though, as we move into the second quarter and beyond.","Kevin McVeigh","I guess, I'm sorry, I was thinking more in terms of fuel. You don't get the fuel surcharges. I know it sounded like you saw some relief from energy costs. I just wondered if that was a headwind on the revenue line.","Mike Hansen","Yes, I'm sorry, we don't have a fuel surcharge. So the energy, the gas prices, we don't flex our pricing or surcharges based on the price of the pump. I'm sorry, what I was referring to was our customers, in the oil, gas, mining areas that generally, when you see the prices of the gas at the pump come down in the past, when we've seen those prices really come down, it kind of hurts that business here in the U.S.","And so the - we saw some benefit in that price of the pump as we said 25 basis points in rental. But we also saw a little bit of softening in the business side of it from a customer perspective. And so that's what we're keeping our eyes on. But we don't have a fuel surcharge. So no impact relative to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gary Bisbee","I guess you sort of alluded to this earlier in the commentary about some of the places where you saw strength this quarter, but clearly in the Rentals business you had a much easier comp on both organic revenue and margins in the year ago. And so I guess I just wanted to ask, is it right to think that that is a portion of the rentals business improvement and may be more significant than any sort of sequential improvement in momentum relative to what you were seeing this past spring? Is that fair?","Mike Hansen","So in other words, yes. Gary, I think your comment on, did we get some year-over-year benefit? Yeah, I think there was probably some of that, as you - as you alluded and I mentioned a minute ago. Our organic growth was still finding the bottom in terms of our volumes in rental and so there certainly is a little bit of year-over-year benefit there. And so I think that's - I think your commentary is reasonable.","Gary Bisbee","And then just thinking sequentially as we've moved over the last few months. Are you hearing anything different from your clients in the U.S. and Canada around the macro backdrop? Some of the forecasts for GDP growth in the U.S. are moderating, some of the industrial activities moderated a bit, though employment continues to be good. But any change in dialog or is it really steady as she goes?","Mike Hansen","Yes. We haven't heard much of a change from our customers and our first quarter results would kind of show that. When we think about the economic picture though as we move in - the last two quarters of our fiscal year are going into mid calendar '20. We do think about the noises around interest rates, the noises - the continued noises around trade and tariffs.","We're going to be entering an election year where there is going to be a lot of noise, and I would say, we look today with a little bit more cautiousness than maybe earlier in the summer. And while we haven't seen much change from our customers yet, we're keeping our eyes on it because there's just so much noise in the environment today.","Gary Bisbee","And then just lastly, can you give us a sense, how much of the All Other segment is Fire versus Uniform sales? And really the reason I ask is, I think a lot of people have always just plugged in low single-digit growth because uniforms was always bigger, but it sounds like Fire keeps growing. Is that, understanding this volatility quarter-to-quarter, is it possible, that's really more should be a mid-single digit type grower, all in given that Fire is growing quickly and Uniform fairly moderately? Is that a fair assumption? And if you could give us the mix that would be great? Thank you.","Paul Adler","Gary, it's Paul. I think that even in our 10-K, we actually have to break - I think the revenue recognition adoption of that FASB caused us to provide more detail. So you can take a look at the last 10-K and you'll see it. But my recollection is - and doing the math the last time that Fire is kind of like about 55% of the mix at this point in time, 45% then is the Direct sale business.","And then to your point, we've tried to add some color that the Fire business is high single digits, 10% organic, whereas that Direct sale business is typically around 3%. Fire - the Fire business had a very good quarter. It improved gross margins and improved operating margins.","But to your point, because of the fact that we lump those together for the accounting guidance, and we call it All Other, it blends this particular quarter to a little bit of a shrink in the gross margin by I think 10 basis points that was. But if that's more due to the - the mix shift and the fact that the direct sale business grew 5.8% and it shifts that mix and could cause that to move. But if you parse those two businesses out, Fire business actually improved their margins as I said.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber","Wanted to ask about working capital, it came down nicely relative to first quarter last year. Do you think you can kind of flip the negative? I think it was 2.60 or 2.75 or so for 2019. Do you think you can flip that all the way back to par this year? Or can you just talk to how you're thinking about working capital for 2020? Thanks.","Mike Hansen","Yes, when we - our thoughts on working capital are when we are growing, we're going to use some working capital. So for example, if we're growing the way we want to grow. Accounts receivable is going to grow. Inventories are going to grow, in-service inventory is going to grow because we are injecting new inventory into new customers and penetrated customers.","So generally speaking, we expect in a growth environment, we expect to use working capital. Now last year, in the first quarter, our use of working capital was quite larger than it was this year in the first quarter.","So we were in the midst of a lot of system integration activity, a lot of G&K integration activity, and so we had some disruption in the accounts receivable environment. We feel really good about where we are today. And so you've seen a little bit of a less of a usage there, from an inventory perspective last year and an in-service inventory last year.","When we make an acquisition like G&K, there are points in time at which we are going through inventory a little bit more quickly because we're transitioning out of legacy G&K inventory into Cintas types of inventory.","Now that didn't happen all at once in the first quarter last year, but it certainly picked up. It continues today but certainly at a lesser pace. And so that's - there was a little bit disruption last year in the first quarter, a little bit more of a steady state this year in the first quarter, but we would expect continued use as long as we can continue to grow.","Seth Weber","So the balance of the year probably look something like the balance of 2Q through - the balance of last year then. Is that a fair way to think about it?","Mike Hansen","Seth, I don't have the balance of last year right in front of me, but I would - generally speaking, yes. We wouldn't expect any - anything of a disruptive nature in those areas.","Seth Weber","And then just follow up on the SG&A, I appreciate you calling out there were some extra expenses there for the quarter. So would you expect, assuming those don't recur SG&A to be down then year-over-year for the rest of the year? Yeah.","Mike Hansen","That certainly is our - yeah that certainly is our expectation. From a self-insurance standpoint, we've had quarters in the past where we'll see one time claims pop up and it results in a little bit of a higher insurance, medical expense than normal. Those may continue to happen.","But generally speaking, we expect to see some nice leverage in SG&A, particularly from the G&A side of things. Paul mentioned that labor, G&A labor was down a little bit and we are very pleased with that. So we'll have disruptions from quarter-to-quarter. Generally speaking, we do expect leverage, no doubt.","Seth Weber","And just, sorry, one last one for Paul, is tax rate kind of consistent here then for the balance of the year just spread evenly 2Q to 4Q?","Paul Adler","Yes, that's reasonable, Seth, but it's just that Q1 that is so - such an outlier because of the stock option exercises. So I think that's good for modeling for the remainder of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.","George Tong","Going back to organic revenue trends. How much of the acceleration in the quarter would you say is due to traction with penetration of the no programmer market versus improving adds, stops or easing competitive trends that you're seeing?","Mike Hansen","Yes, George, not a lot of difference from a normal quarter from the standpoint of new business continues to be strong, productivity from our reps was really good. And within that new business, set was a good no programmer performance. So new business continues to lead the growth effort. From adds, stops nothing to call out really.","But, as I mentioned earlier, pricing in the quarter did help similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. So a little bit, certainly year-over-year help in that regard as well. So real nice sales productivity, little bit of pricing help, real nice execution from our partners.","George Tong","Your gross margins are continuing to improve across your segments. Can you elaborate on how your input costs are evolving and what your latest thoughts are around the impact of trade negotiations on the business?","Mike Hansen","Yes. So from a material costing standpoint, we haven't seen a lot of change right now. It seems like the trade and tariff conversation is more conversation than impact at this point, but it's still creating a lot of noise and uncertainty for our customers and us to a certain extent. But I haven't seen much of an impact.","Keep in mind from a material perspective, most of our material costs get amortized over some period of time, whether it's the life of a garment or the life of a mat, and that amortization period really helps. It's a bit of a natural hedging that helps us smooth those kind of cost out. But I would say no costs to call out from that regard. Labor, we've talked over the course of the last year, we've seen it some pressure in pockets, and didn't see anything new or different in this quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with RW Baird.","Andrew Wittmann","I just had a couple of maybe clarifying questions here. First just on the guidance, I think you guys - obviously the tax rate was low. We expected it to be low. I don't think you guys expected it to be quite this low. I'm just wondering how much of the tax rate was incremental or part of the guidance raise just to tease that element out of the total rates here versus your prior expectation?","Mike Hansen","Yes, I would say in the quarter it was about a $0.06 impact, for the year, probably about an $0.08 impact. And look, the - so much of that impact that we speak of is kind of out of our control. Well you've heard us talk about the equity piece of that and that's what kind of played out - that played the role in the first quarter here.","Andrew Wittmann","And then just on SAP, in the past you've talked about how well rolled out or how thoroughly rolled out that is. Can you just kind of update us as to where we were either at the end of the quarter or where we stand today, Mike?","Mike Hansen","Yes, Andrew. It's - we're about 75% of the way complete now. And so we're still on track to finish that implementation by the end of the fiscal year.","Andrew Wittmann","And then just for other detail here. You did some pretty good amount of buyback in the quarter. Can you give the total number of shares that you bought in and how much is remaining on the authorization that you currently have in place?","Mike Hansen","Yes. During the quarter, we - well, we have $263 million left on the authorization. We bought 837,000 shares for just under $200 million. Keep in mind that all of that purchasing was done prior to our July call. So it was - it did not have an impact on with the guidance that we gave you today.","Andrew Wittmann","And then I guess just the only other question I had was specific around labor. You talked about SG&A kind of labor savings, but in the gross margin in the plant, this has been an area that's been cited maybe more by some of your competitors, but you guys have talked about it a little bit as well. I was just wondering if there is any changes that you've seen in the marketplace for your plant-level labor and how you're dealing with that today, if there is something to be dealt with?","Mike Hansen","Well, you're right. We've talked a little bit about pressures here and there in pockets particularly in that production and plant environment. And I would say, we didn't see much of a change. It remains a competitive environment and we got to do - the best thing we can do is, is keep our turnover - our partner turnover as low as possible. And we've been pretty successful at that. So I know, not much of a change in this first quarter compared to what we've seen over the course of the last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","You're talking about M&A earlier in the call. Have you guys ever purchased a company that had unionized labor force and is that something that would be a non-starter for you? Or is that something that you would still entertain, if there is a lot of synergy potential?","Mike Hansen","Well, Shlomo, G&K had about 20% union workforce when we acquired them. A union environment, a different culture, it certainly creates a different type of environment to operating environment and those kind of things can tend to make synergy capture a little bit more challenging.","And so at the end of the day, would we evaluate something with a heavy union component? You know that's a value consideration more than anything else. And we'd have to take a good hard look at it, because it does complicate the synergy capture opportunity. But there is - that's a part of the conversation around value and consideration.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","And then, did I hear you right that you did not buyback any more stock after the last earnings call?","Mike Hansen","Correct.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","And then could you just - is that usually - usually when companies don't buyback stock and their leverage is below the level that the - consider a target level there is usually something that is a potential out there, is that an unfair assumption for us to make that there might be something in the near to intermediate term?","Mike Hansen","Well, Shlomo, we've always looked at that buyback as we've executed as an opportunistic program. And if you go back over the course of the last 10 years, we are not consistent from quarter-to-quarter and that's by design. We kind of look at a bunch of different things. We look at the performance of the business, the investment needs of the business.","We look at M&A opportunities on the horizon. We look at things like upcoming dividends and we have a consistent history of not being consistent in the way that we execute on that buyback program. And I'm not sure I look into anything more than that.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","And then if you just look at kind of the margins of the business. The First Aid and Safety had really good growth, margin expansion was not a whole lot there. Is there a lot of investment going on in terms of building out routes or anything like that that you're not seeing more leverage here?","Mike Hansen","Well, we had a real nice gross margin quarter with the gross margin being up 110 basis points. And so we're with that growth, we are continuing to invest in routes and in capacity. But really you're right Shlomo, from an investment standpoint, we did continue to invest in the SG&A space.","And so we do see a little bit of an elevated SG&A number compared to last year. Keep in mind, they are also affected by the medical. And that was about an 80 basis point headwind. But you're right, we are continuing to invest in that business. We do really like it.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","And do you mind just going over the days in each quarter year-over-year? So we get that straight for the next three quarters.","Mike Hansen","Yes Shlomo, it's 65 in each quarter of this fiscal year. And then, let's see, compared to '19. So we had 66 in Q1 last year, then 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3, and 66 in Q4.","Operator","Our next question will come from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Thanks very much.","Scott Schneeberger","I just want to hone in a little bit more on pricing, you've mentioned a nice improvement from fourth quarter or at least still solid, which has improved from the third quarter. Could you delve in a little bit to the end markets where you're seeing that pricing improvement. Is there any competitive dynamic that's changed to affect that? And when I speak of end markets, also if you could just specify across the segments too, please. Thanks.","Mike Hansen","So from a market by market - from an end market perspective, and nothing to call out of any significance. You've heard us talk a little bit about the pricing environment over the years. When businesses in the rental business are performing well, when they are growing they have limited capacity and it generally tends to add a little bit of more readableness to the pricing environment, and so we do see a little bit of that going on.","We also I think do a pretty good job of articulating to our customers, why at times pricing can be appropriate. And so I think that execution has been pretty good as well. So combination of the health of the marketplace, our ability to articulate I think that has combined to a nice environment.","Scott Schneeberger","And just following up on, in response to Manav's question early on in the Q&A, you were talking about a new item in the cabinet and how that could have a lumpy effect because the follow-on tapers a bit. I was just curious, how are you doing with opportunities like that rolling out and if you want to share what that new item was, that would be great. But how are you doing with deploying new offerings and servicing - services. And if you could tie that into G&K and if you're seeing any cross-sell benefit from there, that would be great? Thanks.","Mike Hansen","We do - we are seeing some cross-sell opportunities and benefits like we have over the course of the last year. And, but I would say generally speaking and we'd rather not call out that specific item, but generally speaking, we're always looking and investing for ancillary products ways that we can add some value for our customers.","And so in this case, it was a nice benefit. Sometimes those happen in a particular quarter and didn't happen last year, they can be lumpy in terms of when the roll-outs occur, but we like where we are in terms of our ability to create those ancillary products within our businesses.","That's what - we've talked many times about the umbrellas of image safety, cleanliness and compliance and when we think broadly like that with our customers, sometimes, we're able to come up with some pretty nice and unique ideas and we've been - we've had some success over the course of the last year, and that would go for legacy G&K customers as well as into legacy Cintas customers. We've had some nice success.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan Securities.","Andrew Steinerman","It's Andrew. Could you give a quick comment on merchandise amortization, was it a headwind or a tailwind in the first quarter? And given the strong new wins, do you feel like merchandise amortization will be more of a drag going forward to margins?","Mike Hansen","Yes, right. No, there was nothing to call out in that regard during the quarter. We are in an interesting time as I was mentioning earlier Andrew, where we've injected a decent amount of new Cintas product into legacy G&K customers, and that can create some rippling and we're going to see a little bit of that as we move forward, but less of it today than a year ago I would say.","As we move forward, we're going to continue to sell, hopefully a lot of new business, and so we'll continue to inject at pretty good rates. But again, I would say nothing to call out. Our managers are managing the inventory and the in-service pretty well.","Andrew Steinerman","Can I ask as you do inject, excuse me, inject Cintas uniforms into the G&K customer base, do they notice the - that there is a quality upgrade there?","Mike Hansen","We certainly would like to think so, I mean, when we look at the inventory, Andrew, our people understand the features and the functionality of the inventory in the garments that we have. And they are trained to point those features and functions out to our customers. So as long as we are doing our job and introducing those garments and introducing those prominent features and functions of them, I'm expecting that the customers certainly notice.","Operator","All right, thank you. And at this time there are no further questions in the queue.","Mike Hansen","Well. Thank you for joining us tonight. We will issue our second quarter financial results in December and we look forward to speaking you - speaking with you again at that time. Good night.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect. Please, enjoy the rest of your day."],"5437":["Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) F3Q 2014 Earnings Conference Call March 19, 2014  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Bill Gale - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Mike Hansen - Vice President and Treasurer","Analysts","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse","Sara Gubins - Bank of America","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel","Justin Hauke - Robert Baird","Nate Brochmann - William Blair","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Dan Dolev - Jefferies","Sean Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Bill Gale - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas\u2019 Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fiscal 2014 third quarter results. In addition, we will discuss this morning\u2019s press release in which we announced an agreement o combine our Document Shredding business with Shred-it International. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company\u2019s current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","We are pleased to report third quarter revenue of $1.130 billion, which represents growth of 5.1% from last year\u2019s third quarter. Our third quarter had one more workday than last year. Adjusting for this workday difference, revenue increased by 3.5% over last year\u2019s third quarter. Organic growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and workday differences, was 3.1%.","Let me provide some color on our organic growth figure. First, we experienced a weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacting organic growth by 0.5 percentage points the. Second, we had a difficult year-over-year comparison due to our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment having the largest uniform program rollout in the company\u2019s history during last year\u2019s third and fourth quarters. This adversely impacted this year\u2019s organic growth by 1.7 percentage points.","Finally, revenue in this year\u2019s third quarter was impacted by the severe winter weather experienced by the majority of the United States. There were numerous days, in which our operations or our customers or both were closed as a result of the severe condition. Due to the nature of our businesses, the effects were greatest on our first aid, safety and fire protection services and document management services operating segment.","Our operating income for the third quarter was $150 million or 13.3% of revenue. This operating margin was 90 basis points higher than last year\u2019s third quarter operating margin, up 12.4%. Much of this improvement was the result of a very strong performance by our rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment. Also the additional workday in this year\u2019s third quarter had a positive impact on operating margin due to the number of our large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation and amortization being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis.","Third quarter net income was $84.6 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.69, a 15% increase over the EPS of $0.60 in last year\u2019s third quarter. As Scott Farmer stated in our press release, despite the many headwinds this quarter, we grew earnings at a double-digit rate. We are pleased with our results for the quarter and fiscal year-to-date and we complement our employees who we call partners. We especially recognize the hard work and dedication of our route-based operations and partners who were challenged by this winter severe conditions.","Earlier today, the company announced an agreement with the shareholders of Shred-it International Incorporated to combine Cintas\u2019 Document Shredding business with Shred-it\u2019s Document Shredding business. Under the agreement, Cintas and Shred-it will each contribute its Document Shredding business to a newly formed partnership that will be owned 42% by Cintas and 58% by the shareholders of Shred-it. The combined entity will operate under the Shred-it brand and is expected to have annual revenue in excess of $600 million. In addition to its 42% ownership of the partnership, Cintas will receive approximately $180 million in cash at the closing of the transaction, which is expected to occur before May 31, 2014. Following closing the new company will be led by Vince DePalma, current Chief Executive Officer of Shred-it, who will become CEO of the new venture and Karen Carnahan, current President and Chief Operating Officer of the Cintas\u2019 Document Management Division, who will become COO of the new venture.","The partnership will allow the Document Shredding businesses of both companies to leverage the combined scale and create synergies in a way to generate more profitable growth for shareholders, additional opportunities for employees and better service to customers. Such synergies include one IT platform taking advantage of the enhanced revenue and lower cost of plant-based shredding facilities versus on-site shredding and improve route efficiency and density.","We also see this transaction as in the best interest of our shareholders due to the opportunity to enhance value as noted above but also due to the nature of the shredding business. The volatility of the paper price we receive for the shredded paper creates an unpredictable variable in performance that is not present in our other segments. Additionally while we\u2019ve found many opportunities to extend service offerings in our other segments the same does not exist in the Document Destruction business.","Based on our third quarter results and our view of the U.S. economic climate we\u2019re updating our fiscal 2014 guidance with revenue in the range of $4.550 billion to $4.575 billion and earning per share in the range of $2.75 to $2.79. This guidance assumes no deterioration in the U.S. economy, does not consider any future share buybacks, and excludes any impact of the transaction with Shred-it described previously.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on the third quarter.","Mike Hansen - Vice President and Treasurer","Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned total revenue increased 5.1% from the third quarter of last year with total company organic growth being 3.1%. Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 42.4% which is an improvement from last year\u2019s third quarter gross margin of 41.1%. I\u2019ll discuss these items in more detail by segments","Before doing so let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our third quarter versus 64 workdays in the same quarter of last year. Our fourth quarter will also have 65 workdays whereas last year\u2019s fourth quarter had 66 workdays, so we\u2019ll have one less workday in the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year we will have 260 workdays which is one less than last year\u2019s total. We have four affordable operating segments, Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services, and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the phase of the income statement.","The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the third quarter and totaled $801.7 million which was up 7.1% compared to last year\u2019s third quarter.","Organic growth was 5.4%. The weaker Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar impacted our rental segment growth by 0.6 percentage points. We continue to be pleased with the amount of new business generated by our sales representatives. Our rentals segment gross margin was 43.9% for the third quarter, an increase from 41.9% in last year\u2019s third quarter which had one less workday than this year\u2019s third quarter.","We continue to see improved leveraging of our fixed costs. We\u2019ve been able to increase revenue without adding additional processing capacity. Also as we have discussed on previous calls we began to increase our route capacity in last year\u2019s second quarter and we\u2019ve now lapped that initial investment.","The efficiency of these routes has improved and has helped to increase rentals gross margin. The rental segment\u2019s third quarter gross margin of 33.9% was also an improvement from the 42.9% in the second quarter. Energy-related costs were about 30 basis points higher than the second quarter, but improved route efficiency and fixed cost leverage were more than enough to offset the impact and drive margin improvement.","Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the third quarter and totaled $107.7 million. In comparison to the prior year quarter, revenue was 14.6% lower. The nature of this business is that the revenue can be quite choppy based on the timing of large national account program rollouts.","As we have discussed on previous calls, we had several very large national account rollouts during the second half of last fiscal year, which will not repeat this year. This prior year activity included the largest customer rollout in company history in the third quarter of last year. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 27.5% for the third quarter, down from last year\u2019s third quarter gross margin of 29.2%. The prior year third quarter margin benefited significantly from the revenue from our largest customer rollout ever.","Our first aid, safety and fire protection services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First aid, safety and fire protection revenue which accounted for 11% of company revenue in the third quarter was $126.7 million. This represents an increase of 12.3% over last year\u2019s third quarter revenue. Organic growth was 9.2%. The severe winter weather\u2019s impact on this segment\u2019s growth rate was 1.3 percentage points.","The segment\u2019s gross margin was 43.5% in the third quarter compared to 44% in last year\u2019s third quarter. The severe weather negatively impacted margin. Also the margin fluctuates from time-to-time depending upon the mix of products and services provided. The gross margin of 43.5% is slightly better than the second quarter gross margin of 43.4%.","Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services and it accounted for 8% of third quarter total company revenue. Document destruction or shredding comprised about 80% of segment revenue for both the third quarter and fiscal year-to-date and about 70% of segment operating income. Please note that we allocate all of our corporate overhead to each segment. At this time, we are not able to quantify the amount of the overhead currently allocated to the document management operating segment that will need to be absorbed by the other operating segments after the closing of the transaction with Shred-it. We will provide more clarity in July when we provide fiscal year 2015 guidance. A gain or loss on the transaction will be recognized in the period in which the transaction is closed, which we expect to occur in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Going forward, our investment in the partnership will be recorded under the equity method of accounting and we will record our share of the partnership\u2019s net income or loss into our earnings.","Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 29.1% as a percentage of revenue in the third quarter, which was up from last year\u2019s third quarter figure of 28.7%. The change was due to a number of relatively minor items, including payroll tax increases imposed by various states, slightly higher bad debt expense and professional and legal fees related to the document destruction transaction previously mentioned. In the second quarter of this fiscal year, SG&A was 28.3%. The increase in the third quarter is due to the resetting of payroll taxes at the beginning of the calendar year.","Our effective tax rate was 36.8% for the quarter compared to 36.1% last year. Last year, our third quarter effective tax rate reflected the favorable impact of a change to certain tax regulations. We had no similar items in this year\u2019s third quarter. We expect the effective tax rate for the full fiscal 2014 year to be 37.3%.","Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were about $354 million at February 28, an increase of $41 million from the $313 million at November 30, despite the $93 million dividend paid within the third quarter. Accounts receivable increased about $9 million since November 30. DSOs were 41 compared to 40 in last year\u2019s third quarter. Total inventory, including new goods inventory and in-service inventory at about $755 million at February 28 was relatively consistent with amounts at November 30. Accrued liabilities at February 28 decreased from the November 30 balance primarily due to the payment in December of our annual dividend. Long-term debt was $1.3 billion comparable to the amount at November 30 And net cash provided by operating activities for the third quarter was about $386 million, an $18 million improvement over last year\u2019s third quarter.","CapEx for the third quarter was about $37 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $25 million in rental, less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales, $3 million in first aid, safety and fire protection, and $8 million in document management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2014 to be in the range of $150 million to $180 million.","This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now be glad to answer any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Hamzah Mazari from Credit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse","Good afternoon. Thank you. Just a question on the proceeds out of the JV of the document shredding business, I realize you want less exposure to OCC and ONP, but could you give us a sense of what you plan to do with the proceeds? And then also as you look to sell the imaging and storage business, what do you expect out of proceeds for that, maybe uncertain, but just give us a sense do you buyback more stock here? Do you reinvest in the business?","Bill Gale","Well, Hamzah I would say, first off the transaction has not closed. So it\u2019s premature to discuss what we are going to do with the proceeds. Secondly, the board will certainly evaluate the utilization of the proceeds in the best way possible, but it\u2019s really no different than what our current position has always been and that we will utilize our cash to grow our businesses by investing in those businesses with capital expenditures as appropriate. We will certainly look for good acquisitions. We are open to acquisitions in any of our businesses if they make economic sense and we have demonstrated that we certainly will be willing to repurchase stock if warranted. I will remind everyone that we purchased over 3 million shares of stock at the beginning of this fiscal year. With regard to your comment on the storage and imaging business, we have not made any decision yet on whether we are going to sell that business or not. We said that, that business will continue to be operated as Cintas\u2019 businesses. We will look at opportunities for value creation, but nothing has been decided at this point.","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you. And then maybe if you could give us a sense of how to think about the incremental margins you are currently generating, you mentioned better fixed cost absorption. Just give us a sense of where incremental margins are and where they could go given the current pricing environment, the additions on route capacity and just what you are hearing from your customers?","Bill Gale","Well, I would say we have \u2013 I think we have done an outstanding job with our margins in a difficult economic environment over the course of the last couple of years. Again, we are creating much of our growth through new business, which is more costly, but I think with the utilization of our assets, our facilities, our routes have really paid dividends and you have seen the improved margins in the businesses quarter-over-quarter especially within the rental segment and the first aid and safety and fire segments. So where can margins go? Certainly we think that they can continue to improve. We would love to have some opportunity to get some of that from pricing, but pricing remains very competitive as it has been for several years. And so what we\u2019re doing is just making sure we\u2019re running our operations as efficiently as possible utilizing our assets appropriately and we\u2019ve seen some benefits from that.","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse","Okay.","Mike Hansen","Keeping in mind Hamzah at the beginning of the year we signaled that there maybe a need for some additional processing capacity and that we\u2019re still evaluating that but that may occur more than likely not this fiscal year but maybe in for the next fiscal year. And so they\u2019re probably will come a time in the near future when some additional capacity is needed.","Hamzah Mazari - Credit Suisse","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate it and I\u2019ll turn it over. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll now go to Sara Gubins from Bank of America.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Could you give us an update on the trends that you saw in the quarter in add-stops?","Bill Gale","Add-stops we\u2019re still positive in the quarter, Sara but they were less so than they were in the first and second quarter of this fiscal year or even in comparison to the third quarter last year. However, I will remind everyone that those of you who monitor the jobs reports will also note that jobs added in this most recent quarter were less than they were in the first half of our fiscal year as well as in the third quarter of last year. So we would have anticipated more add-stops if the employment level had increased and yet that did not happen.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America","It makes sense. Could you give us an update on trends in different verticals within rentals particularly manufacturing but I\u2019d be interested to get your broader comments as well?","Bill Gale","What we\u2019re seeing is of course what we\u2019re seeing is stable workforces among our customers and we\u2019ve been seeing that for sometime, we\u2019ve talked about it. Growth is coming from pretty much our traditional type of rental customers. I would say there is no one segment that really stands out. You mentioned manufacturing, well manufacturing is a segment, a part of the growth, but it\u2019s really the service business that we continue to see which has the bulk of our wares and we continue to see opportunities for new customers in that particular vertical. So I don\u2019t think anything really sticks out at this time, it\u2019s generally just we\u2019re selling more business to customers either no programmers or currently with other competitors that we really follow our traditional type of uniform ware.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America","Okay, great. And then just last question. It looks like there wasn\u2019t any share purchasing in the quarter although I know you did quite a bit in the first half, any comments on that and how you are thinking about it for the rest of the year?","Bill Gale","Well I think yes keep in mind we bought 3 million share over 3 million shares in the first part of the year but we also were in the midst of this transaction which precluded our ability to be as active in the market as we might have been able to have the transaction not been occurring.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll now go to Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel","Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. Hey Bill, who dictated or what dictated the equity split over there? Why would you guys not want to own that business? I understand there is some volatility but just based on the leverage that is possible from a bigger business and also the capacity utilization from your off-site shredding plus the fact that at some point in time the paper prices are going to come back. I would think that the contribution right now is at a point in time in the cycle that it\u2019s probably not necessarily as good of a price as you could have valued the whole equity at in a few years?","Bill Gale","Shlomo it really comes down to what\u2019s being contributed by both sides to this venture. So the fact of the matter is that Shred-it is contributing more revenue and more EBITDA than we\u2019re at this point given the relative size of the destruction businesses. We think by retaining our ownership in this thing we see a very good opportunity for value creation by the combination of these two very strong organizations. And we think it is a very appropriate time to do this and we\u2019re very pleased with the establishment of the relationship with Shred-it and the fact that we\u2019re not a majority owner, it does not bother us given our confidence in the combined management teams and businesses of the two companies.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel","Just to be clear I think it\u2019s a good deal, I was just hoping you would have done more equity on that deal based on where we are in the thing. I understand you\u2019re saying based on the EBITDA and revenue contribution that\u2019s what you came out with. So, why the $180 million payment, can you give us an insight into that?","Bill Gale","That\u2019s primarily driven by the fact that we\u2019re not contributing any debt to the operation, whereas the partnership is going to actually leverage themselves up with debt and in order to maintain the appropriate equity split we received cash at closing as a result of that transaction.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel","Okay, I understand. And then do you have any kind of estimate in terms of the weather impact to the overall business in general? Is there some way to quantify that or it just seems to me and when I\u2019m going with this is the Uniform Rentals business I thought did particularly well despite the weather issues. So I\u2019m just trying to figure out how well it really did underline?","Bill Gale","Well I think the Uniform Rental business was able to overcome some of the weather issues because many of our locations we have four day \u2013 four days route weeks. So in other words our operations have an extra day if needed to makeup when they have these types of conditions they have to operate in, whereas if you look at our other businesses we don\u2019t have that extra, that flexibility and being able to overcome the loss of revenue on days when operations were required to be shutdown or customers were shutdown. So I think that was one of the main reasons. As far as quantifying it it\u2019s difficult because we looked at it in a number of different ways and I think Mike mentioned it in his comments in the First Aid Safety segment we calculate that we probably have an impact to our growth rate of about 1.5%.","I would say we probably saw a similar if not little greater impact in the Document Management business and the Uniform Direct Sale business is very hard to predict. We know we had lower revenue from our catalog business which is sold by our route drivers due to the fact that they\u2019re focusing making sure that could deliver and pickup the rental products and services and probably did not have as much time to spend with their customers and trying to sell products out of the catalog. The Uniform Direct Sale business much of our \u2013 that businesses in the hospitality sector and obviously they experienced some issues associated with the weather, that mean they slowed down some of their buying, I can\u2019t say that for sure, I suspect that might be part of the case. But certainly weather did have an impact but with all that said I really think our people did a great job I mean we \u2013 I thought the results were very well, very good for given those conditions and so I feel very good about it.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel","And just one more just to clarify, the accounting on the JV, you guys are going to take the profitability of that business on to the P&L below the operating line? Is that how that\u2019s going to work?","Bill Gale","Yes, that\u2019s correct, Shlomo. So just to reiterate what Mike said basically after the transaction is completed there will be the recognition on a quarterly basis of our 42% share of the net income or loss of that JV, of that partnership. Now that partnership\u2019s net income is going to be impacted in the first 12 to 18 months by some one-time cost as they\u2019re attempting to gain the synergies that are going to be very good for this venture. And then we\u2019ll see the benefit of those synergies as \u2013 coming forward as we move through the relationship. Obviously the leverage that will exist on that partnership will also be reflected in their net income, the interest expense. So we\u2019ll be picking that part up in that recognition of the investment in the partnership. But it will be separately reported within the income statement and as you \u2013 you know and just for everybody else\u2019s benefits, we will not be consolidating any of their revenue, it will be strictly an investment line.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel","Right. So in terms of the way you\u2019re going to look at the business, you\u2019re going to \u2013 looking at the business absent this investment basically go on a go forward basis, that\u2019s what it sounds like after the sale?","Bill Gale","I am sorry I don\u2019t understand your question.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel","In other words, on an EPS basis when you guys go ahead and give it, you are going to be talking about the operations of the business that you are actually controlling as opposed to this JV?","Bill Gale","There will be an EPS impact from this investment. It will fall into our net income and therefore be part of our EPS.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel","And you are going to give us guidance based on that as well, you are going to give us guidance next year?","Bill Gale","Well, we are going to give you to the extent we can Shlomo. You got to understand there is a business plan that\u2019s being, going to be developed. We may not have all of the ability to really predict exactly what\u2019s going to happen in the first year or so, but we will give you guidance to the best of our ability in July when we provide our first look at fiscal \u201815.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Hauke from Robert Baird.","Justin Hauke - Robert Baird","Yes, good evening guys. I guess one more question on the transaction. Can you talk about what have any impact on the capital intensity of that business? And I guess the reason why I ask that is you are talking about doing more offsite shredding as opposed to onsite and our understanding has been that, that over the long run that\u2019s less capital intensive, you need less trucks? And I guess the second part of the question would be just in terms of your M&A strategy, the document management has really represented the lion\u2019s share of where you have been focused over the last few years and so now that this is part of the joint venture, I am just wondering is there still the same level of transaction capital that\u2019s needed within that venture from you?","Bill Gale","The new partnership will fund its own capital requirements. So, we will not be injecting any capital to that partnership or we don\u2019t anticipate injecting any capital in that partnership to continue to fund their growth. We still are running and operating storage and imaging businesses although that as Mike said, that\u2019s only 20% of that segment. And I have some capital needs although they tend to be more stair step type needs as you fill up a facility then you have to purchase another facility and build the racking appropriately for that. So I would say that the capital expenditures will be lessened by the result of us not funding the document shredding business. On the other hand, as Mike said, we are going to have some capital expenditures needed over the course of next few years for production capacity in our rental business. We also are continuing on our implementation of an ERP system and that will consume some capital needs over the next year and the year after as we start moving into some of our other bigger businesses to put into SAP.","Justin Hauke - Robert Baird","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess just are you going to continue to at least in the Qs where you have the consolidated contribution of the venture? I mean, are we going to have any more insight other than just the equity income contribution that comes to you, in other words\u2026","Bill Gale","That is yet to be determined, Justin. There is a lot of very complex accounting rules and disclosure rules and we don\u2019t have enough details yet to know exactly what we are going to be required to disclose or not.","Justin Hauke - Robert Baird","Okay. And then just the last one just a clarity, so there was no divestiture of any control of your operations to Shred-it. So in other words, I think you said the $180 million cash infusion was just to balance the capital structure of the two ventures coming together as opposed to you divesting any part of it as their direct ownership?","Mike Hansen","Right. You keep in mind the $180 million is coming to us and secondly we owning 42% of the new partnership, we will not have control of that partnership. It will be a minority interest.","Justin Hauke - Robert Baird","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Nate Brochmann from William Blair.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair","Good evening gentlemen.","Bill Gale","Hello.","Mike Hansen","Hi, Nate.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair","Hey, why didn\u2019t you talk a little bit in terms of just the overall pricing environment, obviously I know that everything kind of remains competitive, but it feels like it\u2019s pretty rationale and stable right now. I was just wondering if you could talk about the pricing environment both in terms of kind of winning new business as well as some of the existing retention stuff?","Bill Gale","Well, Nate, I\u2019d say it\u2019s never rationale enough for us. We\u2019d always like more. But with that said, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s improved a lot, but it certainly has been deteriorated. Our ability to win new business was still pretty good and retaining business, our loss business is very, very good and has been so for the last year or so, but it\u2019s still tough. And I would say we are not able to get the kind of prices we like to have, because we have got some very good competitors out there who continue to price aggressively and we have to be able to meet them in the marketplace.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair","And are you seeing that more in terms of where you are running up against potential new accounts? Are you seeing that more on the retention side?","Bill Gale","When you say more, I think it\u2019s not as bad as it was back in \u201809 and \u201810, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s been pretty steady. We are seeing at both places when a competitor knows that our contract with the customer is up, they are in there wanting that business just like we are in their customers when their contracts are up. And new business, it all depends on how competitive the buyer wants to be if they \u2013 that they want to get multiple bids, then it becomes more aggressive, but on the other hand, they are satisfied that our product offerings are better than what they can get elsewhere and they like the value of the business, which is one of the great things that we think we offer. Then often we can get closer to a book price on those new customers.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair","Fair enough. That makes sense. And kind of going back to the weather and the top line impact a little bit, you kind of gave a rough number of where you think that went and you clearly pointed out the overall macro jobs report number. In your kind of feel and talking to your customers, do you feel that there would be a little bit more momentum if it wasn\u2019t for the weather out there in terms of just where the overall job growth is and your opportunity to win some new accounts or do you feel that it\u2019s still sluggish at best?","Bill Gale","I think it\u2019s still sluggish. I think the weather created a little bit more sluggishness than otherwise would have happened, but there is not a lot of momentum out there from what we can gather.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair","Okay, that\u2019s great. I appreciate it. Thanks guys.","Operator","We will now move to George Tong from Piper Jaffray.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Hi, thanks. You talked earlier about excess capacity investments potentially for next fiscal year, where is your utilization currently and which segments do you think will require the most investment for growth?","Bill Gale","Well, it\u2019s very difficult to utilization, George. It\u2019s just, I mean, this is the local business and you got to look at every operation separately and every market separately, but we think the rental segment is 71% of our overall revenues they also are the ones that are going to require the largest amount of capital infusion in order to continue to grow on such a base. I think we have done a really nice job of continuing to utilize the existing capacity, but we are going to come to a point in certain markets and we have already started the process of looking for appropriate land to build the new capacity and that will be coming online over the course of the next couple of years. We always will have truck needs in both the rental business and in the first aid and safety and fire businesses. So that will be required. And then as I mentioned, I don\u2019t want to overlook whether reiterate this, is the SAP ERP implementation looks like it will go forward and therefore it will consume some big capital in order to get that done, but we think the benefits of that are certainly justifying the expenditure in that \u2013 for that system.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","And do you think the next round of capital infusion or investments will be similar to what you did last year in the second quarter?","Mike Hansen","Last year in the second quarter was primarily a route-based infusion if you will and we are going to \u2013 we have continued and will continue to add routes periodically as we need them and don\u2019t expect another infusion if you will at any one point in time that is a significant amount from a routing standpoint, but as Bill mentioned there maybe some processing capacity CapEx.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Got it. Could you comment more on sales rep productivity in your Uniform Rentals business and specifically quantifying how much of the growth this quarter was driven by new business?","Mike Hansen","Sales growth continues to be driven by new business; our new business results are still good. We\u2019ve been very pleased with the productivity levels. We\u2019d like to see certainly more customer hiring but we just haven\u2019t seen the momentum in the economy to be able to provide for that. So it\u2019s continued to be driven by new business results.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Alright. And then lastly you noted a smaller positive add-stop metric this quarter, what assumptions for add-stops are you incorporating into your revised guidance?","Bill Gale","Well given the range of guidance it really could be anything from flattish to what we saw in the first half of this year. So it\u2019s not going \u2013 we don\u2019t see a significant change in the add-stops ratio over the course of the next three months. But I think the guidance allows for a variable from flat to a little bit more robust than we saw this quarter.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll move to Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Thanks. Good evening guys. With the guidance for fourth quarter and the full year, I\u2019m just curious and we have a little incident that happened in the third quarter with an extra day, but with one less workday in the fourth quarter. Could you give us and help with our models with regard to perhaps top-line and operating income impact there? Thanks.","Mike Hansen","I think from a top-line standpoint you can simply take last year\u2019s fourth quarter revenue divided by 66 days and multiply that by 65 days to get your base. From an operating income standpoint Bill and I\u2019ve generally talked about a 50 basis point impact.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Great. Thanks for that. And then fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014 now, I think you gave 2014 over 2013 for full year date with \u2013 just allowing the theme, but is there going to be a difference?","Mike Hansen","They will be the same. There will be 65 work days in each quarter in fiscal 2015 for a total of 260, the same as to fiscal 2014.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Great, thanks. And then going back to the earlier questions guys obviously a lot of cash coming in, maybe a little you mentioned ERP might take up more CapEx, but probably less from the relationship now with Document Management. So we\u2019ve got into now probably a lot of opportunity for buybacks. But I was just curious I think a lot of the acquisition activity historically has been in Document Management which did certainly leave the door open there. I was hoping to delve in a little deeper as to what type of opportunities you may explore may pursue on the acquisition front? Thanks.","Bill Gale","Scott, we\u2019re going to pursue acquisitions in all of our businesses as appropriate. Now we\u2019ve been making acquisitions in the fire business, we made a lot of acquisitions to establish our footprint in first aid. We\u2019ve had some fairly significant uniform acquisitions although nothing significant since 2006, but we\u2019re certainly open to that. Again you have to have a willing seller and you have to have appropriate valuation to make sense. And we will continue to look at those opportunities as they present themselves.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Great. And one final one if I could, obviously in direct sales a year ago, a big national customer would \u2013 want a progress report on how that\u2019s going and how the big customer addition outlook is within that segment? Thank you.","Bill Gale","The big customer was the United Airlines Continental merger and that was the one that we were asked to provide all the uniforms for the new combined airline. And I would say it went extremely well, they were very \u2013 they\u2019re very pleased with it. And I think it turned out to be successful for both sides.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Thanks, guys. Thanks very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll now go to Dan Dolev from Jefferies.","Dan Dolev - Jefferies","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Back to the acquisition, it seems like it\u2019s a fantastic deal. Per my math you\u2019re sacrificing about $10 million of EBITDA getting paid $180 million. I mean back in September you said that you\u2019re still pursuing a lot of Document Management acquisitions. So my question is really what has changed, was it valuation that was so attractive or were there any other bigger strategic decisions to maybe over time completely get rid of this business in the long-term that made you do this? Thanks.","Bill Gale","Well we really aren\u2019t getting rid of the business. We still own 42% of a bigger entity. So I don\u2019t think you should assume that there was \u2013 that was involved in this. I think it\u2019s an opportunity to join two very good companies that will focus totally on document destruction and I think you\u2019re going to see value creation as a result of those two entities coming together run by very good management teams and we\u2019re going to share in that upside as well as having getting $180 million upfront on this thing?","Mike Hansen","Yes, Dan, one of the reasons we talked about really liking these small document shredding acquisitions over time. And this is very much like a large one where we have a lot of opportunities to put more volume into our plant-based shredding facilities to get efficiencies, to drive on to one IT platform. And we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunities here that it takes a long time to accumulate many small acquisitions in order to get the synergies created by this deal. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re so excited about this deal.","Dan Dolev - Jefferies","Got it. Did it make more sense than just buying Shred-it?","Bill Gale","No, I don\u2019t think Shred-it was necessarily for sale and they were bigger than we were. And I think that the combination of the two made more sense to our Board and to the management team than any other opportunity that was available.","Dan Dolev - Jefferies","Got it. Bigger you mean on a shredding size not on an overall size?","Bill Gale","Right. But that\u2019s what this is focused on is the shredding side only.","Dan Dolev - Jefferies","Got it. Well thanks a lot. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Sean Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi guys. This is Sean Egan in for Joe Box. I just have a quick question. I wanted to go back to the pricing environment you spoke of earlier. When you mentioned that pricing pressures were kind of creating an environment that wasn\u2019t where you would like it to be, we\u2019re hearing from our contacts that they\u2019re getting quite a bit of pushback from a lot of their customers due to Affordable Care Act implications on their budgets. And they\u2019re really sharpening their pencil and pushing back on their vendors and I\u2019m curious to know how much of that pricing pressure are you seeing from competitive or new competitors versus an existing client coming back to you and pushing back?","Bill Gale","Sean I really don\u2019t have the knowledge to really comment on that. Again we\u2019ve got thousands and thousands of customers and locations. I\u2019m sure there were some examples that exist of what you said. But for me to really say that that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing, I really don\u2019t know.","Sean Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, great. And then just a housekeeping item following up, regarding the transaction, are there any anticipated charges such as any write-downs associated with the deal possibly by the end of the fiscal year?","Bill Gale","All that should \u2013 there certainly are those things that could happen. As we said its very complex, accounting and tax transaction, all that will be a part of what a gain or loss gets recognized as we move forward on the deal. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not in a position at this time to be able to tell you what that is because there was a lot of work yet to be done on valuations and really looking at the details of the deal. And we will certainly provide color on that as we report our fourth quarter results in July. We do not anticipate providing any further guidance on that at this time. We will discuss it so with the fourth quarter.","Sean Egan - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, great. That\u2019s all from me. Thank you.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll now go to Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","Hey, good evening gentlemen. Just one question around the thought process with document management, I mean clearly Shred-it was purely shredding, you guys obviously kept shredding in the document management together. Just some can you just remind us sort of what the strategy there was and why that got left behind?","Bill Gale","Well, the original strategy years and years ago, Manav, was that we first got into document destruction, the document shredding. And then we wanted to \u2013 we had some opportunities to pickup some storage business and we thought that, that might be required in order to appropriately grow the shredding business. We have been happy with some of the storage businesses that we have purchased. And as we have studied this industry, you really don\u2019t have to have both of them in all the markets in order to grow either one of them. So it became apparent to us and we started saying this a few years ago that we were going to focus more on the destruction side and we were just opportunistically going to look for places in which to grow the storage business, but not in a big way. Shred-it, on the other hand, has a very, very small storage business in Canada. They have focused primarily almost exclusively on the destruction side. And really it doesn\u2019t make sense to throw our storage and imaging business into this deal, because the whole concept here is to focus on document destruction. And so that\u2019s how this whole thing is transpired.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","Okay, fair enough. And then just a quick point on the M&A pipeline, clearly you guys have slowed down the pace of the small M&A that you guys have done across the board. You mentioned obviously, I sort of understand that landscape in the uniform rental space, but can you help us understand the number of smaller players or midsize larger in the fire, safety area because I guess that\u2019s the other area that you had been active?","Bill Gale","Yes. And we are still active, there are a lot of players in the fire business that we are in discussions with, but again it comes down to an expectation on the part of the seller versus what we are willing to pay in order to get the appropriate valuation for our shareholders. So there have been some small acquisitions and will continue to be. They will pick up when the meeting of the minds get closer together.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","Okay, alright. That\u2019s helpful then. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And it appears there are no further questions. I will turn the conference back over to you Mr. Gale for any additional or closing remarks.","Bill Gale - Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us tonight. I also wanted to thank you for moving it back like we moved back a day and being able to participate tonight. We are sorry for that bit of confusion, but a lot of that revolved around the timing of this acquisition, I mean this transaction I am sorry and so we appreciate that. We are very excited about forming this partnership with Shred-it. We think it\u2019s great for the shareholders, for our customers and for our partners and we will look forward to talking to you more about it in our fourth quarter earnings release, which should occur sometime in mid-July. Good night.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s presentation.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Hansen","Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our third quarter results for fiscal 2016. After our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","We're pleased to report third quarter revenue of $1,216 billion, an increase of 9.7% from the prior year's third quarter. Organic revenue growth which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 6.8%.","Organic growth for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment was 6.1% and the First Aid and Safety Services organic growth was 11.9%.","Third quarter operating income was $193 million, an increase of 11.1% over last year's third quarter. Operating margin improved to 15.9% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 15.7% in the prior year period. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way with a margin of 17.9%.","Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 was $117 million compared to $100 million in the prior year period, an increase of 16.9%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.6% from 9.0% of revenue in last fiscal year's third quarter.","Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter were $1.05 compared to $0.85 from the third quarter of last year. Third quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 23.5% compared to the prior-year period.","As a result of a third quarter results, we are updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4,860 billion to $4,890 billion, and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.98 to $4.03.","This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the US economy or additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in the table within today's press release.","Since the beginning of fiscal year 2016, Cintas repurchased about 5.7 million shares under our buyback program at an aggregate cost of about $483 million, including $100 million of repurchases in the third quarter. The company still has $280 million available under the current Board of Directors stock repurchase authorization.","Before Paul provides more details of company financial performance, I want to take the opportunity to thank our employees, whom we call partners, for an outstanding job. We are proud of our strong financial results. We expect fiscal 2016 to be our sixth consecutive year of double-digit increases in EPS.","Our organic growth rates are well in excess of the growth rates in US gross domestic product and employment, and we continue to both sell new accounts and add value to existing customers by addressing their specific business needs.","We have distinct competitive advantages. Our corporate culture which guides and drives everything that we do. Our innovative and expansive product line that is comprised of many proprietary products that cannot be offered by our competition. And an unmatched scale that provides unique leveraging opportunities, global sourcing capabilities and the best and broadest service structure in North America.","These competitive advantages have led to our history of strong financial results and have made us the clear leader in our industry. We are significantly larger than our competitors. We are growing faster and our margins are better.","These strong financial results, our unmatched scale and our focus on the long-term, allow us to invest in ways not possible for our competitors. We are continuously engaged in the research and development of new products and services. This is evident in the breadth of the product and service offerings compared to others in the industry.","We are able to embark on a national branding campaign visible on television. Our new tagline, Ready for the Workday, speaks to the value we provide our customers in helping them prepare for their workdays.","This campaign is resulting in greater brand awareness to assist with cross selling efforts. It\u2019s also energizing our partners who are now even more ready for our customers. And we are able to make transformative investments, such as our conversion to the SAP system. I'll discuss the status of the SAP project in a few minutes, after Paul provides more third quarter details.","But these investments will continue to strengthen our industry leading position and ensure that we continue into the future helping many, many businesses get Ready for the Workday.","I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional information.","Paul Adler","Thank you, Mike. First please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's third quarter, the same number of days as last year's third quarter. However, this year's fourth quarter will have 66 workdays compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. In total, fiscal year 2016 will have 262 workdays, 2 more than in fiscal 2015.","Finally, note that our next fiscal year of 2017 will have one less day than this year. We estimate that this one less day will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016.","As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.8% in the third quarter. This solid growth rate was driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services and strong customer retention.","Total company gross margin was 43.1% for the third quarter of this year compared to 42.9% last year. Total company energy-related expenses, including gas, diesel, and natural gas for this year's third quarter were 1.8% of revenue, about 50 basis points lower than last year's third quarter.","Note however, that we continued to see the impact of headcount reduction in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from customers in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 80 basis points in the third quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 40 basis points. So on a net basis, the low fuel prices benefited our operating margin by about 10 basis points.","Recall that effective June 1st of this year, we have three reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and all other. All other consists primarily of fire protection services and our direct sale business division. First Aid and Safety Services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement.","Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services.","The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $936 million, an increase of 6.0% compared to last year's third quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth was 6.1%.","Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.0% for the third quarter, an increase of 70 basis points from 43.3% in last year's third quarter. Energy-related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's third quarter.","We estimate that job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year third quarter operating margin by about 40 basis points. So on a net basis, the low fuel prices benefited our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin by about 10 basis points.","Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the third quarter was $119 [ph] million, which was 50% higher than last year's third quarter.","Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for the segment was 11.9%. This segment's gross margin was 42.2% in the third quarter, compared to 47.3% in the prior year period. Operating income margin was 10.6% compared to 14.2% in last year's third quarter.","The reduction in margins is wholly attributable to the impact of the recently acquired ZEE Medical business. We are in the integration phase and incurring the typical conversion costs.","The assimilation of the business, including route consolidation is in process. The completion of which is integral to the realization of synergies. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities that will result upon completion of the integration in about six months.","Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 27.3% as a percentage of third quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's third quarter of 27.2%.","Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 10 basis points higher in this year's third quarter. Also note that our new national branding campaign impacted SG&A by about 45 basis points.","Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter was 33.8% compared to 36.3% for last year's third quarter. A prior year federal tax audit closed during the quarter with favorable results. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 to be about 36.5%.","Our cash and marketable securities were $386 million as of February 29, a decrease of $286 million from the balance as of November 30. Uses of cash in the quarter included $115 million for the dividend, $100 million for repurchases of Cintas common stock and $166 million to pay some of the taxes due on the gains related to the sale of our Shred-it investment.","Capital expenditures for the third quarter were about $85 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segment was as follows, $76 million in Uniform Rental, $6 million in First Aid and Safety, and $3 million in all other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $270 million to $300 million.","Before we open the call up for questions, I'd like to turn the call back to Mike who will provide some additional information related to investments and SAP. Mike?","Mike Hansen","Thanks Paul. Our investment in the SAP system began years ago. We first converted to SAP in our accounting and finance functions. We soon followed that conversion with the implementation of portions of our global supply chain, including production planning and sourcing.","With this experience under our belt, we put our first operating business into SAP, our Document Shredding business, and then our First Aid and Safety business. Over the past 2 years, we have been communicating our efforts to convert our largest operating division, Uniform Rental and Facility Services to SAP, which is a capital investment of approximately $100 million.","We started with the blueprinting phase, which was designing the system. About a year ago, we moved into the realization phase, which was building the system and testing at. At this time, we expect to complete this realization phase in the next three to four months and then move into the pilot stage.","The great news is we've been able to maintain the project costs and time line that we introduced two years ago with minimal changes. I want to say thanks to all of our partners working on this project. They've done and continue to do a tremendous job.","In fact, we feel good enough with our progress to date that we've made decisions to extend the footprint of the SAP system into our distribution network and expand our e-commerce capabilities. We anticipate that these extensions will be a capital investment of roughly $40 million over the next year or so.","Given the progress made and proximity to implementation, we have better visibility and are now able to share with you the estimated impacts to our fiscal years 2017 and 2018. We expect to begin depreciating the rental capital project around December of 2016.","Therefore, our fiscal year 2017 will include about a half of a year of depreciation. It will also include about half of a year of system maintenance costs. The conversion of hundreds of our operations to SAP will occur during fiscal 2017 and extend through fiscal 2018.","Training costs, which are expensed when incurred as opposed to amortized over time, will exist in both fiscal '17 and '18. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have additional - other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely offline.","We estimate that the investment in SAP will result in $30 million to $35 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $45 million to $50 million of expense in fiscal 2018. We will begin to realize some cost structure benefits in fiscal 2019, but will likely see the power of the system beginning in fiscal 2020, once all operations have had some experience in running it.","This is a transformational investment and we are confident it will be successful. We've seen many companies, including some in our own industry, struggle with these large implementation projects.","Our financial strength and commitment to the long-term has enabled us to dedicate the required internal resources to the project in every phase. We also have the best external resource assisting us as SAP and not a third-party consulting firm has been working with us every step of the way.","And as previously mentioned, we have a great experience with SAP from our prior implementations. We look forward to the long-term benefits this investment will provide.","That concludes our prepared remarks and we'll now be happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question with Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Joe Box","Hey, good afternoon, guys.","Mike Hansen","Hi, Joe.","Paul Adler","Hi, Joe.","Joe Box","I just wanted to dig into the 6.1% organic growth rate in uniform. I know you guys usually wait until 4Q to give us a little bit more detail on the breakout of that segment.","But can you maybe just talk to were there any noticeable differences in the growth rate between the 52% that\u2019s uniform and the 48% that is other or any directional trends between the two?","Mike Hansen","Well, we've talked a little bit, Joe, about the issues that we've had in the oil and gas sector. Outside of that though, we haven\u2019t seen much of a change in the operating environment.","And I would say that our sales continue to be broad-based in terms of the different verticals that we're selling to and the different products and services that we're actually selling.","And so we haven\u2019t seen much of a change with the exception of the oil and gas that continues to be problematic and has deteriorated even further in this third quarter.","Joe Box","Got you. So it's fair to say that there's not any sort of moderation above and beyond within the uniform only component relative to where you were at over the last quarter or two?","Mike Hansen","No, and I think the organic growth is fairly consistent with the last quarter, second quarter which was at 6.2%. And so, no, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of change in the economic environment, and based on our guidance, we still feel pretty good about going forward.","Joe Box","Got it. Thanks for that. And then Mike, I appreciate the commentary on the breadth of your products earlier. How should we think about the pace of new product intros going into hygiene, first aid, non-uniform markets? Are you seeing an accelerating pace there based on the new workday campaign?","Mike Hansen","Well, I think from a campaign standpoint, first of all, Cintas and all of our partners are very energized by the campaign. We are really excited about it and it really speaks well of the value that we offer.","I would say that reactions though, to the campaign are primarily anecdotal. We hear a lot of good news from our locations. But it\u2019s too early to tell whether that\u2019s having any impact on our current results. I think we'll know more about that as we go through the next several quarters.","But getting back to the products and services, you know, Joe, we spend a lot of time in terms of innovation. And we invest a lot in R&D to find the right products that can solve problems for our customers. And again, I think that speaks to our new tagline, Ready for the Workday.","And you know, Joe, when we think about the products and services, we've got retail inspired products, like Carhartt and our wrinkle free garments that people want to wear. We've got customer focused solutions like our scrub rental programs and our chemical cleaning solutions.","And the beautiful thing about these products are they are all proprietary. All of these that I have mentioned are proprietary and cannot be offered by anybody else in the industry. We will - when we introduce a new product, we've got 900,000 or so customers out there that are warm leads.","And even though they are warm leads, we don\u2019t get fully penetrated overnight. It takes a while to educate our people on it, on selling new products, and then it takes a little bit of time to sell it to our customers.","But having said that, we've been able to grow quite a bit above, as I said GDP and employment and the industry because in part we've created innovative products and services that our customers want. And I would say that we've also - we've got a very, very, diverse customer base and that diversity has really helped us.","You see others in our industry who are really suffering because of less diversity. We've got a very diverse customer base. And part of that is on design and part of it is we have products and services that reach farther and reach broader than our competition.","So we're going to continue to penetrate our existing customers with our products that we have, and we've got a lot of runway with those. We will also continue to work on R&D. I am not ready to announce any new products. But, Joe, we feel really good about our ability to continue to grow better than GDP, better than employment, better than the industry, because we are innovative.","We've got a broader product line. We've got a diverse customer base, and we've got a great penetration opportunity. We think that has served us very well in the past and will continue to serve us into the future.","Joe Box","Got it. Thanks for all the color on that. Just one real quick one, relative to the stronger dollar, the impact is pretty clear on the Canadian business. I'm just curious though, if there is more broadly an opportunity to maybe source your garments better?","Mike Hansen","Well, Joe, I would say there's always - we would tell our global supply chain people, there are always ways we can improve and I think they believe that as well. The Canadian impact that you are referring to was primarily a top line impact. We haven't seen a significant bottom line impact. But, yes, there are certainly sourcing opportunities.","The good news is we've got a great global supply chain and they are \u2013 they source globally and they are very flexible. We do not own a lot of our manufacturing. And so this group brings us lots of value.","And I would say there are always ways to improve, whether it's new technology, new sources or just changes in mix and volume. We certainly think there are opportunities.","Joe Box","Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I just want to ask about the cross sell opportunity between the First Aid and Safety business and the Uniform business? I think you talked about 20% penetration on the last call.","Just wondering how you guys are thinking about accelerating that and whether getting this ERP system in place will help to do that?","Mike Hansen","We do think that - a couple things, our First Aid and Safety business is doing a great job of digesting the ZEE acquisition. But keep in mind that\u2019s a fairly large acquisition for them. It was more than a third of the legacy Cintas First Aid and Safety business. That\u2019s priority number one.","But clearly, yes, when we are on the SAP system, one of the benefits is that all of our operations will have more visibility and clarity into our customers and the different products and services that they have or don't have. And so we really do believe one of the real big benefits of the SAP system is to improve that penetration.","But having said that, hey look, we feel really good about the First Aid and Safety business altogether. We know that we've got, as Paul said, two more quarters of integration; the integration is going well.","Our margins are down from a year ago. We certainly understand that and certainly some of that is due to integration costs. And others are just due to a different business. We're integrating a different business than Cintas is. And we have penetration opportunities. And when we think about that organic growth that we saw this quarter of 11.9%, we're really excited about that.","Our people in the First Aid and Safety business have still been able to focus on selling and servicing the customers, as well as starting to get into this the ZEE penetration opportunities.","We talk a lot about the penetration opportunities for our rental business. But our ZEE customers generally have been only First Aid cabinet customers. And with our First Aid business, we have the ability or the opportunity to expand into safety products, training services, AEDs, et cetera.","And so have - we feel like we've got a good penetration opportunity there and I think our 11.9% organic growth speaks to that a little bit.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Also just wanted to kind of level set, I guess, on energy. It sounded like it came in pretty close to what you were saying with the 80 basis point headwind on the top line and I guess, 1.8% of cost.","Is the expectation for the fourth quarter still half as much of an impact on the top line and then that 1.8% on the cost side?","Paul Adler","Yes, Greg, it\u2019s Paul. On the top line, from the customer and the headcount reductions, that about half of the impact from Q3 to be experienced in Q4 is a good figure. In terms of the energy, the cost side of it, though, I think the price per barrel really dropped low in our third quarter, I think it reached $26 at one point. It\u2019s kind of rebounded through the $40 threshold.","So I think if it stays at about that level our energy as a percent of our revenue would probably be more in line with our Q2, which was about 2.0% of revenue. And in Q4 last year, our energy was about 2.2%.","So the bottom line is we're expecting probably about 20 basis points of benefits from the prices at the pump. But then really offset by the headcount reductions that we expect to continue to incur into Q4.","Unidentified Analyst","Right. Okay, that makes sense. And I guess the last one, just from a modeling perspective, the organic growth in all other would you guys be able to give that?","Mike Hansen","Yes. So Greg, it was about 8.2% for the quarter. And it\u2019s a strong year-to-date as well. All other, just as a reminder, includes that direct sale business and our fire protection business. That direct sale business is typically a slow grower relative to everything else we have, meaning 3%, 4%.","So for that organic growth to be as high as it was in that all other segments, that fire protection business is growing quite nicely.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","We'll next go to Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nate Brochmann","Yes, good evening, gentlemen.","Mike Hansen","Hi, Nate.","Nate Brochmann","So I wanted to talk a little bit more about the campaign. I know you won't really be able to look back in the rear view mirror for a while to see the impact. Have you - is that still going on the same timeline that you originally thought that it would or has that extended at all?","And then second question, to my knowledge at least since covering you, that this is the first big huge national campaign that you've ever embarked on, and if that is true, why the timing was kind of right to do that?","Mike Hansen","So a couple things. It is following the timeline that we originally established and thought of. I would expect that the spend on this campaign is going to be a bit lower, quite a bit lower in our fourth quarter and likely ramp up again next fiscal year, second quarter-ish.","So it is following the original timeline that we had established. This is the largest and the first national campaign certainly that includes television. And it is the largest campaign that we've ever done.","And so, why now? Look, we think it\u2019s the right time to continue to get our brand awareness greater and greater throughout the country. We've had many customers over the years say to us, gosh, I didn't know you did that. I didn't know that you did first aid and safety. I didn't know that you had fire protection services. I didn't know you had chemical cleaning services. And the more we heard this, we kept thinking we need to educate.","And so we thought that, look, now is a great time to do this because we've got some businesses that are really doing well and executing well. We've got a lot of great products, a lot of fairly new products and we want to get the word out to many, many businesses in North America that when those businesses have issues, need problems solved, think about calling Cintas. They can maybe help us get Ready for the Workday.","And so we think it's a great time to do that because we're executing well. We've got a lot of good products and services, and we think its going to give us some momentum going into the future.","Nate Brochmann","Okay. Great for that. And then just kind to circle back on the end market questions a little bit, just to dive in one layer deeper. But at this point, obviously, I would assume that you feel that you kind of have your arm around the oil and gas headcount reductions. Obviously, by kind of giving where we probably are going to go in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, I would assume that\u2019s the case.","And also based on your earlier commentary regarding some of the other end markets, I would assume you are not seeing any further weakness in kind of maybe some of your industrial end markets, is that all fair to say?","Paul Adler","That\u2019s correct, Nate. As far as oil and gas, right, we believe we have a handle on for Q4 in terms of the quantification. We wish we had our hands around it in terms of thinking and believing that it was at the bottom. But those rig counts that we continue to monitor continue to decline and they are probably down about 60% year-over-year. So we'll continue to watch that into next fiscal year.","And then in terms of manufacturing, it continues to be positive for us. We believe that more of our customers in the sector are stable or growing as opposed to shrinking. But, of course, we understand the headwinds that are out there and the industry statistics. So we'll continue to monitor it.","But, yes, you nailed it, at this point in time the only negative impact in any particular sector is from oil and gas and coal as well.","Nate Brochmann","Sure. Okay. That's great. And then one last, if I could squeeze it in. We talked about, obviously, and \u2013 I mean, it's the way everything goes with the SAP and congratulations for not having any major hiccups so far, knock on wood.","But with some of those costs that you're anticipating going into next fiscal year and the following, are there any potential offsets? And I mean, I know every day you're always working on productivity improvements and efficiency improvements via technology or whatnot.","But is there anything on the horizon that might give us a little bit of an offset to that, that would be above the norm or would there be any potential upside from any synergy benefits related to ZEE?","Mike Hansen","Well, are there any benefits related - synergy benefits related to ZEE? That's a little bit of an independent question. Yes, we absolutely think there are and that will be \u2013 we'll incorporate those thoughts into our guidance for fiscal '17 in July. So, yes, we do think that ZEE and the first aid margins are certainly going to improve.","From an SAP standpoint, let's keep in mind this is the largest project that we've ever done. As we've kind of come to the end of this realization phase and we've been testing the project, we're really starting to see the power of the system and we're excited about getting this implemented.","And we believe that there is the power in the system that we hoped for. We certainly still see that there are long-term benefits. But having said that, we're not going to take any shortcuts in this implementation. We're going to make sure we do it the right way with no adverse impact to our customers.","And one of the risk mitigating things about the way we are rolling this out is that we've got hundreds of operations that need to be converted and they effectively happen one at a time.","And so its not like we turn it on and our entire rental segment goes live. We have to do this one at a time. Now that mitigates the risk to us. But it extends the rollout a little bit as well through that fiscal '18.","And so we - look, we think we're doing this the right way. As I mentioned, we've seen others, both in our industry and outside of our industry struggle with these and we feel fully confident that, that\u2019s not going to happen to us.","Now, certainly those numbers that I gave you are fairly large, and as you know, Nate, we're not going to sit idly by and just let those fall to the bottom. We are going to manage the impact as best we can. We are going to control our cost structure and we're going to become as efficient as we can become in the next couple of years.","Now in fiscal '17, look, we're going to be on probably less than half of our locations and I would not expect that we're going to see a lot of system benefit. In fiscal '18 we might start to see a little bit of system benefit. But it\u2019s going to be muted because we're going to still be converting quite a few locations.","But having said that again, Nate, we're not going to sit idly by and just let $30 million to $35 million drop to the bottom without really managing the impact through our cost structure, through efficiency gains, et cetera. And will we be able to offset all $30 million to 35 million? No, but we will do our best to manage that impact.","Nate Brochmann","That sounds great. Thanks for the added color, Mike. I appreciate that.","Mike Hansen","No problem. And you know, we \u2013 look, do not do things for the short term. So this is a transformational system that\u2019s going to carry us for a long time. And it\u2019s worth the investment. It is absolutely worth the investment we're putting in, in the next couple of years.","Nate Brochmann","Great. Thanks.","Mike Hansen","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take the next question from Denny Galindo with Morgan Stanley.","Denny Galindo","Hi there. Thanks for taking my call.","Mike Hansen","Sure.","Denny Galindo","I had a question on California market, little geographic question. Aramark said they were expanding capacity there and judging by your number of locations, I would guess maybe 7% of your rental revenue comes from California.","Have you seen any impact, any competitive impact from Aramark's increased presence in California or are things pretty much business as usual over there?","Mike Hansen","Denny, we haven\u2019t seen any marketable impact. Our West Coast locations are performing very, very well, and I would expect that they will continue to do so. And we haven\u2019t seen an impact.","Denny Galindo","Is that about the right estimate of the size of California, somewhere around that 7% to 10% of revenue?","Mike Hansen","I don\u2019t have \u2013 I honestly do not have that number in front of me, Denny.","Denny Galindo","Okay. And then a little bit more color on the SAP question. Is the rollout and it sounds like it's location-by-location, is that evenly distributed throughout the year or is there any kind of seasonal impact to the enrollment?","It sounds like it kinds of picks up maybe in the second half of this next fiscal year and does it mean it peaks in like Q1, Q2 and then tapers off after that?","Mike Hansen","So as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're going to start the pilot sometime in the next three to four months. And that pilot is a very important part of our process. That pilot will make sure that the first several systems are operating the way we think they should operate, that the system performance is as we expect, et cetera.","And so, the first half of fiscal '17 is really going to be working through the pilot to make sure that we've built a system, we've tested it, but its not \u2013 we've not gone live with it. That first part of fiscal '17 is really the first test on live customers, and we're going to make sure that, that goes right before we start rolling it out.","So we'll start to see the implementation pick up in the second half of the year and it will continue all the way through fiscal '18.","Denny Galindo","Okay. And how flexible are those cost numbers, if something like if the macro deteriorated, that you think you could reduce the impact from the SAP training by extending it out further or I imagine there is some kind of range of where you think the numbers will really shake out?","Mike Hansen","Well, we - first of all, the longer the implementation takes, the more expensive it becomes, because we have more people tied up in that rollout process. So it does not benefit us to slow or stop that process once we get it started. We need to get it started when we expect to and we're going to see that move through the finish.","But, Denny, if we saw a significant change in the economy, there are things that we can certainly do to help manage our cost structure and really continue to generate some pretty good cash flow, similar to the way we did in the last recession where we generated more cash than ever before in a two year period in the company's history.","So we're going to get this thing done. I would certainly hope that we don\u2019t get into a recession in the next two years. But we're operating for the long-term, Denny. And we believe, as I said, this is a transformational system and it\u2019s going to be great for our customers and our partners who are operating the system.","Denny Galindo","Okay. And one last one, just on the acquisition pipeline. I mean, with kind of energy almost bottoming here, are you seeing any small kind of regional players maybe in an energy heavy area that might be worth buying here or what does the acquisition pipeline look like more broadly?","Mike Hansen","The acquisition pipeline still - I would say still looks pretty good. I mean, we've spent $150 million on acquisitions so far this fiscal year. We continue to look for tuck-in opportunities. We think they are out there.","And we just need to have the willing seller at the right value. But we think there is a nice pipeline and we're going to continue to work that pipeline. So, yes, I do believe there are still opportunities out there.","Denny Galindo","That's it for me. Thanks.","Mike Hansen","Okay.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins","Hi, thank you. On the costs that you mentioned for next year, the $30 million to $35 million, is that all incremental spend? I mean, could you help us understand what it was or what you are expecting it to be in fiscal '16?","Mike Hansen","So it is - I would say that it is mostly incremental spend, and in fiscal '16, we haven\u2019t spent much. There is some training, we are doing things like training the trainers. But there is not a lot of spend that's hitting the P&L this fiscal year.","It will primarily start to happen once we get to the pilot stage and then ramp up once we get to the actual rollout.","Sara Gubins","Okay. And you mentioned that we should also see D&A start to pick up. Could you give us some sense of how we should think about that in fiscal '17?","Mike Hansen","I would say that, I'd rather give you a little bit more information on that in July, because while we've talked about the SAP capital project starting to depreciate, we've got other capital projects that are important to us, like making sure that we have the routes to continue to handle our growth and making sure that we've got capacity. So I think, Sara, I'd rather answer that question in July.","Sara Gubins","Okay. And then just last question, could you give us an update on add-stops, what you are seeing including energy clients and excluding?","Paul Adler","Sara, its Paul. The commentary is very similar to last quarter, meaning that really only two things were noteworthy. First is that in our add-stops metric we certainly see the negative impact to our FRC, our Flame Resistant Garments, as a result of the headcount reductions in oil, gas, and coal. Outside of that though there is nothing remarkable, nothing trending significantly one way or the other.","And then the only other item of note would be that the winter weather here across the country was definitely a little more mild this year than last year. And we typically count on more of that snow and slush to drive mat placements and increase revenue accordingly, changes in garments, outerwear, et cetera. We didn\u2019t see it to the extent we did last year. But it wasn\u2019t significant and it's certainly a seasonal type of an impact.","Sara Gubins","Thank you.","Operator","We'll next go to Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird.","Justin Hauke","Thank you; good evening, guys. I appreciate as well the SAP expense guidelines. I guess, maybe as an offset, a number that we hadn't really gotten is the integration costs associated with ZEE Medical and it was a sizable acquisition.","I think the plan was that, that would be fully done by the end of the year, maybe just an update on that and if you could kind of quantify how much that expense has been?","Mike Hansen","We have talked a little bit about getting that completed by the end of the year or shortly thereafter. And it\u2019s probably going to be shortly thereafter. That does not mean that we've seen any major slippage in the integration. It\u2019s just \u2013 it is a large implementation or integration for our business and we feel like it is going very well.","We haven\u2019t gotten into a lot of specifics about the ZEE integration cost. Justin, with tuck-in acquisitions it becomes a little harder to fully separate total integration costs compared to operating costs.","And so, we haven't tried to come to specific numbers on that - on what is specifically integration, because at the end of the day, we've got costs of operating and costs of connecting the businesses and we're hiring service sales reps, those are our drivers. We're hiring service sales reps and there are costs to getting a tuck-in acquisition ready.","And so, we haven\u2019t called out anything specific. But I would suggest that probably in the fourth quarter we're going to see some results that are probably about the same, maybe slightly better than we've seen in the third quarter. And I would say that the first quarter, maybe even less so in terms of the mix impact.","Justin Hauke","Okay. Yes, I appreciate that. I'm just trying to just understand how incremental the costs are and independent of the synergies if there was something that would come out. But it did sound like we'll get more of that in '17?","I guess, maybe my second question is just the implied guidance for the fourth quarter, and I know this is a little short term oriented. But is the message that you are assuming in the way the guidance is laid out, is that assuming that your margins are relatively flat year-over-year with the fuel cost benefit moderating?","And if that is the case, I guess, how should we think about it from the standpoint that the marketing expense falls off as well in the fourth quarter?","Mike Hansen","Yes, I would say that the guidance suggests that we're kind of bracketing last year. Last year our fourth quarter we were at 15.6% operating margin and I would suggest that if we can reach the high end of that guidance, if things go well, I would expect some margin expansion.","If we see a little bit of a pullback in the economy, if we see the oil and gas broaden to affect other verticals, we might be at the lower end and see flattish or slightly down.","But I'd like to think that we're going to continue to operate in the existing type of economy and if we can hit the top end of the guidance, I would expect that to be some margin improvement.","Justin Hauke","All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate the time.","Operator","We'll next go to John Healy with Northcoast Research.","John Healy","Thanks. Mike, I just wanted to follow up on that question on the margin outlook for 4Q. I was hoping you could size the SG&A benefit you get from having the 66 workdays versus the 65 and just try to put that in context, and what type of scenario would you have to see to see margins going to be anything but up in the fourth quarter?","Mike Hansen","I think we've talked about a 50 - 40 basis point to 50 basis point impact in a quarter for the extra work day, and two thirds of that being in the gross margin. What would we have to see in order for margins to go down, I think we would have to see some pullback in the economy. I think we'd have to see some issues with our customer\u2019s willingness to continue to spend with us. But I would like to think that it is not all that likely.","John Healy","Okay. That makes sense. And from a big picture standpoint, I was trying to think about your customer base in three buckets, your national accounts, your Costcos or Walmarts and General Motors of the world, and then your mid side regional accounts and then your small business customers.","Could you talk to any sort of change in performance in terms of how each of those buckets maybe is performing? Is one of those groups kind of driving the lion's share of the growth in the company these days and has that contribution moved at all?","Mike Hansen","I don't have any specific numbers. But I guess, John, I don\u2019t \u2013 I am not aware of any changes in those buckets. And in terms of the mix and performance, I am not aware of any changes.","Our improvement, our growth continues to be fairly broad. And its - I think its broad in all of our businesses, which tells me that we're seeing good performance in almost every vertical and type of business with the exception of the ones that we called out.","John Healy","Okay. That makes sense. And then one final clarification question. When you mentioned the $40 million to $45 million of spend on the SAP initiative in 2018, was that an incremental $40 million to $45 million on top of the $30 million to $35 million this year or is that an all-in spend number?","Mike Hansen","John, the number was $45 million to $50 million for 2018 and that is an all-in spend. That is not incremental to the $30 million to $35 million for '17, so good question.","John Healy","Thank you.","Operator","We'll next go to Adrian Paz with Piper Jaffray.","Adrian Paz","Hi. Quick question on the taxes. Can you provide more color on the lower taxes that we're seeing this quarter and do you believe that's going to continue into 2017?","Mike Hansen","I do not. Typically we guide towards about a 37.3% all-in tax rate and when we have federal audits, they are fairly large projects and when they - if they are resolved favorably, like this one was, then there can be reserves that we have set up for tax positions that can be released. And that's what happened in this quarter. I think Paul mentioned our expected tax rate is 36.5% for this year, I would expect 37.3% next year.","Adrian Paz","Great. Thanks. Thanks for the color there. And also I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what drove growth in uniform rentals. Could you provide some color on pricing trends that you're seeing in your uniform rentals?","Mike Hansen","Sure. In the US, we really did not see much of a marketable change in pricing from the second quarter, still very competitive, but I wouldn\u2019t say that we saw much of a change. I would say that in Canada, little bit of a different story. We've seen some significant price increases from the competition. And I would suggest it looks likely that they may be looking for some margin opportunities. But I would say, back to the US, not a lot of change.","Adrian Paz","All right. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","We'll now take a question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks and congratulations on the nice quarter, guys. I'm going to jump around a little bit. First one, anecdotally anything to share about the campaign, it\u2019s been asked already, it's a little early.","But you touched on it a little bit, but any specific, without naming names, like anecdotes of where someone actually capitulated and added business from the national campaign? Thanks.","Mike Hansen","I would say - I'm not sure about capitulated, but I would say we get \u2013 we have internal communications that will kind of bubble up comments from our sales people and they will be comments like, hey, I got a call today. A prospective customer heard our television ad and decided to call us and ask about our services.","We might get, as an SSR stops by, a customer each week. We've gotten some examples of customers coming to our SSRs or our drivers, service sales reps. But we've got customers coming saying, wow, I love that commercial. Tell me more about first aid and safety.","We've had examples where regional customers will come to one of our regional sales people and say, hey, I saw the commercial, digital commercial ad and it got me thinking about some of the issues that I have.","And so we've seen it both from television, from radio, from digital; we've seen commentary from our salespeople that our customers are signaling out that they have seen the campaign, they like it; and it piques interest at times in some of the things that we can do for them.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks a lot. And then someone asked earlier about or you guys brought up from a question earlier the new product pipeline. You mentioned a lot of work on R&D, nothing to announce yet.","But you've had obviously a lot of success, Carhartts, Calentel [ph] What - are we on the cusp of seeing something new from you, something big as far as another addition to product service?","Mike Hansen","Scott, I would say that we still have a lot of runway in the products and services that we've announced. We do have some things that are in our pipeline that we're working on, but I am not ready to talk about any of them specifically.","Scott Schneeberger","Fair enough. And lastly, you mentioned extending the footprint on the ERP [ph] for distribution, and particularly including e-commerce. I'm curious, could you elaborate on that, what you are looking to achieve there and what the opportunity is? Thanks.","Mike Hansen","So from a distribution standpoint, that is primarily the distribution centers that ship to our rental locations. And so that is fairly obvious that gets them on the same platform and it makes a lot of sense.","From an e-commerce standpoint, this system will allow us to share with our customers more information, to allow some of our customers an online buying experience similar to retail, and just allow much more ease-of-use from a selling and an understanding of what we do in the products and services.","So it\u2019s really getting to a little bit more of a retail-like application for particularly our larger customers, but for all customers.","Scott Schneeberger","Sounds good. All right; thanks very much.","Mike Hansen","Okay.","Operator","We'll take a question from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.","Gary Bisbee","Hey, guys, good afternoon. I obviously noted, as others have, your comments about the product portfolio and outgrowing GDP and all these things. I guess, a couple of questions on that from me.","The first one just, is there anything that you think any reasons you would expect the business to behave differently in a future recession than it\u2019s done in the last couple? You clearly did not outgrow GDP in 2008, 2009 and the business contracted quite a bit, not only the top line, but also margins. I realize that was a pretty nasty recession.","But anything that leads you to believe you'd behave differently if we had another very difficult economic environment?","Mike Hansen","Yes, I think, first of all, Gary, you hit the nail on the head. That was the greatest recession we've seen in a long, long time. Unfortunately for us that interrupted 40 straight years of growth in sales and profit, so effectively for something like the last 46, 47 years we've grown in 45, 44 of them. So that was a big one. The next recession, a lot depends on how deep and broad it is.","But I - one of the things, when we look at our business today compared to, let's call it, 2006, '07, '08, we've got a broader business. We've got a more diverse customer base. We were not much in the healthcare space back then. We were not much in financial services and other professional environments.","We've been able to get into those much more with both rental, our rental products and services, but also first aid and fire protection. So we're in some verticals that might be a little less or more resistant, like healthcare to a recession.","I think the other thing that I would say that\u2019s different is today our uniform, total uniform business is less than 50% of our revenue. And so, I think if we saw a pullback in jobs, I would not expect that we would lose many customers.","But a lot of our products and services are still necessary for our customers, like hygiene products and services, like the fire protection services, like some of the first aid and safety requirements. And in addition to that, there are some required garments like fire resistant clothing.","So I think the broadening of our product line, the diversity of our customers, will help us through the next recession. But again, a lot depends on how deep is that recession and how broad is it.","Gary Bisbee","Great that's helpful. And then just a follow-up on that. You talk about having a broader product portfolio and I realize a lot of that is the growth of first aid, fire, and safety. But it\u2019s curious to me in that add-stops really haven't grown much.","So it sounds like you haven't had a big part of your growth this up-cycle been driven by selling more stuff to the base. It's been more new customers, if I understand it.","And then I go back to this number you give us on the fourth quarter every year and I'm awaiting next quarter of the mix within rentals and the mix of all the five or six different things you give us has been exactly the same percentages for four straight fiscal years.","So I'm trying to really assess how much the composition of growth has really changed versus just executing well, bringing on similar types of new customers as you've always done in the past, any comments or thoughts on that? Thank you.","Mike Hansen","Well, the - let's talk about the growth. First of all, new business has been very important to us over the last five or six years and will continue to always be important to us. New business, when we sell a new account, we do not normally sell everything in our portfolio to that new customer.","We have to earn the customers trust and we have to show them that our service is of value. So new customers are really important for us. First of all, because they bring revenue but secondly, they bring future revenue opportunities, and so new business will always be very important to us. It is now and will continue to be.","And then the penetration is very, very important. And I would tell you that the net add-stops metric, it\u2019s a legacy rental metric, and when we have broadened our business like we have, it really doesn\u2019t apply as much when we're talking about selling hygiene products and services to our customers, selling chemical cleaning solutions.","That net add-stops really speaks to uniforms and mat placements. And we don\u2019t like to, we don\u2019t pay attention to it quite as much internally because it\u2019s just losing its importance as we broaden our business.","So I would say, new business will continue to be important, penetration will continue to be important and the reason that you haven\u2019t seen any change in the mix of our rental division is because its all been growing and its really important for us that it all grows, because that means we are adding new customers and we are penetrating existing customers. It\u2019s all really important for us.","Paul Adler","I think, Mike, too, and Gary, everything is growing. So the percentages are not changing significantly. But it's also an over $3 billion segment that's going to take some time to change.","And one way it is changing, even though proportionally it\u2019s not changing. But for example, in garments, you manufacturing is a minority of the business and we are replacing the typical blue-on-blue shirt and pants with Carhartt or with performance polo\u2019s or cargo pants.","And so in hygiene, for example, we have our hygiene standard [ph] signature line that is able to get us not just into the typical restrooms of manufacturing or oil change shops, but high end into offices and corporate complexes.","And I think that changeover, even though proportionally it\u2019s not changing, but the kind of the substance of it, the quality of it, so to speak, should bode well and hopefully make us more resilient in the future.","Gary Bisbee","Great. Thank you. Just one quick cleanup one. The incremental SAP expense you called out, is that in SG&A or would any of that be in cost of services and should we on a segment basis think it's all in rentals? Thanks a lot.","Mike Hansen","I would expect that that will all fall into SG&A and the great majority of that will fall into rental.","Gary Bisbee","Thank you.","Mike Hansen","Okay.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Adler, Mr. Hansen, I'll turn the call back to you for any closing or additional remarks.","Mike Hansen","Thank you very much for joining us tonight. We will issue our fourth quarter earnings in mid-July. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Good night.","Operator","That concludes today's conference and thank you for your participation.",""],"5496":["Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) Q2 2016 Earnings Conference Call December 21, 2015  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Michael Hansen - VP, Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Paul Adler \u2013 VP and Treasurer","Analysts","Manav Patnaik \u2013 Barclays Capital","George Tong \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Gary Bisbee \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Nate Brochmann \u2013 William Blair","Sara Gubins \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Andrew Wittmann \u2013 Robert W.

And after our commentary, we'll be happy to answer any questions.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","We're pleased to report second quarter revenue of $1.219 billion, an increase of 8.5% from the prior-year second quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 6.5%.","Organic revenue growth for Uniform Rental and Facility Services was 6.2%, and the First Aid and Safety Services organic growth was 9.8%. The performance of our sales force in both segments continues to be strong, with the solid improvement in the sales rep productivity. We are pleased with our ability to continue to add new customers and to provide existing customers with additional products and services from our broad line.","Second quarter operating income was $200.3 million, an increase of 10.3% over last year's second quarter.","Second quarter operating margin improved to 16.4% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 16.2% in the prior-year period. The Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment led the way with a margin of 18.1%.","Net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 was $115.5 million, compared to $103.7 million in the prior-year period. An increase of 11.3%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.5% from 9.2% of revenue in last fiscal year's second quarter.","Earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 were $1.03 compared to $0.86 for the second quarter of last year. Second quarter fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations increased 19.8% compared to the prior-year period.","We are on pace to achieve our sixth consecutive year of double-digit increases in EPS. As Cintas CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, we're happy to again report strong increases in revenue, operating income and EPS. We thank our employees, whom we call partners, for continuously striving to exceed expectations.","As a result of our second quarter results, we're updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4.825 billion to $4.880 billion and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.83 to $3.90. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or additional share buybacks.","The EPS guidance is detailed in the table within today's press release. On December 4, we paid an annual dividend of $1.05 per share, totaling $115.5 million. The dividend per share was 23.5% more than last year's annual dividend of $0.85 per share, and was the 32nd consecutive year it have been increased.","The dividend coupled with our share buyback program demonstrates our commitment to increasing shareholder value. As previously disclosed since the beginning of fiscal year 2016, Cintas repurchased about 4.5 million shares under our buyback program at an aggregate cost of $382.9 million, including $180.4 million of repurchases in the second quarter. The company still has $380 million available under the current Board of Directors stock repurchase authorization.","Before Paul provides more details of company financial performance, I want to briefly address the impact of oil, gas, and coal on our results.","We've talked a lot about the benefits of low fuel prices, but we've seen these low fuel prices affect our customers more than anticipated 90 days ago. U.S. oil rig counts are down over 60% compared to last year, and the price of oil has tumbled below $40 per barrel. We see the impact of headcount reductions in not only the oil industry, but also in gas and coal. We estimate that headcount reductions in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 75 basis points in the second quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 35 basis points. While low fuel prices still more than offset this bottom-line impact in the second quarter, we expect this net impact to be even or slightly negative in the second half of the year.","I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional information.","Paul Adler","Thank you, Mike.","First, please note that there were 65 workdays in this year's second quarter, same number of days as last year's second quarter. The same will hold true for the third quarter. However, this year's fourth quarter will have 66 workdays, compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. In total, fiscal year 2016 will have 262 workdays, two more than in fiscal 2015.","As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.5% in the second quarter. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, customer retention, and price increases, all contributed to this solid growth rate.","Total company gross margin was 43.3% for the second quarter of this year compared to 42.9% last year. Total company energy-related expenses for this year's second quarter were 2.0% of revenue compared to 2.6% of revenue in last year's second quarter.","I will address the impacts of oil, gas, and coal and the recent ZEE Medical acquisition on gross margin at the operating segment level.","Recall that effective June 1 of this year, we have three reportable operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business division. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.","Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.","Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $937.7 million, an increase of 5.2% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, organic growth was 6.2%.","Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 43.9% for the second quarter, an increase of 60 basis points from 43.3% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's second quarter. We estimate that job losses in oil, gas, and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year second quarter gross margin by 20 basis points.","Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products, and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $120.4 million, which was 46.4% higher than last year's second quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis growth for the segment was 9.8%.","This segment's gross margin was 43.2% in the second quarter compared to 46.7% in the prior-year period. The reduction in gross margin is wholly attributable to the impact of the recently acquired ZEE Medical business. Given that the acquisition occurred about four months ago, we are in the integration phase and incurring the customary costs of conversion. The assimilation of the business including route consolidation is now under way, which is integral to the realization of synergies. And we're pleased to report 90 basis points of improved gross margin on a sequential basis. We're excited about the benefits and opportunities this acquisition provides. First Aid and Safety is well on its way to becoming a $0.5 billion operating segment for us.","Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 26.8% as a percentage of second quarter revenue, compared with total company SG&A in last year's second quarter of 26.7%. Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 10 basis points higher in this year's second quarter.","Very soon, we will introduce an exciting new marketing campaign. The expense of the campaign began to be recognized in the second quarter. Its impact on SG&A was about 10 basis points. The related expense will continue through the end of the fiscal year with the greatest impact falling in our third quarter.","Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 37.4%, the same rate as in the prior-year period. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect the effective tax rate to be 37.3% in both the third and fourth quarters. For comparative purposes, the effective tax rate in last fiscal year's third and fourth quarters was 36.2% and 37.6%, respectively.","On October 1 of this year, we sold our investment in Shred-it for $578.3 million before taxes. Cintas also has the opportunity to receive up to $34 million in additional consideration in the future, subject to certain holdback provisions. Note that the gain on sale of the investment is included in discontinued operations. The sale of the investment completes our exit from the document management business.","As a result of both the shredding transactions and the sale of the documents storage business, we realized total proceeds of $1.100 billion on a segment that had annual revenue of about $316 million. That's a multiple of three times annual revenue.","Our cash and marketable securities were $672.6 million as of November 30, an increase of $472.4 million from the balance as of August 31. Cash provided by operating activities was $122 million in our second quarter. Uses of cash in the quarter included $180.7 million for repurchases of Cintas common stock.","As previously mentioned, $578.3 million was received in the quarter, as proceeds on the sale of the investment in Shred-it. Note that our cash will be used in part to pay the taxes on the gains on our Shred-it investment in our fiscal third quarter and fourth quarter. The amount of taxes to be paid is approximately $225 million.","Capital expenditures for the second quarter were about $59 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segments was as follows: $51 million in Uniform Rental, $3 million in First Aid and Safety, and $5 million in All Other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million.","That concludes our prepared marks. We're happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","Yeah. Hi, good evening, gentlemen. I just wanted to just get a little bit more color on the energy, gas impact that you guys talked about. So you said 75 basis points to your organic growth for the total company, if I heard you right. So what is the assumption embedded in the full year guidance in terms of how that impacts your top-line number?","Michael Hansen","Well, Manav, that \u2013 first, let me say that understanding this is not \u2013 the impact of this is not an exact science. So we said 75 basis points in the second quarter. And I would say in the second half of the year, we would expect roughly the same in the third quarter, 70 to 80 basis points. And then probably in the fourth quarter, about half of that, because we \u2013 the fourth quarter is when we started to see the negative impact from our customers last year.","And so, if we continue at the current rate, we would expect that the year-over-year impact is going to be slightly smaller in the fourth quarter.","Manav Patnaik","And is it fair to say that most of that is in the Rentals or is there some of that in the First Aid as well?","Michael Hansen","There is some of that in the First Aid as well. We do have a very nice business in that industry from a First Aid and Safety standpoint.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. And then just around sort of these impacts from layoffs and so forth, I mean we've been reading a lot of that happening on the industrial side of things. Can you remind us of your exposure there, or if you're seeing any of those come in more negatively than maybe you would have thought?","Paul Adler","Yes. Manav, this is Paul. First, I would say that we've worked hard to diversify our customer base. And we've disclosed previously that we have no single customer that comprises more than 1% of our revenue. And we also don't have any three-digit [makes] [ph] code or industry code that comprises more than 10% of our revenue. And obviously, we have weathered the offshoring of all the U.S. jobs, U.S. manufacturing jobs years and years and years ago, and we continued to evolve.","Now, we have more hygiene products than we ever had before. We have retail-inspired work wear like Carhartt that enables us to put people in uniform that previously did not want the program or were not interested in one. And we're in healthcare with scrub rental. So we continue to evolve, such that currently, our percentage of our customer base that is in the service-providing sector of the economy is about 70%. So about 30% of our customer base is in the goods-producing areas of the economy. And by goods-producing, I mean oil, gas, coal, construction, and manufacturing as well.","So we obviously are reading the same press releases that you are. We understand the headwinds to U.S. manufacturing, and we're keeping an eye on it. But at the same time, we're trying to keep things in perspective. We do know that not every single one of our customers in manufacturing exports. And so, for many of those, they are receiving the benefits of lower energy prices and other low input costs to their cost structure like commodities, et cetera.","So the bottom line is we're continuing to monitor it. But at this point in time, the only negative impact to our business that we see in this goods-producing sector of the economy is from oil, gas, and coal.","Manav Patnaik","All right. Fair enough. That's really helpful. Thank you so much for all that color.","Michael Hansen","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll go next to George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","George Tong","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Can you discuss how add-stops performed in the quarter, both including oil and gas, and excluding oil and gas?","Paul Adler","Yes. I would say there's two things that were noteworthy regarding adds and the stops in the quarter. And the first, of course, is the impact to our metric from the headcount reductions in the oil, gas, and coal. We definitely saw that negative impact in our flame-resistant garment add-stops metric.","The second item of note was that we did have some softness in our add-stops as it relates to weather. If you recall last year, at this point in time, winter seemed like it had already arrived, and it's been a much milder fall and start to winter this year. And when we don't have that snow, we have fewer mat placements. And that cold weather also helps us to get some additional revenue change over into outerwear, jackets, long sleeves, et cetera. So it's hard to quantify, but we do know that there is some softness as a result of that seasonal fluctuation.","George Tong","Got it. And so, would you characterize the add-stops as being overall positive low single-digits, negative?","Michael Hansen","Well, George, the second quarter is generally a positive quarter from us because of some of the things that Paul mentioned, because of the seasonal nature of jackets and extra mat placements. So it was positive, but not as positive as last year, and due to the reasons that Paul cited.","George Tong","Very helpful. And then can you discuss some plans to add to routes this year and how you expect route efficiency to evolve?","Michael Hansen","We plan to add routes similarly to the way we've done in the last few years, and that is throughout the year. Our anticipation is to add routes to allow our drivers, our service sales reps, the time and the daily capacity to proactively serve our customers to look for up-selling opportunities, et cetera. And so I think we'll \u2013 we don't expect any dramatic changes in route efficiency this year compared to last year because in both years, we're going to be adding.","George Tong","Got it. And then lastly, can you discuss the sustainability of a high single-digit organic growth in your First Aid and Safety segment, and how penetrated your customer base is with First Aid, i.e., what percentage of rental customers are also purchasing First Aid products?","Michael Hansen","Far fewer than 20% of our Uniform Rental customers are purchasing First Aid and Safety Services from us. We think there's a lot of runway there. And we still believe that there are a lot of opportunities outside of our existing customer base as well. In that First Aid and Safety business, there are a lot of businesses today who are handling these issues themselves in-house, maybe going to a catalog company or to Wal-Mart to serve \u2013 to take care of their first aid and safety needs. And we believe that we can do it much, much more efficiently at a great value for them. But we've got a lot of opportunity there to get more into our programs, again both within our customer base and outside of our customer base.","How long can we continue this high single, low double-digits? We believe into the future. We love the opportunity that the umbrellas of first aid, safety, and compliance bring us, and we think it's really a great business model for us and a great value proposition for businesses.","George Tong","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Michael Hansen","Okay.","Operator","We'll go next to Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.","Gary Bisbee","Hey, guys. Good afternoon.","Michael Hansen","Hi, Gary.","Gary Bisbee","It's sort of curious that with the All Other segment as you're calling it now having larger revenue and gross profit than First Aid and Safety that you don't provide any commentary. But I wondered if, at a minimum, you can give us the organic revenue growth for that segment in the quarter.","Paul Adler","Yes, Gary, the organic growth was 6.1% in the quarter. And just remember that that All Other contains predominantly your fire protection services and then also contains our direct sale business, or our national account programs. And so just remember that that can be choppy just by the nature of that direct sale business with the fact that you have rollouts with large customer programs that don't, by their very nature, repeat.","Gary Bisbee","Right, yeah. It looks like that -- is it fair to say that it gets a little tougher from the trend of that in the next couple of quarters? It looks like you've now grown solidly four quarters in a row.","Michael Hansen","I would say that while it can be certainly a bumpy business, the direct sale, I don't know that I would say we're facing headwinds. We still expect good organic growth and improving operating margins.","And keep in mind Gary, there are specific segment accounting rules that I think Paul went over last quarter that we have followed and will continue to follow as it relates to break out of the businesses.","Gary Bisbee","Yeah. No, No, I was just \u2013 it was curious that you've given comments on the first two but not the third. But I understand it \u2013 no, I understand why. So, at any rate, moving on, just any updated color from what you said a quarter ago just on how we should think about the phasing of the integration of ZEE and the costs? Is it reasonable to think that that gross margin continues to decline sequentially like it did this quarter over the rest of the year, or is there anything that would make that more less in the near-term?","Michael Hansen","It is reasonable. So we're about a quarter into that integration. It's going well as Paul mentioned. We are converting routes on to our SAP system. We are rebranding our trucks and that process is going very well. We like the improvements that we're seeing. We still have a lot of improvement opportunities and we would expect that sequentially, over the next several quarters, we'll continue to improve. We could have a little bumpiness here and there given the integration process, but generally speaking, yes, sequentially, going forward, we expect to see improvement, and we're excited about the opportunities that they bring. I would say that when we get to our July earnings release, we'll probably be in better position to speak to our thoughts going forward on the business. But as for this fiscal year, we're focused on the integration, and as I said, it continues to go well.","Gary Bisbee","Thank you.","Michael Hansen","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll go next to Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nate Brochmann","Good evening, guys. Congratulations on another good quarter.","Michael Hansen","Thank you.","Nate Brochmann","So I just want to talk two things. One, obviously, you guys have been getting a lot of sales productivity. Part of that is just a function of some of the process things; part of that is the ability to sell more.","Just wondering how much more runway you think you have there before you might have to reload or kind of juice a little bit a hiring on the sales force front.","Michael Hansen","Well, just, Nate, just as we are with our routes, we're consistently adding sales reps as well. We certainly understand that in order to keep growing, we do need to continue to expand. We believe that we have opportunities, that there are prospects available for us to continue to add. And the other great thing is, while we're adding, we're also seeing productivity improvements. And as you said, some of that is process and some of that's innovation that allows us \u2013 allows our sales reps to have more opportunities to sell.","So, we're going to be adding, just as we have over the last few years. There have been times in the last several years, both in our sales reps and in our routes where we have increased the rate of additions in a quarter here or there, but absent that increased rate, we're generally adding because we want to continue to grow, we want to give capacity to our routes, we want to give \u2013 we want to get in front of more prospects and existing customers.","Nate Brochmann","And then along those lines, in terms of some of those process\/innovative improvements, are those ongoing in terms of constantly know very year, identifying a couple new tweaks that make those processes or those innovations better? Or has there been a couple one-time things that have had kind of oversize impact, or anything that might have an oversize impact over the next 12-18 months?","Michael Hansen","Well, we're \u2013 a part of our culture is to continuously challenge ourselves and improve. And so I think we get incremental improvements every year, whether it's with the hiring of new reps and the profiles that we're looking for, whether it's the training that we do to get them ramped up as quickly as possible. The selling process itself, we're constantly looking for ways to improve. We do have a nice sales prospecting system that we put in, gosh, in the last year or so that is helping us. But I don't know that I'd see or care to share any other improvements that will be a leap forward in productivity levels in the next year or so.","Nate Brochmann","Fair enough. And then just kind of a \u2013 kind of more industry question, but it feels that right now, things are kind of rational out there. I know it's always competitive pricing, but I was wondering if you could kind of comment a little bit on where you see industry pricing right now in terms of both renewals as well as for new awards.","Paul Adler","Yeah, Nate, this is Paul. Pricing environment really hasn't changed significantly from last quarter. Still favorable overall, as we continue to talk about the value of our services and our products. But at the same time, it does remain competitive. National accounts are, in particular, more competitive than other business, and that's why we still focus on new business efforts around those no-programmers, those that have not had the program before, as we get the best value there. And that split, Nate, at still 60-40: 60% from no-programmers, 40% in terms of getting share from our competition.","Nate Brochmann","Great. It sounds good. Thanks for the time.","Michael Hansen","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll go next to Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Was the marketing campaign planned earlier and always contemplated in the guidance, or is that new? And could you tell us a little bit more about it?","Michael Hansen","Let me make sure I understood that correctly. Did you ask if it was in the original guidance or...","Sara Gubins","Yeah. I'm just wondering if it's something that's \u2013 I'm wondering if it's something that was \u2013 that is a new development over the course of this fiscal year or if it was something that you had always contemplated when you originally gave guidance for the fiscal year?","Michael Hansen","Got it. We did contemplate it as we moved into the early in the fiscal year. And with something like a campaign, you can kind of turn it on and off a little bit, you can serve it to meet the needs, and we've done a little bit of that. And we didn't \u2013 because at the beginning of the year, there's \u2013 we've got so much of the year to go. We want to see how the beginning of the year goes before we commit to things. But the year has gone well so far. We did start spending on that campaign in the second quarter. I would expect as Paul said to see that expense go up in the third quarter.","We're excited about the campaign. One of the things that we hear from our customers frequently is that, they didn't know that we can provide all of the different products and services that we do. So for example, we hear from Uniform Rental customers, gosh, I didn't know that you were in the first aid and safety business or I didn't know that you have \u2013 that you provide fire protection services. And so one of the goals is to raise awareness of all of the ways that we can provide value to our customers and we're excited about that.","As it relates to more details, I would say stay tuned, but we're excited about that. Now, when we...","Sara Gubins","Okay.","Michael Hansen","When I mentioned that \u2013 and Paul mentioned, that we'll see a little bit more expense in the third quarter, let me speak a little bit to the second half of the year guidance. Paul touched on a few things in his opening comments. One is we may spend a little bit more on this marketing campaign in the third quarter. Secondly, our tax rate in the third quarter last year was less than what we're guiding towards this year in the third quarter. It was more in the fourth quarter last year than what we're guiding towards. So that's going to have a year-over-year impact, so slightly negative in the third, maybe a little bit positive in the fourth.","And then the last thing I would point to as it relates to the second half of the year guidance is that we have one more work day in the fourth quarter than we do in the third quarter. And so when you take all three of those things and you think about our guidance and you think about your modeling, I would suggest that the fourth quarter is going to be weighted more heavily in terms of profitability than the third quarter is. So, sorry for that [indiscernible].","Sara Gubins","Okay. Great. Thank you. No, that's very helpful. Thank you. I think that before, you talked about energy cost being \u2013 expecting them to be about 2.5% of revenue this year. I'm guessing that now you expect that they will be lower. What are you anticipating for energy costs this year as a percent of revenue?","Paul Adler","Yes, Sara, the guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that we're going to remain at that same percent of revenue that we are in Q2, which was that 2.0%.","Sara Gubins","Okay, great. And then just last question about margins for from rental. I know there are a lot of puts and takes given the marketing campaign, given the pressure from energy clients. Is it fair to assume that the margin expansion you saw in the second quarter is \u2013 on a year-over-year basis is about what we should expect to see in the back half? Or would we even maybe potentially see less because of the marketing campaign ramping?","Michael Hansen","And so, if we think about the overall operating margin, I think that we expect that we'll get some continued margin improvement in the back half of the year. It is going to be a little bit pressured, though, because the year-over-year benefit of energy is going to decrease, probably if \u2013 assuming that 2% rate is down to 40 basis points in the third and 20 basis points in the fourth, and that negative impact from oil and gas customers will start to become a bigger part of the net number, if you will.","So while we do expect to continue to improve margins, I would say that given the pressure of that alone, we might be a little \u2013 we might see a little bit of narrowing in the second half of the year.","Sara Gubins","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew Wittmann","Hey, guys. So, Mike, just to build on this, and sorry for beating a dead horse, but is it the growth investments that you're making that's preventing more operating leverage from coming through? I mean ex-energy here, obviously there wasn't a whole lot here. It seems like there could be more, but it's \u2013 is it just really more reinvestment in the business that's holding you back from putting up [indiscernible] margin gains higher than this, given that organic growth has been excellent?","Michael Hansen","Well, so, Andy, keep in mind that you can't just take the energy benefit, the 60 basis points year-over-year and say that that is the only impact from energy. We are seeing our oil and gas customers being negatively impacted, probably to a larger extent in the second quarter than we anticipated 90 days ago. So, certainly, that low fuel price is having an offset, and we're seeing some of that.","On the other hand, we are \u2013 we will continue to invest in the business. And you are correct: some of that \u2013 I mean, if we pulled back on investment, we could certainly make margins get higher. But we want to keep investing in the business, and we'll continue to do that going forward.","Andrew Wittmann","With the medical being \u2013 thank you for that. With ZEE Medical now being four months in, and actually, sequentially showing some less-tier \u2013 is this one of the reasons for the guidance? It's like, Mike, before, you were saying kind of zero contribution, but it seems like it might to be off to a little bit better start than that. Is that true or how will you break down the guidance hike?","Michael Hansen","I would say that the guidance hike is a bit on second quarter performing pretty well, and maybe a little bit slightly better than we anticipated, and then just a firming of how we feel about the overall business including the First Aid and Safety improvements.","So while I wouldn't put a lot into saying that the ZEE is going much better than we expected, it's going well, and it's going fairly closely to as we expected, and maybe a little bit of that improvement could come from ZEE. But I think it's the combination of feeling really good about the second quarter performance and seeing that move into the second half of the year.","Andrew Wittmann","Thanks. Maybe the last question, then, like on \u2013 you picked up an acquisition or some assets from one of your competitors in a court proceeding in the past few months here. I was just wondering if you could give us some help on how that's going to flow through your income statement, including what you expect in terms of the revenue contribution maybe on a go-forward basis, or even what it was in the second quarter? Any financial numbers, color on that transaction, I think, would be helpful for shareholders.","Michael Hansen","Sure. On December 4, we closed an acquisition of Coyne Textile Services. Coyne was in bankruptcy proceedings. We did not buy all of the business; we bought only a part of the business. It's a little bit of a different kind of acquisition for us; first time we bought a business out of bankruptcy. And so, we're in the midst of integrating that, and because it's in \u2013 because it was in bankruptcy, obviously it probably wasn't the strongest business that we've every acquired.","And so we want to make sure we understand how it rolls in, but it's \u2013 we paid about $33.6 million for the acquisition. We believe that it will provide about $25 million to $30 million of annual revenue. We're in the midst of integrating that into quite a few different rental facilities where it's a really nice tuck-in opportunity. We have contemplated that into the guidance. And I would say from a top line perspective a couple things to keep in mind, while we have contemplated that into the guidance, we have also seen the impact of the Canadian dollar weakening a little bit more than we anticipated 90 days ago. And as we talked about oil and gas, that impact, negative impact is a little bit higher than we anticipated 90 days ago as well.","And so when you combine those three things together, we feel like the right thing to do is to leave the top end of the guidance where it is, but we feel good enough about the operating environment to move that bottom end of the guidance, revenue guidance up $25 million.","From an EPS standpoint, that acquisition kind of fits into, again, getting a better feel for where we are at the middle of the year. And while we might see some benefit, we are \u2013 from a bottom-line standpoint, we really need to see what we've got coming out of the holidays before we can adequately assess that business's impact.","Andrew Wittmann","That's really helpful. Thank you very much.","Michael Hansen","Okay.","Operator","We'll go next to John Healy with Northcoast Research.","John Healy","Thank you. Mike, I wanted to ask a little bit just to get some more color on how you're feeling about the holidays and how they'll impact the business. With Christmas week on, plant shutdowns and whatnot over the \u2013 at the end of the year could be quite volatile and just kind of any initial early read on how those might trend to the last year and maybe the prior years.","Michael Hansen","No initial signs that it will be different from the previous years. I will tell you that we're cautious about the way we view this economy. And coming out of the holidays, we're a little bit probably more cautious than we thought we would've been 90 days ago. But we still feel good about our ability to execute in this environment.","I think, John, a little bit more as it relates to the holiday, and then rolling into January-February, I think a little bit more has to do with the weather. We'd like to see a little bit cooler weather to add more jackets; a little bit of \u2013 a little bit more rain and snow will add some more mat placements. That, we'd like to see, and probably has us watching more closely than any shutdowns during the holiday period.","John Healy","Got you. And on the direct sales business, I think this is around the time of the year, or maybe it was a few weeks, that usually starts some of those outerwear promotions. Is the outlook for the direct sales business a little bit more \u2013 a little bit softer than maybe you would've thought 90 days ago just given the weather, and that's kind of business that you just won't be able to recoup?","Michael Hansen","I would say that while there is a little bit of that, yes. We do have a lot of good projects in the pipeline in that business and our expectation is that we'll see an offset. So I don't anticipate any unusual softness in that business in the next six months.","John Healy","Okay, great. And then just one final question. I know you touched on a bit about the new marketing campaigns. I was hoping you could maybe give us a little bit color in terms of how you're trying to reach the customer. Is it a different \u2013 is it more of a different message or is it a different way. Maybe you're going more to social media or maybe you're going to the television commercials. Any way you can maybe talk to how the ad campaign attempts to reach the small business customer who is putting your services on the shelf?","Michael Hansen","John, I would say we're looking at ways to get as many touches as we possibly can, but I'd rather not get into too many details. I would just say stay tune and we'll talk about it certainly more at our third quarter call.","John Healy","Great. Have a great holiday.","Michael Hansen","Thank you. You too.","Operator","We'll go next to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Good evening, guys.","Michael Hansen","Hi, Scott.","Scott Schneeberger","Hey. Going back, you highlighted 70% of the business is really a lot of service customers, and then 30%, I think you've said oil, gas, coal, construction, manufacturing was the brunt of the that. And thank you very much for the color you provided on oil, gas, coal. I heard some cautionary remarks on construction, manufacturing saying those domestically \u2013 who don't export are doing okay, but what's in the guidance? Is it \u2013 going back on the guidance overall, what effects those first three components that are more commodity components, is that basically if the current commodity prices remain the same is how you're thinking about the guidance?","And then part of the question too is if you could just elaborate on the concern you discussed on construction and manufacturing, was that just reading headlines like the rest of us? Was it the import-export? And is that petering on being something that could go incrementally worse? Thanks.","Michael Hansen","So our guidance contemplates that the environment that we see today continues. And I would say that we have \u2013 throughout our second quarter, we did see our oil, gas, mining customers being more negatively impacted than in the previous quarters. But I would say we haven't seen it extend to any significant degree outside of that. We didn't see that in our second quarter. And I think what Paul was referring to is that we're not convinced that we're in an industrial recessionary environment. We certainly know that the strong dollar can have some impact on certain types of manufacturing and certain types of customers, but we also know that it's a benefit to others. And our thoughts are generally that the current operating environment will continue in the second half of the year. And while we're cautious and maybe a little bit more so than 90 days ago, we still feel good about this operating environment and in our ability to achieve the guidance in this environment.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. And a moment ago, when you mentioned that forex, obviously a headwind, could you remind us what your mix of international revenue is? I believe it's predominantly Canada. And I recall you went a little bit international in hospitality just to follow customers a few years back. And given these conditions \u2013 so, international mix is the first part, but the second of the question would be how are you thinking about M&A abroad right now, just expansion. And I guess particularly within Canada. Thanks.","Michael Hansen","Well, so, I would say 6% to 7% of our total revenue is international, most of which is in Canada. We have primarily our Rental business in Canada. We do have a direct sale business that is not significant, but certainly part of that business. And with the ZEE acquisition, we just got into Canada. That is a \u2013 not a significant amount of the ZEE business either, but all of that combined, probably 6%-ish in Canada, 1% or less everywhere else. And so, let me pause, did I answer your question Scott?","Scott Schneeberger","Yeah. And the follow-up would just be appetite on M&A, I guess, in general?","Michael Hansen","Yes, M&A. So from an international standpoint, because of some of the document management divestitures, we do have about $100 million of cash outside of the U.S. And we'd certainly look for good opportunities to make investments, for example with the ZEE business. We paid for the Canadian business with Canadian dollars \u2013 with international dollars. So we'd love to continue to do that kind of acquisition opportunity.","As it relates to M&A, in general, so in the U.S., primarily, the pipeline has been good for us in the first six months or so of the fiscal year. We made the ZEE acquisition in August, we made this Coyne acquisition in early December, and we would love to continue to make acquisitions like these two that are great tuck-in opportunities where we feel like we can get really good incremental margins.","Scott Schneeberger","Great. I appreciate it guys. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Hi. Thank you for squeezing me in at the end of here. Most of my questions have been answered, I just have a couple. Could you give a little bit more specificity on the percentage of the revenues, especially from just like oil, gas, and mining? Maybe just honing in on that, is there a number that you can give us?","Michael Hansen","A lot \u2013 about a year ago, Shlomo, we talked about that being 2% to 3%; let's call it 3%-ish. I would say given the course of the events over the last year, that business is smaller than 3%.","Our other businesses have grown and continued growing, and that business has not. So it's still a fairly small block of business for us, but it has suffered quite a bit.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. So we're talking about it's like 3% going down maybe a little less than a 1% in terms of total revenue. Just looking at materiality?","Michael Hansen","I don't know that's going down that much, Shlomo, but probably in the 2%-ish.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","No, I don't mean, 2%-1%. I'm saying it may be dropping from 3% to 2%.","Michael Hansen","Oh, yes, correct.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Okay. And then there's a fair amount of cash on the balance sheet from Shred-it, and outside of paying Uncle Sam, is it that the intention to use for more of these type of acquisitions or should we \u2013 if we're thinking about prioritizing on that, would you think \u2013 should we be continuing to model in a certain level of share repurchases as you guys have been doing for a while now?","Michael Hansen","So, a couple of comments on cash. Yes, there is a lot on our balance sheet at November 30. A couple of things again, about a $100 million of that is outside of the U.S. So to bring that into the U.S. would be fairly costly.","We did spend a $115.5 million on our dividend in the first week of December. That was a dividend of a $1.05, which was a 23.5% increase, so we are happy to share that with our shareholders. We did make the Coyne acquisition that closed on December 4 to just over $33 million. And as Paul said, we've got a \u2013 you'll see on the balance sheet about a $236 million income taxes payable that will happen in February.","So those last three items we're going to be spending just under $400 million on those alone. So while there is a lot of cash on the balance sheet at November 30, there are plans for a good chunk of that.","Having said that, we'll continue to generate cash. We would love to put that cash to work in accretive acquisitions, similar to ZEE and Coyne. And we'll keep looking for those opportunities. That certainly is our highest priority. But if there aren't good opportunities and we believe that the share buyback program is appropriate, we've certainly got a track record of showing that we will put that cash to work.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Great. Thank you.","Michael Hansen","Okay. And we'll go next to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi there. I just wanted to quantify a little bit more about the sales administrative line. It was under 27% of revenues, which is towards the low historically, and I definitely heard it's going to bump up at the marketing campaign. My question is just what's a normal sales and administrative percentage while revenues continue to grow at a healthy rate? Will we stay in this kind of 27% range in leverage or do you think over time that has to kind of go back towards 28%?","Michael Hansen","A couple of comments and thoughts. You may see from a First Aid perspective, we're getting really nice G&A leveraging from the ZEE Medical acquisition. That's a business that \u2013 where we didn't bring a lot of G&A and overhead across, and that's why we'd like that opportunity so much. So we've seen some real nice leveraging there. Yet a marketing campaign is a little bit of a blip in the second half of our fiscal year, but I would say going into the fiscal 2017 and then even more so in fiscal 2018, we're going to have the SAP project concluding and beginning to depreciate. And so we will see some impact of that in the next two fiscal years. Absent that, we absolutely believe that we should be and believe we can grow SG&A at a slower rate than our revenue growth, and we expect that every single year. And so absent the couple of callouts, we expect to get leveraging in the G&A area every single year.","So getting back to, is 28% the right number, Andrew \u2013 or is 27%, 28% is right number, we need to see a little bit more of how our First Aid business operates with the ZEE integration. And I think next year will be a better indicator.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay. Thank you.","Michael Hansen","Okay.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions. So I hand the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Michael Hansen","Well, thank you all for joining us tonight, and we wish you all a happy holiday. We will issue our third quarter earnings in late March. And we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you. Good night.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"5498":["Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) Q4 2016 Results Earnings Conference Call July 19, 2016  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Mike Hansen - Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Paul Adler - Vice President and Treasurer","Analysts","Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets","Nate Brochmann - William Blair","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jeff Goldstein - Morgan Stanley","Andrew Wittmann - R.W.

Today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Hansen","Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2016. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","We are pleased to report fourth quarter revenue of $1.271 billion, an increase of 11.3% from the prior year fourth quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and workday differences, was 6.7%.","Fourth quarter operating income was $203 million, an increase of 14.2% over last year's fourth quarter. Operating margin improved to 16% of revenue, compared to an operating margin of 15.6% in the prior fiscal year. The Uniform Rental and Facilities Services segment led the way with an operating margin of 17.7%.","Net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 was $118 million compared to $101 million in the prior year, an increase of 17.3%. Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved to 9.3% from 8.8% of revenue in last fiscal year's fourth quarter.","Earnings per diluted share or EPS, from continuing operations for the fourth quarter were $1.08 compared to $0.86 for the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations increased 25.6% compared to the prior year period.","As our CEO Scott Farmer stated in today's earnings release, these achievements are the results of our employees, whom we call partners in being ready for our customers. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our partners for continuing to generate industry leading results.","Our fourth quarter results were a strong finish to an excellent fiscal year, one in which we achieved record revenue and record EPS. We have a diverse customer base with about 70% of our revenue coming from customers and services providing areas of the economy. This has been made possible by our wide range of products and services.","As a result of these and other assets, we have grown significantly in excess of US GDP and jobs each year since the Great Recession, and we are the clear leader in our industry, and in more ways than one, including size, growth rates, profit margins, quality, service and innovation.","In addition to the success on the top line, we have delivered it on the bottom line. As Scott Farmer stated in today's press release, Cintas has increased EPS by double-digits in six consecutive years. Our research indicates that this feat has been accomplished by less than 5% of S&P 500 companies.","Our cash flow and scale allow us to invest in numerous ways. In fiscal 2016, those investments included CapEx to both maintain and grow the business, and strategic investments, like our SAP project, and new Ready for the Workday branding campaign. We made acquisitions in our Rental, First Aid and Fire businesses and we have the capacity to do more.","This past year, we paid our regular dividend and it was an increase of 23.5% over the prior-year's dividend. Since we went public in 1983, we've increased the annual dividend every year. Finally, in fiscal 2016, we repurchased shares under our buyback program at an aggregate cost of $759 million, including $276 million in our fourth quarter.","Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, we expect revenue to be in the range of $5.150 billion to $5.225 billion, and EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.45. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the US economy or future share buybacks. It does include our expectations for our continued SAP system implementation, and the impact of one less workday in fiscal 2017, compared to 2016.","We estimate that this one less workday will negatively impact fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points and operating income margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016.","I'll now turn the call over to Paul for additional information.","Paul Adler","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's fourth quarter compared to only 65 in last year's fourth quarter. We estimate that this additional day benefited the quarter's operating income margin by 40 to 50 basis points.","As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.7% in the fourth quarter. This solid growth rate was driven largely by new business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, and strong customer retention.","About 60% of new business wins continue to come from no-programmers, or customers that have never had a rental program. We are providing no-programmers in healthcare with scrub rental, those in construction and trades with Carhartt-branded workwear, and no-programmers and customer-facing positions like retail, theme parks and transportation, with performance polos and cargo pants.","Our broad range of innovative and proprietary products and services enable us to do more for the customer, including uniform and mat rental, hygiene, first aid supplies, CPR and other training, and fire extinguisher testing and recharging, to name a few. And the more we do for the customer, the more they appreciate our quality and service, and the less likely they are to leave us.","Total company gross margin was 43.6% for the fourth quarter of this year, compared to 42.6% last year. Total company energy-related expenses, including gas, diesel and natural gas for this year's fourth quarter were 1.8% of revenue, about 40 basis points lower than last year's fourth quarter.","Note, however, that we continued to see the impact of headcount reductions in the oil, gas and coal industries. We estimate that the resulting decrease in revenue from customers in these industries lowered our organic growth rate by about 100 basis points in the fourth quarter and reduced our operating margin by about 50 basis points.","So, the low fuel prices were not enough to offset the negative impact from our energy customers, and the net impact from energy was a headwind of about 10 basis points.","We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.","Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment included the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route.","Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $965 million, an increase of 8.3% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes, workday differences and acquisitions, organic growth was 6.3%.","At this time of the year, we provide revenue mix for this segment. Due to the fact that we changed our segments this fiscal year, I will provide the prior year data for comparability. The revenue mix for the segment for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015 was as follows.","Uniform Rental accounted for approximately 50% of total revenue compared to 51% last year. Dust Control, comprised mainly of entrance mats, accounted for 18% in both years. Hygiene and Other Services, including Restroom Supply, Cleaning Services and Chemical Services, was 14% of total revenue versus 13% last year.","Shop towels were unchanged from prior year at 5% of revenue. Linen and Other, which is mainly non-person-specific garments such as aprons and butcher coats was 9% compared to 8% last year, and Catalog Sales were 4% this year versus 5% last year.","Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.3% for the fourth quarter, an increase of 150 basis points from 42.8% in last year's fourth quarter. We estimate that the extra workday in this year's fourth quarter compared to last year benefited operating margin about 40 to 50 basis points, the majority of which falls within gross margin.","Energy related costs were 50 basis points lower than in last year's fourth quarter. However, job losses in oil, gas and coal negatively impacted this segment's current year fourth-quarter operating margin by about 50 basis points.","So, on a net basis, the low fuel prices did not benefit our Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating margin because they were offset by the headcount reductions impacting our oil, gas and coal customers.","Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of First Aid products, Safety Products, and Training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $123 million, which was 45% higher than last year's fourth quarter. Total growth benefited from the ZEE Medical acquisition. On an organic basis, growth for this segment was 6.9%.","This segment's gross margin was 42.9% in the fourth quarter compared to 46.8% in the prior year period. Operating income margin was 10.9% compared to 15.2% in last year's fourth quarter. We did see a 30 basis point sequential improvement in operating margin.","The reduction in First Aid organic growth rate and margins is wholly attributable to the impact of the acquired ZEE Medical business. Recall that ZEE was about one-third the size of our existing First Aid business, a significant acquisition to this operating segment. We continue to incur the typical conversion costs, which impact margin from the short term.","The assimilation of the business, including route consolidation, is still in process, as expected. In fact, the fourth quarter saw the largest number of ZEE locations being integrated. All of these efforts have a short term impact to growth rates and margins, as is common in an acquisition of this relative magnitude. The completion of the integration will be followed by the realization in full of the synergies. We are on track and continue to be pleased with this acquisition.","Regarding selling, and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 27.6% as a percentage of fourth quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A in last year's fourth quarter of 27.0%.","Medical expenses as a percentage of revenue were 20 basis points higher in this year's fourth quarter. Also note that our new national branding campaign impacted SG&A by about 35 basis points.","On June 1st, $250 million of debt, with a coupon of 2.85%, matured. We refinanced this debt in the form of commercial paper. By staying short in commercial paper, paying about 70 basis points, we were able to reduce interest expense in fiscal 2017 by about $5 million, and avoid a headwind that would result from financing with long-term debt.","Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter was 37.1% compared to 37.7% for last year's fourth quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 to be about 36.7%. That's up slightly from fiscal 2016's 36.4%.","Our cash and marketable securities were $210 million as of May 31st, a decrease of $177 million from the balances of February 29th. Uses of cash in the quarter included $278 million for repurchases of Cintas common stock and $57 million to pay some of the taxes due on the gains related to the sale of our Shred-it investment.","Regarding the sale of the Shred-it investment, please note that the impacts are accounted for throughout the cash flow statement. The proceeds from the sale of $581 million are recorded as cash provided by investing activities, while the taxes paid on the gain from the sale are recorded as cash used in operating activities.","This accounting, while proper per Generally Accepted Accounting Principles has the effect of understating cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow if one does not remember that the taxes paid relate to a non-recurring transaction in which the benefits in the form of cash proceeds are recorded in another section of the cash flow statement.","So if we eliminate the impact of the sale of the Shred-it investment from the cash flow statement, cash flow provided by operating activities would be $695 million for fiscal 2016 versus $580 million the prior year, an increase of 19.8%.","Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were about $68 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segment was as follows, $56 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services, $9 million in First Aid and Safety, and $3 million in All Other.","We expect CapEx for fiscal 2017 to be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. This range includes about $40 million of CapEx related to our SAP implementation.","Regarding SAP, as we disclosed last quarter, we expect to begin depreciating the project around December 2016. Our fiscal year 2017 will include about a half a year of depreciation. It will also include about half a year of system maintenance costs. The conversion of our hundreds of operations to SAP will occur during fiscal 2017 and extend through fiscal 2018.","Training costs, which are expensed when incurred as opposed to amortized over time, will exist in both fiscal 2017 and 2018. As is customary in such a conversion, we expect to have other additional costs in 2017 and 2018 as a result of inefficiencies until the old system is completely off-line.","We estimate that the investment in SAP will result in $30 million to $35 million of expense in fiscal 2017 and $45 million to $50 million of expense in fiscal 2018. The estimated fiscal 2017 expenses are included in our 2017 guidance.","We will begin to receive some cost structure benefits in fiscal 2019, but will likely see the power of the system beginning in fiscal 2020 once all operations have had some experience in running it.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. First off, I was just hoping you could help us bridge to your 2017 revenues between what you would consider organic growth and the FX or M&A impact?","And then maybe more specifically, you can talk about how you're thinking about organic growth in 2017 and how it compares to the - I guess, nearly 7% you delivered in 2016?","Mike Hansen","Greg, we don't typically give organic growth because lots of things can happen throughout the year. But I - you can probably see from our guidance where the revenue range is 5% to 6.5%. That's pretty much in line with what we gave in terms of initial guidance last year.","Keep in mind that, as I mentioned, we'll get a negative impact of 40 to 50 basis points because of the one less workday. And so I would say that we're not expecting too many changes this year, but we don't give specific organic growth numbers.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Fair enough. And then maybe on the energy side, it sounded like the negative net add stops were a little worse than you had expected in the fourth quarter. Maybe you can talk about the moving pieces and how you're thinking about that in 2017 between cost saves and potential further pressure, if we are in a lower for longer oil environment?","Paul Adler","Yes, Greg, it's Paul. Add stops were - they were negative this quarter, but they typically are. There are some seasonal impacts that impact us in the fourth quarter. For example, we have jackets coming off from the winter and being returned to the stock rooms. We have mats that are extra mats that some of the customers were snow and slush, and those are returned as well.","So typically, add stops are negative in the fourth quarter, and they are for us this fourth quarter. And then to your point, they are a little more so than typical, because we still are feeling the effects of headcount reductions in our energy customers.","In terms of next fiscal year, we can tell you that we still expect to have some headwinds from oil, gas and coal customers. We would expect the headwind to revenue in fiscal '17 to be about 60 basis points, and that's built into our guidance. So that's the top-line impact. On the bottom line, we would expect that to be a headwind then of about 30 basis points of operating margin.","The other impact that we believe we will have is just in the fuel costs. Whereas we had a benefit in fiscal '16, we're modeling that the fuel will be a headwind to our cost structure to maybe about 30 basis points.","Unidentified Analyst","A headwind to - on the cost side, higher fuel costs?","Paul Adler","Yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","Paul Adler","On fiscal '16, on a net benefit - or a net basis rather, in fiscal '16, considering the benefit of fuel and the cost structure and then the negative impact of the headcount reductions, reducing revenue and operating margin, we had like a 10 basis point improvement for fiscal '16. Whereas in fiscal '17, we are expecting it to be more of a 60 basis points headwind. So quite a significant change.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.","Gary Bisbee","Hey, guys. Good afternoon.","Mike Hansen","Hi, Gary.","Gary Bisbee","I thought it was an interesting statistic you gave, if I heard it right, that 70% of your revenue you think is from services industry end markets or customers. And can you just help us frame that, I mean, how - what would that have looked like five years ago? Has that been a pretty substantial shift over time or has it been more moderate?","Mike Hansen","I would say in the last five years, probably not too substantial. But over the last, let's call it 15 years, probably much more - and probably even more inverse of that. You know, as jobs over the last couple decades have been off-shored, we have certainly been forced to look for other ways of creating revenue in terms of the uniforms, and that, we've been very successful in the service providing areas.","And so, I would say it's different from certainly 15 years ago. It's probably not too different from five years ago. But I would say that it continues - we continue to perform well in those areas.","A couple of the different pieces that we would see as better today than maybe five years ago even, and certainly 15, would be healthcare, which, 15 years ago, we probably had a very, very small presence and food service.","And in both of those, we've been able to come up with creative solutions, innovative solutions, to get more of an impact in those verticals, and that certainly has helped us.","Gary Bisbee","And when we think about that, is that both a uniform rental story, and then also just penetration of a lot of the other stuff that has broader appeal or is it more the latter than the former?","Mike Hansen","No, that's all of our businesses. And when you think about the Rental segment by itself, there's not a lot of difference in terms of the vertical splits between Uniform Rental and Facility Services. We are providing many of those products to the same customers, and so not a lot of difference there.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. Great. And then if I could just ask one more. Can you give us any more color on how the branding campaign is working? I think we saw - we are seeing commercials, and seen them on the Internet and a few other things.","But what has that done? Is that just awareness or are you actually seeing this help you closing the business? Thank you.","Mike Hansen","Well, the branding campaign has continued, and we certainly - our Cintas partners, our employees are very energized and excited about it. And so it's had a positive impact on us certainly from an energy and excited standpoint.","But we're too early to begin to measure the impact of it. I think I mentioned last quarter that it would probably be more like the second half of fiscal '17 before we would start to really be able to measure any kind of impact.","Keeping in mind, it is a brand awareness campaign. So it is trying to make sure that our customers and our prospects understand and know all of the different things that we can provide to them, all of the different products and services. And we are not specifically targeting any one of them right now.","So, again, we're excited about it. It's going well. It's been - the feedback that we get anecdotally has been very good. But I don't expect to be able to give any measurements on it until the back half of fiscal '17.","Gary Bisbee","Sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nate Brochmann","Hi. Good evening, gentlemen.","Mike Hansen","Hi, Nate.","Paul Adler","Hi, Nate.","Nate Brochmann","So just playing off of Gary's question there a little bit, and I think that's one thing that you guys have really done a great job of in terms of maintaining the sales momentum in somewhat of an underlying sluggish job growth environment.","Could you talk a little bit about, as you go back 15 years ago till today, in terms of being able to change the customer buying behavior to kind of except maybe those new rental uniforms that you have going into those newer industries for you?","And then, second, how much longer is that tail in terms of opportunity, given the fact that it's been only in the last, you know, call it, five or seven years that we've really made some real inroads there?","Mike Hansen","Well, I think the - from a customer perspective, I think it begins with innovative products. We can't get service industries to just simply change with what we might call legacy uniform rental workwear.","We have to be innovative, and we have to create uniform solutions that our customers want to wear. And we think we've been pretty successful in doing that. Paul gave a couple of examples in his narrative a few minutes ago.","And so it really starts with innovative products and solutions. And we feel like that's - we've been pretty good at that. That's going to be important to continue to do that as we move forward.","As far as how much opportunity is still out there, we feel like there is quite a bit of opportunity. We continue to introduce new products like our Carhartt, like our scrub rental, like our Chef Works products for rental. And it takes a while to get those fully penetrated and fully rolled out.","And so there's a lot of runway in just our existing products, and that doesn't include any products that we will continue to invest in and look for.","Nate Brochmann","And I would assume along with that, though, like the word of mouth in terms of people within the industry even talking, that's got to kind of help accelerate that runway a little bit, right?","Mike Hansen","Well, I would say that the more prospecting we do, and the more that we talk about our solutions, yes, the better that can become. And that - from a word of mouth standpoint, that gets around to different decision makers.","Nate Brochmann","Okay. And then second question is, kind of when you originally announced some of the upfront cost-related SAP, I think there might've been a little bit of initial worry about what we can do to offset that.","I mean, clearly, with your guidance going into next year, that's pretty strong. I would assume that you have uncovered some offsets to kind of help balance some of those costs, and obviously, you're really great in terms of the gross margin expansion as well.","Could you talk about maybe some of those things underneath the covers that you are able to find to offset that, particularly given some of the headwinds you're facing in terms of the lost day and the energy costs, et cetera?","Mike Hansen","Sure. I would say, Nate, that it's not that we've uncovered a lot of different things; it's just that - I'll go through a couple things. We won't have the incremental IT investments that we would typically have, and that's helpful.","We expect certainly improved performance out of our First Aid and Safety business, as we lap the acquisition of ZEE. Again, we expect to see improved performance certainly, and we expect to see improved performance out of our Fire business. Those certainly will help. And you are seeing that as part of the guidance.","We will certainly get some natural leverage from the growth in our Rental segment and that will help. And then we're also continuing to control our costs and manage our cost structure, and we've been pretty successful at that and we'll continue to be successful at that.","So there are a number of different things that go into this and help offset some of the headwinds that we've talked about. But I think - there's nothing - there's no magic silver bullet that we've got that we've all of a sudden uncovered. It's continuing to do what we do.","Nate Brochmann","Great. Thanks for all the extra color. I appreciate it.","Mike Hansen","Okay.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins","Hi, thanks. Just a follow-up on that - at the end of your last comments you said that you're -- overall, you're focused on managing the cost structure. Could you add in a little more detail about where - aside from natural leverage in the business, you are able to do that?","Mike Hansen","Well, aside from investments that we choose to make, our expectation is that we're going to grow our G&A about half as much as revenue each year, and we've been pretty good at that. Again, aside from certain investments that we want to make.","And so a lot of it comes from managing that G&A structure. A lot of it comes from an active Six Sigma program where we are constantly looking for small incremental wins to medium size wins. And those Six Sigma process improvements come in our production, in our plants, they come on our routes, they come in all different places.","We have a lot of people who are involved in that Six Sigma program looking for small to medium size wins. And that will certainly help as we become more and more efficient in all of our processes.","Sara Gubins","Okay. Thank you. And could you give us an update on the pricing environment? Have you seen any changes there?","Paul Adler","Sara, its Paul. Yes, on the pricing front, we haven't really seen anything in terms of a marketable change. So it's been pretty status quo. It's still competitive in terms of national account programs, but that hasn't changed, and really no difference. So nothing, no worthy or anything significant to pass on to you there.","Sara Gubins","Okay. Great. And then just last question, could you talk about your priorities for capital next year?","Mike Hansen","Well, I - Sara, I would say that those priorities will be the same as they have been for fiscal '16. I talked a little bit about that in our prepared remarks. We're going to continue to invest in the business. We're going to continue to do that through a little bit of the P&L, but also through CapEx.","We are certainly going to be looking for acquisition opportunities that create long-term value for us similar to the way we did that in fiscal '16. Our third priority is we will take a look at the dividend, and if history repeats, we will likely increase the dividend this year, because that has been very important to us.","And then lastly, if there are - if there is cash remaining, we certainly will put it to work in share buybacks. But we will look at it in that priority order and making sure that we are always looking to strengthen Cintas for the long-term.","Sara Gubins","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeff Goldstein with Morgan Stanley.","Jeff Goldstein","Hi. I wanted to ask about the All Other segment, where it looks like you had some strong growth in the quarter. First of all, are you able to provide the organic growth for that segment?","And then secondly, was growth there driven by any large one-off orders in direct sales or was it more broad-based in nature?","Paul Adler","Yes. I can provide you with the organic growth of All Other, it was 8.5% in the quarter. And that All Other, just as a reminder, includes our Fire business and our Direct Sale business. And that Direct Sale business is typically more of a slower grower in our portfolio, but it had a good quarter. It was a little stronger growth rate.","And again, that's direct sale business, can be a little more volatile, so we had some good rollouts of programs in the fourth quarter that helped push growth along and get that organic growth rate up pretty nicely.","The Fire business continues to grow nicely as well. We expect about double-digit growth in our Fire business. And so as a result of growing the top line in both of those businesses, we also saw 100 basis points of operating margin expansion in that segment as well.","Jeff Goldstein","Okay. And then I want to ask about cotton prices, which have actually increased pretty significantly recently. Would you expect any type of headwind to your business if we are able to see kind of more of a sustained period of these higher cotton prices?","Mike Hansen","Well, cotton, we would have to see a sustained increase in cotton, and for a while. So let's talk about specifically for our Rental business, you know, when we think about most of our uniforms, they are a polycotton blend or lower percentage of cotton. So that is - that's point number one.","Secondly, labor is the biggest component of cost out of our garments, and so the materials are not the majority of the cost involved. Thirdly, there's a supply chain. And so we would have to order the fabric. It would be sown into garments, that - and then shipped to our distribution center.","That probably takes somewhere of 8 to 10 weeks. Then there is a turn through the distribution center, and then it gets shipped out our rental locations where it gets generally amortized over some period of time, mostly 18 months.","So there is a quite a bit of time before we would see a sustained cotton impact. And even if we did see a sustained cotton impact, because of the percentage of the cost itself, I don't see that - I just don't expect that that would be that noticeable, and it would have to be a real spike for some sustained period of time.","Jeff Goldstein","Okay. That's helpful. And then I just have one last maintenance question. You had said regarding the national advertising campaign that spending on the campaign would likely ramp up again in fiscal '17. Is that still the guidance, and do you have any color on which quarters would likely see most of that spend?","Mike Hansen","It - we expect that our spend will be about the same in fiscal '17 as fiscal '16, which for the year, is about 25 basis points. I would expect that the largest or the impacts would be the greatest in our second and third quarters.","Jeff Goldstein","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with R.W. Baird.","Andrew Wittmann","Great. So, Mike, thanks for the answer previously about some of the offsets that you had to the margins. Given that those headwinds are pretty significant, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail?","And in the past, you mentioned that the ZEE integrations that you thought that the segment margins could get back up to their pre-ZEE levels, which I guess is - I don't know, 13-ish-percent for the segment?","Is that still the right goal, and what's the timeframe to which you think you can get those ZEE margins? Or to get these significant offsets, are you now eyeing above prior segment margin peaks?","Paul Adler","Andy, its Paul. Yes, as far as ZEE is concerned, I just want to reiterate that we are pleased with that acquisition; everything is on track. We had mentioned previously that we need a full year to get through the integration. And so through May, we're about 75% of the way through.","It's not turnkey, it's not standalone, as you know; it's largely a tuck-in. And so when you have a tuck-in, you have a little short-term efforts in order to get those synergies in the long-term.","And that's definitely what we are seeing in the First Aid segment is that impact, the integration costs, re-routing, goodwill and customers to make sure nothing falls through in the transition. You can't run as fast as you would like to right out of the gate.","But things are on track. We do expect those margins to bounce back. We don't have a timeframe as far as here's the timetable and the quarters and the milestones. But absolutely, we have another quarter of integration in fiscal '17, and we expect to see those margins bounce back.","And baked into our guidance for fiscal '17 is improvements in those First Aid and Safety margins, and some stronger growth rates than you saw in the fourth quarter as well.","Mike Hansen","And Andy, I would add to that, from a Fire Protection Services perspective, we continue to grow that business. And we grow it - we've grown it quite nicely in the last year, Paul talked about it growing nicely in the fourth quarter. And we expect continued operating margin improvement in that business as well, as we gain density in a lot of our different markets.","And as that business continues to do the same thing that our other businesses do, and that is fine product adjacencies, continue to penetrate existing customers, while adding new storefronts. Our National Account Fire business has been very good over the last year as well.","And so there, we expect certainly improvements in the First Aid business, as Paul talked about, but we also expect them in our Fire Protection business, and that certainly will help us in fiscal '17.","Andrew Wittmann","Okay. Thank you for that context. On the capital budget, I think I heard 280 to 320, that compares to $275 ish this year. I'm just curious as - and we know we - I think we had decent SAP spending in fiscal '16.","I think I heard you say that there's 40 expected in fiscal '17, but I still think that's a pretty decent increase and I was wondering what you contribute the delta to?","Mike Hansen","Well, we will be adding capacity like we've talked about. I believe we'll have a couple different facilities open here early in this fiscal year. Those were not full newbuilds, but they were capacity increases. And that will give us some help in the first quarter.","And then we expect to continue to increase capacity because of our growth, probably closer to the end of the fiscal year or into early fiscal '18.","So there's a little bit more capacity spend than we've seen over the last - certainly over the last three to five years, and even a little bit more than we have seen in fiscal '16.","Andrew Wittmann","Okay. Last question, it's been reported that you guys are going to - and you've had the, I think, the Southwest Airlines contract for a while, which, correct me if I'm wrong, it was mostly a direct sale. Last time you guys redressed an airline was I think it was United Airlines, and that was a tangible number that we could see to the P&L.","Is the Southwest Airlines on the same order of magnitude in terms of the contribution? And how should we expect the timing of that to flow through? And maybe any comments you would have on the profitability, is that rollout a major program, I think would be fairly short order.","Mike Hansen","That is a - that's a great success for us in terms of gaining the award for that business. That's - of the impactful piece of that is relatively new. It's early, so I'm not ready to provide any timetable and estimates. But we'll certainly talk more about that as we go through the performance of that business.","But we're early on. Again, we've got to source the product, and that takes some time. And so those big projects don't happen overnight. And in fact, I think we started working on the United program something like 12 to 15 months in advance of starting to ship. So it is a nice program for us, but it's going to take a little time.","Andrew Wittmann","Okay. So the implication there is if United was 12-plus months, this one might not even have a lot of revenue contribution this year, is that fair to say?","Mike Hansen","I think that's a fair assumption.","Andrew Wittmann","Okay. Great. That's it for me. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc.","Joe Box","Hey. Good evening, guys.","Mike Hansen","Hi, Joe.","Paul Adler","Hi, Joe.","Joe Box","So a couple of questions around the Uniform segment organic growth rate. One, is the growth rate for Uniform versus All Other kind of categories within that Uniform segment, are you still seeing the growth rates kind of trend at a similar rate or are you starting to see them diverge?","And two, if I heard you right, it sounded like you highlighted new business wins, better penetration and even retention as kind of the biggest drivers to the entire segment. I'm curious if any of those three things are either accelerating or decelerating?","Mike Hansen","Well, I would say that the fiscal '16, as we've talked a lot about, had an impact on - from our oil, gas and mining customers throughout the year. And that has had a bit of a negative impact on the growth of the Uniform side relative to the whole segment.","So it is a little bit - the Uniform Rental side is a little bit lower in terms of the growth than the average. And we've been able to pick that up through the Facility Services, both in new business and in the penetration, and as Paul said, the retention.","I would say that from the standpoint of do any one of those three stick out dramatically, I would say no. But I would say that the penetration, we have lots of opportunity left. There is a lot of runway to continue to add value to our existing customers.","And we've been very successful at that in fiscal '16, particularly with some of our hygiene products and services like our Signature series, kind of a more front-of-the-house hygiene business.","And I think what I am describing kind of shows itself in the numbers that Paul gave, and that is that the Uniform Rental business was 51% of that revenue last year, it's now 50%. The hygiene was 13% last year; it's now 14%. That's what you are seeing. You are seeing some lost oil, gas and mining customers, but it's being offset by some nice penetration and improvements in retention.","Joe Box","Right. Appreciate that. And then maybe switching gears to the SAP side, I know obviously it's very early on the Uniform Rental side. But can you maybe just talk about the number of branches that you've rolled out maybe through mid-July, and some early impressions or challenges that you might have had with that?","Mike Hansen","Well, we just recently started our pilot, and early indications are that we're off to a very good start. However, we're early. I think I talked about this last quarter. Our pilot is effectively starting with one location and really learning a lot. And assuming that goes well, we will move to several others. So that by mid-fiscal year, our expectation would be that we're kind of ready to start rolling out full speed.","So right now, we're in that early pilot stage with one location. And, like I said, early indications are it's going pretty well. But again, we're early. And I think we'll have more to say about that more than likely at the end of our first and second quarters.","Joe Box","Got it. And maybe I guess in that same vein, clearly, SAP is going to be a big project for you guys over the next couple of years. Your balance sheet is generally under levered. I'm curious if you guys would be willing to do a sizable deal throughout this SAP process or would you pretty much table any sort of major deal until SAP was completely rolled out?","Mike Hansen","Well, I would tell you that this SAP is a big project, and we've got a lot of resources and attention put to that. But you know, opportunities don't come along every day. And if we had an opportunity, small or large, to add value for the long-term benefits at Cintas, we certainly would take a look at it. And again, at the right value, we would certainly love to do M&A that provides long-term value.","That is the same message that we've had for quite a while and that doesn't change during the SAP rollout. It certainly may affect the way we would integrate it. But if we have opportunities that create great value for Cintas, we'll still take a good look at them.","Joe Box","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. From the press release, we know that - and typically, you guys anticipate a fairly flat economy in the forward guidance. Could you speak to how you think about employment, maybe with regard to oil and gas and mining, and then x-ing that out, how you think about it? Thanks.","Mike Hansen","Well, we - from an oil, gas and mining standpoint, we have seen continued deterioration. But I would say today, that rate of deterioration is slowing, certainly relative to 90 days ago. But as Paul mentioned, we still expect to see a negative 60 basis points to the top line. So that tells you that we don't - we won't feel healed in that area in fiscal '17.","From the rest of the - let's call it economic picture, I would say that it's still a challenging environment. There's not a lot of momentum to it. But I would call it stable. We haven't seen a lot of change today compared to a quarter ago. And so, I would say we're continuing to operate like we have been.","I would say as we look into fiscal 2017, if I were to make a comment about the economy that maybe did feel a little bit different, I would say today compared to, let's call it six months ago, it does feel like there is a bit more uncertainty.","When you think about the - we do - we have seen some ups and downs in employment; no doubt about that. We've seen the European issues; we've seen changes from the Department of Labor in terms of minimum wage and overtime that can have a pausing effect on our customers"," We've got the election coming up. It does feel like there is a little bit more uncertainty than there was six months ago. And that's likely bleeding into the bottom end of our guidance range.","Scott Schneeberger","All right, thanks. That's helpful. And then you talked kind of piecemeal as we've gone through Q&A with regard to, say, branding and what quarters that may hit more. Could you speak to - I don't know if you mentioned the quarter with the extra or the one less day, but on a quarterly basis, top to bottom, when might we expect some of the ebbs and flows?","I guess I'm thinking more on expense and how it will impact the margin. But just how we move through the year, is there anything worth pointing out that will be a big factor, just on the sequential basis as we move through the year? Thanks.","Mike Hansen","Sure. I would say a couple things, Scott. Paul talked about a tax rate of 36.7%. That's a little bit higher than last year, but lower than our - maybe our longer-term. I would expect that we are going to see a slightly lower tax rate in the first quarter, followed by something closer to what we've typically guided toward in that 37% range in the last three quarters. So that's maybe one point.","From a Ready for the Workday campaign standpoint, I would say that it is going to - the bulk of it is going to be in the second and third quarters. From an SAP standpoint, we talked earlier about that will be back-end loaded.","So we will have some costs in the first half of the year, but we turn on the depreciation and we turn on the licensing expenses in the second half of the year. So we will see a little bit more pressure in that back half from that standpoint.","As far as calling things out, I think maybe the other thing that I might call out is the first quarter, as Paul mentioned, would have a little bit heavier, from a First Aid standpoint, ZEE implementation and integration costs. But from a quarter-to-quarter basis, I don't know that I would have much more to share than that.","Paul Adler","Yes, I can't recall, Scott, if we mentioned the third quarter is the quarter with the one less workday.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. I think you did last time; I just didn't have it in front. So thanks for repeating it, guys. And that color was very helpful. Appreciate it.","Mike Hansen","Sure.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Adrian Paz with Piper Jaffray. Mr. Paz, your line is open. You may want to \u2013 did you press your mute function.","Adrian Paz","Hi, this is Adrian Paz on for George Tong. I just wanted to get a little more code on M&A. I know for a long time, Cintas didn't do any acquisitions. And in recent quarters, we've seen a pretty big - well, yes, in recent quarters, we've seen a pretty big uptick in acquisition activity.","I mean, is - are you seeing better valuations out there? And is there any segment that you're targeting growth in through M&A?","Mike Hansen","Well, we - I would say that, as far as M&A goes, it really is opportunistic. So when the opportunities become available, we need to be ready to take advantage of those, and we were opportunistic in fiscal '16, certainly.","We would look for acquisitions in our Rental business, in our First Aid and Safety business, in our Fire businesses primarily. We love tuck-in acquisitions. They are very accretive. And we'll continue to look aggressively for those kind of opportunities, provided they are at the right value.","We might look for bigger opportunities in any of those businesses, again, as long as they provide long-term value for us, and at the right valuation.","Adrian Paz","Also, can you provide an update on Canadian operations? I know that they had been experiencing some headwinds a few quarters back with the currency. Have those - I guess operations there stabilized, and are they, I guess, resuming growth?","Mike Hansen","Well, I would say that the performance of the business there hasn't necessarily been affected by the currency exchange rate. Our business continues to perform well. But we have seen less volatility in that Canadian exchange rate.","I think the negative impact to the top line was 30 basis points. So we're still seeing a little bit of negative. But generally speaking, the business continues to perform well.","Adrian Paz","All right, thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi. Could you just tell us what share count we should use for the first quarter based on the share buyback that was done already? And does your guidance assume any further share buyback?","Paul Adler","Andrew, its Paul. The guidance does not assume any further share buyback. Maybe just to sync up, I don't know if you noticed, but with the earnings release, we have income statement that we enclosed, and there's a supplemental schedule in there that has the computation of diluted EPS.","And if you look at that for the 12 months ended May 31st of 2016, you'll see our computation there for the current year where we start off with income from continuing ops; we reduce it.","And it's about 1.6% reduction to allocate income to its participating securities. And then we divided that number by 110 million diluted shares outstanding.","And so in fiscal '17 for our modeling, we are going to use about that same $110 million or not million dollars, 110 million shares, rather for computation of fiscal '17 EPS.","Andrew Steinerman","Perfect.","Paul Adler","So model your '17 number, reduce it for the income to the participating securities, and look at 110 million shares.","Andrew Steinerman","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Dan Dolev with Nomura.","Dan Dolev","Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I know you don't guide to margin growth, but if I think through the $30 million to $35 million of incremental SAP expense, and I think about what the implied operating margin growth is this year, say, at the midpoint maybe down 40 basis points, if I add back the SAP, I'm looking at maybe 20-ish.","That's still a step-down from what you did last year, even at the midpoint. Is that just conservatism or could you maybe help me bridge through how should we think about that? Thanks.","Mike Hansen","Well, our total incremental margins for fiscal '16 for the company was - were about 20%. Rental, it was certainly higher. Rental was more like 28%. We have talked about, historically, that that incremental margin, we want that incremental margin to be in the 20% to 30% range. If we're higher than that for sustained periods of time, we worry that we're not investing enough.","And I would tell you that, as we look into '17, excluding the SAP impact, we're about in that same range; maybe a little bit on the lower side because of the negative oil and gas impact, because of the negative workday impact.","But generally speaking, we think there are good incremental margins. And at the top end of the guidance, even with the SAP impact, even with the oil and gas, even with the extra workday, there is a slight operating margin improvement.","Dan Dolev","Got it. And I remember last time you said you won't be sitting idly watching the $30 million to $35 million flow down to the bottom line. How do you feel about those today, four months later?","Mike Hansen","Well, I would like to think that the guidance that we have provided is an indication that that's exactly what we have done. And that is not sit around idly waiting for $30 million to $35 million to hit.","But instead, we are continuing to run the business, execute very, very well, improve where we can, and come up with very good results. And we feel good about the business. I think that guidance would tell you that we feel good going into fiscal '17, and our partners still are executing at very, very high levels.","Dan Dolev","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Mike Hansen","You're welcome.","Operator","That will conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back to today's speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Mike Hansen","Well, thank you for joining us tonight. We will issue our first quarter earnings in the end of September, and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","We are pleased to report that revenue for the second quarter, which ended November 30, was $1,606,000,000, an increase of 26.4% over last year's second quarter. The organic revenue growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.7%. The organic revenue growth rate for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 7.3%, and the organic growth rate of the First Aid and Safety Services segment was 10.8%. ","Operating income for the second quarter was $235 million compared to $200 million in last year's second quarter. Fiscal 2018 second quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $13 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition compared to about $3 million of such expenses in the second quarter of last year. Excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, operating income increased 21.8%. ","Operating income margin, excluding G&K transaction and integration expenses, was 15.5% versus 16% last year. Current year second quarter operating margin was negatively impacted 75 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. ","In addition, current year operating margin was negatively impacted by 25 basis points due to depreciation and implementation costs of our enterprise resource planning system, SAP. Net income and earnings per diluted share, or EPS, from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $137 million and $1.24, respectively. EPS was negatively impacted by transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition of $0.07 and $0.02 in the second quarters of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. Excluding these expenses, EPS was $1.31 versus $1.14 last year, a 14.9% increase.","As our Chairman and CEO, Scott Farmer, was quoted in today's press release, the integration of G&K continues to proceed as planned. Our pace of closing duplicate operations increased in the second quarter. We have now closed 50 operations. Also, 47% of G&K locations have been converted to the Cintas operating system. This activity enabled us in the second quarter to realize about $14 million in synergies, almost twice the amount of synergies achieved in the first quarter, which is right in line with our expectations.","In addition, significant progress was made in our implementation of SAP, which remains on schedule. A total of 55 operations have been converted from the old operating system to the new SAP system.","Our second quarter was one of solid progress on 2 important investments, G&K and SAP. Meanwhile, strong execution on the day-to-day mission of profitable growth continued. The steadfast focus of our employees on helping our customers get Ready for the Workday is evidenced by the strong organic revenue and earnings per share growth rates.","As a result of our second quarter results, we are increasing our annual guidance for fiscal 2018. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $6,365,000,000 to $6,430,000,000 and fiscal 2018 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.39 to $5.46. Our guidance excludes any future G&K transaction and integration expenses. It also assumes a pretax reform effective tax rate range of 31% to 33%.","Note that our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business, revenue of $895 million to $915 million compared to a prior year amount of $965 million; synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million; and EPS contribution of about $0.17. While the EPS guidance does not include any future G&K transaction and integration expenses, we do expect that these expenses will be incurred in the remainder of fiscal 2018 as we continue to integrate this significant acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $60 million for the full fiscal year.","I want to comment on the impact to Cintas of U.S. tax reform. There will be significant benefits. As a profitable business with the vast majority of our earnings in the United States, we have historically paid a high tax rate. The reduction in the corporate tax rate will boost Cintas' earnings and increase cash. Also, we expect many of our customers to benefit from tax reform and invest additional amounts of cash to grow their businesses. Healthy and growing customers are good, of course, for our business. Tax reform will enable us to repay debt more quickly and then have additional cash on hand for our priorities, namely, investments, acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases.","The signing of the legislation by the President will be an accounting event for Cintas. We will need to revalue deferred tax liabilities. ","In addition, the lower corporate tax rate will be applied January 1, resulting in a negative effective tax rate in our third quarter and a blended effective tax rate for the fiscal year. Our EPS guidance is based upon pretax reform effective tax rates of 31% to 33%, because we need more time to understand the new tax laws. ","However, we do want to provide you with the results of our preliminary analysis. Under the new tax laws, we expect the effective tax rate for this full fiscal year to be in the range of 8% to 12%. We will incorporate this lower fiscal year '18 rates into our guidance over the next several months. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 and thereafter to generally be in the range of 23% to 26%.","Please note that our fiscal year 2018 contains the same number of workdays per quarter as fiscal year 2017. The number of workdays by quarter within fiscal year 2018 do differ, however, and are as follows, 66 in Q1, 65 in Q2, 64 in Q3 and 66 in Q4. One less workday in a quarter has a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on operating margin due to many large expenses, including rental material cost, depreciation expense and amortization expense being determined on a monthly basis instead of on a workday basis.","We have two reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services; and First Aid and Safety Services. The remainder of our business is included in All Other. All Other consists of Fire Protection Services and our Uniform Direct Sale business. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.","Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. This segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $1,308,000,000, an increase of 30.8% compared to last year's second quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 7.3%.","Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the second quarter, a decrease of 20 basis points from 44.9% in last year's second quarter. A slight year-over-year margin decline results from the inclusion in this year's second quarter of a lower margin G&K business.","In time, the G&K gross margins will improve to Cintas' legacy levels as we further integrate this business and we increasingly realize more of the synergies. For instance, one of the factors resulting in a lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is much higher than the Cintas legacy business. Total segment energy expense as a percent of revenue was 20 basis points greater than in last year's second quarter. Half of the increase was due to G&K. This is the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the route density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density, along with the benefit of reducing redundant capacity will drive significant improvements in G&K gross margin.","Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the second quarter was $139 million, which was 11.5% higher than last year's second quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for this segment was 10.8%. This segment's gross margin was 46.9% in the second quarter compared to 46.1% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 80 basis points. While year-over-year improvements to gross margin driven by ZEE acquisition synergies have largely been lapped, we still expect strong gross margin improvements as the business continues to grow.","Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other category. Uniform Direct Sale business long-term growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Our Fire business, however, continues to grow each year at a strong pace. All Other revenue was $159 million, an increase of 8.9% compared to last year's second quarter. The organic growth rate was 7.8%. All Other gross margin was 42.1% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 40.4% for last year's second quarter, an increase of 170 basis points. Both businesses had healthy increases in gross margin.","Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 29.1% in the second quarter compared to 28.4% in last year's second quarter. Current year second quarter SG&A was negatively impacted 75 basis points by intangible asset amortization expense resulting from the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. ","In addition, current year SG&A was negatively impacted by 25 basis points due to SAP depreciation and implementation costs. The prior year second quarter did not include any depreciation expense from SAP because the project was still in the pilot phase.","Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the second quarter was 33.3% compared to 34.9% for last year's second quarter. This equates to a $0.03 benefit to EPS year-over-year. Note that the effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve bills and releases relating to discrete items. As stated earlier, our EPS guidance assumes a pretax reform effective tax rate range of 31% to 33%. Our cash and equivalents balance as of November 30 was $236 million, and we had $22 million of marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from operating activities in the first 6 months of fiscal 2018 was $379 million and free cash flow was $246 million.","Capital expenditures for the first half of the fiscal year were $132 million. Our CapEx by operating segment for the 6-month period was as follows, $111 million in Uniform Rental and Facility Services; $13 million in First Aid and Safety; and $8 million in All Other. We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $300 million.","As of November 30, total debt was $2,834,000,000, consisting of $300 million in short-term debt and $2,534,000,000 of long-term debt. At November 30, our leverage was 2.5x debt-to-EBITDA. Subsequent to quarter end on December 1, $300 million of fixed rate debt with a coupon of 6 1\/8% matured. This debt was paid with cash on hand and from borrowings under our commercial paper program. ","On December 8, we paid a dividend of $1.62 per share, an increase of 21.8% over last year's dividend. We have increased this dividend for 34 consecutive years. It is an important part of our capital allocation strategy and illustrates our enduring commitment to effectively deploying cash to increase shareholder value. ","Overall, our cash flow remain strong, and we continue to expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.0 to 2.2x debt-to-EBITDA at May 31, 2018.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll first go to Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","I didn't catch if you gave the G&K revenue and growth rate in the prepared remarks?","Michael Hansen","We did not, but the -- it was down about 4.4% year-over-year for the quarter, which is slightly better. You probably saw that Paul had mentioned an increased range. And so it was slightly better than what we expected, and -- but down still about 4.4%.","Toni Kaplan","Okay, that's helpful. And I wanted to ask about -- given Aramark's AmeriPride acquisition, have you seen any changes in the competitive environment yet? I know the deal hasn't closed, but just any -- are you expecting to see any impact from those 2 companies coming together? And basically, yes, just any color on that would be helpful.","Michael Hansen","Well, the deal hasn't closed, as you mentioned. And so I would say, we're -- I would expect that if we do see some impact to the industry, it won't be until after it closes. I would say, today, it's still very competitive. The environment is still very competitive and not much changed, though, from 3 months ago.","Toni Kaplan","Got it. And just lastly, in First Aid, you had another double-digit growth quarter. Can you just give us a little bit of color on how long you expect this pace of growth to hold up? And what you would consider maybe a normalized growth rate in this segment, if you think that double digit is not normalized?","Paul Adler","Well, Toni, we hope it's forever. ","Toni Kaplan","Yes, I'm sure.","Paul Adler","Certainly, the expectations for that business, First Aid, have continued to be high single digits. We still have a lot of opportunity to grow our customer base and with the safety cabinets and other products and services, got OSHA and others drive required in those cabinets. There's still plenty of good organic growth to come.","Operator","And we'll take a question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.","Manav Patnaik","The first question was, I think you made a comment that the pace of synergies was growing faster than maybe what you expected and, I guess, that's indicated with the $14 million versus $7 million. But broadly, I guess, your guidance for the synergies for this year and for all of G&K, I guess, hasn't really changed. So I was just wondering if there was a disconnect between those 2 comments or how we should think of that?","Michael Hansen","I think Paul's comment was synergies certainly have increased and accelerated in the second quarter, but it is in line with our expectations. We certainly did expect to see that number go up. If you remember after the first quarter, we had talked about a couple dozen locations being consolidated in the first quarter, but many at the end of that first quarter. And so we were able to see the synergies from those as well as some others during the second quarter. And so it is in line with where we expected, but certainly an acceleration of what we saw on the first quarter.","Manav Patnaik","Got it. And then the comment on 47% of the G&K locations moved to Cintas operation platform and so forth. Is it fair to assume that, that 47% were probably the bigger heavy lifting locations and the remaining should be a much smoother integration? Or is that not right?","Michael Hansen","No, it really is based on our timetable geographies and markets. And so it is a combination of both small locations and large locations. Still many to do, and -- but going well.","Manav Patnaik","Okay. And then the last one I had was just on tax reform, I appreciate the color you guys gave. But I was just wondering, what if any, were some of the offsetting pieces from the legislation versus just a reduction in corporate tax rate?","Michael Hansen","When we think about that kind of an ongoing rate of 23% to 26%, there are -- there is a big benefit, obviously, from the drop in the corporate rate. However, couple of things that I might point out. There is something called a Section 199 manufacturing credit that is no longer existing, and that had a small impact on us. There is also the Section 162(m) impact, which is the loss of the deduction for any executive comp over $1 million, that certainly will have an impact. But that's about it. And certainly then for there's the onetime toll charge, if you will, related to the taxing of foreign E&P. But generally speaking, look, we're very excited about the tax reform getting done. We do certainly still need to spend some more time with all of the details. But I would say, over the course of the next couple of months, we'll likely update our guidance to give some more specific thoughts.","Operator","And we'll now go to Andy Wittmann from Baird.","Andrew Wittmann","I guess maybe my first question is on the guidance, it looks like you took the tax rate down, I think it was 34%. The last quarter here was 32%. That's an EPS help right there. Is there an implicit -- as you look at the earnings profile of the business tax reform, is there something that changed in the profitability of the business that you expected in the quarter and the outlook for the balance of the year?","Michael Hansen","Are you saying as it relates to tax reform?","Andrew Wittmann","Well, no, I mean, it looks like, I think, previous guidance for tax rate was 34% now it's 32%, that should be about $0.15 of help, I think, to EPS, all else equal. But the guide range wasn't that much, so I was just wondering what explains the difference?","Michael Hansen","Well, one thing to keep in mind is our third quarter has an additional loss of workday. But no, we think that margins for the second half of the year are still going to be pretty strong. And I wouldn't read a whole lot of detail into that other than the fact that we're kind of pleased with the quarter, and we're set up still to have a very good year in the back half of the year.","Andrew Wittmann","All right. And then I wanted to go over to the G&K for my next one, with a pretty good number of facilities of G&K on the system like you've talked in the past that getting on the system is the prerequisite to revenue synergy. I know you've said pretty consistently that those were going to take longer, but I'm just curious, are you able to start talking about selling some of that stuff, now you've got a number of locations or do they all need to be on before you can get after that?","Michael Hansen","No. When a location gets on, we can start to have training conversations and start to get into that. It's going to take a little bit of time to get the ball rolling and to create an impact. But no, once one location is on, we can start talking more about Cintas products and services. They will be available to that location from a system perspective upon conversion.","Andrew Wittmann","Can we have some contribution, you think, later here in fiscal '18?","Michael Hansen","I'm not expecting anything in fiscal '18. No.","Andrew Wittmann","And then just on the cost synergies, if this quarter was $14 million realized and approximately $7 million in the first quarter. If you just take the run rate of $14 million per quarter from the last 2 quarters, that gets me to $49 million for the year, which is pretty much at the low end of your guidance range for the year. How should we think about those cost synergies? Are you -- does it look like you could exceed the targets that you laid out? Or should we expect some level of deceleration of the cost synergies for the balance of the year?","Michael Hansen","We, I would say, there is a lot of heavy lifting to go still in the back half of the year. Our goal will be to get that synergy number to the high end of that range, certainly. But yes, there is a possibility that we can exceed that. I would say that that's more of a timing thing than a increase to the entire range of 130 to 140. But I think there's an opportunity for that as long as we continue to execute well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Guys, just curious, some little items in the quarter. There was talk about the hurricane last quarter. Could you just give us an update, and I believe what you had said last time was it would have an impact on revenue by $10 million to $15 million and EPS 5 to 8. Can you just kind of give us a little bit more clarity? And then I'll follow up with the next one in a second.","Paul Adler","Yes, Scott. That was our estimates at the time. You got that correct. And we said of the $10 million to $15 million, about half of that would be in Q2. Fortunately, we were always in good shape. We had mentioned on the last call that we didn't have much damage to our facilities, and we were able to be up and running. So it was just dependent upon how quickly the customers could get back up and running. But pleasantly to our surprise, they get up and running pretty quickly. And instead of, what, $5 million to $7 million top line impact in the quarter, it was only about $1 million. And then for the remaining 2 quarters, $1 million is probably top line at most. So good news is this turned out to be really a nonevent from the headwind to the top line.","Scott Schneeberger","Okay. And I mean, you guys had a good quarter and revenue guidance went up for the year more than what you did in the outperformance versus at least our estimate in the quarter. I'm guessing, this contributed and was a sizable factor to that, that increased revenue?","Paul Adler","No, I don't know if it was sizable. But yes, I mean, certainly, based upon our last guide, as I said, we expected maybe $5 million to $7 million of headwinds and it was only -- in the second quarter, it was only about $1 million. So yes, $4 million, $5 million of benefits but certainly the top line we see was much more than that.","Michael Hansen","Yes, and I think, Scott, as I mentioned, the G&K revenue was a little bit better than we had expected. And our own -- the legacy organic growth continues to perform well.","Scott Schneeberger","Great. I'm curious just kind of a two-pronger for the last question. The tax reform, you mentioned, the 23% to 26% tax rate in fiscal '18 and thereafter. But I had heard that you will have some deferred tax liabilities being revalued. And I thought I heard that you may even have a negative tax rate in the fiscal third quarter. So that's -- when you speak of the 23% to 26%, it's actually going to be lower for the year in fiscal '18 when that gets factored in the third quarter impact. Is that right?","Michael Hansen","Yes. The range that Paul gave was 8% to 12% for fiscal '18 because of that revaluation of the deferred tax balances. So when you think about the -- if President Trump signs this on January 3, that creates an accounting event for us. We revalue deferred taxes. We have to -- we book the toll charge. And there may be other smaller adjustments that have to be booked, but the impact of the deferred tax reevaluation -- and keep in mind, all those deferred taxes are recorded at a 35% tax rate today and they will go down to 21%. That is a significant benefit or, let's call it, reduction in deferred taxes. And that will create the negative in the third quarter. But thereafter '18, the idea was, look, that's going to be disruption, no question about it at the time in the third quarter. But thereafter, we expect that 23% to 26% as kind of a normalized rate. Now clearly, there are always discrete events that happened like audits and other items that may cause us to move below or above that range at times, but that's kind of what we're thinking in terms of an ongoing rate.","Scott Schneeberger","Got it. That's helpful. Yes, I totally missed the 8% to 12%, so thanks on that. And just the last part of the question, you did alluded to the benefits, obviously, this will have for your customers and for you. Could you kind of talk about a priority thought process of how you may use the excess cash benefit that you'll get from this tax reform event?","Michael Hansen","Well, we're certainly evaluating that, Scott. I would say that when you think about the cash flow that we've generated in the past, our first priority is to invest in our business. And that's investing in our business, in our employees, whom we call partners, but then also in capital expenditures, et cetera. That is always our first priority. The second priority is we will continue to look for M&A opportunities when they make sense at the right value. We will likely continue to look at dividend increases and then share buyback. So I would say that our prioritization hasn't changed much, but certainly, this is the new wrinkle that we're going to need to spend some time on in terms of both short-term and long-term. And we're -- we don't want to make any quick decisions on that. That's an important opportunity and we're going to take the time we need.","Operator","And we'll now go to Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","What's the implied organic constant currency revenue growth for the total company in the second half of the year? And has that changed from a quarter ago? Or is the dollar revenue increased mostly around G&K doing a little bit better?","Michael Hansen","It's a little bit of both now. Andrew, when we think about organic growth, keep in mind, our third quarter will be the same kind of organic growth calculation that we've been under for the first 2 quarters, and the fourth quarter is going to be impacted by the G&K deal being lapped, right. So we are -- it's just simply a math problem. We are going to see organic growth drop in the fourth quarter. So to answer your question about the guidance, it's a little bit of both. It's a little bit of nice performance in our legacy organic businesses, especially our First Aid and Safety. And it's also a little bit of nice performance in the G&K revenue. I would suggest that we're going to have another quarter of relatively normalized, if you will, organic growth in the third. It's going to come down in the fourth, just simply because we've lapped that and that's the way the math works. We then expect to see as we move in to '19, that organic growth begin to accelerate back to Cintas levels.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Healy from Northcoast Research.","John Healy","I wanted to ask just a philosophical question for you guys about pricing. With the comments that you made about tax reform it's clear that your customer should be in a better spot in '19. I was curious to know if you guys -- if you could remind me, if you do most of your price increases at the calendar level, or just simply when the contract comes up on an annual basis? And I was just trying to think about how you've approached price in the last couple of years, and does what you see in the economy cause you to be more confident and maybe pursue more pricing than maybe you have over the last couple of years?","Michael Hansen","Well, I would say that the pricing environment is very competitive. It remains that way. But as I've said in the last several quarters, it seems to be constructive still. We probably have more price increases during the close of the beginning of our fiscal year, but that's not all customers, but probably a little bit more in that beginning of the fiscal year. In terms of our philosophy, it's a conversation about the value that we're providing to all of our customers. And so it is a customer-by-customer conversation about the wear and tear of the garments, the different products and services that we're providing, the service component, et cetera. And so it's a lot of different things that go into pricing.","John Healy","Makes sense. And I want to ask you a question about kind of investments into the business. When you look at acquisitions, clearly, Aramark's doing a big deal with AmeriPride. When you guys get down to that 2x leverage or so, call it, 6 months from now, do you think that you're capable from a FTC standpoint to pursue acquisitions of that type of size? And do you feel like you're kind of limited in terms of the size of assets that you can pursue post G&K?","Michael Hansen","Well, if we're speaking about specifically the Uniform Rental business, look, we'll take a look at all opportunities that are available to us. And do I think that we'd be able to do a large deal? I think it really would depend on that specific opportunity, and there could be some challenges. Our goal would be to take a look at it and evaluate how we feel about those challenges. And so, John, look, that's a -- to say whether or not we could. I think it just depends on the opportunity, but any big deal will likely come with some challenges.","Operator","Now we will go to Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie.","Mario Cortellacci","This is Mario Cortellacci, I'm filling in for Hamzah. Actually to piggyback off the last question. If there is further consolidation in the space, can we expect better pricing? Or what would that look like?","Michael Hansen","Well, look, I mentioned that the pricing environment is fairly competitive today. It's been that way for many years, maybe a little bit more constructive in the last couple years. But I don't expect that to change. I think it will continue to be very competitive because there are many players both local, regional and national. And there are -- not everyone has to rent uniforms. And so I think there is -- we have to continue to show that we can provide a good value. But I think it's going to continue to be competitive. I don't see it changing much because of the Aramark\/AmeriPride deal.","Mario Cortellacci","Okay. And then, I know you've already touched on this in the past as well. But could you frame for us, I guess, how are you thinking about the longer-term benefits of the SAP implementation?","Michael Hansen","Sure. We love that the information that this system will provide to us once we are -- once we have our entire business on. It allows us to much more quickly see opportunities that exist to look at industry specifics and be able to better target prospects, target existing customers for different types of products and services. And so more than anything, the information, we believe, will allow our salespeople and our service people to be more productive and efficient.","Operator","And we'll now go to Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.","Gary Bisbee","Let me take another -- a different approach to the pricing. This has always been a competitive industry, you've acknowledged that regularly. What is the risk that some of the tax reform savings that the industry will earn gets competed away, think about an after-tax return as their margin or whatever is their focus. Is that -- do you see that as a risk? Is that -- any thoughts on that at this point?","Michael Hansen","I think it's too early to tell, Gary. Certainly, that could throw a little bit of a wrinkle into the way our products and services are priced in the marketplace. We're going to have to keep our eyes on that and see how it plays out. But I think it's a little early, but certainly that we're going to keep our eyes on it. It is something that could add a little bit of a wrinkle.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. All right. And then staying on the tax theme for just one more question. Does -- I realize it's early, but does the outline of the plan have you thinking any differently about your investment plans? I realize you've got a ton of stuff going on and probably the first thing to do is pay down the debt. But as you think out over the next couple of years, would it make you more likely to invest, to raise wages to hire people more quickly to accelerate investment projects? Or not really?","Michael Hansen","Yes, I think, Gary, that all those things are likely on the table. We're going to evaluate, and we are going to -- we, first and foremost, we are long-term operators. And so, we're -- the first thing that we will do is evaluate how best this can make us stronger for the long-term. And there could be some short-term decisions because of that, there could be some longer-term decisions. But I think -- this is -- look, it's a new day, and we're going to have to get busy evaluating how to invest, how to best invest this benefit. But I don't have any answer. It's just -- it's not even signed yet, and we need to spend a little bit more time with it, but it certainly will have an impact.","Gary Bisbee","Fair enough. And then have you put any thought yet to the CapEx ability to immediately deduct CapEx? It would seem to me likely that your cash flow would be -- have a meaningful benefit from that and that's your cash conversion, a percent of net income or however you want to look at it would likely improve at least for the next five years. Is it right to assume most of your CapEx would likely be eligible? Or is it also too soon to have a view on that?","Michael Hansen","I believe that, that certainly will benefit us. Gary, I need to spend a little bit more time on the specifics of those rules. But, yes, I think it certainly could create an improved cash flow because of that immediate expensing over the next 5 years. But I'm -- I -- we need to do a little bit more research on exactly the CapEx that we have that qualifies, but I like it. And I think it's going to be positive for us.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. And then just one non-tax one to close it out for me. Talk about the -- just how the math will work in accelerating organic growth once you lap G&K. What are the key factors that then get the reacceleration back towards the normal Cintas level? Is it that you've been hiring salespeople in their territories? Although, I would think those would overlap with your territories, is it more of the cross-sell impact? Or just that, that business is flattening out at some point and then the rest of the base is growing? Just trying to think through [indiscernible]","Michael Hansen","Yes. Gary, I think it's all three of those. First of all, the revenue itself is going to bottom out, and that -- or that the decrease is going to stop, probably in our fourth quarter. But we have hired. We -- first of all, we brought on many legacy G&K salespeople for the open positions that they had. We have been hiring and training, and we saw some nice improvements in productivity from the first quarter to the second. And we like what we see so far. So -- and as you probably know, Gary, with our business, we sell many small accounts every single week and it takes a little bit of time for all of those small accounts to accumulate over time. And so as we think about fiscal '19, we will enter that fiscal year with a little bit better new business momentum from that block of salespeople. We will have seen the bottom of the trough in terms of the revenue overall.","And then lastly, yes, we're going to start to see some benefits of cross-sell and penetration into those customers. I don't believe we'll see any impact in fiscal '18. But fiscal '19, we should start to see some impact. I think the biggest thing is really the new business effort, though, that will get back on track after about a year of those legacy G&K salespeople seeing a reverse momentum because of the announcement of the acquisition and then the retraining, et cetera.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Stratton from Great Lakes Review.","David Stratton","I couldn't tell, I don't know if you said or not, did you give a legacy Cintas gross margin number for the quarter?","Michael Hansen","We did not, David. We have consolidated a number of those operations into the legacy Cintas locations, it becomes very, very difficult to separate what was from a gross margin perspective, what was legacy Cintas versus what was legacy G&K.","David Stratton","Got you. And then, if you would talk for a minute about energy impacts you saw in the quarter and then what you see the rest of the year shaping up like in regard to energy costs and your customers in that field?","Michael Hansen","Well, for the second quarter, we saw total overall energy rate of 2.2% of revenue. I would say for the second half of the year, maybe a slight increase, flattish to slight increase. Did that answer your question?","David Stratton","Yes. And then I guess -- yes. No, that's good.","Paul Adler","David, on the top line, I think you mentioned our customers, too, in that business. And we do watch the rig counts as an indicator of how things are performing and we definitely have seen stabilization in that customer base. And we've talked about that from last quarter to that and we kind of lapped all that. So it's stable, but we haven't seen a lot of growth in the customer base fueling that line of garments, flame resistant type garments.","Operator","And we will now go to Tim Mulrooney from William Blair.","Timothy Mulrooney","Last quarter, you were at $7 million in synergies. Some of the major activities were converting the payroll system into financial system, reducing functions of the former headquarters at G&K and consolidating a few dozen branches. But are there any other major activities this quarter to get you that $14 million synergy figure? Or is this mainly just continuing to benefit from the actions outlined last quarter?","Michael Hansen","Yes. It's primarily those that you just mentioned. So the continued reduction of the corporate G&A and getting almost a full quarter now of many of those savings, it is the benefits of the consolidation of a number of locations. So yes, it is all of those things. As we move forward, the items that are really left are continuing to convert to systems and to look at the sourcing opportunities that are out there because as we've talked in the past, we're still using much legacy G&K inventory, and so we need to burn through that. And once we burn through that, we'll start to then order through the Cintas supply chains. We expect that, that will create some saving opportunities.","Timothy Mulrooney","Okay. You talked about material sourcing, is there perhaps also some room for density saving on the energy side, I mean, you said energy was 2.2% of sales today. I mean, what could that get to, could that get to below 2% at some point?","Michael Hansen","Well, look, a lot of that depends on gas prices of the day. But I think Paul mentioned, if we were -- well, I'll say it this way, for that G&K block of business, that fuel is about 3% of revenue. And so there is an opportunity to pull that down, certainly. And as we have converted the system and we then begin the route optimization process, that allows us to do some rerouting and get those savings. So you are right, Tim. That will start to come over the next several quarters as we complete those kind of integration plans. Could it get below 2% in today's environment? I would say, it's -- I don't think so. I think it probably could come down 10 to 20 basis points as a company. But again, I would think about it from the standpoint of we can get that 3% down to probably something closer to 2% for that block of business.","Timothy Mulrooney","Got it. Okay. And then staying on synergies, maybe just a couple more. Did you say that you closed 50 facilities since the acquisition was closed, Mike?","Michael Hansen","Yes, we did.","Timothy Mulrooney","But I think you were at about 420 locations following the deal closing. Is that -- I mean, just simple math, are you at about 370 today?","Michael Hansen","I haven't looked at that. I believe your math, but I haven't specifically looked at that, but it sounds reasonable.","Timothy Mulrooney","Yes, not important. I was just curious, I guess. And then on the $14 million in synergies today, is that then split pretty evenly between SG&A and the consolidation of facilities? That 50 was a little bit higher than I was expecting. And you still expect that $50 million to $55 million by the end of 2018 to be majority SG&A?","Michael Hansen","For the quarter, yes, Tim, you were correct that it's pretty close to a 50-50 split in terms of SG&A versus gross margin. By the end of the year, I think it's going to start to tilt towards gross margin as we get more and more of the benefits of consolidation of locations and that the system conversion and route optimization. So I think we will start to tilt more heavily towards the gross margin.","Operator","And we'll now go to Sean Egan from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Sean Egan","Just one quick one for me. I'm just curious if you can talk about any difference in the performance of G&K locations, those 47% on Cintas systems and the balance off in light of the 4.4% revenue decline within the legacy G&K? Just wondering if you're seeing any clear differential yet.","Michael Hansen","No. No, we're not, Sean. I think, the issue is as we move any location, whether it's a legacy Cintas or G&K, there is disruption during that period of implementation -- I'm sorry, of conversion, system conversion. And if you're comparing a converted location to one that hasn't converted, that one that hasn't converted hasn't had any disruption yet. And so we're still so early in that system conversion process that we're seeing, certainly, some impact of the disruption. But nothing -- I would say we're not seeing anything that is material in terms of the separation of performance at this point.","Operator","And we'll take a follow-up question from Andy Wittmann from Baird.","Andrew Wittmann","Great. And I wanted to talk just a little bit more about kind of the top line in both your key businesses. But in rental, Mike, can you comment a little bit on add-stop and the characteristics of the new business that you're bringing in, whether it's tilted to new folks or competitive wins and even a comment on retention? Similar questions really for the First Aid business, I mean, the growth rate is really impressive and I'm just wondering if that's being brought into new customers or is that more of a penetration focus there?","Paul Adler","Yes. Andy, on the add-stops, the add-stops metric is positive, but it's typically positive at this time of the year. Nothing really remarkable in it to speak of. Still the main drivers of growth are new business and penetration. So to answer your question specifically about anything changing, not really. It's still been consistent in terms of retention and pricing as well. So no significant changes there. And then, First Aid, yes, again, we were talking earlier about the expectation of that growing high single digits, and it's still a good mix of brand new customers, who value the service and want us to handle the compliance for them and provide a benefit to their employees, but also some good penetration. We continue to evolve in that business to offer more and more ancillary products and services like that safety cabinets and other things that we can put in there and a lot around safety and training. That's becoming a significant part of the revenue base, whether it's a training on materials handling or training and the safety training on CPR. That becomes -- continuously becomes a significant portion of the overall revenue.","Michael Hansen","Andy, we're about 18 months from a fairly good sized investment in salespeople in that First Aid and Safety business, if you remember, kind of coming out of the ZEE integration process. And we're just -- we're seeing some real nice productivity out of our new sales partners.","Operator","And there are no further questions. I'll turn the conference back over to you, Mike, for any additional or closing remarks.","Michael Hansen","Thank you very much for joining us tonight and season's greetings to all. We'll issue our third quarter earnings in March and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude our presentation for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"5436":["Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) Q2 2014 Earnings Call December 19, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","William C.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","William C. Gale","Thank you for joining us this evening as we report our second quarter results for fiscal 2014. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","We are pleased to report second quarter revenue of $1,144,000,000, which represents growth of 7.9% from last year's second quarter. The number of workdays in both this year's and last year's second quarters was 65. Organic growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, was 7.1%, the same organic growth we achieved in our first quarter. Mike will give more details by operating segment in a few minutes.","Our operating income for the second quarter was $153 million, which is 13.4% of revenue. This operating margin is 30 basis points higher than last year's second quarter operating margin of 13.1%. It should be noted that last year's second quarter included an $8.5 million gain on the sale of an investment and a $1.6 million write-off of a garment processing system used in one of our rental locations. When adjusting for these 2 items, our operating margin actually improved by almost a full percentage point. We are also very pleased with our results so far in fiscal 2014.","Second quarter net income was $84.9 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.70. It should be noted that our revenues and earnings per share were record quarterly amounts for Cintas and I wish to congratulate all of our Cintas employees who we call partners for this achievement.","We also just recently paid our annual dividend of $0.77 per share, which was a 20.3% increase over last year's dividend and was the 31st consecutive year in which we raised our dividend.","As Scott Farmer indicated in our press release, based on our second quarter results and our view of the U.S. economic climate, we are updating our fiscal 2014 guidance with revenue in the range of $4.525 billion to $4.575 billion and EPS in the range of $2.73 to $2.79. This guidance assumes no deterioration in the U.S. economy and does not consider any future share buybacks.","In July, when we provided our initial guidance, we gave our expectation that fiscal 2014 medical expense would be higher than fiscal 2013 by 10 to 30 basis points due to the effects of the Affordable Care Act and that this impact would be seen in the second half of the fiscal year. While there remains a great amount of uncertainty about the impact of this program in the future, we still expect it to increase our medical expense in the second half of this fiscal year. However, the impact will likely be at the lower end of the 10- to 30-basis-point range provided in July. This expectation is included in our updated guidance.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on the second quarter.","J. Michael Hansen","Thanks, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 7.9% from the second quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 7.1%. Total company gross margin for the second quarter was 41.7%, which is an improvement from last year's second quarter gross margin of 40.7%. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment.","Before doing so, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our second quarter, which was the same as last year. As we look ahead to the remainder of the fiscal year, our third quarter will have 65 workdays, whereas last year's third quarter had 64, so we will have one additional day. Our fourth quarter will also have 65 workdays, whereas last year's fourth quarter has 66 workdays, so we will have one less workday in the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, we will have 260 workdays, which is one less than last year's total.","We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as Other Services on the face of the income statement.","The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 70% of company revenue in the second quarter and totaled $804.3 million, which is up 6.4% compared to last year's second quarter. Organic growth was also 6.4%. Sales rep new business and productivity continued to be strong. And similar to the first quarter, our national account revenue penetration was very good.","Our Rental segment gross margin was 42.9% for the second quarter, an increase from 41.9% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were comparable to last year's second quarter. As Bill mentioned, we wrote off a garment processing system during last year's second quarter. Excluding this impact, Rental gross margin improved by 80 basis points. As we've discussed on previous calls, we began to increase our route capacity in last year's second quarter and we have now lapped that initial investment. The efficiency of these routes has improved throughout the past 12 months and has helped to improve Rental's gross margin. In addition, we continue to see improved leveraging of our plant infrastructure.","The Rental segment's second quarter gross margin of 42.9% was also an improvement from the 42.6% in the first quarter. Energy-related costs were about 10 basis points lower than the first quarter, but improved route efficiency and plant infrastructure leverage also contributed to the improvement.","Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog.","Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the second quarter and totaled $121.9 million, which represented sales growth of 10.6% compared to last year's second quarter. We've been very pleased with the Uniform Direct Sales revenue this fiscal year, which is up 9% for the 6 months ended November 30. In fact, Uniform Direct Sales revenue was up 11.5% for the trailing 12 months. Having said that, the nature of this business is that the revenue can be quite choppy based on the timing of large national account program rollouts.","As we've discussed on previous calls, we had several very large national account rollouts during the second half of last fiscal year, which will not repeat this year. As a result, we expect Uniform Direct Sale revenue for the second half of fiscal '14 to be down 5% to 10% compared to last year's second half.","Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 28.8% for the second quarter, up from last year's second quarter gross margin of 27.4% and the first quarter gross margin of 27.7%. This increase is mainly due to a greater mix of hospitality account sales in the second quarter and better leveraging of our distribution network infrastructure.","Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue, which accounted for 11% of company revenue in the second quarter, was $124.6 million. This represents an increase of 11.7% over last year's second quarter revenue. Organic growth was 8.8%.","This segment's gross margin was 43.4% in the second quarter, which is up 100 basis points from the 42.4% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were lower by 20 basis points. The remaining improvement is due to better leveraging of the infrastructure, particularly at the warehouse level. The gross margin of 43.4% is relatively consistent with the first quarter gross margin of 43.6%.","Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services and it accounted for 8% of second quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue totaled $93 million, which is 12.2% higher than last year's second quarter. Revenue increased organically by 6.9% compared to last year. Average recycled paper prices remained at about $125 per ton, which is down about 17% from last year's second quarter average. Organic growth, excluding recycled paper revenue, was 9.4%.","The second quarter gross margin was 45.7%, which is an increase from last year's second quarter gross margin of 45.4%. Energy-related costs were 30 basis points lower than last year. The lower recycled paper prices had a negative impact of $1.9 million on Document Management's gross margin. Using the same recycled paper prices last year, the second quarter gross margin would have improved by about 140 basis points. This improvement is due to our continued migration from on-site to off-site shredding and better performance in both our North American and European storage businesses.","Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 28.3% as a percentage of revenue in the second quarter, which is up from last year's second quarter figure of 27.6%. However, as Bill mentioned, last year's second quarter SG&A included an $8.5 million gain from the sale of stock in an investment. Adjusting for this onetime item, last year's second quarter SG&A percentage would have been 28.4% compared to this year's 28.3%.","Our effective tax rate was 37.9% for the quarter compared to 36.5% last year. Last year, our second quarter effective tax rate reflected the favorable impact of a change to certain tax regulations. We have no similar items in this year's second quarter. We expect the effective tax rate for the full fiscal 2014 year to be 37.3%.","Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $313 million at November 30, an increase of $30 million from the $283 million at August 31. Accounts receivable increased $8.9 million since August 31. DSOs were slightly below 40, which was a nice improvement from the 43 in last year's second quarter.","New goods inventory and in-service inventory levels at November 30 were $249 million and $509 million, respectively, both up slightly from August 31 levels. Accrued liabilities at November 30 increased from the August 31 balance, primarily due to the accrual of our annual dividend that was paid on December 11. Long-term debt at November 30 was $1.3 billion compared to the amount -- comparable to the amount at August 31.","Net cash provided by operating activities for the second quarter was $140 million, an $8 million improvement over last year's second quarter. And CapEx for the second quarter was $39.3 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $24.4 million in Rental; less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $4.4 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $10.1 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2014 to be in the range of $225 million to $250 million.","This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now be glad to answer any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Could you give us a sense of how you see organic growth proceeding through the balance of the year, particularly looking at year-over-year comps in the Rental business?","William C. Gale","Andrew, our expectation is that we should see mid single-digit growth, organic growth, in the Rental business, again, assuming that the economy kind of stays in the mode that it's in. We saw a decent jobs report in the month of November. However, it was choppy relative to the prior months. So our expectation is we're going to continue to see that choppiness and, therefore, as a result of that, we expect that most of our growth is going to come from new business, which is what has been happening so far this year. And therefore, we're targeting somewhere in that mid single-digit area.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. I would also love for you to build and make a comment about add-stops. When I look at the end markets for uniforms and look within the labor report, it just seems like we've moved past the bottom and there's been a little bit of acceleration in the end markets that you guys served the most since the summertime. Do you characterize the fall in the same way?","William C. Gale","I don't -- I'm not as bullish on it as you have -- as you are, Andrew. I looked at it -- Mike and I have been looking at it. We study it every month. And I will agree with you, November looked good, as I just said earlier, but October was poor. There just is no consistency to our -- as we look at it. So I would hope that it might pick up and stay consistent, but right now, I have to be honest and say I'm not confident that, that level -- that it will continue. We saw -- if you look at our add-stops, we've kind of had some choppiness. We've talked about it being up one quarter and then down another quarter. And if you look at our add-stop in the second quarter, it was slightly down compared to the first quarter and to the second quarter last year. So we sure haven't seen any robust improvement in hiring among our existing customers yet.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is actually Greg calling on for Manav. And going off of what Andrew said, could you give a little bit of your thoughts on which verticals you're starting to see improvement in, just comparing the different verticals and where the hiring environment has been picking up a little bit versus some of the others?","William C. Gale","I would say that we continue to see reasonable strength in the energy sector and we're seeing building strength in the health care arena.","Gregory Bardi - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just one more. On the rollout of the ERP system, maybe just a little update there on how the rollouts work for First Aid and Document Management and when you think you're going to move on to some of the next stages?","William C. Gale","We are about 60% to 70% through the rollout in Document Management and First Aid -- the First Aid business. It has had a few bumps in the road, but we've overcome them. We've had some issues, technical issues, that we've been very -- working very closely with our ERP provider to rectify and I think we've gotten over that now. So our expectation is we will complete that rollout in those 2 businesses sometime in mid-calendar '14. At that point in time, we will be most likely embarking upon a design effort for 1 or 2 of our other businesses. We're going to be making that decision here over the next several months.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You've had a nice gross margin expansion, particularly on an underlying basis in Rental Uniforms. And I'm wondering if you think that 80-basis-point year-over-year expansion is a reasonable run rate for the second half of the year.","J. Michael Hansen","Well, we do believe that we will continue to see some expansion. As we say often, Sara, a lot depends on where the revenue comes from. And if new business continues to be the driver, the expansion will be a little more muted. If we do see continued -- a continued trend like we saw in November employment, then, and we have our customers hiring, we may see some better expansion. Built into our guidance, though, I would say probably something similar to the second quarter levels.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And how should we think about longer-term gross margin potential in that segment?","J. Michael Hansen","Well, we've talked a little bit. When we've talked earlier in the year about our CapEx expectations, we did discuss that, in some cases, in some markets, we're running out of plant capacity. So we will talk -- probably have to invest maybe at the end of this fiscal year or into next fiscal year. So there may be some investment that we have to do to add some capacity, but generally speaking, we expect continued margin improvement over time.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then last quarter, you talked about of your new business wins about 60% were no programmers and 40% you thought were market share. And I know that you don't look at that every quarter, but I'm just wondering, if there's any reason, as you look at, at the marketplace, to think that, that's changing?","J. Michael Hansen","No. I would say there's no reason to think that's changing. That's been pretty consistent as we've come out of the recession and I wouldn't expect that, that would change much.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then just last question. So nice to hear that you think your health care increases will be at the low end of prior expectations. I'm just wondering why, what's driving those lower.","J. Michael Hansen","Well, when we thought about how this would impact us, there were a couple of different things. First, there are -- there's something called a transitional reinsurance fee, which we know will happen. There are other administrative costs and expenses that will happen. The other thing that we expected to happen was that more people would come onto our insurance plan, both for the higher dependent ages because of the individual mandate and also because we thought other companies may be eliminating their coverage or at least making it less beneficial. And while we did see an increase in the number of enrollments more than normal, it was less than we had originally feared. So yes, we think it's going to be the cost of the administration, the reinsurance and more participants.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Hamzah Mazari with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a question on the national account business. You've talked about that being pretty competitive. Could you give us a sense of how much of that is related to just the economy being choppy versus potential overcapacity in the industry?","William C. Gale","I'm not quite sure I understand your question.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'm just asking on the national account business. Could you give us an update of how competitive pricing is in that business?","William C. Gale","Well, yes, it remains very competitive. We believe that part of the reason that our national account business continues to be strong is our relatively broad product offering that we have, especially compared to some of our other industry participants. So when we go to some of our national account customers, we are able to offer more than just one particular product offering, be it like a uniform program or an entrance mat program or whatever. So I think as a result of having a number of different things, we're able to be more successful with some of these national account customers and bundle different products and services for them and that enables us to probably have greater penetration than others.","Hamzah Mazari - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And just a follow-up. If you could give us a sense of sort of what your expectations are on sort of building out capacity going forward.","William C. Gale","Well, we certainly -- as Mike mentioned a few minutes ago, we certainly are seeing some pressure points in some of our geographic markets for need for some capacity in the Rental business. And as a result of that, we have several projects underway at various stages that anticipate the building of additional capacity. It takes a while to do that, in that you've got to find the right piece of land, negotiate for that and then, obviously, design and build out the facility. So based on where we're at today versus where we thought we would be, I would tell you that we're a little behind our original timetable on building some of that capacity. It certainly hasn't cost us to not be able to grow in a market, but we've been able to utilize what we have. But as a result of that, I would expect our CapEx to pick up in the latter part of this year and maybe bleed over into 2015. That is certainly going to require more cash flow to build the plants, but also as Mike said, could cause a little bit of short-term, a less robust improvement in gross margin as a result of that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a quick clarification on that. So you're -- it looks like you're taking down your CapEx guidance by about $10 million to $15 million or so. Is that all based on the new plants that you're constructing? And is it, basically, all just push-out into the next year?","William C. Gale","Yes, pretty much so. Yes, Joe.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Perfect. And then just switching over to the First Aid side. Over the last couple of quarters, you guys have put up pretty good margins performance there. And it sounded like you were starting to get some scale benefits. I guess it seems to me like you might have taken a little bit of a step back this quarter on an easy comp. Was there something specific there within First Aid?","J. Michael Hansen","Well -- the gross margin improved. And you're talking about sequentially or year-over-year, Joe?","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Year-over-year on the operating margin side.","J. Michael Hansen","Yes. So in the gross margin, we improved by about 100 basis points and I talked a little bit about that in my prepared remarks. On an SG&A basis, there is some reflection of the investment in SAP. And keep in mind, that's a pretty large endeavor in both Document Management and First Aid and Safety. And you do see a little bit of an increase in the SG&A this quarter year-over-year for both of those businesses. And while we certainly expect benefit from that system, it is not a 1- to 2-year payback. So that's the blip that you're seeing in SG&A that kind of falls down to that operating margin.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I mean, is that something that we should expect to see, then, flow through over the next several quarters or is that a \"blip?\"","J. Michael Hansen","Well, I think what you'll -- I think you'll still see that level of investment as we implement the project. So while we're in the implementation phase, we do have some groups of people going around and training our new users. And so there are some additional costs that will likely, as Bill said, run through the rest of this fiscal year. And then we should be almost fully implemented by mid-calendar '14. So I wouldn't expect that incremental cost to continue, but certainly, there's the cost of SAP that will continue. Having said that, we expect to get benefit going forward. And that benefit will come through better information, better price reviews. And that should come, it's just not a quick turn.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Right. Just a quick question on pricing on your legacy Uniform Rental business. I know pricing is still probably very competitive, but we are starting to get some chatter that it could be loosening up for non-national accounts. Is that something that you've seen or is it still a bit premature?","William C. Gale","Joe, we have so many operations around the country and different customers we're going to. I hear anecdotally lots of different things. I cannot confirm for you that I've heard that take place. I mean, I hear some markets, it's -- \"Oh, this is more aggressive. We've seen it.\" In other markets, \"Yes, it's firming up.\" So from what I'm hearing, I can't confirm that, that's happening based on our experience.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So just maybe a couple of bookkeeping things here. Maybe this is in the commentary, but can you comment on the number of shares repurchased and maybe the average price? It looks like -- I get about 961,000 shares, about $59 per share, but can you give us the real numbers?","J. Michael Hansen","We purchased about 1.2 million shares during the quarter. We talked about most of those purchases were prior to our first quarter earnings release. We have about $505 million remaining on the authorization. We bought about 3.2 million shares for the year. Andy, I don't have in front of me the average price. That will show up in our Q.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. Okay. And then can you -- Mike, maybe a little bit of detail inside -- Mike, I think I ask this question every quarter, but can you give us some color inside the Rental segment between kind of core uniform wearing versus the facility services? Are you seeing any differentiation in the growth rates between those business? Maybe some color there.","J. Michael Hansen","We're seeing real good growth in all of the pieces within the Rental business. And while we don't disclose the different pieces individually, I'll say that garments are growing nicely. And the different businesses within the facility services: the dust; the chemicals; hygiene products and services; our deep clean business, all those businesses are growing fairly well and there's not any real overweighting of any of them.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. The -- just in terms of, so, a year ago, we've now lapped the investments in human capital that you made in terms of routes and maybe some more salespeople. Can you just talk about kind of where you are in that curve right now? Are we still folding those and ramping those new routes up? Or are we at the point where, in addition to plant capacity, we need some more route capacity? Can you just talk about where we are in that today versus a year ago and if there's an expectation for growth there?","William C. Gale","We always are going to be adding routes. So as long as we grow, we're going to be adding routes. But we you don't anticipate, at this point, adding routes to the same degree we did a year ago. So the fact that we have gone a year now from the -- kind of the unusual surge in number of routes has certainly -- we're starting to feel the positive impact of that as those routes build up. And I think that was part of the reason you saw some improvement in the margin in the Rental business. Right now, Andy, unless there is a major increase in the revenue growth rate, I think routes capacity will be added at a -- kind of a nominal pace going forward.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's very helpful. Maybe one last question here in the Affordable Care Act. With some of the provisions changed and others delayed, we've got the outlook for this fiscal year. Is there any way -- is there anything that's changing about your out-year look out from the -- outlook from the experience that you've had so far in rolling people for calendar 2014 that makes you think that maybe the longer-term effect in your fiscal '15 is maybe greater than or less than your previous expectation?","William C. Gale","I guess I'm somewhat encouraged by the fact that we didn't have as many participants coming onto the program that we had feared might happen. But there is so much yet to be played out on this whole thing with some of the delays and parts of the law and that certain businesses do not have to necessarily add or offer the service. I think we've got to wait and see. I just don't think we have enough information yet to know what the full effect of this thing is going to be. And therefore, while we kind of are set now for our enrollment for '14, we really don't know what's going to happen to the cost structure and the -- because we're self-insured, and what ends up happening from the standpoint of the cost per head. So I think we've just got to wait and see, Andy.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Healy with Northcoast Research.","John M. Healy - Northcoast Research","Guys, I wanted to ask a little bit about the fire resistant garments segment. There's been a little discussion in the industry that maybe that market is showing a little plateauing or just baselining of the growth rate. And I was curious to get your thoughts on what's happening in that end market from a demand perspective. And maybe some color in terms of what that might represent as a percentage of the uniform business today.","William C. Gale","I think there's been a little bit of a slowdown in that business, John, only because you were comparing it to that robust growth that we were seeing, as energy was just booming throughout the country here a couple of years ago and through most of last year. But given the fact that we've kind of seen a plateauing of that, obviously, our new business is not as big as it was. However, we are still the largest provider in that market. I don't think there's been, really, a reduction in the number of employees in the energy sector that are required to wear these garments. We really haven't seen any big competitive situation. It's just that you're not seeing that many -- as many oilfield workers going forward. But our FRC business is still one of the highlights of our Rental business and continues to be.","John M. Healy - Northcoast Research","Got you. And I want to ask you a big picture question. Bill, you're always good at giving us a read on how you feel about the economy. And just kind of as we move into the calendar year, I mean, you've had a great last 6 months of the business and your growth rates kind of organically show like there's a little bit of moderation. But I guess if you do the postmortem on calendar 2013, did the business and the economy maybe feel -- come out better than you might have thought? And then, I guess, as you look to calendar '14, are you feeling better about where we're at versus 6 months ago? Or -- I'd just appreciate any color or perspective you could provide there.","William C. Gale","Well, I would say '13 -- calendar '13 certainly turned out to be modestly better than what I had originally expected and I think we have seen similar results in many businesses. So I think many businesses were able to adapt to a slow growth environment and have done quite well in it. As we look into '14, we kind of see -- right now, I think our expectation is more of the same. We don't see any catalysts out there to really improve growth substantially, nor do we see anything on the horizon that would throw us yet into a recession. So right now, I guess we're kind of thinking, it should be comparable to what we saw this year. With that said, I think people have to keep in mind, though, it has not been a consistent year -- or month-over-month improvement. There's been some real choppiness that we've seen throughout '13. And I kind of think that maybe is what we'll see in '14. But when you step back and look at it, you'll say, \"Oh, okay, that wasn't a bad result given what kind of pressures continue to exist out there in the economy.\"","John M. Healy - Northcoast Research","Okay, great. And just final question. In the first quarter, you guys were kind enough to call out the operating margin headwind associated with the lack of the workday. I think it was around 50 basis points or so. Is that a realistic type of benefit we should expect just from a comp standpoint in the third quarter, given the extra workday that should benefit you guys?","J. Michael Hansen","Yes, I think that's a reasonable way of looking at it, John. We'll get the same kind of impact in that we'll have an extra day of revenue to cover things like depreciation, amortization of the garments and other rental items. So I think that's a good way of looking at it.","William C. Gale","But then keep in mind, the fourth quarter, you're going to have that negative comparison again.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I'd love to revisit the margin discussion a little bit, particularly around the uniform rental business. On one hand, we're definitely seeing improvements in route productivity. That's balanced, I think, somewhat by the fact that the non-program [indiscernible] isn't really changing and isn't really expected to change over the next couple of quarters. So can you talk a little bit about how those dynamics are going to play out and how you expect margins to play out over the course of the fiscal year and into fiscal '15?","J. Michael Hansen","Well, as we talked a little bit earlier, we would expect that the routes that we added last year will continue to become more efficient. In probably the next 6 months, we'll see continued improved leveraging of our plant infrastructure. But probably, towards the end of the fiscal year, maybe in the next fiscal year, we will have some investments to make in different pockets for plant capacity. So that will certainly affect us going into fiscal '15. And, George, again, it just -- there's a lot of dependent -- a lot of dependence on how the revenue comes. And if we see the kind of year that Bill just kind of mapped out, then I would expect to see some continuing improvement, with a little bit of impact of the investment that I mentioned. Does that help?","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That's helpful, Mike. And could you give us an updated view on what employment figures need to be [indiscernible] acceleration in organic performance?","William C. Gale","Well, we would -- I think we've kind of looked at it, George, and said that if we could see -- I'm going to throw out this as a general number because it really will depend where the job growth is coming -- but if you can see job growth consistently, 250,000 plus a month, that generally correlates to existing businesses adding employees. And as long as that's kind of across the whole economy, then we would see the impact of that happening on our customers and, therefore, we would see an improved add-over-stop rate.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I don't have too many questions left, but we talked a lot about expanding the routes and how that's been productive. Can you talk a little bit more about products that you've added in the various lines of business that you have and in the last, say, year or 2 and how some of that is driving some of the growth? Or is it really just adding the routes and that's really what it is?","William C. Gale","Well, I think we've expanded some of our offerings in, like, the hygiene arena, Shlomo, which has helped us grow a little bit faster in certain segments. But I don't know if it's really any other significantly new products other than that. I think it's just been, generally, additional penetration of customers with some of those products. And we've talked, for example, of the chemical dispensing business, still a relatively small part of our business, but that has been an add-on to many of our hospitality-type customers. So that's been beneficial to us.","Shlomo H. Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about the floor cleaning business and how many cities you're in? Are you continuing to expand that now?","William C. Gale","I don't know exactly how many cities we're in. We are in many of the major markets across the U.S. Right now, our focus has been on additional penetration within those markets that we're in as opposed to opening up new markets, because we'd like to take advantage of the management structure that's required to run that operation. But I would tell you that, I would think we're -- we've got to be in 50 of the top 100 MSAs.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Dan Dolev with Jefferies.","Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just really quickly back to the economy. I did notice that on the press release, Scott said that he's seeing some signs of economic growth beginning to appear. And I looked back and I saw that this was compared to a previous press release which said that there's still no any evidence in the economy. Was that just November? Am I reading too much into that? And maybe you can please explain what he was saying versus what you were saying, that you're not that bullish.","William C. Gale","It's the holiday season, Dan. We were just trying to be optimistic. No, I'm teasing. I would tell you that it certainly feels a little better to us as we've gone through now 2 quarters of our fiscal year. The fact that, yes, it's still been choppy. And as I mentioned to Andrew at the top of the call, we still have no good consistency. But when you kind of look at the stock market and what's happening with that, you sense that maybe Washington is at least getting together -- or getting along a little bit better. I guess there's kind of a feeling that, \"Okay, things are not going to be back like they were in the '90s, but maybe we're going to be okay.\" And so we kind of sense that in talking with our customers. And we looked at the November jobs report and we said, \"Hey, that wasn't bad.\" So -- and I think we've had 2 quarters now in a row of each one of our business segments grew organically more than 6%. So I think that gives us some comfort to say, \"Okay, maybe things will be all right.\"","Dan Dolev - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's good. I hope so. One other question on shredding. You are growing very fast. And Iron Mountain, I don't think, discloses the growth in shredding, but I'm estimating they're growing about 3%, which is well below you. So are you just -- can you maybe tell us what the market is growing at? And it looks like you're gaining a lot of share and who you're gaining share from.","William C. Gale","I do not have any statistics on what the market is growing, so I -- and I really can't comment on anything Iron Mountain does. All I can tell you, Dan, is that, yes, we've seen a nice pickup in our service revenue. And while the paper prices continue to be a little bit of a headwind, we are pleased with the business. We -- our model has been one of converting to more off-site shredding and that seems to be going very well. We've had some nice wins on some pretty good-sized national account customers. So I think that's been benefiting us. And I would say that we are taking business primarily from the smaller players because more and more companies realize that they're not really engaging a company to do waste pickup. They're engaging a company to do privacy protection. And they've got to be sure that it is securely handled and that companies have the standards to do that. And I think that has helped us with our growth rate.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sean Kim with RBC Capital Markets.","Sean Sun-Il Kim - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","First, on guidance. I think when you guys initially gave guidance, it assumes sort of mid single-digit organic growth in the Rental segment. It's come in a little bit ahead of that in the first half. So I guess it makes sense for you to raise the lower end, but just wondering why you guys lowered the top end of the guidance as well.","William C. Gale","Well, I think part of that is driven by the fact of paper prices. And the Document Management business have not rebounded as much as we had initially hoped. I think it also is attributable to what Mike was talking about in the direct sale business in that we are not going to have as good a second half as we did in the first half and as we did in the second half last year. And as we got closer to that period, we don't have any other big rollouts that are going to happen to replace that business. And I think it's just the general conservative view of what we see we might have to deal with. We get into the winter -- if we have a bad winter, that has a bit of an impact on our business. So I think it's just -- it's all those factors together, Sean. I wouldn't read too much into it, other than it's not as optimistic as we hoped it might have been when we started the fiscal year, but it's certainly not as pessimistic as we feared it might be when we started.","Sean Sun-Il Kim - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. Just one more, if I may. I think, historically, you guys have done more share repurchases in the fiscal first quarter and the fourth quarter. Is that -- did you think that's something we should expect in fiscal '14 as well, sort of acceleration in buybacks towards the end of the fiscal year?","William C. Gale","Well, I will remind everyone that during the first quarter and into early the second quarter of fiscal '14, we did purchase 3.2 million shares. Whether or not we will purchase any shares in the fourth quarter is subject to our board's direction. And I can't predict at this time nor can I signal what we may do. So I -- all I would say is past practice is sometimes an indication of the future.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","I noticed that in the quarter, I think there was only about $300,000 or so in M&A. I don't know if you addressed this, but I'm wondering what your thoughts are there going forward. And it kind of piggybacks on the question before that. You're obviously -- just boosted the dividend by over 20%. And if there were not to be any share repurchases, your cash would be growing very rapidly here, leading either to debt reduction or cash on the balance sheet that's not...","William C. Gale","That's not what?","[Technical Difficulty]","William C. Gale","All right, I'll try to answer his question. Hopefully, he can hear the answer. I think acquisitions always are going to be somewhat unpredictable. We did -- certainly, we do continue to have a very active full-time M&A staff within our company that is constantly looking for good acquisitions. And unfortunately, in the second quarter, we did not have a lot of meeting of the minds with sellers as to the appropriate valuations and, as result of that, we didn't make them. That doesn't necessarily mean that's going to happen in the third and fourth quarter because there's always ongoing discussions. And I don't know what will happen. I can't predict that. Regarding the cash buildup, it's a nice problem to have in that it gives us a lot of options for maximizing shareholder value. And I think our board has shown a pretty good process of putting that cash to appropriate use and I don't expect that to change.","Operator","And we'll take our next -- actually, at this time, we do have one question remaining in the queue. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Following up on M&A, just on where you're looking there, Bill. Should we think you're primarily focused in Document Management, still? Is there activity in Rental? Just across your segments, thoughts on where you may be more or less active.","William C. Gale","Scott, we're actually active in all of the business segments, I'd say, with the exception of direct sale. There is not a lot of value to buying direct sale businesses, generally. So we don't spend a lot of effort there, but in all -- in the other 3 segments, we continue to evaluate different opportunities.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Great. And then last year, you said that the Superstorm Sandy had an adverse impact, but that it was not material. Curious, the weather has been solid this quarter, any benefit or risk on comparison from that? And then just taking that a step further, how would you kind of rank order the 3 biggest drivers of year-over-year margin expansion?","William C. Gale","Certainly, because of what we said last year, we knew there were a lot of concern that people thought that Hurricane Sandy might have an impact on us and that's why we made the comment that it was a minimal impact, it wasn't material. So I can't really say that we had any benefit this quarter of any -- because it wasn't material to begin with. Relative to the components of the gross margin improvement, I would say the most of it has come from the route, utilization of the leveraging off the route additions; and then, secondarily, probably from the plant utilization. And then we -- I think we had a minor energy pickup, didn't we, Mike, quarter-over-quarter?","J. Michael Hansen","It was minor, if there was one. Yes, it was comparable. It was primarily those 2 items.","Operator","And it appears there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","William C. Gale","I want to thank everyone for joining us during this very busy time of the year. Appreciate your interest in Cintas. And on behalf of all of the Cintas family, we want to wish everyone a very happy holiday season and a successful 2014.","Operator","And again, this does conclude today's Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call.

","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Hansen","Good evening and thank you for joining us. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas\u2019 Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2019. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements.","This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company\u2019s current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 was a record $1.79 billion, an increase of 7.4% over last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 7.6%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201919, the organic growth rate for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment was 6.8% and the organic growth rate for the first aid and safety services operating segment was 10.7%.","Gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 of $823.6 million increased 9.5%. Gross margin, as a percent of revenue, was 45.9% for the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 compared to 45.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201818. Uniform rental and facility services operating segment gross margin, as a percent of revenue, improved 100 basis points from last year\u2019s fourth quarter to 46%. And the first aid and safety services operating segment gross margin percentage improved 70 basis points to 47.7%.","Reported operating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 of $314.4 million increased 18.4%. Operating margin was 17.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 compared to 15.9% in fiscal \u201818. Operating income was negatively impacted by integration expenses relating to the G&K acquisition by $900,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 and $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201818. Excluding the integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition, operating income increased 12.4% and operating margin improved 80 basis points to 17.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 compared to 16.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201818.","Reported net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 was $226.2 million and reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 were $2.06. Reported EPS was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the G&K acquisition by $0.01 in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819. Excluding the G&K acquisition integration expenses, net income dollars increased 13.5% and net income margin was 12.6% compared to 12% last year. EPS increased 16.9%.","We are pleased with these fourth quarter results, which conclude a very successful year. A year ago, in our prepared remarks, we shared our expectations for fiscal \u201919. We provided revenue and earnings per share guidance, we committed to an estimated amount of synergies from the G&K acquisition and the continued conversion of operations to a new ERP system. We shared our excitement for -- with returning to our debt to EBITDA target ahead of schedule, and we committed to returning to our historical priorities for deployment of cash. We are happy to report that we not only achieved, but exceeded these expectations. ","For the ninth consecutive year, our organic growth rate was in the mid-to-high single digits. This means, we've been able to grow consistently in multiples of GDP and employment growth. Due to our strong growth, innovative products and services, and hard work and dedication of our employee partners, we moved up 41 places to number 459 in the Fortune 500 ranking. For the ninth consecutive year, we achieved double digit earnings per share growth from continuing operations when adjusted for one time and special items.","We paid an annual dividend of $220.8 million that increased 26.5% over the prior year. We've now increased the annual dividend paid to our shareholders for the 35th consecutive year, and the company deployed excess cash by purchasing 4.8 million shares of company\u2019s stock for a total amount of $953.4 million. Fiscal \u201819\u2019s achievements were especially noteworthy given that they were accomplished in a period of extreme change management, in which we were integrating our largest acquisition to date and implementing a new enterprise resource planning system, namely SAP.","The integration of a very large acquisition required the extra effort of everyone in the organization. Our partners executed our playbook and made the right adjustments when necessary. Better revenue retention and more cost synergies have resulted in a higher return on investments and plan. In many respects, the implementation of an ERP system is like an integration of a very large acquisition. It impacts hundreds of operations and requires the involvement of experts from all departments of the company. ","The conversion of each operation to SAP is an eight-month process of planning, changing business processes and employee mindsets, training and certification and customer communication. In implementing SAP, we are moving from a decade\u2019s old platform to new technology that provides powerful information and data designed to help us improve our business. Through fiscal \u201819, about 65% of the operations are now in SAP. We will complete the roll out to the remaining locations in fiscal \u201820.","The Cintas\u2019 story is one of growth. We have grown both revenue and profit 48 of the past 50 years. The only exceptions were the Great Recession years. Our successful financial formula is organic revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits, double digit earnings per share growth, significant cash generation, and prudent deployment of excess cash. Our priorities for uses of cash are investing in the business for growth, acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases.","Our opportunity for continued growth is great. We have a product or service to help nearly every business get ready for the work day. This is evident in a diverse customer base spread over numerous verticals in both services providing and goods producing sectors of the economy. All businesses care about image, safety, cleanliness, or compliance, and businesses continue to outsource to concentrate on their core competencies. We are well positioned to continue to benefit from these tailwinds. We enjoy unrivaled scale, innovate our product and service offering, invest in technology, and build our brand.","Cintas possesses numerous competitive advantages, but our greatest one is our culture. This year, Cintas celebrates our heritage 90 years in the making. The Cintas culture is a foundation upon which the company is built, and it is the reason for the company's success. The culture reflects our integrity, professionalism, and dedication to our customers. Other hallmarks including positive discontent and competitive urgency drive us to innovate and stay out in front of the competition. The Cintas culture is why even after nearly a century of success, we believe our best years are ahead.","Before turning the call over to Paul for more details, I'll provide our fiscal \u201820 expectations. We expect revenue to be in the range of $7.24 billion to $7.31 billion. We expect EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $8.30 to $8.45. Note the following regarding the guidance. The growth rate at the revenue guidance range is 5% to 6.1%. However, our fiscal \u201820 contains one less work day than our fiscal \u201819.","Adjusting for this one day difference, on a constant work day basis, the revenue growth rate range at guidance is 5.4% to 6.5%. One less work day also has a negative impact on EPS, reducing it about $0.06, which is a 90 basis point drag on the EPS growth rate. The guidance assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal \u201820 of 21% compared to a rate of 19.9% for fiscal \u201819. The higher effective tax rate in fiscal \u201820 negatively impacts our EPS growth about 180 basis points and total EPS by about $0.14. ","Keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. The guidance assumes a share count for computing EPS of 109 million shares. This consists of diluted weighted average shares outstanding, plus participating securities in the form of restricted stock. It does not assume any future share buybacks, any potential deterioration in the US economy or any further specifically identified G&K integration expenses. ","And lastly, the guidance does not or does include the impact from the adoption of the accounting standards update 2016-02 on leases. With the adoption, significant changes to the balance sheet will occur. We expect the assets and liabilities to increase in the range of $160 million to $185 million. However, we do not expect any material effect on the P&L or the cash flow.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Adler","Thank you, Mike. Please note that our fiscal fourth quarter contained the same number of work days as the prior year fourth quarter. Looking ahead to fiscal \u201920, please note that there will be one less work day than in fiscal \u201819. One less day will negatively impact fiscal \u201920 total revenue growth by 40 basis points. To illustrate the magnitude of the headwind, using fiscal \u201819\u2019s annual revenue, one less work day equates to about $27 million. One less work day also has a negative impact on operating margin and EPS.","Fiscal \u201820 operating income margin will be reduced by about 12.5 basis points in comparison to fiscal \u201819 due to one less day of revenue. The negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis and we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses. As Mike stated, one less work day is a headwind of about 90 basis points on EPS growth, and about a $0.06 drag on total EPS in comparison to fiscal \u201819.","Each quarter of fiscal \u201820 will contain 65 work days. In comparison to fiscal \u201919, the fiscal \u201820 Q1 will have one less day; Q2 will have the same number of days; Q3 will have one additional day and Q4 will have one less day. Please keep the quarterly day differences in mind when modeling our fiscal \u201820 results.","We have two reportable operating segments, uniform rental and facility services and first aid and safety services. The remainder of our business is included in all other. All other consists of fire protection services and our uniform direct sale business. First aid and safety services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. Uniform rental and facility services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers on route. ","Uniform rental and facility services revenue was $1.43 billion, an increase of 6.4%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 6.8%. Our uniform rental and facility services segment gross margin was 46.0% for the fourth quarter compared to 45.0% in last year's fourth quarter, an improvement of 100 basis points. Energy expense, as a percentage of revenue, was 2.4% compared to 2.55% in the prior year quarter. We are pleased with the gross margin expansion and our ability to overcome wage pressures and tariff impacts.","Our first aid and safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment\u2019s revenue for the fourth quarter was $163.5 million. The organic growth rate for the segment was 10.7%. The first aid segment gross margin was 47.7% in the fourth quarter, compared to 47.0% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 70 basis points. First aid segment gross margins continue to increase with strong top line growth. As our volume grows, we can negotiate better pricing from vendors. Growth also enables us to improve route density, reducing gasoline and diesel costs, and enabling our service teams to spend more time serving and upsell.","Our fire protection services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category. Our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace. The uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility, such as when we install a multimillion dollar account. Uniform direct sale however, is a key business for us and its customers are all often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from our other business units. All other revenue was $201.8 million, an increase of 12.7%. The organic growth rate was 11.6% and was driven by 14.3% organic growth in the fire business. All other gross margin was 43.7% for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 43.6% for last year's fourth quarter.","Selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, were 28.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 and \u201818. Lower labor expense, as a percent of revenue, was offset by increases in other expenses including stock compensation, insurance, workers\u2019 compensation and medical. We are self- insured and therefore subject to some volatility in workers\u2019 comp and medical expense from quarter to quarter.","Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 was 21.7%. As Mike stated earlier, the tax rate can move from period to period based on discrete events, including the amount of stock compensation expense. Our cash and equivalents balance as of May 31 was $96.6 million. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201819 increased 31% from the amount of operating cash flow in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201818. ","Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter were $68.9 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $54.7 million in uniform rental and facility services; $9.6 million in first aid and safety; and $4.6 million in all other. We expect fiscal \u201820 CapEx to be in the range of $280 million to $310 million.","As of May 31, total debt was $2,849,000,000; $2,537,000,000 was fixed interest rate debt and $312 million was variable rate debt in the form of a term loan and commercial paper. At May 31, we were at our targeted leverage of two times debt to EBITDA.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is actually Greg calling in. I was just hoping to get an update on the G&K synergies in terms of where we were exiting 2019, what we expect in 2020, and how you guys are feeling about potential sources of upside going forward.","Mike Hansen","We finished fiscal \u201819 a little bit over $100 million for the year, a little bit better than we expected at the beginning of the year. And I would expect that in fiscal \u201920, we\u2019ll get to the neighborhood of $135 million, which is right in the middle of the range that we guided to three years ago when we announced the G&K deal. So we feel great about achieving the synergies we initially set out to do. If we can get to that 135 in fiscal \u201920, that's a year ahead of schedule, we had talked about a four year plan, and so we feel really good about achieving that. The lifting, the heavy lifting that's left continues to be the route optimization that will continue in fiscal \u201820. That's, as we've talked about over the last few years, that's not a source of significant synergies. We will get some energy benefits as we eliminate mileage on our routes, but we certainly are growing and need to continue to add capacity on route. So all in all, Greg, we feel great about where we are in that G&K integration.","Unidentified Analyst","And then I also wanted to ask about natural adjacencies out of your, outside of what is the core business currently. It seems like we're getting towards the end of some of the heavy lifting on the integration and the SAP implementation. And leverage is pretty reasonable at this point. Just wondering if that changes how you guys think about potentially going after some of these markets and what kind of markets that could potentially be?","Mike Hansen","Well, we, I would say this, we -- I mentioned a little bit in my prepared remarks that we look for opportunities in image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance and those are some pretty good umbrellas to be covering for our customers, and there are a lot of opportunities there. As we've seen over the years, we have had product adjacencies in all of our businesses and we're continuing to look for those under those four umbrellas that I mentioned. And certainly, we're looking for other things that may also be included under those umbrellas that could be possibly a different route structure or what have you. But, we're being disciplined and we want to make sure that there is long term value that there's a big market opportunity for any new type of product adjacency or business. We certainly, as you mentioned, we are at our two times leverage kind of a goal, and we've got a strong balance sheet and so we're going to be looking for opportunities to deploy that cash and certainly acquisitions and other investments in our product lines are right at the top of our list. So we'll be looking for opportunities.","Operator","Our next question will come from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","Wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about the economic and employment outlook and basically what you're hearing from your customers right now in terms of their propensity to spend going forward, just some background on the industry would be great.","Mike Hansen","Well, we feel pretty good about the macro; still, the environment still feels pretty conducive to sell new business to continue to penetrate and you see with our fourth quarter revenue results, as well as the guidance that we've given that we feel pretty good about the momentum that we have in the business and that we\u2019ll continue into our fiscal \u201820. We look at GDP for calendar \u201819, it\u2019s still above expectations or still above 2%. If you think about the last nine years, that's the neighborhood in which we've performed and we've had a pretty good nine year period where we have grown in excess of that GDP and employment. So we still like the macro environment. In the last quarter, we've seen just under 500,000 jobs being created in the last six months, a million in the last year, 2 million. And so the job growth has continued to be pretty good as well. So Toni, we like the environment and as you can see by our fourth quarter and our guidance, we like the momentum in the business.","Toni Kaplan","That's great. And then in terms of margins, how should we be thinking about expansion across the segments in the upcoming year and then additionally, how should we be thinking about incremental SAP costs over next year.","Mike Hansen","So, from a margin perspective, our guidance would imply something in the way of low-to-mid 17s as a company, and we're certainly striving within each of our businesses to grow margins and that's our expectation. That margin expectation for fiscal \u201820 would include some pretty good incrementals as a total business. And so, we continue to look for opportunities and expect improvements in that. ","From an SAP cost perspective, we\u2019ll continue to roll that system out this fiscal year. And we've talked about some of those rollout costs rolling off after fiscal \u201820. That's been somewhere in the, let's call it, $10 million to $12 million because we've talked about SAP costs from a few years ago, increasing about 25, about half of which has been costs that are related to the rollout whether it's training, consultants, et cetera. So we do expect that some of that will roll off in fiscal \u201821.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.","Kevin McVeigh","Hey, really nice job, the organic growth in the fire business, the 14.3%, was there anything in there in particular that kind of drove that and then just really, really, really nice margin expansion. Can you give us a sense of how much of a headwind kind of the tariffs and we just work because obviously we're able to really offset that nicely.","Paul Adler","Yeah. Kevin, it\u2019s Paul. I'll talk about fire and turn it to Mike on the tariffs. But in terms of fire, yeah, the organic growth was strong at 14%. But we continue to expect out of that business, organic growth of 10% or a little bit better. So, very good execution in Q4. But that's kind of par for the course with the fire business of late. So nothing specific to really call out. But we just continue to do a great job of winning business. We have a very professional, aggressive sales force, and kind of leveraging our service capabilities that we have in uniform rental, and our experiences there through the fire business and very professional service oriented businesses on the service side, and so we expect that strong organic growth to continue.","Mike Hansen","Kevin from a tariff standpoint, there certainly has been a lot of noise in the tariff environment, and -- but I would say, certainly a little bit of impact, not a lot, the noise around Mexico kind of came and went. China, while we have seen a lot of noise and seen some tariffs, we have not been too affected by the first couple of buckets of those tariffs. But we're not immune to additional tariffs that might happen. We have to stay ahead of those things and so we're seeing a little bit of it. But there's probably more noise than impact. From a labor perspective, we have certainly seen some impact market by market especially. I wouldn't say that it's been significant. We do, in our production or our plant\u2019s environment, we do see a little bit more difficulty in hiring people. But generally speaking, the pressures that we've seen have been not significant and we've been able to deal with them quite well so far. We're certainly going to need to continue to keep our eyes on all of the tariff information that's going on, though as we move forward.","Operator","Our next question will come from Gary Bisbee with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gary Bisbee","I guess if I could go back to margins and the margins implied in the guidance. I think if we back out the margin benefit from the tale of the G&K synergies and also the drag from one less work day, it doesn't sound like the guidance implies a whole lot of margin expansion outside of those -- from those two factors, so I know you tend to have some conservatism in how you guide, but is there anything else you'd call out that would lead to less operating leverage in fiscal \u201820?","Mike Hansen","No, and quite honestly, Gary, I'm not sure that I would agree. I think if you think about that margin improvement, that's, let's call it low to mid 17s compared to 16.7 for fiscal \u201819 would imply, at the midpoint, roughly incrementals right around 30%. That's at the high end of where we've talked about being. If you strip out those incremental synergies, you're still above 20% at the midpoint. So we feel we're right where we want to be with those operating margins and we do expect continued improvement even without the synergies, but inclusive of the synergies, we like the margin expansion quite a bit.","Keep in mind, Gary, keep in mind that when we compare, if you're backing from EPS, we've got a $0.14 headwind in the higher tax rate than in fiscal \u201818 and then as you mentioned, we've got the $0.06 headwind from the one less work day. So if you're backing in from EPS, you got to keep in mind, there's a $0.20 headwind. ","Gary Bisbee","Yeah, I guess I was just doing, you said 35 million incremental savings, that's 50 basis points and then that's offset by 10 or 15 from the one less work day. It\u2019s sort of like half that margin, but I guess your point is fair that the other half is still pretty good expansion, so that's fine. I guess I just want to ask one other thing\u2026","Mike Hansen","Yeah. And I would say from a synergy standpoint, Gary, I would -- we think about it as 105 to 135. So about a $30 million improvement.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. All right, fair enough. And then on SAP, a two parter, you've, I guess, you said, you're 65% of the way through the network rollout at this point, you've talked about two benefits, the one you're most excited about is just the information allowing you to cross sell and run the business better. How is that playing out, once you've got one of your facilities that is up and running, is that pretty quick or is there a meaningful learning curve? And I guess what I'm really trying to get at is, are you beginning to benefit yet from the rollout to date, or should we think of it more as a future benefit, later this year, maybe even more so into next year.","Mike Hansen ","Sure. There is a learning curve. No question about it. This is a system that is heavily data dependent and we have to change our business processes locally to be able to use that system most efficiently. So, there is a drag in terms of, we talked about an eight month planning process prior to implementation, there's also a period of time afterwards where we're getting efficient at using the system. So it certainly is a process and a lot of change going on. ","From a local perspective, I think we are seeing some incremental benefits like new portable route computers for our SSRs and so there are some incremental benefits that are probably more on the minor side. I think from the ability to manage the information, we would typically do that at greater than a one location at a time type of a look. And so the more we get on, the more we can begin to look at different regional groupings and take advantage of the power of that information. So I think most of that is going to come as we move into \u201821 and \u201822.","Gary Bisbee","And then if I could just sneak in one quick cleanup number, you said last quarter you expected like in the cadence of \u201819, that the Q1 tax rate would be a lot lower. Is last year's number a good ballpark or should we think it's higher than that, but still much lower than the rest of the year?","Mike Hansen","Yes, you're right, Gary. It will be quite a bit lower. I would probably think of it in terms of a kind of a 12% to 13% type of a range and a lot of that will depend on the level of stock compensation benefits based on the price of our stock, the performance of the stock, but you're right, it'll be much lower than the rest of the year.","Operator","Our next question will come from Blake Johnson with Goldman Sachs.","Blake Johnson","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Regarding your revenue guidance, how much of the growth do you expect to be driven by further penetration of the non-programmer market versus headcount growth at existing customers? And can you discuss traction and penetrating underrepresented verticals such as healthcare and industrials this quarter?","Mike Hansen","Sure. So, for fiscal 20, our new business efforts are generally the driver of our revenue growth in all of our businesses and we like the opportunities there particularly in that no programmer space, we can get to that no programmer space with our unique garments, with our unique garment solutions like our scrub systems and we think there's a big opportunity there. So, we expect that to continue to drive the growth like it has for years past, but the penetration remains good. It's when we can provide a good product and articulate the value to our customers. They certainly have shown that they're willing to spend, so that certainly will be important for us, but it's led by the new business efforts.","From a fourth quarter perspective, those under penetrated verticals continue to perform very well: healthcare, education, the government sectors, they continue to perform very well. We are focused on those areas, particularly with our sales efforts. And we're encouraged by what we have seen in \u201819 and expect good things out of those verticals also in fiscal \u201820 and beyond.","Blake Johnson","And then regarding G&K, one of the strategic benefits was to drive higher penetration of ancillary products to legacy G&K customers. Can you discuss any progress made here? Maybe the current percentage of cross selling between various lines of business or any other metrics that would be great.","Mike Hansen","We certainly have made progress in fiscal \u201819 in terms of some penetration, it's hard. I'm not going to provide any specific penetration because so much of that volume is intermixed with legacy Cintas volume. However, we certainly have seen that our penetration has been strong. Our hygiene growth has been strong for the year. And so we are encouraged and believe that we've made some good headway there and expect to continue that in fiscal \u201820. But I would say, overall, we're pleased.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Just a quick comment about client retention levels and any changes year-over-year and my second question is the pricing for new accounts, has that seen any upward movement in recent years?","Paul Adler","Andrew, it\u2019s Paul. In terms of retention, I would say that really no significant change in our business. It's been roughly about 95% and that's still where it was last fiscal year, and that's where we still expect it to be. Of course, we're always working on improving that and there are opportunities, but I would say nothing significant to note. In terms of pricing, I've been doing a lot of businesses for new accounts. ","Mike Hansen","Andrew, it's a pretty competitive environment still out there. And I'll give you an example. When we're out there selling work wear, for example, our customers have lots of options and, and so there is a retail option, where we're seeing billions of dollars being spent at retail, large retailers, we're seeing direct sale options where those competitors can design and manage programs and we're seeing the rental option as well. So our customers have alternatives and options. And so we have to continue to innovate and create good garments and other products, we've got to be able to articulate the value of what we do versus a retail environment versus a direct sale program. And we've got to follow through on that great service. So the point Andrew is, our customers still have lots of options. The competition is certainly out there, and is available to them and we've got to make sure that we are providing the right value. And so all of that competition keeps, it's a bit of a governor on what we can do with pricing. And so while we are looking for the best price and we sell profitable new business, there certainly is competition that keeps that pricing in a bit of a tighter range.","Operator","Next, our question will come from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber","I wanted to ask about the big share buyback in the fourth quarter. In your prepared remarks, you kind of listed share buyback as I think, third or fourth in your pecking order. So, I mean, is this just a function of you couldn't find acquisitions that you liked or valuations just stretched above what you're willing to pay or can you just sort of characterize why the buyback was so strong in the fourth quarter relative to kind of your pecking order? Thanks.","Mike Hansen","Sure, our pecking order is just as we said, and we are certainly looking for opportunities, but I'll tell you, Seth, our cash flow was really good. In the fourth quarter, our cash flow from operations was just under $400 million. In the third quarter, it was $325 million. So $725 million in the second half of the year. So cash flow has been really good. And, look, we like to put that to work. We would love to be, we have continued to invest in the business. We would love to find acquisitions. We are aggressively working on those, but we can do the buyback that we just did in the fourth quarter and still do execute on a large acquisition if it became available. So it's a little bit opportunistic. We like the momentum in the business, the average of those, the average buyback was something in the way of just under $220 million for the fourth quarter. And based on where our stock sits today, it feels like a pretty good move for us. So I think it's opportunistic, we\u2019ll continue to look at it this way. But we certainly love investing in the business and we love to make acquisitions as well.","Seth Weber","And then just maybe just to comment on the SG&A in the fourth quarter was kind of flattish year to year, you did mention some extraordinary costs, so I think, that offset the lower labor. So, how are you thinking about SG&A as a percentage of revenue for next year? Should you see some leverage there? Should it go down as a percentage of revenue?","Mike Hansen","We certainly do. If you think about the fourth quarter, one of the call outs that Paul made was our stock compensation expense. Our stock continues to perform very, very well and we love that. But it does result in greater stock comp expense, it was higher by about 30 basis points than last year. When we have a good stock performance, we generally will also get a lot of stock option exercises, which we had in the fourth quarter, which was why our tax rate was a little lower than guided. And when we have those exercises, because they are non-qualified stock options, there is an employer portion of payroll tax. And so when you combine those things, it's a little bit of a headwind. We don't mind it because of the stock performance, but it was there. For the year, our SG&A was down 30 basis points, and we certainly do expect to get leverage in fiscal \u201820 and beyond. That doesn't mean it's going to happen every quarter, but certainly over the course of the year, we expect it.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","I have three, but a couple might be quick and easy. First one, the way you guys have sized the synergies, it's been more in a time period of achievement than it has been, any change to the absolute level. And you said obviously, the route optimization is the last big piece that isn't going to be super impactful. So I guess the question I'm getting at is, is there potential upside to the 130, 140, once we get out a year from now, or is this probably going to be it for the way you guys discuss it?","Mike Hansen","Well, two things. First of all, the upside, I've mentioned a few times in the past, we think is coming, will come from our sourcing environment, as we kind of combine the G&K spend, legacy G&K spend and our spend. We have seen some of that heavy lifting that is rolling into our P&L and will continue to do so in fiscal \u201821. And we look for continued opportunities and benefits there. So if it gets above the 135, that I mentioned earlier, and we generally expect that it will, it'll likely be in that service, I'm sorry, in that supply chain area. ","I'll say this though, Scott. It gets harder as -- the farther we get from the acquisition date, it gets harder and harder to specifically say whether it's a synergy or just more efficiency in the business. And so our expectation is after fiscal \u201820, we won't be talking about that quite as much and we'll be moving forward with looking for all different kinds of efficiencies in the business.","Scott Schneeberger","The next question is just on CapEx, looks like an increase of about 1% to about 12% at the high end of the range year over year. I was just curious what would be the swing factors of the 1% versus a 12% over the coming year on a year over year basis?","Mike Hansen","I'm a little confused by what you mean by 1% to 12%.","Scott Schneeberger","Just comparing the spend \u2013 for the guide of fiscal \u201820 versus fiscal \u201819, assuming my numbers are right.","Mike Hansen","So the guide of 280 to 310, you're saying it's a, you're saying a 12% increase over our CapEx for fiscal \u201819?","Scott Schneeberger","Yeah, that's correct. At the high end, it's 1% at the low end\u2026","Mike Hansen","Yeah, I'm sorry. Sorry, it took me a bit to understand that. Look, we're growing, we're growing nicely. And we've, as you know, we consolidated quite a few G&K locations into Cintas locations, but there still are capacity needs, particularly in those markets that didn't have a G&K operation in them. And so we do have capacity needs as we continue to grow, and I would expect that that would, that that fact would continue, if we continue to grow the way we're growing. And so we're going to probably have a little bit of an uptick this fiscal \u201920, just simply because we are continuing to grow and add more plants than probably we have in the last few years because of the consolidation efforts.","Scott Schneeberger","And that third question that I wanted to get in with was on the fourth quarter call and in years past, you've shared a little bit of information with regard to uniform segment revenue mix. I'm not anticipating much of a change, but is that something you're open to sharing this year?","Paul Adler","Yeah, Scott. I have that and you're right, not much of a change. Uniform rental, and as you mentioned, this is measured as a percentage of the uniform rental and facility services segment and it\u2019s Q4 data. So uniform rental, 50% of the mix. Dust control came in at 18%; hygiene is 14%, shop towels at 5%, linen 9% and then catalog was about 4%.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And next we'll go to Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird.","Justin Hauke","I guess the one question that I had here just on the balance sheet, and, kudos for getting the leverage down to where you're looking to hold it at two times. But I'm curious on the upside, in the cycle where we are today, how much leverage would you be willing to tolerate to the extent that there were opportunities, whether an ancillary business or your current business, maybe there were more material acquisitions that would be out there. How much leverage would you be willing to put on the balance sheet here?","Mike Hansen","Well, I'll start with, we currently have a covenant that limits us to 3.5 now. We've got a great banking group and if we had an acquisition that forced us to go above 3.5, then we would look at it in a couple of different ways. First, does it create the long term value that would warrant that kind of leveraging? And secondly, given then the combined cash flow, would we be able to reduce that fairly quickly like we did with the G&NK, after the G&K deal closed? We would look at it from those two standpoints. So I think it just depends on the value and the long term value creation. But we'd certainly, if we felt like it was a great opportunity, we certainly would evaluate that.","Operator","Our next question will come from Dan Dolev with Nomura.","Dan Dolev","So on uniform rental organic growth, I can't believe I'm complaining here, because 6.8 is truly an amazing number. But, comparison was about 120 basis points easier. I mean, what can get us upside to that number in fiscal \u201820? Is it productivity, is it up selling like, when can get to that heydays of the 8% organic growth? What needs to happen for that thing?","Mike Hansen","Well, we would certainly need a very good macro and we like the macro today. But we would need a good macro. We need to be firing on all cylinders in terms of our sales productivity and with some good and innovative products and services. And, we've got to be really on our game to sell into our current existing customers.","Dan, the last four years, our organic growth has been right in this range where we came in this fourth quarter, and we talked about a few times in the past, we like this pace. It allows us to manage the growth in sales reps, the growth in route capacity, the growth in production capacity, and so we do like the pace and we think that we can get some pretty good margin improvement when we're at this kind of pace, we can manage the business very well. And we like it, the last four years, we've been -- our organic growth in total has been 6.8, 6.7, 7.1, 6.5 and obviously, the 6.5 included the first quarter, where we were bottoming out in terms of the post G&K. That's right where we want to be, that 6.8 and our guidance for next year is pretty darn close to that. So that's the pace we like, Dan.","Dan Dolev","And then just a quick follow up on the productivity just to be clear. I think last quarter, you said that sales productivity was good, but if I can quote, not as good as it was in the second quarter, is there an update to that one in terms of how it trended in the fourth quarter?","Mike Hansen","Yes, Dan, you are correct. We were making great progress on sales rep productivity, kind of coming out of the G&K acquisition in terms of filling the sales roles and getting everybody trained and up to speed and then also getting the systems converted, which was necessary for those G&K reps to sell the Cintas product line. You'll recall, we\u2019re making nice improvement through Q2 and then last quarter in Q3 with some weather impacts, we noted that the productivity dipped, but in Q4, it did bounce back very nicely, even stronger than it was in Q2.","Operator","Our next question will come from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.","Tim Mulrooney","A couple of quick ones here. First of all, if I go back to the fourth quarter, and I look at uniform rental segment gross margin expansion of 100 basis points year-over-year and that's a very solid result. Can you just walk us through the primary factors driving that expansion outside of the lower energy costs?","Mike Hansen","Yeah, we certainly got some good leverage from the revenue growth. We had some nice synergy capture. Energy, as you said, helped a little bit and we're selling profitable business. And so a lot of things went well in the quarter from a pricing perspective, probably a little bit better in the fourth quarter incrementally than in previous quarters, the pricing while still competitive, as I talked about, with Andrew\u2019s question, probably just a little bit, incrementally more positive. And that certainly helps the margin as well. So all in all, great synergy, great leveraging, selling good profitable business and a little bit of energy help, all put together for a pretty good quarter.","If I could add that this -- the rental gross margin for the year was up 170 basis points from our fiscal \u201916, which was the year before the G&K deal. So if you think about adding a legacy G&K business with a gross margin of about 37.5% to now today that full rental gross \u2013 full your rental gross margin of 45.5, we've made some great progress in the last few years and our partners have worked so hard in integrating this acquisition. We bought a very good business and our new partners have done a great job, our existing partners have as well. And it really shows in this fiscal \u201819 year with some really good margins, especially in that gross margin area.","Tim Mulrooney","Yeah. I think everybody in the investment community would agree with that statement. It\u2019s been very impressive. If I could move on, how much do you have remaining on your buyback, Mike, and does your guidance assume -- what does your guidance assume with respect to share repurchase?","Mike Hansen","We have 263 million on the billion that was authorized last fall. And the guidance assumes no additional share buybacks.","Tim Mulrooney","No additional share buybacks, okay. And lastly from me, any quantifiable impact from weather in the quarter. I mean, we had more rainfall across the US this quarter, but I'm not sure if that has the same level of impact that the cold weather had last quarter.","Mike Hansen","Not nearly the same widespread impact. So nothing worth calling out.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today and I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike Hansen for any additional or closing remarks.","Mike Hansen","Well, thank you again for joining us tonight. We will issue our first quarter financial results in September and we look forward to speaking with you again at that time.","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation."],"5439":["Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call September 29, 2014  5:00 PM ET","","Executives","","Bill Gale - SVP of Finance and CFO","Mike Hansen - VP and Treasurer","","Analysts","John Healy - Northcoast Research","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Andy Whitman - Robert W.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Bill Gale","Thank you for joining us this evening. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas\u2019s Vice President and Treasurer. After our commentary we will be happy to answer questions. Let me remind you that the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company\u2019s current views as to future events and financial performance. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1.102 billion. Organic revenue growth which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions and the Shred-it Transaction was 7.2% for the first quarter. This was a nice acceleration from the 6.2% organic growth in our fourth quarter ended May 31st, led by a rental organic growth of 8.1% and our first aid safety and fire protection services organic growth rate up 10.1%.","Our sales force performance in both businesses was strong and the pricing environment in the first quarter improved from our previous quarter. We were a little disappointed with the negative 2.2% organic growth change in our uniform direct sale revenue as we have a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue decline. While much of the declines in the last three quarters relates to large national account roll-outs occurring last year and not repeating this year, we have seen some softness in our Fortune 1000 national accounts as well.","As we noted in today\u2019s press release, our first quarter income statement was affected by a few items that are not representative of our ongoing operational performance. First, as we indicated in our July earnings call, we had a $13.6 million gain net of tax on the sale of stock in an equity method investment during this year\u2019s first quarter.","Second, our fiscal \u201815 first quarter income from continuing operations did not include any document management services operating segment results. Mike will provide more details about the accounting for document management and its impact on the first quarter and the remainder of this fiscal \u201815 year.","Third, we recorded an additional $4.1 million gain, net of tax, during this year\u2019s first quarter, due to receiving additional proceeds related to the Shred-it Transaction. We have identified these items separately in today\u2019s press release, so I will speak to the results as adjusted for those items. Our first quarter gross margin was $477.9 million or $43.4% of first quarter revenue.","As Scott Farmer said in today\u2019s press release, the gross margin improved in each of our businesses. In fact, the first quarter\u2019s gross margin of 43.4% was the highest as a percent of revenue since fiscal 2006. We continue to operate our businesses very efficiently and are taking advantage of existing capacity in our infrastructure. First quarter operating income was $163.5 million or 14.8% of first quarter revenue.","We\u2019re very pleased with this improvement over last fiscal year\u2019s first quarter adjusted operating income as a percent of revenue of 13.4%. First quarter net income and earnings per diluted share as adjusted also improved nicely compared to last fiscal year\u2019s first quarter amount as adjusted. First quarter net income as adjusted was $92.4 million, which was 8.4% of revenue and grew by almost 21% over last year\u2019s first quarter.","This fiscal year\u2019s first quarter earnings per diluted share as adjusted was $0.78, which grew over 25% compared to last fiscal year\u2019s first quarter figure as adjusted of $0.62. We are very pleased with the start to this fiscal year and thank our employees who we call partners for their hard work and dedication.","I will turn the call over to Mike for more details on the first quarter performance and the impact of the Document Management Business. And then, I will provide a few comments on our updated fiscal 2015 guidance.","Mike Hansen","Thanks, Bill and good evening. I\u2019ll start with a few comments on Document Management. We indicated in today\u2019s press release that we have changed our accounting classification of the document storage and imaging business to discontinued operations. We\u2019re evaluating strategic opportunities for this business, and we\u2019ll provide more details as appropriate. The classification of this business as discontinued operations means under U.S. generally accepted accounted principles that we must condense all income statement impact from the business into one line on the income statement for all periods presented. As a result, we will no longer show any documents storage and imaging revenue, gross margin or operating income in either this year\u2019s or last year\u2019s income statement. Instead, the entire results in both years are condensed into one line item on the income statement, entitled income from discounted operations net of tax.","Let\u2019s switch to Document Shredding. Because we continue to have an ownership in the Document Shredding business through our partnership with Shred-it, U.S. GAAP says we really haven\u2019t exited the business. As a result we will continue to include document shredding results in last fiscal year\u2019s income statement; however, beginning with this first quarter of fiscal \u201815, we will no longer report any document shredding revenue, gross margin, or operating income. Instead, we will simply show our share of the partnership income in our corporate operating segment. During the first quarter of fiscal \u201915, there was no impact from the partnership.","From a modeling perspective, the end result of these changes in document management accounting means that we will have no document management operating segment results going forward.","The easiest way to model the comparison of fiscal \u201815 results to last year will be to exclude the entire document management operating segment results from last year.","So, as a result of the changes I just discussed, we now have three reportable operating segments. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, and First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid Safety and Fire Protection Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of our income statement.","Before moving into the first quarter results, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in this year\u2019s first quarter which is the same as last year\u2019s first quarter. Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal \u201915, we will have 65 workdays in each quarter for a total of 260 workdays for the fiscal year. These workday figures for fiscal \u201915 are the exact same as in fiscal \u201814, so we will have no workday differences or adjustments for the remainder of this fiscal year.","The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $857 million, which is up 8.1% compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. Organic growth was also 8.1%. Growth of roughly one-half of 1% was due to a contractual buyout caused by a change in government regulation that forced a customer to close one of its operations.","As Bill mentioned the performance of our sales team continued to be strong and first quarter new business was better than last year. In addition, the pricing environment improved relative to the fourth quarter and last year\u2019s first quarter. We still have not seen much impact from net add-stops which were down slightly compared to last year\u2019s first quarter.","Our Rental segment gross margin was 45.1% for the first quarter, an increase from 42.6% in last year\u2019s first quarter. As bill mentioned, we\u2019ve continued to leverage our infrastructure and are operating very efficiently. In addition, we continue to sell products and services that do not require additional processing capacity such as our hygiene products and services and our chemical dispensing services. Lastly the more favorable pricing environment help drive incremental margins as well.","Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the first quarter was $105 million, which was 2.2% lower than last year\u2019s first quarter. As Bill indicated earlier, lower sales to our Fortune 1000 national accounts has been the driver of the revenue decline.","Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 29% for the first quarter, an improvement over last year\u2019s first quarter gross margin of 27.7%, while our revenue was lower than last year\u2019s first quarter. Our sales mix was more weighted towards our higher margin hospitality business.","Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the first quarter was $140 million, which is 11.3% higher than last year\u2019s first quarter. Organic growth was 10.1%. This businesses sales team continued to perform well and our national account business continues to thrive. This segment\u2019s gross margin was 43.7% in the first quarter which is fairly consistent with last year\u2019s first quarter of 43.6%.","Switching to selling and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.5% as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter compared to a total company SG&A in last year\u2019s first quarter of 28.8%. When excluding the impact of the document shredding had on last year\u2019s first quarter SG&A and revenue, last year\u2019s adjusted total company SG&A was 27.8% as a percentage of the adjusted revenue.","The increase in SG&A as a percent of revenue from last year\u2019s adjusted 27.8% to this year\u2019s 28.5% is due to two items. First our worker\u2019s comp and auto insurance related costs were higher in this year\u2019s first quarter compared to last year. Second as we mentioned in our earnings call in July the contribution of the document shredding business to the Shred-it partnership leaves less revenue to cover our SG&A structure.","Specifically certain corporate G&A expenses such as the operation of our corporate headquarters must now be allocated to our remaining three operating segments instead of the four operating segments that we had last year. We expect this headwind to continue for the remainder of this fiscal year.","Our effective tax rate was 37.4% for the quarter, compared to 37.2% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve bills and releases related to specific discrete items. We expect fiscal \u201815 effective rate to be 37.3%.","Turning now to the balance sheet, as a result of the classification of the document storage and imaging business had discontinued operations. Our August 31st balance sheet now shows all assets associated with that business in one-line item entitled assets held for sale. The balance in this line item at August 31st was $151 million. There is also a line item entitled liabilities held for sale, which incorporates certain liabilities associated specifically to the documents storage and imaging business at August 31st. The balance in outline item at August 31st was $15 million.","Our cash and cash equivalents were $581 million at August 31st, an increase of $68 million from the $513 million at May 31st, mainly due to strong operating cash flow. Accounts receivables decreased by $19 million since May 31st due to improved collection performance and the reclassification of documents, storage and imaging related AR to assets held for sales.","New goods inventory and in service inventory levels at August 31st were $250 million and $514 million respectively. These balances are relatively consistent with the balances at May 31st.","Accrued compensation and related liabilities at August 31st decreased by $41 million from the May 31st balance mainly due to the payment of fiscal year \u201814 bonuses and commissions. Long-term debt remained at $1.3 billion representing roughly 1.7 times EBITDA and finally CapEx for the first quarter was about $68 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows. $61 million in Rental including roughly $25 million related to the SAP project, $2 million in Uniformed Direct Sales, and $5 million in First Aid Safety and Fire Protection. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $275 million to $325 million.","I will not turn the call back to Bill for comments on our updated fiscal 2015 guidance.","Bill Gale","Thank you, Mike. We\u2019re updating our fiscal 2015 revenue guidance to be in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.475 billion. This revenue guidance has changed from our initial guidance provided in July to reflect the elimination of document storage and imaging revenue due to its classification as discontinued operations. This updated guidance also reflects our first quarter revenue performance and our thoughts on the U.S. economic environment for the remainder of our fiscal 2015 year.","As Scott Farmer indicated in our press release earlier today, we believe the U.S. economy remains inconsistent and we believe recent global events increase the unpredictability of the environment. We are also updating our fiscal 2015 earnings per diluted share guidance to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.29. This guidance reflects a number of items.","First we have eliminated the benefits from the documents storage and imaging business. Second, we have incorporated the additional $0.04 Shred-it Transaction gain. Third, this updated guidance continues to assume no benefit from the Shred-it partnership but does reflect the first quarter $0.11 gain on the sale of stock in an equity method investment which was also in the initial guidance provided in July.","Lastly the updated guidance reflects the first quarter performance and also our thoughts on the U.S. economic environment.","This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now be glad to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And we\u2019ll take our first question from John Healy with Northcoast Research.","John Healy - Northcoast Research","","Bill, I had this question come in to me. I just was hoping to get a little bit more color on the guidance. If I think about the moving parts, the $0.11 item was already in the guidance and you kind of called out the $0.04 gain. So if I back that out, the guidance looks like it\u2019s moving up by about $0.10. How should we think about that $0.10 from a contribution standpoint in terms of how does your view on the economy change and the other item I thought that would be contributing to it would be, how do we think about the movements of document storage now that it\u2019s in discontinued ops, if that\u2019s a net positive or how that impacted the guidance?","Bill Gale","Well, the document storage and imaging business did have a minor contribution to our initial guidance, it was about $0.03. So, basically you are backing that out. I think you accounted for the $0.04 special gain in the first quarter due to the Shred-it Transaction, but you are correct that we are increasing guidance on the rental first aid business and our direct sale business basically. Primarily, as the result of the first quarter results, which were better than we originally expected, and while we expect the rest of the year to be good, we don\u2019t expect it to be as robust as we saw in the first quarter.","Again, it could be a bit conservative on our part, but there has been ongoing inconsistency in the jobs reports. We still are seeing a reluctance in the part of many of our customers to expand our operations, to add employees. As Mike indicated, there was very little, there was no help from add-stops in the quarter, basically it continues to be from new business and then again as he said, a better pricing environment.","So, I guess in summary what we are saying is yes increased guidance from continuing operations but probably not at the same rate that you saw in the first quarter.","John Healy - Northcoast Research","And I wanted to ask, when I was taking the notes from your initial comments, it sounded like you guys were at the margin I would say talking positively about the pricing environment. I feel like it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve heard anything like that on the Uniform Rental Costs. So I was hoping if you could talk to kind of what you are seeing on that side of things? Maybe what\u2019s driving it? Is it a cost push in the business or is it more disciplined from industry competitors or just some more color that you are seeing there?","Bill Gale","Well I went back and looked at some of our releases last year and our calls. And I think we did indicate that pricing environment was beginning to improve even in fiscal \u201814. And I think what happened in this first quarter is we saw continued improvement. I think part of it is driven by probably a better education on our part for our service providers and sales people to go to our customers and explain that we\u2019ve had the cost increases over the last several years and have not really been able to pass those on to the extent that we feel justified that we should be able to.","So I don\u2019t want to create a belief that we just have really skyrocketed prices, we haven\u2019t, but we certainly have been able to get more of a price increase than we have since the end of the recession.","John Healy - Northcoast Research","","And then just final question from me on the discounted ops. Any thought in terms of when we might see that kind of realistically come to a close? Is it a quarter out or two quarters out, how should we think about that?","Bill Gale","John, I really can\u2019t answer that question right now. There\u2019s a lot of things going on. So it would be premature for me to speculate on a specific timeframe.","Operator","","And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Unidentified Analyst ","","Hi this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I was hoping you could talk maybe about the specific industry verticals. I know you said that the recovery has been inconsistent. But I was wondering if maybe you could talk to specific verticals that you\u2019ve seen some strength in recently?","Mike Hansen","Well, as it relates to our performance Greg, it\u2019s been relatively broad revenue growth for us. Our new business still comes from customers of all different types. We\u2019ve been able to sell additional products and services into existing customers of all types. And so, I would say that it\u2019s been a fairly broad revenue growth stream for us.","As we look at the job performance, even in this first quarter as well as the entire calendar year, we\u2019ve generally seen a bit of narrow employment improvement, and about a third coming -- about a third of the employment growth coming from some verticals that don\u2019t help our businesses, particularly uniform rental much and that being professional services, fast-food service, temps, education. But having said that, we\u2019ve been able to continue to sell to many different verticals both in new business and in penetrating with additional products and services.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, fair enough. And then maybe on the M&A pipeline. How active has that been and do you expect to ramp-up post some of these document management transactions?","Bill Gale","Well, we\u2019ve have been -- we\u2019ve remained active Greg, in the M&A area throughout the last couple of years. And as I have indicated in the past, it\u2019s not for lack of effort on our part, it\u2019s for the appropriate valuation that we feel an acquisition would make sense for our shareholders. So, at this point, we are still very much wanting to do some big acquisitions, and we are continuing to work diligently for those. But there is nothing at this point that has come to fruition, primarily because of valuation expectations.","Operator","Next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Daniel again for Scott. Can you address some of the margin enhancing initiatives you are doing this year that can provide potential upside to your current outlook?","Bill Gale","Well, I think the first quarter was reflective of a lot of things we\u2019ve already been able to implement. It\u2019s greater utilization of our plans and our routes. It\u2019s more selling of products and services that do not require the processing through our laundry facilities, things like chemical dispending and hygiene services et cetera. I think it also is just an attitude on the part of the company to continue to drive excess cloths out of the business and work toward improving the margins back to the levels that we had achieved prior to the recession. We had stable energy cost, so we didn\u2019t have to deal with that this quarter. Better utilization of our stockrooms for our Uniform business.","So, I think it\u2019s just a number of different things. As far as looking out for the rest of the year, I think you as look at our guidance what we\u2019re saying is we would probably anticipate maintaining margins at relatively the same levels that we achieved in the first quarter. As far as any significant upside potential, I doubt if that is really available. I\u2019d say it\u2019s more maintaining what we\u2019ve achieved.","Operator","Next question comes from George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Please go head.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Good afternoon. Can you discuss how add\/stop performance in the quarter compared versus your expectations and what your views are for add\/stop performance next quarter?","Bill Gale","Well, we talked to last quarter that net add\/stops were slightly better than the previous year. In this first quarter, they were slightly lower than last year. And so we really haven\u2019t seen much of a trend. We\u2019ve continued to kind of bump along with net add\/stops. We haven\u2019t seen any change in that performance or any discernable trends in September either. And so, we are expecting that we\u2019ll just kind of continue to bump along relatively and consistently in net add\/stops, and don\u2019t anticipate that our customers will start hiring at any rapid pace anytime soon.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Got it. And your updated guidance does that incorporate improvements and add\/stop performance?","Bill Gale","Not really. It pretty much just reflects kind of a status quo where we don\u2019t really see any improvement over prior years in add\/stops but we\u2019ll continued new business, which is basically new customers and increased penetration of different products and services. And then hopefully a reasonable pricing environment continuing as we saw in the first quarter.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","That\u2019s very helpful. And as you look at margin performance, how would you segment out contribution from pricing versus greater route and planned utilization versus the say cost savings initiatives?","Bill Gale","I really don\u2019t have a way of doing that very easily George and probably wouldn\u2019t be able to disclose that even if I had it because of competitive things. But I would say all of them are contributing factors. And it\u2019s, basically you\u2019ve got all different sorts of initiatives going on from different levels of capital investments, from efficiencies. Obviously the pricing helps. So, it\u2019s just very difficult for me to be able to split that kind of stuff out.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Got it. And last question, this is a longer-term strategic question. But with respect to margins, how do you think about the path to peak margins in terms of just how long it takes to get there and whether your success in pushing through pricing, whether that means you can break above prior peak margins?","Bill Gale","I am not sure I would commit to breaking above prior peak margins. I\u2019d love to be able to get back to those margins in the future. And I think we\u2019re making very good progress towards that regard. But keep in mind, the cost of doing business today is more than what it cost back in 2005 and \u201906, we hit those margins. So, we are attempting to get back there, but to exceed it would be pretty difficult thing to do, I think.","Operator","We have Andy Whitman, Robert W. Baird.","Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird","Hey, guys good afternoon. Bill, I don\u2019t want to make two side of a point on it, but you made a comment that the margins that you put up here in the first quarter might kind of continue through the balance of the year. Are you referring to the year-over-year growth in margins on the operating line, which really the 140 basis points on the clean basis or you\u2019re saying the absolute level or is that referenced to the gross margins? Maybe just a little, again not trying the two side of a point, but I want to understand what you meant by that.","Bill Gale","Well, sorry for the confusion Andy. What I was saying the absolute level of the margins should be relative, I would hope, would be relatively to close what we achieved in the first quarter.","Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird","Okay, great. And then just on the revenue line you kind of gave us some help about the document storage business, in fact $0.03, you talked about. On the top line, what was your forecast for what that business can do? We were modeling somewhere around $80 million, maybe $90 million, is that about right?","Bill Gale","Absolutely right.","Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird","So then really you do have a slight raise than on the revenue line, if you kind of adjust for that as well. Just a little bit, but a little bit of on the revenue line.","Bill Gale","You are correct.","Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird","Okay. And then just as it relates to the government contract you highlighted, you said that half of percentage point Mike. Should we see that basically as kind of a one-time benefit? So, you can make the argument that the segment growth of 8.1, because really the 7.6, still very good but not quite 8.1?","Mike Hansen","That\u2019s right Andy, but it\u2019s not a government contract. It is a customer. It was a commercial customer who, because of a government regulation, was forced to close down some of their operations and therefore they bought out of their contract. So it was not to having to do with the government so we\u2019ll get sure clarify that.","Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird","No, that\u2019s helpful. And then just as it relates to the asset for sale for the storage business, it\u2019s on the balance sheet like you noted for 151. I guess when you move things to discontinued operations and assets for sale, you have to at least to evaluation test there. I guess I think is it true that you would, if it would have been less than the 150, you would have market-to-market that what you thought it was. So, can we assume that the 151 would be a minimum for what you get for it?","Mike Hansen","Well, you are absolutely right. We have an obligation to impair it if it were not going to get that value. So, this is all subjective. But our expectation is that those were fair values that are on the balance sheet.","Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird","To call it asset for sale or to put in discontinued, do you need a letter of intent or something more formal or is it really just a subjective decision or just using this as maybe a way for investors to gauge where you might be along in that process?","Bill Gale","It\u2019s a very complex set of analysis that one must go through, and we decided to be conservative. And basically classify it that way since we believe that within the next months we won\u2019t necessarily be operating those as we are today, they\u2019ll be part of a joint venture or they\u2019ll be sold to another party.","Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird","And then can you just afford maybe one last question, I wanted to ask about the ancillary services and the rental segment. And I\u2019ve asked this one plenty of times before. But maybe Mike can you talk about the relative growth rates of the ancillary services versus what you consider core uniform rental? And maybe just as it relates to the longer-term trend, you\u2019ve always talked about how the number of services that you can offer customer increases your retention. But how has that number of services and products that you\u2019ve been offering tracked? Can you give us some sense about how that\u2019s improved over the last couple of years, if it\u2019s improved?","Mike Hansen","Okay, regarding your first question about the growth of the different products and services. We have seen very good growth in our uniform rental business, and we have seen growth in our ancillary products and services. So, the mat rental, the hygiene products and service, which is made-up of air fresheners and soaps and towel dispensers and the chemical dispensing. All are growing quite nicely. We won\u2019t get into the specific level of growth on any of them, but they are all growing quite nicely. And we continue to improve the amounts of products and services at our existing customers.","We still believe we have a long way and a long great opportunity continue adding those. But certainly they have gotten better, in terms of the penetration amounts, have gotten better in the last few years. That doesn\u2019t give you any specific numbers. But we don\u2019t really get into the specifics of any of those. But I can tell you that directionally we\u2019re doing very well.","Operator","We\u2019ll move to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","I just wanted to focus on the revenues guidance of 4.9% to 6.7%. I assume very little of that has acquisition, past acquisition, baked in to just like the first quarter had only 20 basis point differential. And so my question is assuming that point is right and we get over 7% growth in the first quarter, is there anything other than a conservative view on the economy that suggest more like a mid-single digit like a 5% growth for the balance of the year to kind of get into the 4.9% to 6.7% range with the same percent start?","Bill Gale","Your assumption first, and yes there is no real acquisition growth going forward other than what you just saw.","Mike Hansen","And Andrew, I would say that is a pretty good summation of our view for the rest of the year, and that\u2019s what reflected in the guidance. Yes, again, we are being somewhat conservative, driven by enlarge by what we continue to see this inconsistency, and then all the different activity going around the world that seems to impact people\u2019s thinking on business. So, obviously, if we can achieve similar results in the rest of the year that we saw in the first quarter, we\u2019ll be at the upper end if not exceed that guidance. So obviously, if it goes the other way, we\u2019ll be down the lower-end.","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","And could you just mention how much storage -- document storage revenues were in the previous guide, I mean what was taken out of the guide and put into discontinued ops for 2015?","Bill Gale","Maybe for $85 million, last year\u2019s storage revenue was $82 million. And so it\u2019s roughly that same amount.","Operator","We\u2019ll move to Greg Halter with Great Lakes Review.","Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review","Based on the cash flow statement, there appears to be about 61.4 million in the repurchase of common stock. I just was curious as to the timing of that and the number of shares.","Mike Hansen","Well, 700 and some thousand shares were the result of the share purchase program that we reported to you in July. That was kind of the combination of the 4.2 million shares we bought beginning in our fourth quarter. Then the remainder of that was due to the fact when we have restricted stock that that\u2019s with our partners. There is a tax obligation as a considered ordinary income. And so what we do is we basically sell enough of a share that they invest and to pay for the payroll taxes.","Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review","Okay, so there really wasn\u2019t anything new in this fiscal quarter?","Mike Hansen","No.","Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review","Okay and probably 10 years ago I was in one year plans for Investor Day or something like that, and there was great discussion and potential around RFID. And just wonder if anything has occurred in that regard in terms of making that a viable solution in some of the plans?","Mike Hansen","It really has not. We continue to experiment with it, but it has not really proven to be beneficial yet. And we are certainly trying it but it\u2019s nothing we\u2019ve been able to rollout.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we next move to Dan Dolev with Jefferies.","Dan Dolev - Jefferies","Just really a macro question, Bill, I am just thinking about your comments today and compare them to your comments the last, maybe quarter or two. Am I misreading it or you incrementally more bearish on the U.S. economy or is it just over-interpreting you analysis or is it everything the same really?","Bill Gale","I think it\u2019s the same. I don\u2019t think my view, our view I shouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s my view, our views have really changed from the way we felt the last couple of quarters. We were obviously pleased with the first quarter results, better than what we initially expected. But has that given us confidence that that will continue, not yet. And we\u2019d love to be able to continue to surprise everybody on the upside, but I just not confident enough to give you that comfort.","Dan Dolev - Jefferies","No, that\u2019s help. I thought I sense something, but I guess I was over interpreting. I appreciate it.","Mike Hansen","Thank you all very much for joining us and being interested in the results. And at this point, we would expect to issue our second quarter results some time before the Christmas holiday in mid to late December. So, until then, thank you again.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great rest of your day."],"5435":["Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) Q1 2014 Earnings Call September 19, 2013  5:00 PM ET","Executives","William C.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","William C. Gale","Thank you for joining us this evening as we report our first quarter results for fiscal 2014. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas's Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer questions. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1,120,000,000 which represents growth of 6.6% from last year's first quarter. Our first quarter had one less workday than last year. Adjusting for this workday difference, revenue increased by 8.2% over last year's first quarter. Organic growth, which adjusts for both the impact of acquisitions and the difference in workdays, was 7.1%. As mentioned in today's press release, the organic growth for each of our 4 operating segments exceeded 6%. Mike will give more detail by operating segment in a few minutes.","Our operating income for the first quarter was $140.1 million, which is 12.5% of revenue. This operating margin is 70 basis points lower than last year's first quarter operating margin of 13.2%. On our July earnings call, I indicated that comparisons to last year's first quarter would be difficult due to 3 items. First, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, our first quarter had less workday than last year. This had a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points on this year's operating margin due to a number of our large expenses, including rental material costs, depreciation and amortization, being determined on a monthly basis instead of a workday basis. Secondly, this year's first quarter recycled paper prices were over 20% lower than last year's first quarter recycled paper prices. This resulted in a negative impact to operating margin of 30 basis points compared to last year's first quarter. Finally, we began adding route capacity in the second quarter of last fiscal year, so last year's first quarter had none of the expenses associated with that capacity expansion. All in all, we are pleased with our first quarter operating margin results and a solid start to our fiscal 2014 year.","First quarter net income was $77.8 million, and earnings per diluted share were $0.63. We were active with our share buyback program and purchased a total of 3 million shares of Cintas stock in the first quarter and into September. Since we purchased the shares in the latter part of the first quarter and in September, the buybacks had no impact on our first quarter earnings per share. However, we expect that these buybacks will benefit fiscal year 2014 EPS by about $0.04. We announced in July that our Board of Directors authorized an additional share repurchase program of $500 million. As of today, we have available for future share repurchases $15.4 million under the October 2011 board authorization and $500 million under the July 2013 board authorization.","As Scott Farmer indicated in our press release, much uncertainty remains in the U.S. economy. The employment picture from month to month remains uneven and inconsistent, a reflection of businesses' uncertainty about future investment plans. As a result, we are maintaining our fiscal 2014 revenue expectations to be in the range of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion. We are updating our EPS expectations to include the impact of the buybacks through today so that we now expect fiscal 2014 EPS to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.79.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike for more details on the first quarter.","J. Michael Hansen","Thanks, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 6.6% from the first quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 7.1%. Total company gross margin for the first quarter was 41.6%, which is down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 42.4%. I'll discuss these items in more detail by segment.","Before doing so, let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our first quarter, which is one less than last year. In fiscal '14, we will have 65 workdays in each quarter, for a total of 260 workdays. This creates year-over-year workday differences in each quarter except the second and results in one less workday for the entire fiscal year.","We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement.","The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the first quarter and totaled $792.9 million, which is up 5% compared to last year's first quarter. Adjusting for the one less workday in this year's first quarter, this segment's revenue grew 6.7%. Organic growth was also 6.7%. This was a nice uptick from the 4.8% organic growth rate in the fourth quarter.","National account revenue penetration was strong during the quarter, which enhanced the growth. Additionally, sales rep productivity was strong, and net add-stops showed modest improvement over both last year's first quarter as well as the fourth quarter.","Our Rental segment gross margin was 42.6% for the quarter, down from 43.3% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related costs were 10 basis points higher than last year's first quarter. The remaining decrease compared to last year was due to having one less workday in this year's first quarter and due to the costs associated with adding route capacity last fiscal year beginning in the second quarter. The first quarter gross margin of 42.6% improved from the 42.1% in the fourth quarter, despite having one less workday in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Energy-related costs were 30 basis points lower than the fourth quarter, and we did start to see improved efficiency in our recently added routes.","Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sale revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the first quarter and totaled $107.5 million, which represented growth of 7.2% compared to last year's first quarter. Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 27.7% for the first quarter, down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 29.4% and the fourth quarter gross margin of 30.8%. This decrease is mainly due to a greater mix of national account sales in the first quarter. National account sales generally have a lower gross margin than hospitality accounts.","Our First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection revenue, which accounted for 11% of company revenue in the first quarter, was $125.9 million. This represents an increase of 13.6% over last year's first quarter revenue. Adjusting for one less workday in the first quarter compared to last year, revenue growth was 15.3%. Organic growth was 9.2%. This segment's gross margin was 43.6% in the first quarter, which is up 50 basis points from the 43.1% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related costs were lower by 20 basis points. The remaining improvement is due to better leveraging of the infrastructure, as well as an improved mix of high gross margin sales in the first quarter compared to last year's first quarter. These improvements were partially offset by the one less workday in this year's first quarter. The gross margin of 43.6% is relatively consistent with the fourth quarter gross margin of 43.5%.","Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of first quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue totaled $94.1 million, which is 10.3% higher than last year's first quarter. Adjusting for one less workday in this year's first quarter, revenue increased by 12%. Revenue increased organically by 6.3% compared to last year. Average recycled paper prices remained relatively low at about $125 per ton, which is about $45 per ton lower than last year's first quarter average. Organic growth, excluding recycled paper revenue, was 10%. The first quarter gross margin was 45.9%, which is down from last year's first quarter gross margin of 49.1% and from the fourth quarter gross margin of 46.4%, primarily due to the drop in paper prices. However, we also invested in off-site shredding facilities in the past year to allow additional migration to the more efficient service model of off-site shredding.","Switching to selling and administrative expenses, SG&A was 29.1% as a percent of revenue in the first quarter, which is down slightly from last year's first quarter figure of 29.2%. General and administrative labor was down as we continue to leverage our cost structure. This was somewhat offset by a 20 basis point increase in medical expenses. Our effective tax rate was 37.1% for the quarter, compared to 37.5% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the effective tax rate for the full fiscal 2014 year to be 37.3%.","Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash and marketable securities were $283 million at August 31, down $75 million from the $358 million at May 31. This decrease was primarily due to using $101 million of cash for the share buyback program. Accounts receivable increased $15.6 million since May 31. DSOs were just below 40, which was slightly better than last year's first quarter. New goods inventory and in-service inventory levels at August 31 were $245 million and $500 million, respectively, both up just slightly from May 31 levels. We continue to be pleased with our ability to manage inventory levels appropriately. Accrued compensation and related liabilities at August 31 decreased by $35 million from the May 31 balance, mainly due to payment of fiscal year 2013 bonuses and commissions. Accrued liabilities decreased $37 million compared to May 31, primarily due to payments of accrued bond interest and accrued profit sharing. Long-term debt at August 31 was $1.3 billion. As of August 31, our total debt-to-EBITDA remains slightly below 2x.","CapEx for the first quarter was $37.5 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $22.2 million in Rental; less than $1 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $3.3 million in First Aid, Safety, and Fire Protection; and $11.3 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2014 to be in the range of $240 million to $260 million.","This concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now be glad to answer any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","One just quick housekeeping question. Could you give us your share count at the quarter end and maybe today, given the late nature of the repurchases?","J. Michael Hansen","The share count at the end of the quarter was 120,778,000. And for the year, we're modeling about 122.5 million shares.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right, okay. You saw a nice acceleration in uniform rental. And in your prepared remarks, you mentioned seeing some improvement in national accounts. Could you give us any more color on perhaps what type of national accounts and if you would expect that acceleration to continue?","J. Michael Hansen","Sure. As you know, Sara, we have quite a few facility services offerings, and we saw some real nice penetration into our national accounts in -- particularly, in our cleaning areas, our floor cleaning, our emergency floor cleaning businesses, restroom cleaning. And as far as we'll -- do we expect that to continue, it's a little bit hard to say. But we certainly believe that our national account customers see the value of those products and services. But I would say, it's a little too early to tell whether we'll see that throughout the rest of the year.","Sara Gubins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question. On the fourth quarter call, you mentioned that you'd be adding route capacity during fiscal '14, although not as much as in fiscal '13. Any change to those plans?","J. Michael Hansen","No. We -- I would say, going forward, we'll typically add route capacity as necessary. And we'll generally add some in a -- certainly, in a growing environment. And where our new business remains strong, we'll continue to add routes throughout the year and into the future. I would say, though, it would not be at the pace that we saw beginning in the second quarter of last year. We did have a little bit of a catch-up for some -- from added capacity, so I wouldn't say we'd be at that same pace for the rest of the year.","Operator","And we'll go next to Joe Box with KeyBanc.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a bit of a follow-up on that question, more taking it from the margin angle. How do you think that we should be viewing incremental operating margins over the next couple of quarters? Obviously, they've been subdued as you've deployed more route capacity. Do you think that incremental margins should remain subdued? Or would it be reasonable to assume that they could potentially reaccelerate now that you'll actually be anniversary-ing the capacity expansions?","William C. Gale","Well, Joe, it'll come down to where is the business coming from. As we've said on last several quarters, the more of our growth that comes from new accounts, the less improvement we'll see in margins because we have additional material costs, we -- that tends to fill up the routes a little faster. And therefore, you just don't get the rapid improvement in the margins. If, on the other hand, and we haven't seen this yet, but if on the other hand we were to see a real acceleration of growth of wares in existing accounts, then obviously, that would have a much better impact on the margins themselves. So I can't really tell you that. At this point, we did -- as Mike said, we had a modest improvement in our add-stops, but it wasn't significant. So we're still in a, I would say, a lackluster employment growth environment.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. It looks like your first aid margins were actually the highest first quarter margins that you've had since the downturn. Just curious, is that a function of the benefits of scale? Are you getting a more favorable mix there? If you could just maybe give us any color on what's driving it and maybe how we should think about the upset from current levels.","William C. Gale","I think it's kind of a scale situation. We have been developing our national footprint in the first aid and fire business over the last several years. And the more volume we have in those different markets, those -- some of those markets that are relatively small, the better impact that we have on our margins. I think it also is attributable to some of the initiatives the management team put in place to make sure that, that business was generating the profits that we think are appropriate. And they've done a good job at basically providing additional products and services offerings to their customers that have enhanced the revenue at each of the existing stops. So I think that's been -- that's also been a factor in it.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just one question on the buyback. Over the last few years, when you've been in the market buying stock, you done it in a meaningful way. I realize you obviously don't provide guidance on buybacks, but should we view this as a more one-off opportunistic quarter? Or would you say you're putting more emphasis on the buyback?","William C. Gale","Well, I would say that it is -- we felt confident, given our board's directive, to proceed with the buyback that we did in this quarter, which I think was significant. As far as what we do going forward, it is all dependent on what happens with our other opportunities for uses of cash, our confidence in the future and how the board directs us to proceed with what they feel is the best way to enhance shareholder value.","Operator","And we'll go next to Manav Patnaik with Barclays Capital.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just one, first, quick question. I mean, it seems like you did some acquisitions like this quarter. I know you typically provide the breakout of where you did those in the Q. Could you just give us a flavor of maybe the spread this quarter?","William C. Gale","They were primarily in the Document Management segment. I would say about 2\/3 of it were Document Management and the other 1\/3 -- or the other 30% or so was in our first aid and safety segment.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. That's what I figured. So can you maybe just elaborate a little bit more around the -- just the Document Management side? Obviously, the organic growth there for the last 3 quarters has been in around that 6% mark. Is that a sustainable rate? And what the trends behind that are?","William C. Gale","Well, the Document Management segment continues to provide us with a lot of acquisition opportunities because there are so many businesses doing document management around the country. And now that we have established a pretty decent national footprint, it behooves us to look for other tuck-in acquisitions that we can have in some of these markets in order to improve the profitability. So I think we're going to continue to see opportunities in Document Management going forward because there are just still so many out there. So at this point in time, we are very disciplined on it. We're making sure that they generate the returns we want. But we see this probably will continue for some time.","J. Michael Hansen","And as Bill mentioned just a minute ago how our First Aid, Safety, and Fire segment's gross margin has benefited from the scale of these -- of adding more volumes. So these tuck-ins are quite nice to help the leverage and the gross margin and overall operating margins in those businesses. As they become bigger, we become more efficient.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. So I get that on the acquisition front. I guess I was trying to pin more on the organic side. So is a lot of the organic growth, then, being driven basically from accumulating all these prior acquisitions you guys have done and now finally benefiting from the footprint? Is that what the main driver there is?","William C. Gale","Well, we've had pretty good organic growth, absent the fluctuations in paper prices, for some time in this segment. The benefits you'd get from having more locations available to you gives you opportunities on a national scale to sell a national account. So from that perspective, it does enhance organic growth. But I don't want to leave you with the impression that we couldn't grow organically if we didn't make these acquisitions. We feel very good about that, our ability to do that. But our goal has always been to become a national player in that business.","Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And just one last thing. I mean, in terms of the guidance, obviously, you left the revenue unchanged. So -- and I guess tieing to the earlier question on if the organic growth on the rental side can continue this -- I guess, the 6.7% range. I guess -- I mean, that clearly implies there's probably some deceleration towards the back half. But would you say that's just more caution? Because, like you said, it's a lackluster environment, but there -- if these trends continue, obviously, there would be upside there.","William C. Gale","I think it's a -- I don't want to call it conservative, but we want to factor in all the uncertainty that we still hear out there in the marketplace. I think the Fed's action yesterday gave you some indication of their view of the economy as relatively soft. So I would say, yes, we're being cautious, but I don't think unreasonably so, given all the other things that we continue to see and hear.","J. Michael Hansen","This -- we mentioned that there was a modest improvement in net add-stops. This is not the first time we've seen a nice uptick in net add-stops only to be followed by a downturn. And as we've talked about quite often in the last couple of years, this employment picture is so bumpy and inconsistent that we're certainly hesitant to say that there is momentum.","Operator",".","And we'll go next to Andrew Wittman with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess since we've done some talking about document, I'm going to do one more and just talk about what's going on in that business. Obviously, paper prices have been kind of stubbornly low, I guess, I would say here. It's weighing on the overall profitability of that business, at least to the income statement. Can you talk about reaction in the marketplace on the service levels and the pricing for service levels? Are we starting to see that go up, in other words, to offset these paper price challenges? And just talk about another initiatives that you might have to improve the profitability there outside of paper prices.","William C. Gale","You certainly have seen a, I would say, a stabilization of service pricing because some of these people just were trying to survive on the paper price itself, and they obviously cannot do that with the cost of servicing. So to the extent that there's an upside to lower paper prices, it's more rational service pricing. I think we've got to keep in mind, this paper price is driven by a lot of different factors from currency levels, from foreign demand, et cetera. We're going to see fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. But I think the general trend is that what we saw in the first quarter was probably a low for the year. We expect there to be a more -- a slight increase as we go through the year, more comparable on average to what we saw last fiscal year.","J. Michael Hansen","And Andy, as it relates to your question about improved profitability, one of the comments I had made was that we've invested -- we continue to invest in the business, and we've invested in some offsite shredding facilities, and that allows us to replace the very expensive, large shredding trucks with much smaller box trucks. We use less fuel because of that. We're able to see more customers because we're not shredding on-site. And so we get a lot of leverage and efficiency once we start to fill those off-site shredding facilities up. Today, we've got excess capacity in those shredding facilities because, as we've talked, we've just created a number of those in the last year or so. So we've got, certainly, a plan to create more efficiency and become more profitable in the business.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got you. Can you help us get our arms around that trade-off from on-site to off-site shredding, what the economics look like, maybe the cost of a truck versus building a facility, just to help us understand what that could be?","William C. Gale","I would say, I really don't want to get into details of that because it's -- some of it's kind of a strategic thing on how we're structuring these things and what we're paying for them. So suffice it to say that you can get more volume on a per capital dollar basis through an off-site shredding than you certainly can with an on-site shredding.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Fair enough. Jumping over to the core rental segment, then, can you talk a little bit about customer retention, the sales hiring pace and potentially the amount of new business that you're seeing in the market today?","J. Michael Hansen","Customer retention is -- remains very good. We're at historically pretty high levels, and we feel very good about that customer retention. Sales productivity is very good. New business continues to be the fuel for the growth, and I would say I don't see that necessarily stopping in the next several quarters. We feel very good about the execution in that area. And as far as continued growth in that business, we certainly would love to see some better employment, some add-stops pickup, but we're not ready to certainly say that we've seen a trend from that employment.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. So your sales force is flattish in terms of your headcount there?","J. Michael Hansen","Well, we strategically will look for opportunities to add reps when we can, when it makes sense, if we have capacity that we want to fill up in certain markets, if we have additional prospects that we identify in certain markets. So we're generally adding sales reps as we see opportunities, and that will continue to happen throughout the year. We've not made any significant investments like we did about 3 years ago. But we'll continue to look for opportunities where it makes sense.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Last one for now, was -- can you describe just -- like the characteristic of the new business wins? Is it still roughly 50-50 split between a no-programmer versus a market share gain?","William C. Gale","I would say it's a little bit more no-programmer, probably 60%. We don't measure that every quarter, but the last time we looked at it, of course, in conjunction with the last fiscal year and basically looking, talking to our salespeople anecdotally, that seems to still be the case that it's a little more coming from the no-programmer. Competitive wins, sure, we're still there. We're still getting some competitive wins. But again, the preponderance or the -- let's say, the majority of the new business is no-programmers.","Operator","And we'll go next to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Following up on that last question within rental. You've touched a bit on, obviously, new business, new programmers and then add-stops. Could you talk to pace of lost business? I imagine that, that stabilized nicely and perhaps an improvement for you in the overall picture. And then also taking it a step further into pricing and what type of environment you're seeing out there.","J. Michael Hansen","Retention, like I said, is still pretty strong, and we didn't see any change in trend. It's -- our retention has been pretty good for the last couple years and has gradually improved, but we didn't see any difference or change in trend in the quarter. From a pricing standpoint, it continues to be very aggressive. And particularly, when it comes to a customer renewal, we're still seeing very aggressive competition. And so pricing is competitive. We're in a relatively low inflationary environment. And as it relates to us going to our customers and looking for price increases, it's generally a customer-by-customer conversation, but it's one that's not as easy to do in a low inflationary environment and where there is very competitive prices at renewal time. So it's been a difficult environment for price increases. I wouldn't say that it's changed much from the last several quarters, but it continues to be very competitive.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. On the cost side, obviously, nothing like what you saw 2, 2.5 years ago. Cotton prices starting to swing from down year-over-year to up year-over-year. Could you just address that? It doesn't look like that's going to be a major issue, and you certainly operated well through it last time we saw a spike in those, but could you readdress it? Also, any initiatives with regard to synthetics or any changes?","William C. Gale","Well, the cotton price, what you -- the headlines are the spot prices, and they'll fluctuate just like all these other commodities do on a spot basis based on weather forecast and other things. Our global supply chain group is very cautious on ensuring that they have an adequate supply of low-cost products, and I am not too concerned right now by this recent increase. It's something we'll keep our eye on, but it certainly is nothing that I think is going to cause us any big difficulties going forward.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Great. And just one more last. I noticed last sentence of the press release, discussion about guidance, including the impact of Affordable Care Act. Since the last that we heard from you, any changes in assumptions, expectations, strategy on how you may approach that? Still a lot up in the air, but just curious on an update.","William C. Gale","Yes, I don't think anything has changed from the 2 months ago when we talked about this initially. We put in our guidance and what we talked about our fourth quarter that we expected a 10- to 30-basis-point increase in medical cost due to the Affordable Care Act. I have no reason to say that any different today. I think there's still a lot of uncertainty. A lot of things are still up in the air as to what is going to be put in, how it's going to be put in. So as far as I'm concerned, really nothing has changed in the last couple of months. All I can kind of be confident in saying, it's going to be more expensive than it had been. And I think we have reflected that appropriately in the guidance.","Operator","And we'll go next to Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit kind of around those last couple of questions. But when we talk about retention and we talk about pricing and the ability to bring on some new customers, whether it's a nonprogrammer or in a competitive bid, how important, at this point, is your diversity of services in terms of bringing that immediately to the table as an additional offering and something that maybe not all the other competitors offer? Is that helping you get in the door a little bit faster or winning a little bit more business or creating that additional retention above and beyond what you might have historically seen with maybe just 1 or 2 products?","William C. Gale","Well, certainly, I think it -- and it does, we've proven to ourselves that adding additional products and services to a customer improves the retention of that customer because the more things you do for the customer, the less likely it is you're going to lose that customer. So I don't think there's any question about that. I think the variety of offerings that we have gives us more opportunities for new business for different types of customers. So we don't always lead with Uniform Rental. Depending on what the customers' needs are, we may get in there initially on tile and carpet cleaning or document shredding or first aid and safety. And then, I think, once they begin to know us and see us, then we share with them opportunities of other things we could do for them. So I think the fact that we have so many different things that we do probably gives us a broader spectrum on which to go after new business.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And is that still being identified by route person? Or how is that kind of changing if you're looking at more of a enterprise, what's best for the customer and what's best for Cintas to lead with? How are you able to identify that via the fact that -- I know there's different sales forces within each different segment.","William C. Gale","Well, I think we've stratified our sales force to handle different-sized customers, different business units. So I think that's one way we do it. We have a fairly active marketing group that is constantly working with the sales organization, identifying prospects, identifying opportunities for all of our different service offerings or sale offerings. So it's -- with a sales force as large as we have, with the variety of different businesses we have, we've got a marketing committee for each of the businesses, which works -- meets every, what, 6 weeks, I think, to basically look at ways to penetrate other types of industry segments or other type of customers. So it's just a collaborative effort, Nate, that we're constantly looking for opportunities.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. Yes, I mean -- and that sounds great. It's just, I mean, at the end of the day, I think you're seeing some really nice trends in -- particularly in those other services, as alluded to. I mean, obviously, some decent strength. Part of that is scale and maturity, but part of that is, I feel like, the broader sales effort is probably making a few more inroads than it used to.","William C. Gale","All right. Well, yes, well said. I totally agree with that.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","And then just one last thing. I know you talked about this before, and people have asked you about it before, and I think it's probably still early and there's other macro things that mask this, but I think the more we see -- and every once in a while, we hear about another plant opening in terms of this kind of \"nearshoring\" on the heavy manufacturing-type theme, are you guys seeing any impact at all from that in terms of your somewhat industrial base of customers? Have you won any accounts that kind of feel that, that's been a benefit? And if so, do you think that there's anything to be said for whether that helps in terms of acceleration or not?","William C. Gale","I'm sure there are cases where that's helped. I could not give you any real examples. I -- obviously, if you open a manufacturing plant anywhere in the U.S. that previously had not been there, that's not only going to provide an opportunity for that particular customer, but all of the businesses that serve that new facility. And so I think it's a more gradual-type thing that certainly helps the overall economy continue to grow. So we've seen growth in the economy, albeit modest -- more modest than we all would like, but we've seen growth. We've seen growth in our business, and I think that certainly, that has been a factor to the extent that there's been creations of new businesses within a particular area. Unfortunately, you also have continued closures and reductions of -- or elimination of businesses as we go through there, so we haven't seen this rapid growth, but -- so I think it's there. It's just probably just one element of why we're seeing some modest growth.","Operator","And we'll go next to Sean Kim with RBC Capital Markets.","Sean Sun-Il Kim - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","My first question is regarding CapEx. I think your CapEx was less than $40 million in the quarter, and yet, you're still guiding to $240 million to $260 million for the full fiscal year. So there is -- it seems like it's a pretty -- there's an increase over the rest of the year. And I'm trying to understand, you said the pace of route capacity additions will probably be slower, and yet your CapEx, I think, is going to go up. So I'm trying to understand what's going on there.","William C. Gale","Probably the biggest reason, Sean, is as we talked about the CapEx guidance that we gave in July, which we've retained the same number, we indicated that one of the reasons for the relatively good-sized increase in CapEx and expectations in '14 versus '13 was the fact that we needed to build some new rental capacity, some new plants, and we had some initiatives on our ERP computer system. Those 2 items take a little bit longer to kind of work through the system. Decisions have to be made, we have to find land, we have to contract for the design of the building. So I would say that we would most likely see our CapEx higher as we go through the year under the presumption that we move forward with some of these new plants and with some of the ERP software initiatives that we thought we were going to do back in July. So we continue to evaluate that. As of right now, I have no reason to believe we're not going to do those things, and that's why we've retained the CapEx guidance where it's at.","Sean Sun-Il Kim - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Just one last question. In terms of gross margins in the Rental Uniforms segment, do you think we've sort of hit -- it's gone down for the past, say, 4 quarters or so, and now we're beginning to anniversary the route capacity additions. So do you think we've sort of hit bottom there and we're going to see some leverage there going forward?","J. Michael Hansen","Well, I think we will. As we -- as our routes continue to get more efficient, we think that there will be some improvement there. But as Bill mentioned a little while ago, it really is hard to tell based on -- until we know where the revenue growth is going to continue to come from. If we were to see employment really pick up and our customers started hiring, we would really see some nice leveraging of those routes because we're adding revenue to the existing stops. If we continue to see the growth be driven by new accounts, then we may continue to add routes. And at some point, as Bill also said, we will add some plant capacity. And so it is dependent on where the revenue comes from. I would expect that our routes that we added last year will continue to get a little bit more efficient through this year.","Operator","And we'll go next to Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Molly R. McGarrett - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Molly McGarret for Andrew. I just have one brief one. Can you give your view on sort of long-term targets, what you're thinking for top line growth and operating margins relative to prior peaks? If you bring it through this cycle, what will drive that in terms of the length of the cycle or penetration rate? What kind of variable do you think will drive that?","William C. Gale","Well, Molly, as we have indicated on a number of occasions publicly and probably in previous calls, the top line growth rate that we're going to be able to achieve is going to be dependent, to a large extent, on the robustness of the economy. So let's put it this way: if we continue to see an economy growing as it has been for the last year or so, the growth rates that you're seeing today are probably what you're going to continue to see. We're not -- unless we see an acceleration of employment, we're not going to see an acceleration of our growth rates organically. With that said, I think as we've talked a lot about on this call, we also have initiatives underway to improve the profitability of our business where we're getting to scale in some of the newer businesses. We've done some things, I think, in the rental side that will continue to improve the profitability there. So I feel good about growth. I just would say that I'm not going to really believe that we can do something that's not possible organically unless the economy cooperates a little bit more robustly.","Operator","And we'll go next to Gregory Halter with Great Lakes Review.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","I just wanted to be clear on what the rental business's organic revenue growth rate was, unadjusted, for the one less day?","J. Michael Hansen","I -- we don't really calculate it that way, Greg. The total...","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Would it be the 5.0%?","J. Michael Hansen","Well, that was the total growth for the quarter, unadjusted. Yes.","William C. Gale","And there was no...","J. Michael Hansen","Actually, there was no acquisition price [ph].","William C. Gale","Yes, there were no acquisitions. So yes, it basically -- well, 5% -- adjusting for the workday, 6.7%, because there were no acquisitions.","J. Michael Hansen","Yes, right.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Okay. That sounds good. And in your guidance, I know you mentioned the -- I believe, you're modeling 122.5 million shares for the year. And in the guidance, on the EPS, does that assume that there won't be any further share repurchases or that they're not being counted in there?","J. Michael Hansen","That assumes that there will not be future share repurchases, yes.","William C. Gale","Now keep in mind, too, when Mike gave the outstanding shares, you've got to adjust for share equivalents that are sitting out there in the form of invested restricted stock and stock options. So that's one reason why the number is higher. I just want to make sure everybody understands that. But no, our assumption is that -- and that's included in our guidance, too, is that there would be no further share buybacks because we just don't have any basis on which to say what they would be.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Right. There's no 10b5-1 plan or anything like that in place?","William C. Gale","Well, I didn't say that, but I just...","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Okay, one last one for you. On the rental business, I wonder if you could comment on how things like the fire-resistant clothing and Carhartt and womenswear are doing?","William C. Gale","Fire-resistant clothing continues to be a very nice business for us, Greg. This is where I'm very enthusiastic about government regulation because it is forcing a lot of customers to basically provide these type of garments to their employees. And as a result of that, being the largest FRC provider in the world, we're doing well there. That, coupled with the fact that the energy sector is a big user of that and continues to grow nicely in the U.S., obviously, has been one of the reasons that we've seen some growth there. Carhartt continues to be a star within the company. There is a unique set of workers and people in this country that like that product, and we're the only one who can offer that as a rental product, and it has certainly been beneficial to us and continues to do so, less so than the FRC, but it certainly is a benefit. Womenswear has picked up a little bit. I would say I'm not as enthusiastic about the growth there yet. I think we need to continue to develop the appropriate type of garments that are appealing to women in different types of jobs on a rental program. And so I would say it's better than it was, but it could be a lot better, and we're continuing to look at different things.","Operator","And we'll go next to Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","There's been a lot of talk about penetrating the health care market, I think, in the industry broadly. Can you just talk about some of your services that you're offering to the health care industry, some of the initiatives that you have in place? What would be really helpful is giving us some sort of size about the level of revenue that you're generating today from the health care industry and what your outlook is on for the growth rate there.","William C. Gale","I certainly think health care opportunities will continue to be one of the reasons why we will grow. And the penetration rate is still very low. The focus that we have in health care from a rental side is more in the facility services and providing products that can enable a health care institution to provide the sanitation they need to avoid the in-house problems that they have with infectious diseases and that sort of thing. So we've worked with health care to come up with some products that can help keep their place cleaner and, on a rental basis, that provides cost-saving opportunities to the health care institution, and we're continuing to do that. We've made some inroads, but it's still small. We're not really focusing on the garments of the nurses and the health care providers that you would see, that you would just generally see, but rather looking at scrub rentals and the facility services-type products. Now, of course, health care is a big industry for us in the Document Management business and continues to be a driver in the growth of that business because of the privacy protection laws that all health care institutions need to worry about.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you help us by giving us a general size of that business, Bill or Mike?","William C. Gale","No, I don't have that information available. And even if I did, Andy, I probably wouldn't be able to share it with you.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Bill Gale for closing remarks.","William C. Gale","I want to thank everyone, again, for joining us this evening.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.","William C. Gale","Thank you for joining us this evening, where we will report our third quarter results for fiscal 2012. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After some commentary on the results, we will be happy to answer your questions.","We are pleased to report that our third quarter revenue grew 7.9% from last year's third quarter to revenue of $1,012,000,000. Net income increased by 28.7% to $76 million, and earnings per share were $0.58, a 41.5% increase over last year.","I would like to make a few comments on this quarter's revenue growth. This year's third quarter had one more work day than last year's third quarter, which benefits our overall revenue growth. On a same-workday basis, our revenue growth was 6.3% over last year's third quarter. ","Our organic growth, which accounts for both workday adjustments and the impact of acquisitions, was 5.9%. Keep in mind that the recycled paper prices remained at approximately $150 per ton throughout the quarter, and this lower price negatively impacted our consolidated revenue growth over last year's third quarter by 0.6%.","Our operating margin continues to reflect our focus on high quality growth. The operating margin of 13.6% was an improvement over both the third quarter of last year and this year's second quarter. We also benefited this quarter from lower-than-expected energy-related costs and medical costs. Energy-related costs for the third quarter were 3.3% of revenue, which is slightly better than the expected level of 3.5% assumed in our guidance. In addition, medical-related expenses were 30 basis points lower than last year due to better than expected experience.","As a result of the better-than-expected results in the third quarter, we are updating our guidance for fiscal 2012. We now expect fiscal 2012 revenue to be in the range of $4.09 billion to $4.12 billion, and we expect earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.24 to $2.27. This guidance assumes no deterioration in the current U.S. economy and effective tax rate of 37% for the entire 2012 fiscal year, and recycled paper prices to continue to be approximately $150 per ton. It also assumes that energy-related costs will increase to approximately 3.5% of revenue and medical expenses to increase to normalized levels.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","Now I would like to turn the call over to Mike Hansen for more details on the third quarter.","J. Michael Hansen","Thank you, Bill. As Bill mentioned, total revenue increased 7.9% from the third quarter of last year, with total company organic growth being 5.9%. ","Total company gross margin for the third quarter was 42.1%, which is up from last year's third quarter gross margin of 41.8% despite a steep drop in recycled paper prices. I will discuss these items in more detail by segment.","Before doing so, please let me remind you that there were 65 workdays in our third quarter, which is one more than last year; and there are 66 work days in our fourth quarter, which is the same as last year. As a planning note for fiscal 2013, our workdays will be as follows: 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second quarter, 64 workdays in the third quarter and 66 in the fourth quarter. The total workdays in fiscal 2013 will be 261, which is one less than fiscal 2012.","We have 4 reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products; Uniform Direct Sales; First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services; and Document Management Services. Uniform Direct Sales, First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services and Document Management Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement.","The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, masks, towels and other related items. This segment also includes restroom supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue accounted for 71% of company revenue in the third quarter. Third quarter rental revenue was $721 million, which is up 8.4% compared to last year's third quarter and up 6.5% organically over last year. All areas of our rental business grew in the third quarter, and we continue to focus on selling profitable business.","Our rentals segment gross margin was 43.1% for the third quarter, an improvement of 30 basis points over last year's third quarter gross margin of 42.8%, primarily due to lower energy-related costs. The impact of cotton continued to be at the expected level.","Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms, branded promotional products and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue accounted for 11% of company revenue in the third quarter. Third quarter revenue of $109.1 million represents an increase of 6.4% compared to last year's third quarter. There were no acquisitions in this segment.","Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 30.5% for the third quarter, which is up from last year's third quarter gross margin of 29.5%. The increase is mainly due to better capacity utilization from the higher volume, slightly offset by the expected cotton impact. The gross margin of 30.5% was an improvement over the second quarter gross margin of 29.6%, mainly due to a better mix of higher margin products.","Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training, and fire protection products. First Aid, Safety and Fire protection revenue accounted for 10% of company revenue in the third quarter. Revenues were $101.4 million, an increase of 11.2% versus last year's third quarter and organic growth was 9.1%. We continue to see good revenue performance out of this segment, as both First Aid and Safety and Fire Protection grew nicely for the quarter.","This segment's gross margin was 43.2% in the third quarter compared to 41.5% in last year's third quarter. Energy-related expenses were 10 basis points lower this year compared to last year. However, improved capacity utilization from the higher volumes in both our facilities and on routes was the driver of the gross margin expansion. The third quarter's gross margin of 43.2% was roughly consistent with the second quarter gross margin of 43.1%.","Our Document Management Services operating segment includes document destruction, storage and imaging services, and it accounted for 8% of third quarter total company revenue. Document Management revenue increased 2% over last year's third quarter. Revenue decreased organically, though, by 1.3% compared to last year. As we mentioned in the press release, our third quarter Document Management revenue growth was adversely affected by lower recycled paper prices. The recycled paper prices stayed at roughly $150 per ton during the quarter, which is the same level we saw at the end of our second fiscal quarter. This results in a paper price that is roughly 30% lower than last year's third quarter and close to 50% less than the first quarter of this fiscal year. While it is difficult to predict this price for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, as Bill mentioned, our updated guidance assumes the prices will stay at $150 per ton.","The Document Management gross margin is also adversely affected by the drop in recycled paper prices as the change in the prices generally drops to the bottom line. The third quarter gross margin was 47% compared to last year's third quarter gross margin of 49.4%. The negative impact of lower recycled paper prices was somewhat offset by better capacity utilization from higher service volumes.","Moving to selling and administrative expenses, we are pleased with our continued leveraging of the consolidated selling and administrative expenses. Third quarter selling and administrative expenses were 28.5% of revenue, a 170 basis point improvement from last year's third quarter of 30.2%. Selling expenses continued to be lower as a percent of total revenue due to higher revenue levels and continued rep productivity improvements. And administrative expenses continued to be lower as a percent of revenue due to lower medical expenses and administrative labor.","Third quarter selling and administrative expenses of 28.5% of revenue were also lower than the 29.2% in this year's second quarter. Although payroll taxes increased due to resetting at the beginning of the calendar year, decreases in medical expenses and workers\u2019 comp related expenses and continued cost control initiatives more than offset that increase.","Our effective tax rate was 37% for the quarter compared to 38.9% last year. The effective rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. As noted in our press release, we expect the effective tax rate for the entire 2012 fiscal year to be 37%.","Turning now to the balance sheet. Our cash and marketable securities were $353 million at February 29, up $15 million from the $338 million at November 30. Please note that about $170 million of this cash and marketable securities is located outside of the U.S.","Accounts receivable decreased by $8 million since November 30. DSOs on accounts receivable were 40, which is the same as at November 30. ","New goods inventory at February 29 was $276 million, down $12 million from November 30. This decrease was expected, as the relatively high levels of the past year due to the SAP conversion normalized.","Accrued liabilities decreased $95 million compared to November 30, primarily due to the December payments of the annual dividend and accrued bond interest.","Long-term debt at February 29 was $1.3 billion, of which $226 million was in current liabilities. We have $225 million maturing on June 1, 2012. We intend to pay this off -- pay off this amount with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program. However, if longer-term borrowing rates remain at the attractive low levels they are currently, we may reevaluate and decide to refinance the amount. The average rate on the outstanding debt is 5.1% and total debt-to-EBITDA is roughly 2x.","Moving on to cash flow. Cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter was $131.8 million, which is up from last year's third quarter amount of $98.7 million. In addition to higher net income, the decrease in inventory during this year's third quarter added to the improvement over last year.","CapEx for the third quarter was $37.9 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $26.8 million in rental; $1.9 million in Uniform Direct Sales; $3.4 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection; and $5.8 million in Document Management. We expect CapEx for the fiscal 2012 to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million. ","That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And right now we'll go to the James Samford with Citigroup.","James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just wanted to touch on your guidance, and if I just sort of back in to what Q4 is implying, it seems like you're implying some modesty sell [ph], and perhaps even sort of flat margins year-over-year. Is that your intention or is that really conservatism that I should read into that?","William C. Gale","Well, that was certainly thought through when we provided that guidance, so let me give you a little more color on that. We are a -- we tend to be a bit conservative, but I also think a few things deserve mention that Mike brought up in his comments. We did see our medical expenses be lower in the third quarter than what is typical, so we expect those to rise to more normalized levels and thus impact SG&A. We do expect energy costs to be back up about 20 to 30 basis points from what we saw in the third quarter. We still have some concerns about the economy in terms of job growth and just overall confidence. The paper price has a big impact on us, and we continue to expect that to be low. And keep in mind, last year's fourth quarter, we were seeing rising paper prices from the third quarter of last year. And therefore, if the paper prices do not increase, which we don't really expect them to do at this point, the impact of the lower paper prices this year is going to have a bigger impact than what Mike talked about for the third quarter. And then, finally, I think another thing to -- that's worth some mention here is that we have seen a pickup of our turnover in our sales force to more normalized levels over the last few months. And as we replace these more productive salespeople with newer salespeople, we tend to think that the impact on new business might be impacted a bit. So that's why the guidance was as we provided it.","James Samford - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's fair enough. One quick follow-up on the rental gross margin. I think that came in just slightly below where we thought. Just wondering how much of fuel costs versus I guess the natural gas benefit that you probably got, how much of that was a factor in the quarter?","J. Michael Hansen","The energy-related costs in total were down from last year by about 30 basis points. But some of the leveraging that we have seen was offset by some rising -- rise in material cost. Our cotton impact has accelerated as we expected it to from the first and second quarter. And so we're seeing a little bit of that as well.","Operator","Moving forward, we will go to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to pick up on something just mentioned. With this increased turnover of salespeople, where are they going? Is it a product of an improving economy and they're seeing opportunities elsewhere? What's the dynamic there, guys?","William C. Gale","We have -- first off, I don't want to make a big deal about this, Scott. I just wanted to mention that it is going to have a slight impact on the growth rate. But as the economy improves, our salespeople are in great demand for other industries. And they also -- there's a burnout in some of our salespeople because it's all new business. They're hunters, basically. So I don't think it's anything that we're alarmed about. It's just a fact that it's a reflection of what's the strength of our sales force, and that the economy is picking up a bit.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And that segues well into the -- you guys are seeing nice revenue growth. You're obviously getting leverage from that. You talked about energy and medical and getting benefits there. But it appears that you\u2019re operating quite effectively. Could you talk about some of the initiatives you have occurring and where you think you're seeing success among expense management?","William C. Gale","Well, I think we're seeing success in many areas. Let me give a commentary in a few. In our plants, our rental plants, we've implemented quite a bit of automation, and we have been able to incentivize our workforces in the plants that have enabled us to improve productivity. We're seeing in our routes -- the impact of the portable route computer certainly have helped the productivity of our service sales reps. And the fact that a significant number of our rental routes and some of our other services routes have gone to 4-day workweeks instead of 5, and that's improved our fuel efficiency, as well as the productivity of our workforce. The G&A area has certainly been benefited by our CEO's initiative of looking -- making sure that everything we do is of value to our customers, and that they recognize it, and they're willing to pay for it. So we've been able to streamline a number of our processes. Plus we're getting some of the benefits of the SAP conversions as we roll those out to some of our functional areas like all of our finance activities in our global supply chain. Continuing at Cintas to always do improvement of what we have and the fact that we're seeing some top line growth is enabling us to get some leverage in all the different areas.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Great. One more before I turn over. The pricing environment, this is broad for all the segments, but particularly for rental. Are you able to take advantage of the approving environment right now? And could you speak to how much of the organic growth you're seeing is price related?","William C. Gale","Well, we're -- we actually -- we saw some pickup on pricing earlier this fiscal year. And as Mike and I were analyzing the results for this during this quarter, I would say that pricing hasn't deteriorated, but it hasn't improved at the same rate that we were seeing earlier in the fiscal year. So we didn't really get a whole lot of benefit in this quarter on pricing but -- nor did we really get any deterioration.","Operator","Moving forward, we'll hear from Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I know you don't disclose it precisely, but I'm just wondering if anecdotally you could talk a little bit about the add\/stop metric kind of trend during the quarter, and how that's kind of trending overall throughout the year.","William C. Gale","We have not seen a significant improvement in add\/stops. As we mentioned a year ago, we finally saw a stabilization in that. As we look at the numbers week to week, you'll get a few weeks where you'll see some positive impact. And then that same trend won't necessarily continue into the next week. It doesn't go negative, but it's just not as robust. So I'm not willing yet to say that we're really seeing any real impact of adds. It's just -- it's kind of a just a very, very modest improvement over what we saw earlier this year.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","That's helpful. I mean, it sounds like pretty much the same that's been going on. In order to, like, continue to support the new services and the new business wins that you've been getting, how do you feel about your current net level of hiring? Is it still to the point where you can continue to get several productivity improvements still there, or is it to the point where you're starting to have to hire again net-net to support the service levels?","William C. Gale","Well, certainly on the routes, to the extent you add new stops in any of our businesses, you have to quickly add capacity, because we have rightsized the routes during the downturn, and we continue to be focused on keeping our service sales reps pretty full and productive. So there's not a lot of additional capacity for new stops. There's capacity for additional business on existing stops, especially in the rental division when you have additional wearers at a stop, the effort to take the uniforms in for the new wearer are really not that significant over what you were doing anyway. So we -- you get some nice revenue growth there. But generally speaking, the impact of new business does require us to continue to expand the routes. On the production side, I think we've been saying this for some time, and we continue to feel pretty confident that we have adequate production capacity in most areas of the country. Therefore, we will not need to invest in a lot more plant capacity as our revenues continue to increase. And then on the other businesses, the Document Management business is primarily route-based. We have a little bit of storage business. And of course, the storage revenue continues to increase. You got to make sure you have capacity and racking to put those boxes in storage. But since most of our -- the bulk of our business is shredding, that's a route-based business, and again it depends on is it additional stops or is it just additional volume within the stop that determines what kind of capacity you need to have.","Operator","Next question, we'll hear from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to talk about the selling administrative line, where it's been coming down remarkably as a percentage of revenue all year long. And I definitely heard your comment, Bill, about the sales force. So my question is, is near term, are we going reverse? Are we going to go much higher than we are now, 28.5%? Are we going to head back towards 30%? What is kind of the near-term kind of level of efficiencies for the S&A line?","William C. Gale","Andrew, near term, you're not going to see a significant change from where we're at today. Our only -- I don't see any impact really on the selling expense. It's more some of those items Mike mentioned like on the medical costs. They may rise modestly from what we saw in the third quarter. Sometimes you have a little bit of bad debt expense that will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. But you're not going to see a materially -- material change in that line. I think the overall longer-term trend will continue to be pointing downward, although as not quite as rapid a pace as what we've seen over the last year or so.","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And that's true for the fourth quarter as well, S&A as a percentage of revenues will be down but not to the extent that it had.","William C. Gale","Well, no, no. I said medical expenses could impact that modestly. It could be...","Andrew C. Steinerman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That\u2019s 30 bps, right. But now I'm talking year-over-year, so if...","William C. Gale","Yes, it will be down year-over-year, yes.","Operator","Next question is from Gary Bisbee with Barclays Capital.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Let me just follow on that with one quick one on the SG&A. If the -- can you give us any sense of the magnitude of those likely sales hires. I'm not even so concerned with, like, the fourth quarter, but if we think over next year, the SG&A expense has decelerated. You've lapped the easier comp, and it still stayed incredibly low growth in the number. I understand the medical comment and all the other comments you made. But are we talking mid-single-digit growth in the headcount? Or what types of numbers are we going to need here?","William C. Gale","No, Gary, I think you misunderstood. It's primarily the result of replacing headcount that we had. It's not a significant increase in headcount that we're anticipating right now. It's more or less just continuing -- we'll be getting back to a level that we may have seen in the second quarter or so. That's all I'm trying to imply.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Well then, so let me take another cut at that. I mean you've obviously had good revenue growth, and you're starting to comp the real time on revenue growth accelerated, but you continue to have good growth. Don't you need to layer in more salespeople to keep that going? Or is there much more productivity that can come out of the system other than, I understand, the short term comment about replacing people that left?","William C. Gale","It would be a modest increase that would be not that significant.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, all right. Let me move on then. The uniform rental pretax margins were excellent, I don\u2019t -- I think a level we haven't seen in a couple of years. And how should we think about the trending here over the next couple of years? Is there a chance to get back to the prior highs of many years ago in this business? Or is the -- has anything changed that would make that not possible if we had several more years of revenue growth?","J. Michael Hansen","Well, from a gross margin standpoint, Gary, the good news is we're still -- we still have fewer wearers today than we have pre-recession, which means we have more processing capacity than we did before. We also...","William C. Gale","Gary, just a clarification. Were you talking about direct sales or the rental business?","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Oh, no, the rental business. I guess, when you look at it, it's been 2.5 years since you had -- and I guess I was looking at the pretax margin, but since you had a level this high. I guess I'm trying to understand how much more -- on both margins, how much more of this can go over time. I mean is the business potentially get back to where the margins were 5, 8 years ago when they were a lot higher or...","J. Michael Hansen","Gary, to kind of finish the thought I had before, we've got a lot of production capacity. And a lot of the revenue that we're adding like hygiene services, chemical business, tile and carpet cleaning does not require any laundry facility capacity. And so we still think that we can get leverage going forward from a gross margin standpoint. Now there may be ups and downs because of material costs ups and downs, maybe due to cotton, but we still think there is some leverage opportunity in our gross margin and in our production facilities. And if you think about the fact that we still haven't seen a significant amount of customer hiring, if our customers start to hire and we get a lot of adds at existing stops, we're going to see even better margin impact there. So keep in mind a lot of that higher -- some of the highest margin revenue left us during the recession and has yet to come back. So we still have some gross margin opportunity. In the SG&A, if you think about some of the cost that maybe we didn't have in the earlier part of the 2000s, which were stock option expensing, medical wasn't as high, there may be some reasons for not getting all the way back to the SG&A levels that we saw, but still some leverage over the next couple of years.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just one more on a point you just made. I guess, why do you think you haven't seen job growth among your customers? I realize that part of the customer base maybe has a bit more industrial manufacturing slant, but we've even seen some growth in recent months in that. We're seeing small businesses, which I know you skewed toward growth faster than the total job market. I guess I'm struggling to understand why you haven't seen that yet. Do you have any insight into it or any thoughts as to when that may happen our why it's not happening?","William C. Gale","I think we're going to have to see more robust job growth, 200,000 or whatever jobs a month. I don't think it really is going to show up too much on our numbers yet. When we get up to 400,000, 500,000 job growth in -- especially in our sectors, I think you're going to begin to see a little bit more of that. It just -- it really hasn't been that significant yet.","Gary E. Bisbee - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And actually, I thought of one more I'd love to sneak in. The European Document Management, I think you said that lost money a quarter ago. Is that still operating at that weak level?","J. Michael Hansen","We haven't seen any further deterioration in the European business. It's still a very difficult operating environment. And we expect improvements going forward, but it wasn't quite as bad as the second quarter, but still not where we want it to be.","Operator","Next question in queue will be from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I actually want to continue beating the SG&A horse. Just in terms of understanding sequentially why the SG&A is going down, if I take the 50 basis points between medical and energy, that's about $5 million sequentially. And then can you just give us a little bit of an insight what the other, maybe $4 million of decline sequentially was in the SG&A?","William C. Gale","Shlomo, there are numerous items in there. I really don't have the detail in that, I mean, but there are so many different things that go through there: insurance costs, workmen's compensation cost, bad debt expense, legal expenses, professional fees, et cetera, et cetera. So we try to highlight for you some of the big ones, but we really -- we don't have the detail to provide publicly on the rest of it.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Let's take from 2 quarters ago then and -- where the revenue was down $5 million from 2 quarters ago and the SG&A is down $22 million. Can you talk about some of the difference from, say, just 2 quarters ago and highlights on that?","J. Michael Hansen","Shlomo, some of the -- it gets a little bit problematic to compare different quarters. So for example, in our first quarter, we have some expenses that don't normally occur throughout the year like some management meetings, some sales meetings. And so there are some things that cause maybe first quarter SG&A be a little bit higher than third quarter. But generally speaking, we are -- we continuously look at all of our processes, particularly in our G&A area. And we continue to ask, is it value-added? In other words, is it something that the customer wants? And if not, then we look for new ways of doing things where we eliminate things. And that can go towards processes, all different kinds of expenses that we have in SG&A. So we're always looking just for every line item.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you just give an example for something like that then? Just talk about one example where as a process the customer wasn't paying you for that you decided to eliminate just...","William C. Gale","Well, a good example is just you have staff people creating reports for -- that are needed for some reason a couple years ago, and all of a sudden you find out 50% of somebody's time is producing these reports and the need for those reports are no longer there. So that could be one. Or the reports get replaced by some sort of automation. That would be an example of things that you basically get rid of.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Is there something directly related to the SAP implementation that's allowing you to take some of those costs out?","William C. Gale","Sure, we're basically -- one of the benefits we're getting from SAP in the financial arena is we now have the ability for our accounting organization to handle more locations than they previously were able to handle and produce information that previously they had to go to our IT organization to get, and they can do it themselves. So there are savings that happens as a result of just improved systems.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, no, I appreciate the color on that. And then just -- I know you're just highlighting some of the change in the sales force, but you're not alarmed by it. I'm just wondering you're starting to see some change over there, but usually that's indicative of a change in the economy. Yet, you're not seeing any changes with regard to your customer base in terms of employment within your customer base. Is that what you're saying?","William C. Gale","That's what we're saying.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And the salespeople that are leaving, is there any -- do they hit ceilings? Or is there anything else that's indicative of why they would want to leave what's considered a very good organization out in the...","William C. Gale","I think some people just tend to -- the job design itself, they get tired of doing it the way they were doing it, and they have an opportunity at another company. With our -- the society that we have today, we see more and more people -- 2 couples both with careers, and sometimes there's an impact of people leaving because they -- their significant other has another opportunity somewhere else. So it's just a myriad of things. I think the fact that the economy for professional-level people seems to have picked up a little quicker than for the more of the blue-collar workforces is enabling some of this mobility, too.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And are they moving -- in your sense, are they going to competitors or just doing something different?","William C. Gale","No, they're not going to competitors, Shlomo. They're basically maybe going to other industries or leaving the sales profession. I think, again, I'm going to make the point, you guys are making a bigger deal out of this than I think is necessary. All we're getting -- all we're seeing is approaching our more historical turnover levels that we saw back before the recession.","J. Michael Hansen","Okay. Well, that fair color on that then.","J. Michael Hansen","Shlomo, just one last point on the SG&A. One thing to keep in mind, if you compare first quarter to third quarter, for example, is we do have one less workday. And that means one less day of labor and other related expenses. So just keep that in mind as you kind of analyze quarter-to-quarter.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And, Mike, how much of your SG&A pushes the clock versus being salaried?","J. Michael Hansen","Well, that's something we haven't disclosed publicly.","Shlomo Rosenbaum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I would expect that they would primarily be salaried labor.","William C. Gale","A lot of clerical people in SG&A, also.","J. Michael Hansen","But it doesn't -- from the standpoint of a workday, it doesn't matter, Shlomo. If you've got fewer workdays, you're paying less.","Operator","Next question in queue will be from Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask you a quick follow-up question on Document Management. Can you just give us a sense of what the organic growth rates and maybe the margins were in Europe versus the U.S.? And can you maybe just talk about what you're doing in Europe to rightsize the cost structure over there?","William C. Gale","Joe, we do not separately break out the growth rates in Europe versus U.S. We just keep it in Document Management in total. Our strategy in Europe, as we mentioned at the last call, was basically to assimilate these acquisitions we've made, to implement some of the techniques that we've been successful with in the U.S. in those businesses over there and focus on improving the profitability of the business. And at this point, we are still encouraged by the potential that exists there. We did not see a deterioration from the second to the third quarter, nor have we seen a significant improvement yet.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, and maybe just changing gears. Question on the inventory front, you guys got a bit of a benefit this quarter. Was that a onetime correction that was primarily related to the SAP implementation? Or could we potentially see inventory being a source of cash over the next couple of quarters?","William C. Gale","We hope to see it continue to be a source of cash for the next couple of quarters because we did see a significant increase in the inventory about over a year ago when we implemented SAP. So at this time, we would expect there to be a reduction in the overall inventory levels, barring some significant new customer rollout program. But at this point, I don't anticipate increased inventories.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, and just one last question for you. How should we think about the timing of lower cotton costs rolling through your Direct Uniform business? And obviously, you talked about a headwind this quarter, but should we start to see that benefit roll through over the next couple of quarters?","J. Michael Hansen","I -- we wouldn't expect a benefit. You mean a benefit from the fact that cotton is a bit lower than it was a year ago?","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Correct.","J. Michael Hansen","You know, Joe, we buy fabric all the time. And that's kind of entering our supply chain at varying levels, and I wouldn't say that we bought all of our fabric last year at the highest prices. We're kind of getting average prices, and they're rolling through at varying levels depending on the turns of the various inventory. But generally speaking, I would not expect to get a benefit in the next couple quarters from that in our Direct Sale business. And in our uniform rental business, we're going to continue to see kind of an accelerating number through probably midyear fiscal '13.","Operator","Next question we will hear from will be from Greg Halter, Great Lakes Review.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Just wondered where you stand in terms of the SAP implementation. Is it fully done, or are there still more components to roll out?","William C. Gale","We have several years left assuming that the system appears to be the correct alternative as we roll it into our business units. But it's a 3, 4 or more year project that we would have.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Okay. And I know about 5 to 8 years ago, there were some talk and discussion and experimentation with RFID and so forth and so on in terms of the facilities. With the prices and the cost of those chips and so forth coming down, has any more progress been made in that area?","William C. Gale","I'd say there's been some progress made. The issue we've always had is the chip, a multi-read chip that can withstand the industrial laundry process. And we have experimented with a number of different manufacturers. We made some progress, and then all of a sudden, they don't have the life we expected. So while it is continuing -- continued to be tested in a couple of our operations, we're a long way away from saying we have success and be able to roll it out across the company.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Okay. Regarding uses of cash, obviously, the stock has had a nice move upward here, which I would presume would not put you in a buying area, and you can only do so much with the dividend, and obviously, on a debt as well with the rates where they are. Just wondered what your uses or priorities for cash are given the strong cash generation?","William C. Gale","Well, there's really been no change from our philosophy before. This is a board level directive on how we utilize that cash. We just completed the third quarter where we paid our dividend, 10% increase from the prior year. We have a $225 million debt tranche coming due on June 1. The acquisition pipeline appears to be showing some life again, so there might be opportunities down the road there. And we just bought $500 million worth of stock less than 9 months ago. So the authorization, we've always completed our authorizations over time, and I would say that the board will direct us on what they think is in the best long-term interest of our shareholder.","Gregory W. Halter - LJR Great Lakes Review","Okay. And one last one for you, I think on the last call, you talked about the fire garments and Carhartt. I just wondered if you had any comments on how those 2 areas in particular are doing?","William C. Gale","They're doing well. The FRC, the flame-resistant garments continue to be successful as government mandates that different industries must put their employees in such garments, and we continue to be the leader in selling those type of customers. The Carhartt business -- or Carhartt relationship continues to be a very successful one. It is enabling us to provide uniform rental programs to companies that, in the past, may not have considered one because they didn't like their offerings, but they do like Carhartt. So while it is not a very, very significant part of our rental business, it is an important part, and we continue to feel very good about it.","Operator","Moving forward, we will hear from Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is David Ridley-Lane in for Sarah. As paper prices fall, I'd imagine that competition will increase among document management firms and shredding companies. How will the dynamic change if the paper prices linger at these levels?","J. Michael Hansen","Well, David, when paper prices are relatively high, so at this past summer's levels, the pricing for the service gets very competitive because some providers look at it as a paper collection. And so the service pricing gets very competitive. As we see the prices come down and stay at this $150 level, it will bring some discipline back into that service pricing, which we believe is a better long-term range for our business. So we would expect that some discipline will get back into the service pricing, and we can focus more on providing the security to this business that it really needs.","David Ridley-Lane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And on a totally different topic, if you did decide to refinance the $225 million in debt, I heard you on the uses of cash, but would you just sort of let the cash sort of sit on the balance sheet, or would there be a go-to use of cash if you did decide to refi that?","William C. Gale","Well, that presents an interesting dilemma, because you've got such what appears to be very cheap, let's say, very inexpensive debt available to you, and yet we also have a very strong cash flow business. So it becomes a point, well, how long are you willing to sit -- have that cash sitting on the balance sheet, waiting for implementation. So we'll have to consider all of that as we get closer to the summer and decide whether or not it makes sense, and determine whether or not we should refinance and get that cash or just go ahead and use some of the cash we have available and keep our debt capacity available for the future.","Operator","Next question will be from John Healy from Northcoast Research.","John M. Healy - Northcoast Research","Bill, I had a capital allocation question for you with some of the uncertainty regarding dividends going forward. I know the company has a very proud history of sustaining and increasing its dividend annually. How does the board or how do you feel about that scenario if legislation changes how dividends are taxed and would that be something that would make you guys think about capital allocation a little bit differently?","William C. Gale","I think the board will certainly consider those potential changes as it decides on the dividend. It also is very interested in listening to some of our long-term big shareholders and what their interests would be. But there are so many variables. Who knows what's going to happen, John? And we really don't have to face that since we don't pay a dividend until the end of the year anyway, and maybe there will be more clarity by that time. But I'm sure, it will be considered.","John M. Healy - Northcoast Research","Okay, great. And then I want to ask you a question, you made the comment regarding the acquisition environment maybe being a little bit more active. What part of the business is that on? And what level of leverage do you think would be the highest if you're taking the company up to if a more sizable acquisition presented itself?","William C. Gale","The acquisition -- I think they'll be -- the acquisition activity is picking up primarily in the Document Management business and a little bit in the rental business. I think there'll be some opportunities perhaps in our fire business also, down the road. The -- as far as -- what was the last...","John M. Healy - Northcoast Research","Regarding leverage, please, where you feel comfortable.","William C. Gale","It all depends. Because it depends on the type of acquisition you're getting, what kind of cash flow it's bringing to you, EBITDA. We absolutely could become more leveraged, but we also have to balance that with the ratings that we want to maintain with the rating agencies that give us access to a lot of capital. So I would tell you that it would all depend on what the use of the leverage would be as to how comfortable we are on getting to a certain level. If it's buying a company that's going to generate a lot of cash and that leverage will quickly come back down, we would take a much different view than if it's just a permanent leveraging up of the balance sheet.","Operator","The next question will be from Justin Hauke with Robert W. Baird.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","One last question on the margins. I know we've kind of beaten the dead horse here, but just as we think about '13, I just wanted to clarify some of your comments. It sounds like possibly the additional margin leverage you're expecting to see over the next couple of years will be more gross margin as opposed to SG&A, a little bit of SG&A but more weighted to gross margin. Is that what you were trying to imply?","J. Michael Hansen","Yes. Without giving any particular timing and specific numbers, because we haven't really provided those, we think there is a fair amount of leveraging opportunity in our operations in all of our businesses. And so we do think that that\u2019s still is an opportunity going forward. It may bounce up and down from quarter-to-quarter, but we think there's some good opportunity there. From an SG&A, you've seen that number come down pretty dramatically over the last 6 or so quarters. And that rate of improvement will likely not continue.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, and then I guess just on that level, you mentioned structurally some of the things that are different in the SG&A line. So if I look back 6 or 7 years ago, the SG&A margins in '11 were 500 basis points higher than they were in 2004. How much of that is structural from the base of higher medical expenses?","William C. Gale","Somewhere between 100 and 300 basis points probably.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","100 and 300?","William C. Gale","Yes.","Operator","And at this time, we have no further questions in the queue. I'll turn things back over to our host for any additional or closing remarks.","William C.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Hansen","Good evening and thank you for joining us tonight. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our first quarter results for fiscal 2016. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","As we reported today, in the press release, please note that a change in our reportable segments U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles require companies to evaluate their reportable operating segments when certain events occur. As a result of a recent evaluation, effective June 1, 2015, we will report the following operating segments: Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other. All Other primarily consists of Fire Protection Services and our Direct Sale business division.","We are pleased to report first quarter revenue of $1.199 billion, an increase of 8.8% from the prior year first quarter. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, work day differences, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 6.8%. Organic revenue growth for our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment was 6.8% and the First Aid and Safety Services segments organic growth was 10.5%.","The performance of our sales force in both segments was strong. We continue to add new customers and provide existing customers with additional products and services from our broad line. First quarter operating income was $185.5 million, which was 15.5% of revenue compared to an operating margin of 14.8% in the prior year period. This represents a 70 basis point improvement from last year\u2019s operating margin.","Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 was $106.2 million and earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter were $0.93. Note that the first quarter of last fiscal year\u2019s net income and EPS from continuing operations were positively impacted by a gain from the sale of stock in an equity method investment. Excluding this gain, first quarter net income and EPS from continuing operations increased 15.1% and 19.2% respectively, compared to the prior year.","Net income from continuing operations as a percent of revenue improved 50 basis points to 8.9% from 8.4% of revenue in last fiscal year\u2019s first quarter, excluding the prior year period gain. We also demonstrated our continuing commitment to providing shareholder value through our stock buyback program. During August and into September through the close of business yesterday, Cintas purchased 2.9 million shares of common stock. This share buyback had no impact on first quarter EPS, but is expected to benefit full fiscal year EPS by $0.05.","Since the beginning of fiscal 2016, approximately 4.5 million shares of common stock have been purchased at an aggregate cost of $381.2 million. As of September 23, 2015 Cintas had 381.8 million, available under the current Board of Directors stock repurchase authorization. As Cintas\u2019 CEO, Scott Farmer stated in the today\u2019s press release, we are off to a good start to our fiscal 2016 year. We thank our employees whom we call partners for their strong performance.","On August 1, 2015 the company closed on the acquisition of Zee Medical, for a consideration of approximately $134 million in cash. About $121 million were paid at the closing of the transaction and an additional $13 million may be paid in the future fiscal years subject to holdback provisions. We are in the very early stages of the integration of the Zee business. We are excited about the benefits and opportunities this acquisition provides, including expanding our footprint and enabling us to serve an even greater number of customers in North America.","As a result of our first quarter results and the recent acquisition of Zee Medical, we\u2019re updating our annual guidance. We expect fiscal 2016 revenue to be in the range of $4.8 billion to $4.880 billion, and fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.88. This guidance does not include any EPS impact from the announced agreement to sell our investment in Shred-it, which has not yet closed. This guidance does not include any potential deterioration in the U.S. economy or additional share buybacks. The EPS guidance is detailed in a table within today's press release.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Paul for more details on company financial performance.","Paul Adler","Thanks, Mike. First please note that there were 66 workdays in this year's first quarter compared to 65 in last year's first quarter. The second and third quarters of this fiscal year will have the same number of work days as last year of 65. This year's fourth quarter will have 66 workdays, compared to 65 in last year's fourth quarter. Thus fiscal year 2016 will have 262 work days, two more than in fiscal 2015.","As Mike stated, total revenue increased organically by 6.8% in the first quarter. New business wins, penetration of existing customers with more products and services, retention, and price increases all contributed to the strong growth rate. Total company gross margin was 43.7% for the first quarter of this year, compared to 43.4% last year. Total company energy related expenses for this years\u2019 first quarter were 2.2%. Last year's first quarter energy-related expenses were 2.8%.","As Mike previously stated, effective June 1, 2015, we have three reportable operating segments, Uniform Rental and Facility Services, First Aid and Safety Services, and All Other. All Other consists primarily of Fire Protection services and our Direct Sale business division. First Aid and Safety Services and All Other are combined and presented as Other Services on the income statement.","The Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogues to our customers on route. Uniform Rental and Facility Services revenue was $938 million, an increase of 7.4% compared to last year's first quarter.","Organic growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions, workday differences, and foreign currency exchange rate changes, was 6.8%. For comparative purposes, this segment's organic growth for the previous quarter, our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter was 6.2%. Our Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment gross margin was 44.7% for the first quarter, an increase of 90 basis points from 43.8% in last year's first quarter. Energy-related costs were 70 basis points lower than last year's first quarter.","Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segments includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the first quarter was $99 million, which was 24.5% higher than last year's first quarter. Total growth benefited from the Zee Medical acquisition. On an organic basis growth was 10.5%. This was a good sequential increase in the growth rate from 8.2% in our fourth quarter. This segment's gross margin was 42.3% in the first quarter, compared to 45.9% in the prior year period.","Energy-related costs were 40 basis points lower than in last year's first quarter. As Mike stated earlier, we are in the very beginning stages of the integration of the Zee business. As expected, our First Aid and Safety Services results were negatively impacted by conversion costs, the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the purchase price accounting, and other charges. This impact will continue in the short term as we assimilate the acquired business and begin to realize the synergies. ","We\u2019re excited about the benefits and opportunities that this acquisition provides. Regarding selling and general and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 28.2% as a percentage of first quarter revenue compared to a total company SG&A and last year's first quarter of 28.5%. The 30 basis point improvement in SG&A was realized despite a 40 basis point increase in medical expenses this quarter, compared to last year.","On July 15, 2015 Cintas announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to sell its investments in Shred-it for approximately $550 million to $600 million before taxes. The transaction is still expected to close in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2015. As a result of the announced sale of the investments, the related income or loss is now reported in discontinued operations. The investment in Shred-it on the balance sheet is recorded at assets held for sale and a related tax liability is recorded as liabilities held for sale.","Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 37.2%, the same rate as in the prior year period. We expect a full year 2016 effective tax rate to be 37.3%. Our cash and marketable securities were $200 million at August 31, a decrease of $233 million from the $433 million in May 31. Cash provided by operating activities was $143 million in our first quarter. Uses of cash included $121 million, net of cash acquired for acquisitions in about $222 million or repurchases of Cintas common stock.","Capital expenditures for the first quarter were approximately $63 million. Our CapEx by reportable operating segments was as follows: $55 million in uniform rental, $4 million in first aid and safety, and $4 million in all other. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2016 to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Greg Bardi","Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav, just wanted to ask about the guidance. It looks like excluding Zee Medical and the buybacks, the guidance is essentially unchanged even with the pretty solid numbers. Just wondering if there has been a changed to your view versus when you first gave guidance or if there is \u2013 if it\u2019s just kind of conservatism so early in the year?","Mike Hansen","You are correct. Without Zee and without the share buyback impact, the guidance is generally the same. Our first quarter results were generally in line and we still feel good about the year. There is no change in the way we feel about that with maybe the only possible exception of the Canadian dollar continues to weaken. Today, it was somewhere in the 1.33, 1.34 range which is a little bit weaker than we guided at 1.25. So we may see a little bit of top line impact as we go through the rest of the year. But aside from that, we still feel good about the year and not really any change to our thinking.","Greg Bardi","Fair enough. And then on the M&A environment, should we think of Zee Medical as kind of a one-off opportunity that you\u2019ve had or are you seeing comparatively larger companies coming available recently?","Mike Hansen","Certainly Zee is a great opportunity for us and one that we feel very excited about. It certainly does demonstrate that we want to put our cash to work and we really do like the opportunities for M&A particularly in a case like Zee where there is a lot of tuck-in opportunity. I would say I can\u2019t comment on any other items because I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate, but we\u2019re certainly continuing to be active and looking for opportunities to add value through M&A.","Greg Bardi","Okay. Thanks, Mike.","Mike Hansen","Okay.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Andrew Steinerman with JP Morgan.","Andrew Steinerman","Hi, could you review which driver of revenue growth caused the acceleration in the quarter to 6.8% growth year-over-year, you outlined 60 basis points of acceleration which segment did that come from and what\u2019s the organic revenue growth implied for the full year in the revenue guidance?","Mike Hansen","Well, we \u2013 a number of things. As Paul mentioned, we had a very good new business quarter. One of the things in the last call that we talked about was a little bit of preparing in the fourth quarter to get off to a good start. So we probably hired some reps early, we added some routes earlier and we got some good momentum going into the year and that continued through the quarter, new business was very strong. Customer retention was a little bit better than last year so another benefit not as significant as the new business. Pricing was I would say the environment didn\u2019t change much but it was still a fairly positive environment with the exception of our energy related customers.","Andrew Steinerman","Sure.","Mike Hansen","So those three areas all contributed. I would say that there was a little bit of an offset from those energy related customers as we\u2019ve talked in the last several quarters. Our oil and gas customers are certainly operating under difficult environments as well as our mining customers and we saw our uniform rental net add-stops being negative for the quarter. So there was a bit of a drag from that, but certainly\u2026","Andrew Steinerman","Did you say add-stops were negative overall because of oil and gas or add-stops were negative in oil and gas?","Mike Hansen","Because of oil, gas and mining.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay, perfect. And then the other part of the question was, what was the organic growth? What is the organic growth implied in the revenue guidance for the year?","Mike Hansen","We haven\u2019t provided that and I would rather not get into that number. I don\u2019t have it calculated. We are really focused on the top line but I would say that we don\u2019t expect many significant changes to that \u2013 to the first quarter performance. We still feel good about the year.","Andrew Steinerman","Right. So in the same vicinity that we\u2019ve been thinking about it for a while now?","Mike Hansen","Yes.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay, good. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","George Tong","Hi, good afternoon. Can you talk a bit about how much of your growth is being fueled by organic customer growth versus penetration of the non-programmer market and how that\u2019s evolved in recent quarters?","Mike Hansen","I can\u2019t give you any specific numbers, George, but I will tell you that the penetration opportunities still exist and they are \u2013 we are taking advantage of them. Our ability to sell particularly into good uniform rental, anchor accounts with our signature series hygiene products, our chemicals, our microfiber mops et cetera it\u2019s still going very well. I would say that new business has been a strength over the last five years or so but penetration has continued to be very, very solid for us. And while I can\u2019t give you a number, both are continuing to drive organic growth.","George Tong","Got it. And then going back to add-stops, can you describe how add-stops have evolved over the course of the quarter and how add-stops are evolving now into this current quarter so far?","Mike Hansen","I would say that for the quarter, we experienced a little bit of continued deterioration from our oil, gas and mining. Aside from that, I would say it was a pretty constant and consistent quarter. So, not a lot of changes, we went through the quarter and not much change since August 31. We are only a couple of weeks in, but nothing marketable to speak up.","George Tong","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Joe Box","Hi, Mike. Hey, Paul.","Mike Hansen","Hi, Joe.","Joe Box","So it\u2019s been a few years now since I think your last big addition with respect to route capacity. How are you guys thinking about route capacity going forward? Is it going to be added on really an as needed basis or do you think potentially we could be seeing maybe a broad based addition like we had a few years ago?","Mike Hansen","Generally, Joe, we want to continue to add routes throughout each year and we have continued to do that. So I wouldn\u2019t expect that we will have a big influx of routes anytime soon but a little bit depends on the nature of the economy and what we are seeing with our customers. But I would say I wouldn\u2019t expect to have an influx of new routes in the Rental business. In the First Aid business, we have continued to add routes. We have in that business, our SSRs really do drive a lot of growth and we want to make sure that they have the capacity, the time to spend selling and so we are fairly aggressive in adding routes to that business. But I will tell you with the Zee acquisition, there is a lot of integration to be doing and we\u2019re going to have to take that quarter-by-quarter.","Joe Box","Appreciate that. Thank you. And then maybe just as a follow-up on the macro point that you made earlier, I mean I think we all have a pretty good sense of what\u2019s going on in oil and gas and mining, but I am curious if you may be seeing a bifurcation between industrial oriented customers outside of oil and gas and mining versus maybe what you\u2019re seeing from consumer driven businesses, and if you\u2019re seeing any sort of a change how might that impact you?","Mike Hansen","I wouldn\u2019t say that we are seeing a marketable change from the other customers but the environment has been pretty good. I mean they are \u2013 when we can show them value, they will take additional products and services that do add that value. But I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019ve seen a marketable change to that, but certainly a different operating environment than our oil, gas and mining customers.","Joe Box","And then one last one from me. Paul, what was the margin tailwind in the Uniform Rental business just from the extra day?","Paul Adler ","Joe, typically that extra day in the quarter gives us about 40 basis points to 50 basis points improvement.","Joe Box","Okay. So if I would strip out the 40 basis points to 50 basis points and I think you said there was 90 basis points of tailwind from Energy within the Uniform Rental business, net-net we are looking at a gross margin that\u2019s down in the Uniform Rental business. Can you maybe put some color around why it would have been ex those items?","Mike Hansen","So, yes, we had a 70 basis in the Rental business, we had a 70 basis point tailwind from Energy but roughly 40. When we say 40 basis points to 50 basis points of work day, probably 40 of that is in gross margin, 10 of that is in SG&A. So let\u2019s call it about a 40 basis point benefit from the work day. We have talked about the Energy related customers creating a bit of a drag. Keep in mind when those customers stop or eliminate positions, that is lost revenue but we still have the amortization of the garments and we still are driving the truck to that customer. So we still have a lot of the cost without the revenue. That is basically an offset to that work day benefit during our first quarter.","Now I will tell you also, when you compare our first quarter gross margin in the rental business to the fourth quarter in a quarter that had the same level of energy, our gross margin was 190 basis points better. And let\u2019s take off 40 basis points from the work day, we still had a very nice sequential improvement and we feel very, very good about that. We are getting a lot of good leverage. ","And then the last comment I\u2019ll make is, one thing to keep in mind about last year was that our first quarter gross margin in Rental was the strongest of the year. It was 50 basis points better than any other quarter. We did have a very good quarter. There was a one-time customer buyout within the quarter that helped that gross margin. And so I think we had a very good gross margin quarter and I would expect that we\u2019re going to continue to see good leveraging within that business knowing that we do have a little bit \u2013 we are expecting a little bit of the tailwind or all of the tailwind of the Energy costs to go away in the latter part of the year. Does that help with our gross margin?","Joe Box","Yes. That\u2019s a perfect clarification. Thanks for that. Have a good night guys.","Mike Hansen","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andy Wittmann","Hey, Mike. What was the size of that buyout last year that you just mentioned? Can you quantify in terms of margin or dollars?","Mike Hansen","Yes. We had commented that it was about 50 basis points worth of growth which would effectively mean the same kind of thing on margin.","Andy Wittmann","Yes. It\u2019s basically, almost a 100% flow through when you have to do that.","Mike Hansen","Yes.","Andy Wittmann","Okay. So just on Zee Medical, I thought maybe you guys might call out the integration cost, closing cost separately but it looks like you\u2019re expensing that and just running that through the P&L and as a result you\u2019re not showing EPS accretion but can you give us an idea of if you take out some of those one timers of the integration cost, can you give us what those would have been for the quarter as well as your outlook for the year so we can get a sense of what the normalized or the introductory accretion is from Zee?","Mike Hansen","As you can probably tell from our guidance, we expect no impact on EPS this fiscal year. So this acquisition is about a third the size of our existing First Aid business. It\u2019s a large acquisition for us and there are a lot of integration steps to be done. We need to rebrand the trucks, we are putting people into Cintas uniforms, we have to convert the systems and we\u2019re going to be doing that over the course of the year. I would say the other thing about the Zee business, the routes were not as efficient as the Cintas routes. The custom, the revenue per route, the revenue per customer is not nearly as high as Cintas and so it\u2019s a bit of a - a little bit more of an inefficient business and we've got some work to do to integrate and get that to the levels where we want them to be.","Having said that the integration is going very well and we\u2019re excited about that business and its opportunity that it creates for our First Aid business. I\u2019m hesitant to get into any more specific integration costs in the first quarter. We really just got it in the month of May, I'm sorry in the month of August and had a lot of meetings training et cetera and we\u2019re really just now getting started on that. And so again, I\u2019ll reiterate, the current year we're not expecting any accretion, but we certainly do expect to get that next fiscal year. Once we see how the integration develops as the year goes on, we\u2019ll be more in a position to provide guidance at that point.","Andy Wittmann","Okay that's fair. We will look forward to maybe an update on that in the next quarter, maybe just can you give view or broad stroke view of what you think the cost synergies of the businesses are recognizing that there is route overlap and maybe some route underutilization that you inherited?","Mike Hansen ","I\u2019m not prepared to do that yet. I want to see more develop within the integration. We certainly have an integration plan, but I'd rather wait until we see a little bit more of the integration develop.","Andy Wittmann","Okay, that is fine. And then, I guess, are you seeing anything different on the competitive environment in terms of pricing you mentioned that it was additive to your quarter, it just seem like the last 12, 18 months was, I\u2019d say pretty good for the overall industry, I think you guys benefit and others did too, do you have tough comps or are your competitors getting more competitive with, for new business pricing. Is there any risk that we have to see in the future from the competitive environment?","Mike Hansen ","Well of course there is. The pricing is always competitive, there is no question about that and we are only able to raise prices when we are showing great value to our customers and that\u2019s the, as long as we can continue to show that we are providing great value we don't necessarily see a change in the environment unless the economy changes. I would say that based on that pricing environment, being relatively similar to last, the last several quarters, we haven't seen a lot of competitive changes in this first quarter. And I can't say that that won't happen in the future, but we haven't seen it yet.","Andy Wittmann","Got it. Okay, maybe just a final question just on the reclassification of the segments, I\u2019m curious as to why the fire protection got carved out and put into the other segment whereas the other stuff now redefined, the First Aid and Safety Business and maybe now that we have these new segments how we should be thinking about the margins as we model forward on those?","Paul Adler ","Andy, this is Paul. You probably know the accounting guidance is pretty descriptive about reportable operating segments and the guidance requires that companies evaluate their segments periodically and definitely when changes occur. And we had such a change in the first quarter with the acquisition of Zee, and therefore as a result of evaluating, reevaluating that as our reportable operating segments, looking at the guidance we needed to make some changes and the most material of those changes obviously are the fact that First Aid and Safety is now a standalone segment separate from fire. ","And then we also made a change in terms of including the sale of items from our catalogues to customers on our routes and including that in the Uniform, Rental and Facility services segment. So those are the two major changes and in the guidance it permits and it is acceptable than to - once you reach a certain threshold of segments and disclosures that the other business units than are combined into an all other segment and that\u2019s where fire is and that's where the direct sale business, you\u2019re thinking about direct sale to national accounts that type of business. That's where those reside.","Mike Hansen","Andy that fire business, the direct sale business there still very important to us. We believe that they are good businesses, but we are giving visibility to 90% of our revenue going forward and certainly the focus is on those two largest businesses that we have. As it relates to the margins of that All Other, you know we expect improvement just like we do in our Other Businesses and there are certainly as leveraged to be gained, there are route density opportunities and so we certainly do expect continued improvement because we have the Direct Sale business in there, it could be a little bit bumpy at times because of the ups and downs of that business, but generally speaking we expect improvement.","Andy Wittmann","That makes sense. Given that Direct Sale now got split between two segments there\u2019s a lot of moving parts, is it, are you guys thinking about giving us maybe last year's numbers restated for the - on a quarterly basis for the new classification of the segments by any chance? Should we be looking for that?","Mike Hansen","Yes. Actually in the earnings release income statements there is a table supplemental information and there we have recast it all the prior year quarter's by segments, we don't bring new gross margin income, assets, so you will have some good segment data under the new structure for fiscal 2015 and then obviously 2016 going forward.","Andy Wittmann","Perfect. Yes, I see that. Thank you very much.","Operator","We will go next to Sara Gubins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins","Hi thanks good afternoon. Could you talk about your manufacturing clients and are you seeing any change in the behavior?","Mike Hansen ","We have not seen much of a change in their behavior in this quarter compared to the last quarter. I would say that\u2019s true for not only manufacturing, but our other verticals, excluding that energy-related sector.","Sara Gubins","Okay. And then share repurchases really accelerated in the last three quarters, could you talk about how we might think about share purchase potential on a run rate basis over time?","Mike Hansen ","As we've talked about in previous calls, our goal is certainly to grow organically and followed by M&A and we would love other opportunities like Zee Medical, but when we have additional cash what we certainly will take a look at in increasing dividend, but then if there is cash remaining outside of those opportunities our board likes to put it to work and so I say that Sarah because a lot of it depends on how that cash balance looks and what the other opportunities for cash are. I would say that that buyback program has been quite a benefit, we believe to our shareholders and if we have available cash we\u2019ve shown that we will put it to work. While I can't give you any specifics because it\u2019s a board level decision I would just say that if we have available cash we like to put it to work. We have $381 million left on our current authorization and the board will be looking at our positions over the rest of the fiscal year.","Sara Gubins","Okay, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks very much. Guys could you comment on specifically oil and gas customers and mining separately with regard to what innings you think you are in on add stocks on both as is the headwind that has been certainly on oil and gas, do you think if you could speak to both on where you think you are on the cycle, thanks.","Mike Hansen ","That\u2019s a tough question, Scott. I would say that it felt like from an oil rig standpoint in the first quarter, there was some stability towards the end of the quarter. But then you read an article like in today\u2019s Wall Street where there are fracking firms that are starting to close up shop. That\u2019s a tough one to call. I would love to say that we are in the late innings of that oil and gas, but I don\u2019t know that I can say that. I would say that today \u2013 as of August 31, those oil and gas customers for us, the revenue is lower today than it was at May 31 because of continued net stops but I\u2019m not exactly sure, Scott, where that\u2019s going to end up.","From a mining perspective, we see some pretty hard hits and I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t give you much future guidance in that either other than to say that it\u2019s been a tough environment for the mining industries at least for our customers and I would expect that that\u2019s not going to turnaround overnight nor will the oil and gas customer impact turnaround overnight.","Scott Schneeberger","All right, thanks for that. And then you\u2019ve addressed some pricing questions earlier, but with regard to pricing across all of your segments, all of your markets and I imagine it\u2019s kind of soft in those two areas we\u2019re just talking about, but it sounds like it\u2019s pretty firm elsewhere. Is there anywhere else outside of rental that good or bad that bares attention or is everything fairly status quo? ","Mike Hansen","I would say that everything is status quo. Now keep in mind that Energy customer impact also does affect First Aid and Safety. We have a lot of good Energy customers but having said that, I would say that the pricing environment for most others is status quo.","Scott Schneeberger","Okay, great. Thanks, Mike.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Denny Galindo with Morgan Stanley.","Denny Galindo","Good afternoon. Just quickly on Zee Medical, how much decline in margins in that First Aid and Safety segment was strictly due to Zee Medical? Can we expect a similar amount of impact for the rest of the year?","Mike Hansen","I think that we would have had somewhat of an increase without Zee Medical in that gross margin. I would say that if the integration continues to go well and we start the process of rebranding and putting the routes on to our systems as the year goes on, we would expect to see some improvement. So I would expect that the drag that we saw in the first quarter is going to be the worst of the year and we should start to see a little bit of improvement. I would say that for the year we don\u2019t expected necessarily to turn positive for the cumulative year but by the fourth quarter we could see a little bit of benefit if the integration goes well.","Denny Galindo","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And another quick one there, is there any seasonality at all to Zee Medical or is there any \u2013 you added one month this quarter, is that a representative month or is it higher or lower than what the run rate will be?","Mike Hansen","I would say that from a seasonal standpoint, it\u2019s probably very similar to our business where we have a lot of outdoor activity in the First Aid business in the summer, a lot of construction sites et cetera. You get into the winter, you see better margins because of the cold and flu season. So I think it would track the same kind of performance of our First Aid business. Now, because of the disruption that is happening because of the integration, I am not ready to say that, that the month of August was representative of the year. I would certainly love to see us improve on that but we\u2019re going to need to let the dust clear a little bit on the integration before we can give you a good run rate number.","Denny Galindo","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then taking a step back, you talked a little early about route extension, are there any particular cities or metro areas that you\u2019re thinking could be a good opportunity? We had looked at your locations and it seems like the big cities like New York, LA, Chicago had a very low amount of your facilities compared to the total market but any color there would be helpful.","Mike Hansen","We think all of those areas are very good opportunities for more route density, no doubt about it. We do some comparisons internally and from one location to another and we\u2019ve got locations that are more mature where the route density is quite a bit higher than in some of the larger cities like New York and LA even Philadelphia. So we think there really are some good opportunities in a lot of big cities not just a few but a lot. We are not nearly penetrated to the extent we think we can be.","Denny Galindo","Okay. And another clean up one, any update on the SAP implementation? How is that going? Are you still thinking the timeline will be similar to what you thought in the past?","Mike Hansen","That project is going very well. We are on the same schedule as we talked about over the last few quarters. We are on the same cost expectation as we\u2019ve been over the last few quarters and so that means we would expect that we will come out of the realization mode at the end or towards the end of this fiscal year and start to put that system to work a little bit in fiscal 2017 from the standpoint of the roll out should start to happen. And so we will see a little bit of the \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t say a little bit, we will see some cost impact and we will quantify that more once we get to the point where we know we\u2019re rolling out but we will see some cost impact next fiscal year.","Denny Galindo","Okay. And then lastly sort of a bigger picture question, one thing we\u2019ve been hearing about a little bit is automation and it kind of feels like other analyst here talks about automation in terms of self driving cars and now you see here a lot in the restaurant industry servers or various positions there. Is that something that you\u2019re seeing it all in terms of your add-stops right now, any impact or is there something that could emerge as the headwind in the future if some of these uniform wears are taken out of the stocks to automation?","Mike Hansen","I can\u2019t tell you that we could \u2013 we\u2019ve seen a noticeable impact of that. I am sure it\u2019s happening here and there, but we haven\u2019t seen a noticeable impact. I would like to believe that we in North America are very entrepreneurial and we\u2019re going to continue to create jobs and replace certain jobs that get automated, and we\u2019re going to do our best to put those new jobs into uniform. We certainly believe that we want to continue to put more and different types of job functions into uniforms and we\u2019re going to continue to work on that. I think we\u2019ve been pretty successful over the last handful of years and that we\u2019re going to continue to look for those opportunities and I like to bet on the North American entrepreneur to create more jobs and we\u2019re going to put them in uniform.","Denny Galindo","Sounds good. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.","Gary Bisbee","Hi guys. Good afternoon. I wonder if you could share with us to help us think about the trending, what the organic revenue growth was from the new segments over the four quarters of last year.","Mike Hansen","I believe that I can give you a little bit of that, yes. So let me talk Uniform Rental and Facility Services, in the first quarter last year it was 8.5%, in the second quarter it was 8.1%, in the third quarter it was 7.9%, and as Paul mentioned in the fourth quarter it was 6.2%. So not a whole lot difference from what we reported especially directionally. From a First Aid and Safety standpoint, 10% even in the first quarter, 13.7% in the second quarter, 10.6% in the third quarter, 8.2% in the fourth quarter. From an all other standpoint, it was 0.8% in the first quarter, it was negative 0.5% in the second quarter, 3.6% in the third quarter, 3.8% in the fourth quarter and you can kind of see there a little bit of the bumpiness that we talked about in that direct sale business.","Gary Bisbee","And then I don\u2019t think you gave us any color on the other in the segment commentary. What was the organic growth this quarter?","Mike Hansen","Oh, I\u2019m sorry.","Paul Adler","It was 4.9.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. Thank you. And then is there any more clarity you can provide or directional commentary on what the after tax proceeds from the shredded sale is going to be or how we should think about taxes?","Mike Hansen","I would say that, so you can think about the \u2013 lets go to the midpoint of the range that Paul gave of 575 in proceed. Now one thing to keep in mind is some of those proceeds will drag out a little bit with kind of the customary holdbacks but let\u2019s go to the midpoint of that number. You will see on the balance sheet that there is an asset held-for-sale of 194, 275 that is our book value. The difference between the proceeds and that book value is a gain on which we\u2019ll have tax of 37.3%. In addition to that on the balance sheet, there is a liability held for sale of 78,457 and that essentially is a differed tax item because we did not pay any tax on last year\u2019s gain at the time of that transaction nor did we paid tax on the dividend that occurred in May. And so when we pay taxes, we will have a little bit of a catch up because of that differed liability.","I would expect that, as Paul said, we will see we expect that to close in the fourth quarter of this calendar year. I would expect that if that happens, we will pay those taxes in the first calendar quarter of next year.","Gary Bisbee","Great. Okay. And those taxes I guess will they flow through discontinued operations because that\u2019s where the gain is?","Mike Hansen","Yes, it\u2019s built into our tax rate and so you will see essentially a net income that is the after tax gain.","Gary Bisbee","Gotcha. Okay. All right, great. That\u2019s helpful. Probably not but any thoughts on plans for the proceeds? I know last time you got the first \u2013 there was a special dividend provided, any thought on doing that again?","Mike Hansen","We want to see that close first. Our Board will certainly have that on their agenda and we\u2019ll be talking about it but we need to see that close before we commit to spending it.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. And then one clean up one, what was the buyback number of shares in the quarter versus early in the second quarter. I think you lump them together. Is that fair?","Mike Hansen","I don\u2019t \u2013 Gary, I don\u2019t have that in my fingertips in terms of the \u2013 we did buy some shares in September, I don\u2019t have that at my fingertips in terms of the first quarter only.","Gary Bisbee","That\u2019s fine, don\u2019t worry about it. And then just one bigger picture question, I think you\u2019ve been asked this in a different way earlier but fiscal 2015 was the second year in a row where you pushed out client capacity additions that you talked about at the beginning of the year and I guess I just wanted to understand and once or twice you commented that permitting and things like that was part of the issue but how is utilization across the entire network and do you have markets today that aren\u2019t growing because you\u2019re so short on capacity or was that really \u2013 those additions you\u2019ve talked about and delayed, is that more giving you the capacity to grow for several more years? Thanks.","Mike Hansen","Yes, there certainly are those logistical issues of finding the right land, getting the permitting done and then actually building the building. We certainly do have some markets that have capacity that\u2019s getting tight. It\u2019s not preventing us from growing but we are getting close in some of those markets and we do need to add some capacity and our expectation is that we will do that towards the backend of this year, but it\u2019s not preventing us from growing.","Gary Bisbee","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Mike Hansen","Okay.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to John Healy with Northcoast Research.","John Healy","Thanks. Mike I wanted to see if you could give us a little bit more color about performance of the Texas and the Canadian regions. You have been upfront about the oil and gas and the mining exposure, but if you just look at those geographies beyond just the vertical they serve, if you just think about the state of the country, how do the growth rates to those two markets look compared to what you guys are reporting for the rest of your business?","Mike Hansen","John, I honesty I don\u2019t have that at my finger tips and I don\u2019t think I would like to give that level of detail out just for competitive reasons, but certainly in Texas and Canada, in West Virginia there are a lot of oil, gas and mining customers and those are the hardest hit areas. We are not shrinking in any of those areas, we\u2019re still growing and certainly not at the same pace as the rest of the country, but I don\u2019t have a number to share with you.","John Healy","I can understand that, but, I guess what I was hoping to get out was just kind of the spillover effect from the oil and gas, specific sectors into other areas of your business within those states, I\u2019m curious to get your thoughts on how much contagion did you see in those markets, was it worse than you thought, it is still to be felt, I\u2019m just trying to understand the spillover factor?","Mike Hansen","We talked a lot last year about that oil and gas being 2% to 3% of our total revenue that sector has gotten hit pretty hard. I would say that while that the - that sector has been hit hard and maybe a little harder than we would have expected, we haven\u2019t seen the spillover to be that much more significant and really not any more significant than we would have expected throughout the course of the last year. I think it has been fairly connected to that energy sector, but we\u2019ve been able to grow quite well despite that and so we don\u2019t see a lot of spillover.","John Healy","Okay. And then I wanted to ask on the M&A front, clearly after organic growth that\u2019s the your biggest priority. I think we are all pretty familiar with what is available to you in terms of asset potential on the Uniform side, but could you talk a little bit more about the First Aid and Safety, I wasn\u2019t that familiar with Zee Medical before the acquisition and are there a lot of kind of what I would say these mid size operators out there that would make sense, or what\u2019s the environment like for those types of assets, you know what\u2019s the landscape like there?","Mike Hansen","There are some small independent opportunities that could be out there. Zee did have a franchise network and so there are some opportunities there, at the right value. I would say there are not a lot of other large players when we think about that business the competition is coming from those smaller players, but also the do it yourselfers, the Grainger\u2019s, the people going down the Wal-Mart or Sam\u2019s club, so I would say that the M&A as the business exists today is likely going to be smaller tuck-in opportunities.","John Healy","Okay. And then just lastly, I might have missed it so I apologize, but the Shred-it move, when do you expect that to close, maybe you guys spend a month out there?","Mike Hansen","We\u2019ve said in the fourth quarter of the calendar year.","John Healy","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jason Rodgers with Great Lakes Review.","Jason Rodgers","Yes. I wondered if you could give the annual sales figure for Zee Medical, as well as sales by geography and perhaps how their margins compare to your First Aid and Safety business, thanks.","Mike Hansen","Well the annual revenues as we mentioned in our press release are about, we would expect $100 million to $120 million, because we will own Zee for 10 months this year, we are expecting $90 million to $100 million. I don\u2019t have at my fingertips the revenue by geography, but I will tell you that our margins are in the Cintas legacy First Aid business are better than Zee Medical, but we\u2019ve got a lot of integration to do and we want to see those things improve. I am not ready to quantify a synergy opportunity yet because I want to see more of the integration happen.","Jason Rodgers","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And we have no more questions at this time.","Mike Hansen","Well thank you again for joining us tonight and we look forward to speaking with you again at the end of our second quarter and we\u2019ll issue our second quarter earnings in late December. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation."],"5502":["Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call July 20, 2017  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Mike Hansen - SVP of Finance and CFO","Paul Adler - Vice President and Treasurer","Analysts","Manav Patnaik - Barclays","Andrew Wittmann - Robert W.

Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Hansen","Thank you and good evening. With me tonight is Paul Adler, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. We will discuss our fourth quarter results for fiscal 2017. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer any questions.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a Safe Harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the Company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","We are pleased to report that revenue for the fourth quarter, which ended May 31st was $1.530 billion, an increase of 23.1% over last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate, which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.1%. New business wins; penetration of existing customers with more products and services and customer retention remains strong. The organic growth for the uniform rental and facility services segment 8%. And the organic growth rate of the first aid and safety services segment was 9.2%. Fourth quarter gross margin improved to 44.4% from 43.9% last year. This is our 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement.","Operating income for the fourth quarter of $177.3 million decreased 11.2% from last year's fourth quarter. Fiscal 2017 fourth quarter operating income was negatively impacted by $63.7 million of transaction and integration expenses related to the G&K Services acquisition. Excluding G&K results and acquisition charges as well as a benefit from a change in the accounting for equity compensation as required by a recent accounting standard, our operating income margin was 16.4% versus 16.1% last year, an improvement of 30 basis points. Net income and earnings per diluted share or EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal '17 were $82.2 million and $0.75 respectively. Fiscal '17 fourth quarter EPS included a positive impact of $0.02 from the change in the accounting for equity compensation and $0.05 from the G&K business.","Fiscal '17 fourth quarter EPS included a negative impact of $0.50 from transaction and integration expenses and certain incremental nonrecurring bank fees included in the interest expense related to the G&K acquaint. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.18 versus $1.06 last year and 11% increase over last year's fourth quarter. Our fiscal 2017 results added to our record of success. We have now grown revenue and profit 46 of the past 48 years, with the only exception being the great recession years. For the seventh consecutive year, organic growth was in the mid-to-high single digits. We continue to grow by multiples in excess of both gross domestic product and employment. For the seventh consecutive year, we grew EPS double digits excluding the G&K results and acquisition related items as well as the benefit from ASU 2016-09.","And we increased the annual dividend for the 33rd consecutive year. For Cintas the past is indicative of the future because of the constant we share, which is our culture. Our culture is part of our strategy and drives our meaningful performance. We value honesty and integrity, competitive urgency, and challenging the status quo in a positive manner. Profitable growth is in our DNA. The opportunities for us to seize are significant.","Retail inspired garments, health care scrub rental, and branded rental garments like Carhartt, our recent investments in the product line which have a long runway. Our first aid and safety business has a run rate of more than $500 million and yet we just recently completed our national footprint. National account opportunities also remain. And despite acquiring a significant competitor, new business wins were up significantly over last year. Also our fire services business is only about 70 of the top 100 largest markets in North America.","We continue to evolve as a business services company helping over a million customers get ready for the workday. With an array of products and services including dust mask, hygiene products, first aid products and services, and fire protection services, we have a product or service for every business in North America. Our opportunity for continued growth is the 16 million businesses we currently don't do business with. Not only the opportunity is significant to expand market share, but we have huge potential to grow revenue and profit by penetrating our existing customer base.","Within our uniform wearing customer base, our penetration rates of other products and services with the exception of entrance mats are less than 20% and less than 10% of our customers do business with two or more of our business units. We've added sales reps specifically focused on penetrating existing customers. They're supported by a national branding campaign whose purpose is to educate on all that we can do for businesses so they can concentrate on their core competencies.","Cintas is a business that was built to last and that building doesn't stop. Our focus on the long term means that we make the needed investments. Our investment in an enterprise resource planning system is a significant one. The implementation of SAP will continue into fiscal year 2020 due to the additional operations from the G&K acquisition. Once completed, SAP will produce cost savings and will better equip us to cross sell. We will be a stronger company with this new technology.","And finally, we are excited about our recent acquisition of G&K. Preliminary results are very encouraging. We are on track to meet our financial and nonfinancial objectives and look forward to the many opportunities G&K provides. The synergies are compelling and result from the significant overlap in operations. Route density will also improve. We can spend more time helping customers solve their problems. We will have more time to sell into the accounts. The cost synergies alone will improve G&K operating margins to about 25% in four years.","So in sum, our record of success is a lengthy one. The past has been great, but the future too is very bright. So looking ahead to 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $6.27 billion to $6.36 billion and fiscal '18 EPS from continuing operations to be in the range of $5.15 to $5.25. Our guidance includes the following assumptions related to the acquired G&K business. No transaction and integration expenses. Revenue of $870 million to $900 million compared to a prior year run rate of $965 million.","Synergies of approximately $50 million to $55 million. Purchase price amortization expense related to intangible assets of $50 million. Interest expense on G&K acquisition debt of about $65 million and an EPS contribution of $0.15 to $0.17. Again this EPS guidance does not include any G&K transaction and integration expenses. However, we do expect to incur these expenses in fiscal '18 as we continue to integrate the acquisition. We estimate that these expenses will range from $50 million to $65 million.","Before I turn the call over to Paul, I want to discuss the G&K revenue guidance, we've discussed this over the course of the last year, but want to be clear. Obviously the two most significant components of revenue growth rate are new business and lost business. The legacy G&K operations just like Cintas operations will continue to have loss business in the normal course as contracts come up for renewal. The G&K loss business may be slightly higher than normal due to the disruption of the integration, but not significantly so.","The new business component from the legacy G&K sales reps though will significantly decrease for a temporary period. We are in a process of filling open positions and training all new reps on how to sell using the Cintas processes, how to sell Cintas products and services and to use the Cintas systems. As a result, the new business typically generated to offset the normal loss business will temporarily be reduced until the sales reps get back to their territories and begin to ramp productivity to normal levels. The result is that legacy G&K revenue will decline in fiscal '18. This was expected and we modeled the deal based upon this reality.","So now I'll turn the call over to Paul.","Paul Adler","Thank you, Mike. First, please note that our fiscal year 2017 continued one less work day than in fiscal year 2016. It was the third quarter that had one less day than the prior year quarter. One less workday negatively impacted fiscal 2017 total revenue growth by about 40 basis points and operating margin by approximately 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 2016. Looking ahead to fiscal '18, there will be no differences in workdays as fiscal '18 contains the same number of work days per quarter as fiscal '17. We have two reportable operating segments, uniform rental and facility services, and first date and safety services. The remainder of our business is included in all other.","All other consist of fire protection services and our direct sale business. First aid and safety services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement. The uniform rental and facility services operating segment includes the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats and towels, and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services. The segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogues to our customers on route.","Uniform rental and facility services revenue was $1.220 billion, an increase of 27.1% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes, the organic growth rate was 8%. Our uniform rental and facility services segment gross margin was 44.6% for the fourth quarter, an increase of 20 basis points from 44.4% in last year's fourth quarter. Current year fourth quarter gross margin of course included the margin on the acquired G&K business, which was 40.2% for the fourth quarter. Excluding the acquired G&K business, the Cintas legacy uniform rental and facility services business gross margin improved 100 basis points from 44.4% to 45.4%. The G&K gross margin will improve to Cintas legacy levels as we realize the synergies from the acquisition.","For instance, one of the factors resulting in a currently lower G&K gross margin is that energy expense as a percent of revenue is 80 basis points higher than the Cintas legacy business. This is the result of the smaller G&K business lacking the route density that the larger Cintas legacy business possesses. The fuel savings from route density along with the benefit of reducing redundant capacity will drive significant improvements in G&K gross margin. Our first aid and safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training. This segment's revenue for the fourth quarter was $134 million, which was 9.4% higher than last year's fourth quarter. On an organic basis, the growth rate for the segment was 9.2%.","I want to take some time to revisit the impact of the ZEE Medical business on this segment's organic growth rate. We acquired ZEE in our first quarter of fiscal 2016. ZEE was a significant acquisition, increasing the total first aid business by about one-third. In our fiscal 2017 second quarter, 15 months after the acquisition, this segment's organic growth rate was less than the typical high-single digits. This lower organic growth rate was due to two main reasons. First, not only was the acquired ZEE business significant in size, but it was also not growing. The ZEE Medical pre-acquisition had no sales force. Second, our focus in the first year of an acquisition is to secure the customer base and earn the trust of the acquired customers through outstanding service. On our second quarter earnings call of this fiscal year, we disclosed that we believe that the first aid segment's organic growth rate hit the bottom and the segment was positioned for improving organic growth rates.","We added sales reps to grow the ZEE customer base with our broad range of products and services. And meanwhile, the legacy Cintas first aid and safety business continued to grow at a strong pace. As we expected, our organic growth rate did climb from the bottom, increasing from 3.3% in the second quarter to 5.5% in the third quarter and now 9.2% in the fourth quarter. Thus the decline in the organic growth rate was expected due to the weight of the acquired business and it was temporary. The segment has returned to its customary organic growth rates in the high single digits and on a significantly larger revenue base. This segment's gross margin was 44.5% in the fourth quarter compared to 42.9% in last year's fourth quarter, an increase of 160 basis points. Our margins continue to benefit from the realization of ZEE acquisition synergies, including improved sourcing and the leveraging of the existing warehouses.","Our fire protection services and direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category. All other revenue was $175 million, an increase of 9.2% compared to last year's fourth quarter. The organic growth rate was 8.3%. All other gross margin was 42.8% for the fourth quarter of this fiscal year compared to 42% for last year's four quarter. The direct sale business by its nature is not the recurring revenue stream that our other businesses are. Therefore the growth rates are generally low-single digits and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multi-million dollar account. We installed some large accounts in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 driving double-digit organic growth in this business. One of these accounts was Southwest Airlines. Majority of the product was shipped and recognized as revenue at the end of fiscal 2017 as opposed to early fiscal 2018 as originally expected.","On July 11 2017, we sold a business that was not a good strategic fit. The business was reported as discontinued operations for the periods ended May 31st 2017 and 2016. Revenue and EPS for the sold business were about $26 million and $0.01 respectively in Q4 of fiscal 2017 and $28 million and $0.02 respectively in Q4 of fiscal 2016. Revenue and EPS for the business were about $105 million and $0.07 respectively for the full fiscal year of 2017 and $110 million and $0.07 respectively for the full fiscal year of 2016. These amounts are important to remember as you consider our fiscal 2018 guidance. Proceeds from the sale, net of taxes paid will be approximately $85 million.","Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 27.9% in last year's fourth quarter. 60 of the 70 basis points is attributable to the amortization expense of the intangible assets established in the purchase price accounting of the G&K acquisition. Our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the fourth quarter was 37.8% compared to 37.2% for last year's fourth quarter. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve build and releases relating to discrete items.","We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to be about 34%. Our cash equivalents balance as of May 31 was $169 million and we had $22 million of marketable securities as of quarter end. Cash flow from operating activities on the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter was $280 million dollars and free cash flow was $225 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were approximately $55 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows; $45 million in uniform rental and facility services, $7 million in first aid and safety, and $3 million in all other.","We expect fiscal year 2018 CapEx be in the range of $280 million to $320 million. As of May 31st total debt was about $3.133 billion consisting of $363 million in short-term debt and $2.770 billion of long-term debt. Our leverage at May 31st was 2.8 times debt to EBITDA. Subsequent to May 31, we repaid $50 million of the term loan. We expect our leverage ratio to decrease to approximately 2.3 debt to EBITDA at May 31st 2018. With $300 million of senior notes maturing in December that we will not refinance, $200 million of term loan and commercial paper, we have structured our debt to help us achieve our goal of reducing leverage to 2.0 times debt to EBITDA. Regarding SAP, since last quarter's earnings call, more locations have been converted to the system. As of the end of this month, we will have converted about 30 locations. We continue to be pleased with the conversion efforts and the capabilities of the new system.","Due to the acquisition of G&K, we are adjusting our SAP implementation plan as necessary. Certain G&K acquisition locations will also be converted to SAP. And therefore because of this additional work we expect the implementation to extend through fiscal 2020. The good news is that we can leverage the system over an even larger organization because the SAP hardware and software costs will not increase. They are sunk costs. We expect that fiscal 2018 SAP expenses will amount to approximately $30 million. This compares to about $12 million in fiscal 2017.","That concludes our prepared remarks, we are happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Manav Patnaik","Thank you good evening gentlemen. First question for you is just on the divestiture, maybe just a little bit more color on which part of the old business that was in and just why that was done?","Paul Adler","Manav, this is Paul. That business as you can tell from the numbers that we quoted was small in the scheme of things. It was really the combination of a couple of acquisitions that we had made years ago. It was an emergency services type business that provided emergency like plumbing and electrical work security door work, commercial cleaning, services of that nature. The difference was that that work though was performed by sub-contractors and so it's a model we kind of experimented with, but ultimately we decided that we wanted to self-perform service as part of our differentiation from our competition. And so therefore it was not a good strategic fit for us.","Manav Patnaik","And would that revenue fall into the all other line, is that where that would have fit?","Paul Adler","Yes. Primarily in the previous periods, it was in the all other bucket.","Mike Hansen","There was a small piece in the rental segment, but mostly in all other.","Manav Patnaik","And then just on the synergy side, you've laid out the cost synergies for the year and you've given us the guidance on this before, maybe just on the revenue synergies, any sense on when we should start expecting more color on that and any examples of how we should think of the revenue opportunity here?","Mike Hansen","Our first goal is to, as Paul talked about kind of on board our new customers, make sure that they understand our services and we expect that the primary integration activities will happen in the first two years. I think once we are then on the same systems and they are all of those locations, those new locations are trained on our products and services, I think will then start to see the opportunities. So my expectation would be that's a 2020 type of a conversation.","Manav Patnaik","Sorry, just last one, just to clarify. You said most of these synergies in the first two years, is that different from what you said before in terms of getting 130 to 140 over three to four years?","Mike Hansen","Manav, I said the most of the integration activities would occur in the first two years, that is different from the recognition of the synergies. So let me maybe talk a little bit about the synergies real quickly. We spent the fourth quarter really confirming our assumptions with our integration plan. And the good news is we did not see anything that changed our mind about our opportunity. No unforeseen issues, we still expect that it we'll achieve $130 million to $140 million in synergies. So that's I think that was one step and that's a good start for us.","We didn't do many integration activities in the fourth quarter because of the confirming and really spending time communicating with our new partners and our new customers. However we've gotten pretty busy in June and July. And in June, we did convert the G&K payroll to our payroll system that's a big first step and that went very well. We have converted to the Cintas financial system that's another big step that went well and we've gone through the first few waves of branch consolidations and those have gone well. And so I think we're off to a good start. No surprises as of yet and we really like what we've seen so far.","We mentioned that the year one synergies are $50 million to $55 million and let me step back and say, we did announce that we were closing the corporate headquarters and that closure is proceeding. And so certainly the year one synergies are certainly coming some from the corporate closure and other G&A activities, probably more than half of those first year synergies. And the rest are from the integration activities of the integration of locations. Again, we think that most of those integration activities are going to happen in the first two years.","The synergy recognition though generally will happen in the 12 months following that integration activity. So in year one we're going to see 50 to 55, in year two, I think we'll see another meaningful increase in synergies, and in year three, we'll see the annualizing of the year two synergy. I'm sorry the year two integration activities. We'll also start to see some sourcing benefits in that third year and we expect to fully realize the 130 to 140 in year four. So that's a little bit of the cadence of the synergy recognition and let's just - it's a little bit of a nuance but the integration activities are a little bit different than the synergy recognition.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew Wittmann","I wanted to build on that last one and to see if I could drill in a little bit more. So that you've got the synergy plan and integration plan pretty well mapped out for this year. I was wondering Mike, if you just give us a little bit of inside as what do you think you'll be ending the fiscal year at for like a run rate, just given the visibility that you have so far?","Mike Hansen","And are you saying a synergy run rate?","Andrew Wittmann","Yeah. You're going to recognize a 50 here and I was just wondering at the end of the year what do you think the annualized run rate will be at the end of the fiscal year?","Mike Hansen","I would - I'm hesitate to provide that because I want to see a little bit more, but I think it will probably be a run rate to about half of our total synergy number. And we'll start to see as we then get more integration activities, we'll start to get pretty close on a run rate perspective by the end of that second year. But I'm a little hesitant to give you a specific number because I want to see a little bit more of the waves happen.","Andrew Wittmann","Yeah that's fair. I want to drill into the guidance a little bit and just make sure that my understanding matches your understanding of it. In particular on the organic growth implication there, obviously you've got some moving pieces with not only G&K, but this disposition as well. I calculate something at seven or a little bit north of seven kind of being the organic growth rate implied in your guidance. Do you get to the math and can you help us understand maybe how that breaks down by segment?","Mike Hansen","Andy, I get a little bit less than that. Our last few years we've been in the kind of the 5% to 6.5% range and that's about where we are this year as well. I'm not going to get into that by segment, but I would say, we're in the same range we've been the last few years in terms of our opening guidance.","Andrew Wittmann","Maybe my final question was been on the margins. And I think if you did - if you give the numbers for rental segments, gross margins like-for-like or legacy Cintas, up 100 basis points. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit of help on breaking that down, where you got that and how those puts and takes are trending now as we move forward here into the new year.","Mike Hansen","I think that revenue, I'm sorry, the gross margin improvement is building on the same thing that we've seen over the course of the last few years. And that is continued leveraging of our infrastructure, penetrating existing customers, selling revenue that is not processed in our laundry facilities such that we get more revenue dollars out of our existing capacity. I would say those are the keys to that gross margin improvement. And we think that with the improving G&K gross margins over the course of certainly the next couple years, we think we still have some good run rate there.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mario Cortellacci with Macquarie.","Mario Cortellacci","Could you give us a sense of how much of your business is levered to employment trends or job figures versus history? It appears the business is a little more diverse, both within the uniform and also first aid and fire safety. Wondered if you could give us a little color?","Mike Hansen","Maybe I'll say that this way. Our revenue is roughly half uniform and then I'll move maybe into our rental segment, about half of the rental segment is non-uniform, so facility services made up of entrance mats, hygiene products, chemical cleaning solutions et cetera. So, today compared to let's call it ten years ago, the percentage of uniform revenue is certainly lower than then, it was probably closer to the 60%, 70% range back then. The other thing I would say is, is we have worked hard not just to create solutions that are non-uniform, but also within our uniform programs we worked hard to create innovative products retail and inspire products, garments solution based products that can reach new and different customers even in a time when there is not employment growth.","So in other words we think there is a large unserved opportunity out there and we have products and services I would say today that are better able to capture that unserved market than maybe ten years ago. And so when we look back over the last seven years or so, and I think we talked about our revenue growth being multiples of GDP and employment. A lot of it is because of the innovative garments that people want to wear. As well as then the non-garment solutions that we've created that really can create value for every type of business in America. So we feel good about that little bit of that decoupling from the employment that may be ride us a little bit closer ten years ago.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets.","Gary Bisbee","Hi guys, congratulations on closing the deal and it sounds like you're off to a real good start. I guess the first question I have you showed another quarter of sequential acceleration in the rental's organic revenue growth. What do you attribute that to - last quarter, you said that one of the factors that's been changing is you're doing great job on retention. Is that still it and I wanted to ask directly, how much business have you taken from G&K in this interim period from when you announced the deal to closing it, because it seems no one else in the industry is seeing acceleration, you are and there's a falling off. So I wonder if it's just the transfer from acquired to organic a piece of that?","Mike Hansen","It is not a piece of that, so we would not - when we convert revenue from, let's call it, that legacy system to our system, that certainly is not organic growth to us. So why the acceleration in organic growth? I think it is because we continue to execute at very high levels, I think we got a little bit of benefit in this fourth quarter, not I think - I know we got a little bit of benefit in the fourth quarter from a bit of a bounce back in - or a lessening of the negative in the oil and gas area. Last year, when we talked about fourth quarter performance, we had said that the headwind in oil and gas was about 100 basis points.","This year, we would have said, I think in the third quarter, we said 60 basis point headwind. We would say it's probably more like 30. And so the year-over-year comps in the oil and gas are starting to be beneficial. That won't last forever, but starting to be beneficial. So I think we got a little bit of bounce from that. But most of it is, you know, we continue to execute well. Our reps are very productive and customer retention remains good.","Gary Bisbee","Yeah. And I did mean to imply, you were doing something funky with the accounting. I just wondered if your sales people were targeting G&K customers and if you have a sense for if you won business, where people switched to you rather than dealing with whatever happened there, maybe you just don't have a sense for it, but?","Mike Hansen","Well, I mean, if you're talking post acquisition, we certainly wouldn't go and -","Gary Bisbee","I am talking from when you announced the deal in August until you closed, right, there is this period we said their sales productivity fell off, your revenue accelerated. And so I just wondered if you had any sense if your reps were going to those customers and saying, \u201cHey, you're going to be with us sooner or later, do you want to switch now and have some certainty around pricing coverage, you know, et cetera?\u201d","Mike Hansen","I apologize, I didn't catch that you had mentioned since the signing. I don't think that's - I don't think that's any part of the organic growth.","Gary Bisbee","Okay. Fair enough. And then just is there any of their revenue going into the other line, did they have some uniform sales or is it pretty much all in rental?","Mike Hansen","Correct. It's all in the rental segment. Yes. But there was a very, very small piece in the first aid business, I mean we're talking about 1 million - a couple of million dollars annualized, but aside from that, it's all rental.","Gary Bisbee","And then just one last one for me, you have historically, in the fourth quarter, given a sense of the mix by product categories. Is that something you're willing to share this year? Thank you.","Paul Adler","Yes. Gary, we have that for you. I can give you Cintas legacy business and the G&K business separately, just so you all for the first time, have a little bit of an idea of that mix. Going forward, it'll be very difficult, if near impossible, to separate the two as we continue to integrate. But for now, I can tell you that the Cintas legacy uniform rental business, about 49% of the revenue and I'm referring to the segment, not to the consolidated entity. So in looking at the uniform segment, 49% is garments. Dust control is 18%. Hygiene, which is restrooms, cleaning services, chemical services, that was 17% of revenue. Shop towels were 4%. Linen was 8% and catalog sales were 4%.","And then in comparison, for G&K, their uniform rental mix. The garments are 55% of total revenue. Dust is 15%. Hygiene is 3%. Shop towels are 9%, and let's see, linen is 14% and catalog sales were 4%. So it really highlights what we had talked about previously that this is a business that doesn't have as broad of an offering as we do and so some good opportunities for us. In the future, you can see that hygiene line is much smaller as a percent of the total than it is for us.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Scott Schneeberger","Following up on Gary's question with regard to recent trends in organic, you guys were talking about Southwest and some other large, a large new business that came through, the way I interpreted it was in the fiscal fourth quarter that you thought might have come in the first half of fiscal '18. Could you just elaborate what type of impact that will have near term, you've given the full year guide, so I think we have that understood, but maybe some near term consideration for that, if impactful.","Mike Hansen","Yes, Scott. We did roll the bulk of that program out in the fourth quarter. There is a very minimal roll out amount in the first quarter and then it - then it - as with these kind of programs, you get into a maintenance mode after that and so we would expect probably a little bit of benefit, a couple of million dollars in the first quarter and then tailing off into a maintenance mode after that. This was one that was - it was scheduled for right around the end of our fiscal year and so for the - for fiscal '17, as we were thinking about this a year ago and even six months ago, it was just - it was so close as to where it would fall and it happened to fall into the fourth quarter and our team did a real nice job of getting that to the customer.","Scott Schneeberger","You mentioned SAP, 30 million impact in fiscal '18, but that it would persist on to '20, you may not want to give further guidance on '19 and '20, but just trying to get a feel or if you could refresh how you're thinking about a total spend over the period, the long term period.","Mike Hansen","We - as Paul said, about $30 million in fiscal '18, about half of that is recurring and half non-recurring. And we would expect that that will go into fiscal '19 and then - and that will certainly be reduced - the non-recurring will be reduced in fiscal '20. We don't expect that implementation to take the entire fiscal '20 year, but it will go into '20. So we would expect something of the same in '19 and non-recurring less in '20.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Joe Box","So no mention on the route consolidation piece, I'm just curious is that a process that happens only when you guys consolidate facilities or can it be separate. And then when that route consolidation does happen, what's been your experience with the level of disruption you might have with your customers, relative to maybe the benefits you might see.","Mike Hansen","So you're right, we didn't - we really didn't speak a whole lot to the, let's call it, the prioritization of the synergy buckets. And so maybe I'll touch on that a bit. And so I'm speaking of the 130 to 140 now, we would expect that the largest bucket is the G&A stream. It's the elimination of redundant, corporate processes as well as some location G&A expenses. The second largest would be - the second largest bucket would be that production facilities. So the combination of locations, the elimination of redundant capacity is certainly a fairly good sized opportunity for us.","We think that third bucket will be the sourcing piece and while that is one of the longer timeframes of this process, we think that's a good opportunity. We think that from a routing perspective, there certainly is the fuel benefits that Paul talked about from combining the route forces and creating much more density. But we're hesitant to say that there will be a lot of route consolidation. We definitely need capacity on our routes to make sure that we have the time to meet with our customers, the time to build relationships, to make the service calls that we need to make. And so we see that as certainly a route optimization opportunity, but we don't see that as one of the bigger, a consolidation being one of the bigger opportunities there because we like the capacity.","We're general - for the last probably seven years, we've been adding routes every single year. And the last thing we want to do is cut routes only to add them again. So it's really more about route optimization. And now as it relates to the timing of that, an integration generally will mean the system is first. We have to get on the same system, so that our different operations can speak to each other. And once we get on the same system, then the route optimization can happen. So, it's usually following the location consolidation or system integration.","Joe Box","I guess, do you have the ability to bring a lot of G&K's route into your existing facilities or vice versa? Or you could pass the constraint maybe at the plant level and I guess ultimately, I'm trying to understand how much can be pulled and what the consolidation opportunity could be among the different plants, because obviously there's a lot of overlap.","Mike Hansen","I'm not going to get into a specific number, but I was - let me be clear. I was speaking of route opportunities there, not production facility and location opportunities. We think there is quite a bit of opportunity. That was that second largest bucket that I mentioned. So in other words, the servicing of the routes, we certainly think there are consolidation opportunities in many markets and that certainly is one that is a big part of our integration plan. I'm not going to get into location numbers, but that certainly is the second largest opportunity within that overall synergy play.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from John Healy with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","John Healy","Thank you. Mike, I wanted to ask a question based on the prepared remarks. I think, you made a comment that over the next four years, you would see G&K operating margin at 25%. Did I catch that right and if that is the case, maybe you can provide some perspective on where you could potentially see Cintas or what I would say real Cintas operating margins, maybe potentially over the next four years or so?","Mike Hansen","You did hear correctly, John and so if we think about that G&K block of business, that had been at about a 12.5% operating margin. The synergies of 130 to 140, it gets you to 25 or better percent of that block of revenue. So that's what I mean by that 25% operating margin for that block of business. Now, obviously, that block of business is - we're in the process of fully integrating that into this Cintas block of business. And so we will lose the specific reporting of that. But, if we add that kind of volume with that kind of incremental margin, I certainly see that, I want to say that alone is 100 basis point improvement in overall operating margins. And I think that we have room to grow still in all of our businesses as well.","So I think there is still opportunity in rental to drive higher. There certainly is opportunity in first aid and safety and the all other still has opportunity to grow. So without giving you a number, I think all of our businesses have opportunities to grow and the incremental margin from the G&K block of business certainly will be a big part of that.","John Healy","And I wanted to ask, I might have missed it, but did you guys give CapEx guidance for 2018 and is there any thought about what CapEx could be, maybe as a percentage of revenue or kind of longer term, once the businesses are completely married together and running smoothly? And then lastly, just on tax rate, I thought you said 34%, so a little bit lower than what you guys have seen in the last couple of years and I was just wondering if that's kind of a new kind of run rate for you guys.","Paul Adler","Yeah. John, the tax rate is lower because of that change in accounting standard on equity stock compensation. So it muddied kind of our results this year and that's why we're - that's one of the columns and the tables in the earnings release to try to get that out, so you can see an apples-to-apples comparison, but because of that standard, we do believe the effective tax rate will be lower than the typical 37% that it had been. So - and that's why we've guided that way. In terms of CapEx, we did guide - I thought it was in the script 280 million to about 320 million for fiscal '18. And, I think what is a percent of revenue, we've typically been in that 4.5% of revenue area. It's been higher from time to time in the past few years especially with the SAP spend of what, 140 million over the last three years. But I think that that's probably a good metric now to use going forward as a percent of revenue.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley.","Toni Kaplan","Can you provide an update on what you're seeing in the pricing environment, both in terms of existing business and new business wins. We heard from one of your primary competitors in the quarter that they were seeing some increased competitive pressure on pricing. So just wondering if you're seeing any of that as well.","Mike Hansen","I would say, Toni that the pricing environment hasn't changed a whole lot. It's still fairly constructive and it doesn't feel much different than it has for the last year or so. And I would say that that would mean that it's always competitive and it remains competitive, but I wouldn't say it's been any more so in the last quarter than prior to that.","Toni Kaplan","Got it. And then on de-levering, you mentioned you want to get to two times that EBITDA, just to clarify is that gross or net and then just on M&A, should we expect that you'll continue to do tuck-ins as you integrate G&K or would you sort of wait until the integration is over.","Mike Hansen","So the leverage question, generally, that's gross because some of the cash that we have on our balance sheet is outside of the US and can't really be used to pay down and some is in restricted. For example, letters of credit type things. So it is gross and we expect that certainly to come down nicely in fiscal '18. As it relates to acquisitions, yes, I would say that we like tuck-in acquisitions. We like them in our rental business and our first aid and safety business and in our fire business. And I would expect that once we get to that leverage level that we've guided towards, that two times range, that will become, I would say, active like we have been in the past.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Dan Dolev with Nomura.","Dan Dolev","Can you discuss the level of new business in the core Cintas rental that you're expecting for the next year? I think you discussed it for the G&K part and you discussed the lost business for both, but can you discuss it for the core - the new business for the core. Thanks.","Mike Hansen","Sure. We would expect growth in that new business. Certainly, that is the - that's the driving force behind our organic growth. We want to make sure we are signing up new customers, because that certainly helps with future penetration opportunities. We expect it to be strong and we expect it to grow over 2017 levels.","Dan Dolev","Did you expect it to be in line in terms of the magnitude, in line with the 2017 rate or higher or lower?","Mike Hansen","Yes. I would say yes, because the implied growth rate from our guidance that we talked about is pretty much in line with the last couple of years opening guidance and so, yeah, so that would be in line.","Dan Dolev","And the 5% to 6% rental or implied rental growth guidance, is it just conservatism?","Mike Hansen","No. We think it's a reasonable rate. It's where we've been the last couple of years and we certainly would like to do better than that, but I think as we look to the next year, we'll lap the energy - the easier comps from energy. As we sit here today, I would say that I feel - while the economy is constructive, I would say it's maybe not quite as so as it was six months ago. So what we feel good about the guidance and look if we do see the economy do better, if we start to see some - even some better penetration rates, we can certainly do better, but we think it's a good starting point.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Tim Mulrooney with William Blair.","Tim Mulrooney","Yeah. I'm just trying to get a sense for what your Uniform Rental gross margin could be in a couple of years. Can you point to any historical examples of when you increased your route density from an acquisition, how that impacted your gross margin? Was there any material structural lift when you acquired Omni or Unitog, for example? And if so, how long did that take to manifest?","Mike Hansen","I don't have anything from those two acquisitions right in front of me. Keep in mind those were 15 and 17 years ago, but I think as we think about today, given the synergy cadence that I kind of mapped out a few minutes ago, it certainly would imply that the G&K gross margin of 40 will improve. And I would expect that that improvement will be over and above where current Cintas levels are today. So while I'm not ready to give you a specific number, that certainly will be accretive to the overall gross margin of the rental segment. And I think we should see some nice movement in the next couple years as we complete the integration and recognize those synergies from the consolidation.","Tim Mulrooney","No, that's very helpful. And given the - we're running up against 5:00 here. I'll just throw one more out there. For a long time now, you guys have talked about 60% of new customer growth coming from no programmers. And the question I often get is where are these new customers coming from? Can you give us a few examples of new industries or verticals that you're entering or maybe in the early stages of penetration that maybe you weren't in 5 to 10 years ago? Uniform Rental has been around for a long time, obviously, and I'm just trying to get a better idea of where you're getting this very solid growth, where that's coming from. Thank you.","Paul Adler","Yes. You're right, Tim. We've talked about of our new business dollars, about 60% of them are coming from no programmers, those customers that don't have a rental program and yeah, I mean, there are a few buckets that we can talk about, the first is scrub rental. We've talked about that in the past. Scrubs was largely a direct sale, commodity and we work to change it into a rental program with a service element to help hospitals and other health care institutions control their inventory through those dispensing units, but that's something we've really gotten into in earnest in the last five years. It's a huge market and it's a market that we're in the very early innings of penetrating. And so we're getting some good wins, but we have a long way to go in that sector.","Another good industry for us, the sector for us for no programmers is in the trades areas, that Carhartt product line that we've talked about, that rugged look. Those are garments that really appeal to people that work in the utility industries or plumbers, electricians, anyone in trades and we've had a lot of traction with that product. So - and then just in general, it's really the recognition that, I think Mike mentioned this earlier, we have to gravitate in the product line to where the employment is. We've done a very good job of that by creating these garments, some are branded, but also creating garments that are more retail inspired, polos and microbial shirts, et cetera that we can get into industries that are customer facing like resorts, theme parks, et cetera. And so, yeah, a lot of opportunity, that just kind of gives you an idea of some of those no programmers that are out there.","Mike Hansen","And Paul touched on garments and I would say another difference is, over the course of probably the last five to seven years, we've - because of the breadth of our product line, we lead with facility services much more than we did maybe ten years ago. And so we are able with our facility services, I think, we talked about this earlier, we can add value to almost every kind of business there is, because almost every business has doors that can use entrance mats, have restrooms that can use our rest room and hygiene products. Many of them have employees that can use our first aid and safety services. Almost all of them have fire protection needs and so we're able to lead with non-uniform rental opportunities and solutions much more than we did ten years ago and that has certainly helped us as well.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Shlomo Rosenbaum with Stifel.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","I just want to probe a little bit more about the component of the moving parts of attrition versus new business in terms of your calculation that G&K's revenue would decline 7% to 10%. What's a normal attrition rate for that business and can you just discuss that a little bit in what you might be doing to just try and offset some of that. Generally, I think you guys are very customer focused and I would expect you to be even more so in a situation like this.","Mike Hansen","Sure. So you've heard us probably talk about our customer retention being in the mid-90% range. And G&K ran a big - ran a good business and they were in the - their customer retention was in the low 90% range and so when we think about that, let's call it, 7-ish lost business factor, that's not unusual for our industry and the difference as I spoke to in the prepared remarks, the difference is we'll continue to see that and we're certainly doing our best to build relationships with our customers. But that happens and typically a business will replace that with the new business efforts and there will be a temporary disruption to that replacement as we train our reps and get them productive.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","And how long does it take you to train those reps, because what you're also doing is you're not taking unskilled reps, you're taking reps that have been doing things in a certain way and I guess you're improving upon it, but you're not taking someone - very often, you're not taking someone green.","Mike Hansen","We're not, but that doesn't mean that they train and they're up to - they're up to normalized productivity levels as soon as they're finished training. It's a process and while the training, the specific training, maybe over the course of a month or so, the ramp up in productivity takes a bit of time and then in our business Shlomo, I'm sure you understand this, the weekly sales are not huge businesses. This is a momentum kind of a business and our new sales partners are going to go from not selling much at all to ramping up to $100 to $200 in revenue per week. And so it's a - that ramp up takes some time to make an impact on the overall revenue of the company. And so as we think about the - that replacing, we certainly are going to see an impact to our fourth quarter growth rates of fiscal '18 and now continue into probably the first half of fiscal '19.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Are you talking about the impact you're talking about where it's going to start to accelerate?","Mike Hansen","I'm talking about - when I talk about the impact, I'm talking about the fact that you're going to see some deceleration in our growth rate in that fourth quarter of fiscal '18 and into the first half of fiscal '19. So if you think about it, I mentioned that the revenue run rate of G&K is about 960 right now for our fourth quarter, right. We're guiding to 870 to 900 for the year. So clearly, our fourth quarter is going to have a less revenue for that block of business and that's going to impact growth. And that impact is going to happen for probably the first half of the year and then we'll start to see that acceleration come back.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","Just to be clear, you're talking about fiscal year '18 where you're going to see the impact or fiscal year '19 where you're going to see the slowdown?","Mike Hansen","Fourth quarter of '18 and first half of '19.","Shlomo Rosenbaum","So the training will come at that point in time after you've upgraded the systems?","Mike Hansen","No. The training is happening right now. The training is happening right now. It's just that again when we go through this period of time where this selling resource isn't bringing in much new business, it takes a little bit of time to recover from that.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll now take our final question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Judah Sokel","It's actually Judah on for Andrew. Just a very quick question here at the end. I wanted to clarify the clean EPS number in the quarter. We called out $1.18 for legacy Cintas, and there was also $0.05 of contribution from G&K. So I think it's pretty clear that would imply a $1.23 if you include G&K together. But I wanted to confirm that the G&K results include that $9.5 million of amortization or $0.05 of EPS. So if you fully included G&K, I'm calculating an adjusted EPS of really $1.28. Is that the right way to think about it, adding back the amortization?","Mike Hansen","Well, you are correct in saying that certainly the $1.18 plus the $0.05 get you to $1.23 as a clean number. Yes. The amortization was $9.6 million in the quarter, which is roughly $0.03. So if you want to add that back, yes, that would get you to $1.28. And you'll notice when we convert to our guidance for fiscal '18 and show a comparison of fiscal '17, you'll notice that we show a baseline of 4.77 [ph]. And so just to be clear, that is then the Cintas legacy plus the G&K operating results plus the ASU impact on the full year that gets you to the 4.77. Is that clear, Judah?","Judah Sokel","Yeah. That is.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Mike Hansen","Well, thank you, again for joining us tonight. We look forward to talking to you as we complete our first quarter and have our conference call in September. Good night.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect."],"5440":["Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call December 18, 2014  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Bill Gale - SVP and CFO","Mike Hansen - VP and Treasurer","Analysts","Greg Bisbee - Barclays","Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Dan Dolev - Jefferies","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","Operator","Good day everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call.","Today's call is being recorded.","At this time I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Gale, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Bill Gale","Thank you for joining us this evening. With me is Mike Hansen, Cintas' Vice President and Treasurer. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","As we reported in today's press release, our results for continuing operations adjusted to exclude all impacts of the document management businesses are more representative of our ongoing performance. Therefore, our discussion of the company's performance will be based on that, the exclusion of document management.","We are pleased to report second quarter revenue of $1.123 billion. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency and the Shred-It transaction was 7.2% for the second quarter. Rental organic growth was 8.1%. And First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services organic growth was 12.1%. The performance of our sales force in both businesses remain strong and penetration of additional products and services into existing customers continued.","Our second quarter gross margin was $481.4 million or 42.9% of second quarter revenue. This was a nice improvement over last year's 41.3% as we continue to leverage our infrastructure, continue to operate very efficiently, and increased our revenue per stop from added penetration at existing customers.","Second quarter operating income was $181.6 million or 16.2% of second quarter revenue. This was a 20.7% increase over last year's second quarter operating income of $150.5 million or 14.3% of last year's revenue.","Second quarter net income and earnings per diluted share as adjusted also improved nicely compared to last fiscal year second quarter amount, as adjusted. Second quarter net income was $103.7 million, which was 9.2% of revenue and grew by 24% over last year's second quarter. Second quarter earnings per diluted share as adjusted was $0.86, which grew over 26% compared to last fiscal year's second quarter figure as adjusted of $0.68.","As Scott Farmer indicated in our press release today, our employees, who we call partners, have executed our game plan very effectively, and we look forward to the second half of our fiscal year.","We are updating our fiscal 2015 guidance as a result of our second quarter results. Before discussing the guidance though, let me make a few comments on our views of the economy.","We have certainly been pleased with the U.S. employment growth in the last few months. While the employment growth continues to be more narrow than we would like, the overall growth totals have been good. This has not yet translated into marketable improvements in our rental net add-stops metric. But our customers are recognizing the value of our products and services and our penetration continues to be solid.","Our guidance assume that the U.S. economy will remain in this current state during the second half of our fiscal year. We do believe, however, that this economic state is fairly fragile. Many macro factors such as interest rate environment, energy prices and global economic issues could upset the U.S. momentum, and so we are hesitant to turn too optimistic.","With these views in mind and based on our second quarter results, we now expect our fiscal 2015 revenue to be in the range of $4.45 billion to $4.5 billion. We now expect our fiscal 2015 earnings per diluted share guidance to be in the range of $3.49 to $3.54. When excluding the special items of the impact of the document shredding business and the additional gain on the Shred-It transaction, the impact of the sale of stock and an equity investment and the impact of the discontinued operations, including the sale of document storage and imaging business, we expect fiscal 2015 earnings per diluted share guidance to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.25. This EPS guidance is detailed in the table within today's press release.","I will now turn the call over to Mike for more details on the second quarter performance.","Mike Hansen","Thanks, Bill, and good evening. Before moving into the second quarter results, let me remind you that there were 65 work days in this year's second quarter, which is the same as last year's second quarter. Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2015, we will have 65 work days in each quarter, for a total of 260 work days for the fiscal year. These work day figures for fiscal 2015 are the exact same as in fiscal 2014, so we will have no work day differences or adjustments for the remainder of this fiscal year.","We have three reportable operating segments, Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales, and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services are combined and presented as other services on the face of the income statement.","The rental uniforms and ancillary products operating segment consists of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restaurant supplies and other facility products and services.","Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $865 million, which is up 7.6% compared to last year's second quarter. Organic growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency changes, was 8.1%. Organic growth was higher than total growth because of the weakening of the Canadian dollar.","As Bill mentioned, the performance of our sales team continued to be strong. We did not see a marketable improvement in net add-stops compared to last year's second quarter, but we did see our typical seasonal net adds for jackets and entrance mats. Entrance mat net adds were somewhat stronger than last year due to the early wintery weather this year. Penetration of additional products and services to existing customers remains strong.","Our Rental segment gross margin was 44.8% for the second quarter, an increase from 42.9% in last year's second quarter. Energy-related costs were 20 basis points lower than in last year's second quarter. We've continued to leverage our infrastructure and are operating very efficiently.","The second quarter Rental gross margin of 44.8% was a decrease from this fiscal year's first quarter gross margin of 45.1% due to a number of items, none of which are significant. Energy-related costs in the second quarter were 20 basis points lower than in this year's -- this fiscal year's first quarter.","Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog.","Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the second quarter was $117.5 million, which was 3.6% lower than last year's second quarter. When adjusting for foreign currency changes, the organic decrease was 3.2%.","Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 27.6% for the quarter, a decrease from last year's second quarter gross margin of 28.8%. This decrease was due to lesser volumes and a mix towards lower-margin accounts.","Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training, and fire protection products.","First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the second quarter was $140.4 million, which is 12.7% higher than last year's second quarter. Organic growth was 12.1%. As has been the case for the last few years, this business continues to execute at high levels and continues to innovate with new products and services.","This segment's gross margin was 43.8% in the second quarter, which is slightly above last year's second quarter of 43.4%. Energy-related costs were 20 basis points lower than last year's second quarter. The second quarter gross margin of 43.8% is fairly consistent with this fiscal year's first quarter gross margin of 43.7%. Energy-related costs were 20 basis points lower than the first quarter.","Moving to a few comments on the document shredding business. As a reminder, under U.S. Generally Accepted Account Principles, we will continue to include document shredding results in last fiscal year's income statement. However, beginning with the first quarter of this year, fiscal 2015, we no longer record any document shredding revenue, gross margin or operating income. Instead we will simply show our share of the partnership income in our corporate operating segment. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, there was a slight loss of $300,000 net of tax from the partnership.","Switching to selling and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 26.7% as a percentage of revenue in the second quarter, compared to a total company SG&A in last year's second quarter of 28%. When excluding the impact that document shredding had on last year's second quarter SG&A and revenue, last year's adjusted total company SG&A was 27% as a percent of the adjusted revenue. The decrease in SG&A as a percent of revenue from last year's adjusted 27% to this year's 26.7% is made up of a number of minor changes from last year, none of which are of any significance.","Looking ahead to our third quarter, keep in mind that payroll taxes reset with the new calendar year. We expect this resetting to increase third quarter payroll taxes by roughly 80 basis points over second quarter levels.","Our effective tax rate was 37.4% for the quarter, compared to 37.8% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on tax reserve billeds [ph] and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the fiscal 2015 effective rate to be 37.3%.","As we discussed on our first quarter conference call, we changed our accounting classification of the document storage and imaging business to discontinued operations, effective with this fiscal year's first quarter reporting. The classification of this business as discontinued operations means, under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, that we must condense all income statement impact from the business into one line on the income statement for all periods presented. As a result, we no longer show any document storage and imaging revenue, gross margin or operating income in either this year's or last year's income statement. Instead, the entire results in both years are condensed into one line on the income statement, entitled 'income from discontinued operations net of tax.'","For this year's second quarter, we had $17 million of net income from discontinued operations net of tax. This income resulted in earnings per diluted share from discontinued operations of $0.14. Included in this net income figure is a gain on the sale of the document storage and imaging business totaling $16.3 million net of all related expenses and taxes.","As we announced on November 6th, 2014, we sold this business in three separate transactions which closed this past October and November. The aggregate consideration of these businesses was roughly $180 million. We received roughly $160 million of cash at closing with holdbacks [ph] of roughly $20 million to be determined over the next 12 months. The gain in this second quarter was computed based on the $160 million of cash received at closing.","Our cash and cash equivalents were $827 million at November 30th, an increase of $245 million from the $581 million at August 31st. Again we received cash of $180 million from the sale of document storage and imaging -- $160 million. The remaining increase was generated from our operating cash flow. Keep in mind that we paid our annual dividend of $202 million on December 5th.","Accounts receivable increased $21 million since August 31st due to the increase in sales. New goods inventory and in-service inventory levels at November 30th were $236 million and $528 million, respectively. These balances are fairly consistent with the balances at August 31st.","Accounts payable increased roughly $30 million since August 31st due to the timing of vendor payment due dates. Current accrued liabilities were $503 million at November 30th, an increase of $210 million. This increase was due to the accrued dividend of $202 million at November 30th.","Note that the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale at August 31st were sold as part of the document storage and imaging sale, except for certain document storage real estate properties that remain classified as held for sale at November 30th, these properties are currently being leased to the buyers of that business.","Long-term debt remained at $1.3 billion, representing roughly 1.7 times EBITDA.","And finally, CapEx for the second quarter was about $45 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $35 million in Rental, $3 million in Uniform Direct Sales, and $7 million First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $250 million to $275 million.","That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now be glad to answer any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Manof Phenix [ph] from Barclays.","Greg Bisbee - Barclays","Hi. This is Greg actually calling on for Manof [ph]. Just wanted to get some details on your energy costs in this lower cost environment. Does the current guidance that you have assume that oil prices and gas stay this low or is there potential upside should we remain at these low rates?","Bill Gale","Greg, as you know, our guidance has a range of about a nickel, and our basic assumption is that, generally speaking, the experience that we had in our second quarter will continue for the rest of the year. So let me just give a little color on that, because we anticipated this.","If you look at the average price of fuel, and this is taken from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in our fiscal second quarter, the average price of gas was $3.13 a gallon and the average price of diesel was $3.71 a gallon. In the first quarter, the average price of gas was $3.54 a gallon and the average price of diesel was $3.88 a gallon.","Now, keep in mind, a little over 50% of our fleet is diesel, and we have not seen the dramatic drop in diesel prices that we've been seeing in gas prices. But if you think about what happened in our energy prices from the first quarter to the second quarter as a basis of revenue, we had about a 14 or 10-basis-point decline in the cost of our revenues.","So, you know, while it's having an impact, we would expect the kind of experience we had in the second quarter to continue through the year. If we get what we saw late in the second quarter continue through the year, then we -- that would help us, all else being equal, to achieve toward the higher end of the guidance.","Greg Bisbee - Barclays","Okay, very helpful. And I guess along the same theme, I was wondering if you had gotten any feedback from your customers on the lower costs and if it's impacting their business and maybe, you know, specific to your energy customers, how big is that to you, and what do you expect that impact to be for those contracts?","Bill Gale","Well, no particular industry is overly significant to us, but there's no question that if these energy prices continue with these levels, our exploration customers, which have been pretty robust here in the last several years, are going to be impacted. And therefore, if they start laying off some of their employees, that will certainly have an impact on our revenue from those type of customers. It's not material but it will have -- it will be negative. On the other hand, lower energy prices would seem to me to drive some benefit for other types of businesses.","So I think it's hard to really say whether or not it's going to have, you know, a negative or a positive impact on the company because there's going to be some industries that will benefit and some that won't.","Greg Bisbee - Barclays","Fair enough. And if I can sneak in one more, just on the buyback slowdown this quarter, does that have anything to do with the special dividend and what's your appetite for buybacks going forward?","Bill Gale","Yeah. We are certainly, you know, keep everyone in mind. We bought $250 million worth of stock late in our fourth quarter, into the first quarter, this past fiscal year. We did pay the special dividend in addition to our regular dividend in early December. We also have indicated that we are very, very interested in making acquisitions. And we are continuing to pursue, you know, a fairly active pipeline. Obviously nothing significant has happened at this point, or we would have announced it.","So in view of the fact that we may not find the acquisitions that we would like to have, I think the Board has shown in past experience that we will certainly be active in purchasing our own stock if warranted.","Greg Bisbee - Barclays","Okay, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Whitman from R.W. Baird.","Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird","Thanks. First, I wanted to give a very sincere congratulations to you, Bill, on a great career, and many successes, and Mike also. Big shoes to fill. Bill, I think we'll all miss your ability to put a dour outlook on the economy when your numbers are actually quite good. So that's what I'll miss the most about these calls.","Bill Gale","Well, thank you for the kind words, Andy.","Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird","Yeah. But that being said, I have dovetail that into a question, because I think it's the question that everybody is going to be asking, when you look at the guidance range, it looks like there's a material deceleration in the growth rate that you're assuming, in EPS. The fuel benefit only gets better from the average levels that you saw in the second quarter, you alluded to that upside, you know, puts on the top line here. But is there something in the business here that you're seeing either somewhat offset on the cost side coming in or deceleration in some of the businesses that we should be aware of that leads us to the guidance range that you've given here?","Bill Gale","Well, I think as Mike mentioned in his comments, keep in mind, we've got the payroll tax reset, which is approximately an 80-basis-point impact in our third quarter. We also had a second quarter in which our experience in our workman's comp and auto claims was better than it had been in the previous couple of quarters. We tend to see a slight increase at our medical costs in the third quarter -- in our third quarter. So with that said, we see a little bit of headwinds there, you know, which will impact the SG&A line and thus would impact the overall margins.","I think we've got to keep in perspective that the energy cost, try to put that when I responded to Greg at the first question, is not as significant as some may believe. Certainly we would benefit from continued low gas prices, but it's not as significant as I think some people think. Because our overall energy costs are 2.5% of revenue, of which the delivery side of it is approximately 1.5%.","Now, so with that said, we still would like to see a broader employment growth. We have not seen any adds to speak of at existing customers. We have seen additional penetration of products and services at our customers, but we've yet to see really the uniform wears being added. Were that to happen, then we would certainly be at the upper end of the guidance, but based on our current view, we thought the guidance that we provided was appropriate.","Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird","Got it. So just -- you mentioned efficiency, obviously the business model has got some leverage in it, but efficiency was a word that was mentioned a few times. Last we checked, the implementation of SAP to the uniform business, the Rental segment, you know, still kind of more in the future than present [ph]. Is there anything that structurally that's new and different or are we seeing other things like leverage, and frankly, price contribution adding more to the margin expansion we're seeing here? I think those are other key questions, then I'll leave it there.","Bill Gale","Andy, you're right, the last two things you hit on, leverage of the infrastructure and the price increases have certainly benefited margins. The SAP system is still in its early stages. We will not be piloting anything, at the earliest, until our fiscal 2016, and therefore there really won't be anything benefiting us probably until latter part of 2017 or 2018.","So right now it's really one of just getting additional volume within our routes and through our plants. We mentioned previously that we will be constructing some new facilities in various markets. We're not moving as rapidly as we once thought, as we continue to look for the appropriate pieces of land. And therefore, that's one of the reason why you saw a reduction in the CapEx guidance, because we don't think we'll be moving as fast with those -- that new construction as we originally thought.","So I would say that as long as we can continue to leverage what we've got, we'll continue to see margins at these levels, adjusted for the SG&A I talked about earlier.","Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird","Would you -- on the pricing, would you say that pricing continues to get better sequentially here? Is it --","Bill Gale","You know, we're a little concerned, it's okay to the second quarter, but as we see these lower gasoline prices in the headlines, we're wondering, is that going to create some difficulty for the industry to continue to get the kind of pricing that we've been seeing lately. So I think there is a concern out there that, you know, we'll have to make sure we explain this properly when we continue to try to get price increases.","Andy Whitman - Robert W. Baird","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sara Gubins of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe just a follow-up on the discussion around pricing. Could you give us any sense of the magnitude of price increases that you're seeing?","Mike Hansen","No, Sara, we don't talk about those in any magnitude publicly. We just, as we said in the first quarter and a little bit today, we did see an improvement in the pricing environment in the last six months compared to a year ago.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. Okay.","Last quarter when you talked about margin expectations, it sounded like you were thinking that they'd be flat in the absolute versus the first quarter. And then of course in the second quarter they were up quite nicely. I'm wondering what drove the surprise, if it was a surprise, but what drove the surprise in the quarter. And it may have been pricing and it may have been a little bit of energy, but I'm wondering if there was anything else.","Mike Hansen","Well, in the second quarter relative to the first, our overall gross margins were about the same, we got -- which was a very good level year over year, helped by nice -- the nice pricing environment, helped by leverage of our infrastructure, and the penetration of new products and services. The real sequential margin improvement was in that SG&A where Bill mentioned we had better workers' comp and auto experience in the second quarter.","And the other thing we talked about in the first quarter was the extra G&A, if you will, because of the document shredding contribution, so we lost quite a bit of revenue to cover that extra G&A. And we've done a very good job of managing our cost structure and kind of rationalizing that G&A to the organization that we have today. And so we're pleased with the execution there.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And then just last question, would it be possible to give any more color on what's driving the strong uniform rental growth? And I'm thinking new programs versus some market share shifts.","Bill Gale","I think a lot of it's driven by the strong execution of new business by our sales organization, so, new customer adds, primarily from the programmer side [ph]. Again approximately two-thirds of our new business is coming from customers who have not used the services before.","But I think it also is driven by the additional products and services. As we've spoken about for the last several years, we continue to expand our offerings both within the Rental segment as well as within the First Aid and Safety segment, to provide additional things to our customers. And I think that has helped the growth rates in both those segments.","Sara Gubins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Jefferies.","Dan Dolev - Jefferies","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Question on the gross profit in uniform rental. So if I look at the incremental margins in Q1, they were very strong, in the mid 70s. They decelerated a little bit in Q2. My question is, so it stopped the accelerating trend which started early last year. My question is, it seems like it should be accelerating given the cheaper energy prices. So what was -- what made it decelerate? And the second part of the question is, what kind of level do you think you can maintain throughout 2H? Thanks.","Mike Hansen","Well, Dan, in both quarters, our gross margin was very strong, and it's been that way for a number of quarters now, and we continue to get very healthy incremental gross margin in that business. And as long as we continue to penetrate and make our customers more valuable, as long as we can continue to grow without adding capacity, it should be healthy. And so, you know, overall that incremental margin was still very healthy.","Dan Dolev - Jefferies","Absolutely. But you see that not decelerating significantly below, so, call it the mid-60s to high-60s.","Mike Hansen","Well, I think, Dan, some of that depends on the mix of the revenue that comes. And we've talked a little bit about adding some capacity, rental processing capacity in a few markets in the future. And so it depends on the timing of that capacity addition and it depends a little bit on the mix of revenue that we get. If we see a marketable improvement in our customers' hiring, we may see even better incremental margin.","Dan Dolev - Jefferies","Great. Thank you, and congrats again for both of you for the promotion and for the retirement.","Bill Gale","Thank you, Dan.","Mike Hansen","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Box from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hey. Good evening guys.","Bill Gale","Hi, Joe.","Mike Hansen","Hi, Joe.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets","So I just want to take the rate question from earlier, just take it from a different angle. When you guys are looking at rates and you're saying that rates are actually up, are you looking at core rental rates or are you maybe looking to say a yield number that might include ancillary fees like loss waiver, stuff like that? Just trying to understand what it is.","Mike Hansen","What do you mean by rates, Joe?","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Well, just maybe the core rate that you might charge a customer per day. When you're saying pricing is going up.","Mike Hansen","When we're talking about pricing, being a little bit of a better environment today than a year ago, what does that mean? Is that your question?","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Correct. Correct.","Mike Hansen","Yeah. Well, that -- generally that means when we are renewing some accounts, we're able to do it at a little bit of a better level. When we have -- our contracts generally have an annual price increase opportunity and that annual price increase opportunity can be a little bit easier. And it just comes back to our ability to speak to the value that we're providing to our customers. And we've been able to do a pretty good job of that in the last six months.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets","That's good to hear, Mike. I just wasn't sure if that was, you know, you're maybe able to tack on some additional surcharges and that was able to raise the bill, and you're maybe considering that core pricing. But it doesn't sound like that's the case.","And then -- maybe just switching gears then. I'm curious, from a high level, are you guys starting to see new business formation? Are you still seeing subtractions? Has that been a positive driver? Or is the organic growth really more of a function of ancillary products to existing customers at this point?","Bill Gale","Well, there's still no question, we're adding new customers, Joe. Is that indicative of the economy, adding new businesses? I don't think we really could say that for sure, because there are so many businesses that were out there that weren't using our services. So I don't think we could, you know, tell you that there's all these new business adds or whatever. I can just say, from our perspective, we're able to get more companies to take our services and we're getting more of our existing customers to take some of our other services. So I think those are the two primary reasons why you're seeing the growth.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Understood. Just one last follow-up for you. Are the payroll taxes higher than they'd normally be in 3Q, so there'd actually be a year-over-year impact? Are you just pointing out the sequential change?","Bill Gale","Sequential change. We're just trying to make sure that everyone understands that. No, it's not a year-over-year thing, it's a sequential change.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay. So I guess I'm really just trying to understand then why there wouldn't be better SG&A leverage in the back half of the year. And I certainly understand there are some minor things in there like auto claims and workers' comp.","Bill Gale","No, there's a lot of things in there. And I think what we're telling you is that we would not expect there to be a significant improvement in the overall SG&A number at this point. We think we've done a pretty good job given the fact we lost a lot of revenue from the document shredding and document storage transactions, and we're trying to get that revenue right-sized for the -- those costs, right-sized for the remaining revenue.","I just -- I think that so many of you do you models and then you want to assume the same level of SG&A from the second quarter and the third quarter. So we're telling you that's not the case. What we're also telling you is that we would expect the rates that we saw in the second quarter adjusted for payroll taxes, adjusted for potential increases in workman's comp type cost, to basically be comparable for the rest of the year.","Joe Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Understood. Thanks guys, and great quarter.","Mike Hansen","Thanks, Joe.","Bill Gale","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Thanks. Yeah, let me add guys, Bill and Mike, congratulations to both of you.","So you covered it well earlier, but just curious if you could add, if you want to do so at this juncture, your oil and gas exposure as an end-market, just that part of the total mix. I know you mentioned that you didn't think it would be too material on a direct level, maybe on a broader level over time. But just curious on that. Thanks.","Bill Gale","Scott, it's in the low single digits. It's nothing of any significance. I don't have the exact number, but as you followed us for years, there's just no one industry that really impacts us all that much.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Great. Thanks. Appreciate that.","And then curious on M&A pipeline, you addressed that a little bit earlier as well. Would appreciate if you could delve a little more into the types of things you're seeing. Obviously you have a lot of cash sitting over [ph] on the balance sheet right now, a lot of flexibility with things that you do. And I know that you're going to come across this as a dumb question, but is document management, which seems to have some M&A activity, completely out of the picture? Thanks.","Bill Gale","Yeah. Document management is completely out of the picture. We've disposed of the storage and imaging business and we still have our 42% share of the joint venture, but we will not be pursuing any document management transactions within Cintas any longer. We certainly are going to pursue acquisitions in our other businesses. And we will continue to do. There are some big ones, there are some small ones, and there are some good regional players.","We also will continue to pursue other businesses that either will complement one of the segments we're already in or may perhaps even be another new segment, although historically we've never gone into a brand-new segment in any big way without testing it first.","So I just wanted to be sure everyone understands that we are actively pursuing things within First Aid, Safety, Fire, as well as in the uniform side of the business, and we will continue to do so. But we will not make an acquisition that doesn't make sense economically just because prices may have become a little frothy.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Great. And good job and congratulations again.","Bill Gale","Thanks.","Mike Hansen","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","Good evening. I was wondering if, Bill, you meant to say, to get to the high end of the revenue guide, that we need add-stops to pick up. I know you said something similar to that. But is that what you meant?","Bill Gale","To get -- I really didn't address the revenue, Andrew. I was talking more about the profit side, because I think it was more of a margin question.","To get at the high, you know, yes, if we -- I would know. I would tell you that the high end of the revenue guidance does not assume a significant improvement in add-stops. If it would assume a continued good pricing environment, a continued impact of good new business results, and the penetration that we've seen.","If we were to see a lot of our customers really adding people and therefore increasing the revenue per stop in a significant way, we certainly would be able to get to that top end of the guidance plus some as we go forward.","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","Yes. I'm still sort of curious about this add-stop and wondering if you think add-stops will increase this cycle, because when I look at the Labor Board's [ph] diffusion index, it's broadening out. And it's including categories that seemed extremely relevant for uniforms, like manufacturing and warehousing and transportation, but perhaps they're adding people in areas that are uniformed, or something along those lines that I was just wondering if you feel like, if this continues, that add-stops will go up?","Bill Gale","I certainly hope so, but I will tell you from our experience with our existing customers, we are not really seeing that type of activity. Now we're not seeing declines either.","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","Right. Which category do you think needs to kick in more for add-stops to go higher?","Bill Gale","Which category, you mean like which\u2026","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","Manufacturing, transportation?","Bill Gale","Services, I think just generally services. That's the bulk of our customer base, are in the service sectors.","Andrew Steinerman - JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Bill Gale for closing remarks.","Bill Gale","Again I want to thank everyone for joining us this evening. And on behalf of all my fellow partners here at Cintas and our management team, we want to wish you a very happy holiday season. Mike will be back in March to give you our third quarter results.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We do appreciate your participation. Have a great day. Thank you."],"5441":["Cintas Corporation (NASDAQ:CTAS) Q3 2015 Earnings Conference Call March 18, 2015  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Mike Hansen \u2013 Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer","Paul Adler \u2013 Corporate Controller","Analysts","Andrew Steinerman \u2013 JPMorgan","Greg Bisbee \u2013 Barclays","Andy Whitman \u2013 Robert W Baird","Faton Begolli \u2013 Merrill Lynch Bank of America","Nate Brochmann \u2013 William Blair","Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer","Joe Box \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Operator","Good day everyone and welcome to the Cintas Quarterly Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.","At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Hansen, Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Hansen","Good evening and thank you for joining us this evening as we report our third quarter results for fiscal 2015. With me is Paul Adler, Cintas' Corporate Controller. After our commentary, we will be happy to answer questions.","The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the SEC.","As we reported in today's press release, our results for continuing operations adjusted to exclude all impacts of the document management businesses are more representative of our ongoing performance. Therefore, our discussion of the company's performance will be based on the exclusion of document management.","We are pleased to report third quarter revenue of $1.109 billion. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions, foreign currency and the Shred-It transaction was 7.5% for the third quarter. Each of our businesses organic growth was positive for the third quarter with rental organic growth being 7.8%, Uniform Direct Sales being 4.8%, and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services organic growth being 7.5%. The third quarter revenue impacts from severe winter weather and the oil and gas related customers\u2019 was relatively minor. Paul will touch on this when discussing the individual business results.","We\u2019re also pleased to show continued improvements in income as adjusted compared to last year\u2019s third quarter as adjusted as operating income increased 17.1%, net income from continuing operations increased 20.2%, and earnings per diluted share increased 25%. Certainly, lower energy related costs help the comparison to last year, but we also feel good about our ability to leverage our infrastructure and manage our cost structure. Paul will discuss the energy related cost in more detail. We want to recognize our employees and we call partners for their dedication and competitive urgency in serving our customers. They continue to do a great job.","Let me make a few comments about the Shred-It investment. First, regarding the presentation on the income statement, we have pulled the results out of SG&A and included in a line under income taxes entitled loss on investment in Shred-It, net of tax. This is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and provide the pure indication of the performance of the business.","Second, regarding the third quarter impact, we\u2019ve recognized a $6.8 million net loss for our third quarter or negative $0.06 per share. This negative impact was primarily due to integration costs such as IT, system converting costs and rebranding costs. In addition, Shred-It has a fairly large presence in Canada and the weakening of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. dollar also had a negative impact.","The conversion in general though, continues to progress as planned and we are pleased with the performance of the business. We indicated in today\u2019s press release that we acquired 3.2 million shares of our common stock during the third quarter. The total cost was $251 million and the average cost per share was $78.84. This buyback had $0.01 positive impact on our third quarter EPS and we expected to benefit the fourth quarter by $0.02.","As we announced on this past January of 13th, the Cintas\u2019 Board authorized a new buyback program of $500 million and that entire program remains available as of today. We also announced in today\u2019s press release that we have updated our guidance. We now expect our fiscal 2015 revenue to be in the range of $4.46 billion to $4.49 billion. We have tightened the revenue range slightly to reflect continued weakening of the Canadian dollar and for potential oil and gas related customer impact. While we did not see any noticeable revenue impact in the third quarter from our oil and gas related customer, we did began to hear from them that a negative impact is coming.","On the EPS side, we now expect our fiscal 2015 earnings per diluted share guidance to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.58. When excluding the special items of the impact of the Document Shredding business and the additional gain on the Shred-it Transaction, the impact of the sale of stock in an equity investment and the impact of discontinued operations including the sale of the Document Storage and Imaging business. We expect fiscal 2015 earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.31 to $3.34. This EPS guidance is detailed in a table within today\u2019s press release.","I will now turn the call over Paul for more details on the third quarter performance.","Paul Adler","Thank you, Mike. Before moving into the third quarter results, let me remind you that there were 65 work days in this year's third quarter, which is the same as last year's third quarter. Our fourth quarter will have 65 work days, which is the same as last year's fourth quarter, for a total of 260 work days for the fiscal year. Looking ahead to next fiscal year, fiscal 2016 will have 262 work days, so two more than this year. By quarter, the work days will be 66 in the first quarter, 65 in the second and third quarters and 66 in the fourth quarter.","As Mike mentioned total revenue in the quarter increased 7.0% excluding last year\u2019s impact of Document Shredding. Total revenue increased organically by 7.5%. Total company gross margin was 42.9% for the third quarter of this year compared to 42.3% in last year\u2019s third quarter. The current quarter gross margin of 42.9% expanded 80 basis points from last year\u2019s third quarter gross margin of 42.1% adjusted to exclude Document Shredding.","Total company energy related expenses for this year\u2019s third quarter were 2.4%. Last year\u2019s third quarter energy related expenses were 3.2%, but excluding Document Management they were 3.0%. I\u2019ll discuss gross margin and energy related expenses by business in just a moment.","Before doing so, let me remind you that we have three reportable operating segments: Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products, Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services. Uniform Direct Sales and First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services are combined and presented as other services on the income statement.","The Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products operating segment consist of the rental and servicing of uniforms, mats, towels and other related items. The segment also includes restaurant supplies and other facility products and services. Rental Uniforms and Ancillary Products revenue was $859.5 million, which is up 7.2% compared to last year's third quarter. Organic growth, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency changes, was 7.8%. Organic growth was higher than total growth because of the continued weakening of the Canadian dollar.","We did not see any noticeable third quarter revenue effect from oil and gas related customers, but as Mike mentioned, these customers businesses did begin to feel the impact of the low oil prices in the later part of the quarter. Aside from the oil and gas related customers, we saw no marketable change to net add stops in the third quarter.","Our Rental segment gross margin was 44.6% for the third quarter, an increase from 43.9% in last year's third quarter. Most of these improvements came from energy related costs, which were 70 basis points lower than in last year\u2019s third quarter. The third quarter Rental Segment gross margin of 44.6% was a slight decrease from this fiscal year\u2019s second quarter gross margin of 44.8%. Energy related costs in the third quarter were 20 basis points lower than in this fiscal year\u2019s second quarter.","Our Uniform Direct Sales operating segment includes the direct sale of uniforms and other related products to national and regional customers. Uniforms and other related products are also sold to local customers, including products sold to rental customers through our direct sale catalog. Uniform Direct Sales revenue for the third quarter was $112.2 million, an increase of 4.2% compared to last year's third quarter. When adjusting for foreign currency changes, organic growth was 4.8%.","Uniform Direct Sales gross margin was 27.7% for the third quarter, a slight improvement from last year's third quarter gross margin of 27.5% and this year\u2019s second quarter gross margin of 27.6%. Both of these improvements are mostly due to lower energy related expenses. Our First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection Services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products, safety products and training, and fire protection products.","First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection revenue for the third quarter was $137.1 million, which was 8.2% higher than last year's third quarter. Organic growth was 7.5%. We continue to be very pleased with this business. Third quarter organic growth came down some from previous quarters due to fewer repair jobs on the fire protection side of the business and due to the severe winter weather in the Northeast.","This segment\u2019s gross margin was 44.3% in the third quarter, an improvement of 80 basis points compared to last year\u2019s third quarter gross margin of 43.5%. Energy related costs were 60 basis points lower than last year\u2019s third quarter. The third quarter gross margin of 44.3% was an improvement over this fiscal year\u2019s second quarter gross margin of 43.8%. Energy-related costs accounted for 40 basis points of the improvement.","Switching to selling and administrative expenses, total company SG&A was 27.2% as a percentage of third quarter revenue, compared to a total company SG&A in last year's third quarter of 28.6%. When excluding the impact that document shredding had on last year's third quarter SG&A and revenue, last year's adjusted total company SG&A was 27.8% as a percentage of the adjusted revenue.","On our second quarter call, we indicated that our risk management claims experience was better than the previous year and that better experience continued into our third quarter. Keep in mind however that we are self-insured. In addition to risk management and number of minor improvements were realized in other expense categories.","The third quarter SG&A of 27.2% was a 50 basis point increase, compared to the 26.7% in this fiscal year\u2019s second quarter. As we mentioned on the second quarter call, payroll taxes reset in our third quarter. This expected increase was partially offset by a number of minor improvements in other expenses.","Our effective tax rate was 36.2% for the quarter, compared to 36.7% last year. The effective tax rate can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on tax reserve builds and releases relating to specific discrete items. We expect the fiscal 2015 effective rate to be 37.3%. Our cash and marketable securities were $490 million at February 28, a decrease of $337 million from the $827 million at November 30th. This decrease is due to paying the $202 million dividend in early December and the execution of the $251 million share buyback during the third quarter, partially offsets by cash generated from our operating cash flows.","Accounts receivable decreased $12 million since November 30th, due to the timing of collections. New goods inventory and in-service inventory levels at February 28th were relatively consistent with November 30th balances. Accounts payable increased roughly $27 million since November 30th, due to the timing of vendor payment due dates. Current accrued liabilities decreased by $221 million since November 30th, due largely to the payments of the accrued dividend, which was paid in December.","Long-term debt remained at $1.3 billion, representing 1.6 times EBITDA. And finally, CapEx for the third quarter was about $50 million. Our CapEx by operating segment was as follows: $43 million in Rental, $2 million in Uniform Direct Sales, and $5 million in First Aid, Safety and Fire Protection. We expect CapEx for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $220 million to $250 million.","That concludes our prepared remarks and we\u2019ll now be glad to answer any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.","Andrew Steinerman","It\u2019s Andrew. I definitely appreciate you\u2019re kind of talking about oil clients upfront because you\u2019d be asking anyhow. But my question is when you look at your percentage exposure to oil clients, has it changed since you talk about those in late December and whey you say that you\u2019ve allowed for some room for easing with your oil clients into fourth quarter, how much is this going to move the kind of fourth quarter organic number like is this a big deal or you\u2019re just trying to kind of communicate one small piece of the business?","Mike Hansen","Andrew, we knew that we would get out this question, so we\u2019re trying to anticipate a little bit. The magnitude of those oil and gas customers has not changed since the second quarter, so it\u2019s still in the lower single-digits. And when we think about the fourth quarter, more of the impacts based on our guidance movement is due to the Canadian dollar, but there will be a little bit of an impact from the oil and gas customers. We have started to hear from them that they are reducing workforce to some extent. But like I said the impact is within our guidance and the amount of those customers hasn\u2019t really changed.","Andrew Steinerman","Great. And just \u2013 the business even if they reduce people, I mean the uniform rental business doesn\u2019t move quickly so I could try \u2013 again maybe I will try one more time, do you think that the oil and gas clients pulling back might move your organic rental number 10, 20 basis points? Or is that higher given the low single-digit exposure overall?","Mike Hansen","Well, I think it will be a relatively small move. And while we \u2013 I hesitate to give too many specifics, but I think it certainly is going to be less than a percentage point of impact in the fourth quarter. Now, the other thing I would say Andrew is we\u2019re in the midst of this impact and we\u2019re hearing from customers making moves on a daily basis if you will. And so, it\u2019s a little bit hard to peg it exactly. We do think certainly that it\u2019s within our guidance. As we get into fiscal 2016, we\u2019ll certainly have to continue to evaluate how this moves and speak to that in July, but again it\u2019s not \u2013 it is a relatively small portion of our overall revenue.","Andrew Steinerman","I appreciate. Mike, let me try one more time. So 95 plus percent of your business continues to be strong, right.","Mike Hansen","Yes.","Andrew Steinerman","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Gary Bisbee with RBC.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good afternoon, this is [indiscernible] for Gary, not to continue along the oil and gas exposure, but I think you guys mentioned last quarter some of the pricing pushback potentially from customers regarding lower fuel prices. Is that tended to materialize in the quarter and any comment on that?","Mike Hansen","Our pricing environment in the third quarter was relatively the same as the second quarter. So we didn\u2019t see much of a change, I think what we had signaled last quarter was that look as we \u2013 as those customers start to feel the impact of the lower oil prices, conversations about pricing may be a little bit more difficult. But we did not see a dramatic change in the pricing environment in the third quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Fair enough thanks. And I guess in terms of the \u2013 add-stop metric, I guess any kind of commentary around that and any more color just regarding, I guess, in the overall context of the job market here?","Mike Hansen","Well we, as Paul said, we didn\u2019t see a noticeable change in the net add-stops number and that\u2019s as you\u2019ve probably heard from us that\u2019s been relatively consistent over the last several years. And I think the impact of net add-stops on a quarter specific basis is just not that large and that\u2019s the way it is been for the last-gasp five years and that\u2019s what we saw in the quarter, just not much of an impact.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. ","Mike Hansen","We certainly love to see our customers begin to hire at a higher rate and feel the impact of that, but we didn\u2019t see that in the third quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Fair enough. And then I guess in terms of these Shred-It impact are you guys wanted to disclose, I guess what potential impact that could be on fiscal 2016 estimates or any whether it\u2019s going to be material for your guys or kind of expected impact from that?","Mike Hansen","Well I will tell you, a year ago when we closed that transaction, we certainly with Shred-It put together a business plan and that business plan included certain performance expectations, certain synergies, certain integration costs. And that I would say that that integration is going as expected and we continue to be happy with that business. But because we are in the midst of that integration process, the results and the cost of those re branding efforts and IT conversion efforts are little bit unpredictable right now. And so we are not prepared to give really much of a forecast for the fourth quarter and certainly not for our fiscal 2016. As we get into fiscal 2016, that may change, but we need to see more of the integration be completed before we\u2019re going to be ready to give forecasts.","Unidentified Analyst ","Great and if I could sneak one more, and I guess could you guys comment, I guess on the M&A pipeline and kind of the activity levels there and, I guess, if the valuations are increasingly higher for you guys in the context around that would be great, thanks.","Mike Hansen","Sure, we do have an active pipeline were we are constantly looking for opportunities in that area. I would say that evaluations are generally fairly high, but we\u2019re certainly willing and looking for opportunities in that area. Even though nothing significant is close we\u2019re still that is a great use of our cash and we\u2019re still looking for those opportunities.","Unidentified Analyst ","Great, thanks so much.","Mike Hansen","Sure.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.","Greg Bisbee","Hi, this is actually Greg calling on for Manav. I was just hoping you add a little bit more color on the weather impact for this quarter. I know the weather is pretty bad last year, just want to see how much for tailwind that actually was for the quarter?","Paul Adler","I would not say that it was a tailwind for the quarter. Last year, you are correct, last year the winter was fairly severe and it really affected our document management business more than any other business. It also tends to affect our first aid and safety and fire business a little bit more. And so I wouldn\u2019t call that a tailwind for this quarter because yes obviously we don\u2019t have the document management results and we had some weather issues this quarter in first aid safely and fire as well.","Greg Bisbee","Okay. And then I guess on document sales here [indiscernible] some of the tough comps, can be a little bit lumpy but this mid single-digit range that you had is that a reasonable expectation for what you are thinking about that business and what it can do?","Paul Adler","I am sorry you are talking about the document management business.","Greg Bisbee","I am sorry, Direct sales \u2013 Uniform Direct Sales.","Paul Adler","Uniform Direct Sales, all right.","Greg Bisbee","Sorry for that.","Paul Adler","That\u2019s a very good business for us and we do believe that it can grow in the mid single-digits. We want to make sure that we\u2019re selling the right accounts and profitable accounts. We aren\u2019t interested in selling commodity direct sale of uniforms but we do believe that can grow in the mid single-digits.","Greg Bisbee","Okay.","Paul Adler","But as you say it is a bumpy ride with that business.","Greg Bisbee","Okay. And just one more from me on the CapEx guidance trending well there, is that being pushed out fiscal 2016 or is that kind of, you\u2019re realizing that you don\u2019t need to do quite as much or how should we think about that?","Mike Hansen","I would say that the processing capacity that we spoke off in the first half of the year is getting pushed into next fiscal year. We still have some SAP spending. As you know, we\u2019re in the midst of the SAP projects for rental. And we\u2019ll see a little bit of that get pushed into next year as well.","Greg Bisbee","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is [indiscernible] calls on for George Tong. I just wanted to touch on Uniform Rentals and see if you can give us a little more color on what\u2019s really driving growth there, is it new customers, is it better pricing, give us a little more color on that.","Mike Hansen","Sure, it\u2019s \u2013 I would say that it\u2019s a same thing that\u2019s been driving for the last several quarters and that is good new business sales, so new customers. It is penetration of existing customers with additional products and services and certainly pricing has helped this fiscal year as well. We\u2019ve talked about the pricing environment being more positive this fiscal year than compared to last fiscal year, so that\u2019s certainly has helped us well. So it\u2019s a combination of the three of those.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. And touching back on CapEx, I know you were planning to build up some new facilities to expand your production capabilities or your processing facilities. I just wanted to see if there is any update on those plans?","Mike Hansen","We still are actively working on those plans. As I have mentioned that the actual spending has been pushed \u2013 will get pushed into next fiscal year, but we still do need some capacity in certain areas and we\u2019ll be moving forward with those plans next fiscal year.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks for the color.","Mike Hansen","Sure.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Andy Whitman with Robert W Baird.","Andy Whitman","Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Like I just wanted to understand the \u2013 some of the impacts of Shred-it here and maybe the first thing is a definitional question in your guidance. You mentioned that Shred-it \u2013 your guidance excludes \u2013 assumes I think you said considers no contribution from Shred-it. Is that saying that you expected to be EPS neutral or are you saying Shred-it is going to do what it\u2019s going to do and you\u2019re not considering that in how you\u2019re guiding. And the reason why I ask this is for the quarter obviously it had a \u2013 I guess a negative $0.06 impact and previously my working assumption was that Shred-it was going to be EPS neutral. So I guess this restructuring but thought that was contemplated. Was what you saw in Shred-it unexpected for you or where you guiding exclusive of Shred-it from the get-go?","Mike Hansen","We\u2019ve been guidance exclusive of Shred-it. We that integration \u2013 while it continues as expected, it can be a little bit unpredictable in terms of when this spend happens and so we\u2019re just not prepared to give good guidance on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We do really believe that synergy opportunities are being achieved and will continue to be achieved and we really do believe that \u2013 that it will be additive to us. But we\u2019re in a little bit of a period of unpredictability and hesitant to give any kind of guidance as a result.","Andy Whitman","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Is it even meaningful to try to get the quarterly breakdown, now that you\u2019ve pulled the Shred-it contribution out of the SG&A and put it on its own line, would you be comfortable giving that and even if you did can we make anything of it?","Mike Hansen","Sure it will. I mean the quarter itself was $6.8 million and prior to this in the second quarter, I believe it was roughly $300,000 of a net expense, in the first quarter, because in our first quarter we were so close to the transaction date, that there weren\u2019t a lot of integration activities happening.","Andy Whitman","Yes, Okay, all that is helpful. I think \u2013 that\u2019s it, I think all I have for this time. Thanks.","Mike Hansen","Okay.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Faton Begolli with Merrill Lynch Bank of America.","Faton Begolli","Hi, this is Faton Begolli calling in for Sara Gubins. So my first question is on the SMP implementation. Could you update us on the role out of that and what benefits you are seeing?","Mike Hansen","Well, we are in a very early stages and so that the early stage is mean we are \u2013 we\u2019re still building the system, we expect to be able to pilot that system, probably something early fiscal 2017 and if all goes well, then we\u2019ll start to see a roll out some time in fiscal 2017 and continuing into fiscal 2018. So we\u2019ll start to see the depreciation of that system, partially in 2017, probably if all goes well, a full year in 2018 and really want to start to see the benefit until we get to that point. So we haven\u2019t seen any benefit of it yet nor have we seen any real expense yet.","Faton Begolli","I see, okay. Thank you and you also mentioned no change in add-stops. We had a point where we \u2013 where you would expect growth there or what would it take a expect growth in that metric?","Mike Hansen","Well it certainly would take our customers hiring at a more accelerated pace. When we think about the jobs, certainly the headlines are looking better and that is good news. We just haven\u2019t seen that translate to net add-stops yet. Keeping in mind that the last several months are seasonally adjusted and so it gives a little bit difficult to equate the BLS information to our net add-stops. But we just haven\u2019t seen yet and we need to see our customers more rapidly hire.","Faton Begolli","I see, okay. So switching gears to a potential acquisition, so giving your recent performance and your recent operating results, would you expand the countries outside of the U.S. few acquisition. Is that in your plan?","Mike Hansen","Well we \u2013 I would say that our first priority and our first preference would be to acquire businesses that are in our existing businesses within the U.S. and Canada. As certainly we will get the most value and synergies out of those kind of acquisition opportunities. Having said that, if we were able to find the right acquisitions internationally and in the right businesses we certainly would take a look at those. But as you probably seen from Cintas over the years, we would likely be a little bit more cautious about that. But our preference is acquisition opportunities in our existing businesses in the U.S and Canada.","Faton Begolli","Got it. Thanks. Okay, so my last question is just a housekeeping question, what do you expect for a share count for the end of the year?","Mike Hansen","I would \u2013 we are expecting something around $119 million.","Faton Begolli","Okay, that is all I have, thank you.","Mike Hansen","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We will take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nate Brochmann","Good evening, everyone.","Mike Hansen","Hi, Nate.","Nate Brochmann ","So I want to follow-up a little bit on the add-stop metric and I know we haven\u2019t really seen an increase in I know that we kind of been fluctuating from neutral, maybe the slightly positive and even sometime slightly negative. But if we were to assume that maybe at some point that starts getting moving, would there be anything in the cost structure or anything in terms of just utilization or capacity at a point that we\u2019d have to add so significantly that we could not at least for a period of time recognize maybe some historical relationships between the increase in the add-stop and then incremental gross margins that would get associated with that route density?","Mike Hansen","Well, if we saw a rapid pick up in adds, so keeping in mind, we would likely have some additional material cost when a customer adds a new employee. We will go to our stockroom where we have existing garments and we\u2019ll pull as many of those existing garments as we can and those are already in our cost structure. However, there are times due to size, differences, et cetera, where we may have to order some new garments as well. So there is a little bit of an incremental material cost impact. We then have to wash those instead of those garments sitting in our stockroom, we have to wash those garments and sort them.","But then from a service standpoint, we\u2019re already going to that customer, we\u2019re already delivering and there really isn\u2019t any additional cost there. So it is a very accretive kind of business and its great business and we love to see more of it. Would we get enough net add-stops to dramatically affect our capacity where we\u2019d have to really see some significant hiring in order to do that. So, we\u2019d have to have a lot of net add-stops affecting one or two or a few locations and that\u2019s unlikely.","Nate Brochmann","Okay, and yes that\u2019s helpful. And then second \u2013 and I don\u2019t know if there is anything that you can really share, but obviously you\u2019ve been very successful over the last several years in terms of adding some new services, anything new in the pipeline that we can talk about or anything else in terms of that incremental in terms of the extra cross-selling opportunity?","Mike Hansen","Well, we\u2019re certainly always working on new products and services, no question about it. We are still working hard to penetration as many customers as possible with our Carhartt program. We\u2019ve talked about Scrub Rental program and our chemicals. And those are still selling very, very well and the growth rates are still very good. I\u2019m not ready to talk about any new items, but the really nice thing about our business is we\u2019ve got close to a million customers that we\u2019re seeing generally on a weekly or monthly basis and that relationship and that frequency create some good opportunities for us. And so we\u2019re always looking and we\u2019re currently working on ways to improve \u2013 not improve but increase the amount of products and services with each of them.","Nate Brochmann","Sounds good, I appreciate the time. I\u2019ll turn that over.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Good afternoon. I\u2019m curious on new wins and penetration. Just curious any commentary on end market themes that you\u2019re seeing there where the strength is coming from for the most part?","Mike Hansen","You know the theme that we\u2019ve talked about over the last years or may be a couple of years is that healthcare is becoming a more and more important vertical for us as we create more products for that verticals such as the Scrub Rental Program, such as Microfiber mops and wipes. It is becoming more important for us and that\u2019s been a nice vertical. I would say that really nothing other \u2013 no other verticals that really top out as being a big change to us.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks and I think that\u2019s been covered pretty well, but I just ask it one more time just to drive it home. In the oil and gas end market, you\u2019re saying low single-digit exposure that\u2019s what it was last quarter that\u2019s what it is this quarter. Was it about the same going back a year or 18 months ago? And then what I\u2019m getting at is \u2013 is that come on strong this year or has that been pretty stable for the past couple of years?","Mike Hansen","Well, the oil and gas vertical requires a lot of fire resisting clothing. And so, I would say over really the last five years, it\u2019s been a very nice vertical for us. We have had a lot success and the industry has had a lot of success selling fire resisting clothing to them. I would say that it hasn\u2019t been a change to us though. It\u2019s been fairly consistent and a good growth vertical for us for a number of years. I would say if you go back 10 years, Scott, probably less revenue in that area than today.","Scott Schneeberger","Excellent, thanks. And one more from me, I think it\u2019s pretty clear, but just would love to get your perspective on the increase in the guidance. How much of it was relative to the internal expectation for the fiscal third quarter? How much was contribution from share repurchase that\u2019s been done recently and just other puts and takes [indiscernible] or a bridge is essentially what I\u2019m looking for? Thanks.","Mike Hansen","Well, the share buyback was $0.03, $0.01 in the third quarter and we expect $0.02 in the fourth quarter. I would say a lot of the guidance and we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m speaking to EPS was because of the good results in the third quarter certainly. And it just reflects our expectation for the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve been at a pretty good operating margin for the year. I think Bill and I talked a little bit about that being relatively consistent throughout the year and I wouldn\u2019t expect to change from that now.","Scott Schneeberger","Great. Thanks for the color.","Mike Hansen","Sure.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Box with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Joe Box","Hi, good afternoon guys.","Mike Hansen","Hi, Joe.","Joe Box","So, Mike, I think you mentioned earlier in your prepared remarks that you do expect operating leverage from density gains. I\u2019m just curious should we think about that statement as maybe being status quo versus you\u2019d previously expected from density or are there maybe some bigger benefits out in front of us as you implement your SAP system and maybe we could be looking at continued above trend incremental margins?","Mike Hansen","I think the \u2013 our guidance would start to suggest that when you think about our third and fourth quarter of last fiscal year, we had some very healthy incremental margins. From a rental standpoint, the operating margin was close to 50% in the second half of the year, the incremental opportunity margins.","It\u2019s hard to keep that rate going for long periods of time, but we do still believe that that we can have very good incremental margins because we\u2019ve got quite an infrastructure around the U.S. and Canada and we can continue to add products and services to our customers and some of those are not \u2013 some of the revenues that we\u2019re getting is not processed, so we\u2019re not really using any processing capacity. So we think there is still a certainly our good incremental margin opportunities as we move forward. Having said that at the 50% clip that that\u2019s pretty hard to sustain over long periods of time.","Joe Box","Of course, I appreciate that. Thanks Mike. And just maybe one quick one on Shred-it, I appreciate the commentary you\u2019ve given us so far, but I do want to try to understand maybe where we\u2019re at from an integration standpoint, really just to help us with our model. Can you just give us a sense of maybe what inning you think you\u2019re in as you\u2019re integrating these two companies? Are you guys just scratching the surface on re-branding on IT and route consolidation? Or do you think you\u2019re maybe in mid or late innings?","Mike Hansen","I would say that that we\u2019ve passed the 50% mark and so we\u2019re probably in that third quarter of the integration.","Joe Box","Thank you that \u2013 that\u2019s helpful. And then just one last oil and gas question, I\u2019m not really curious about the top line impact, but I do want to ask on working capital. If you do start to see some assets come back to you, could you possibly re-deploy those into other markets like construction or petrochemical or are they all pretty industry specific?","Mike Hansen","Well, it certainly would be customer by customer, but we can use fire resistant clothing in other industries besides oil and gas. Anything that\u2019s got kind of a flash fire opportunity can \u2013 will need fire resisting clothing and there are lots of opportunities for those. So they\u2019re not quite as broad as our general work wear uniform, but there are other opportunities except for certain customers, who have very specific garments that that we would have an inventory liability protection on.","Joe Box","And do you think we would notice it in the working capital line or is it too small?","Mike Hansen","I don\u2019t think it would be noticeable, no.","Joe Box","Okay, thanks guys, nice quarter.","Mike Hansen","Thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Adams [Indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, guys this is Adam [Indiscernible] on for John Healy. Great job on the quarter.","Mike Hansen","Thank you.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, I was wondering if you guys could help us out with the SG&A line, it was impressive again this quarter. I was hoping you could guide us about that line item moving forward into 2016 from a modeling standpoint?","Mike Hansen","I am sorry, is it Adam?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes.","Mike Hansen","Adams, we\u2019re not prepared right now to give fiscal 2016 guidance. I would tell you that that we do believe that we can continue to get leverage in the SG&A area, but not prepared right now to give 2016 information.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks guys. Good quarter.","Mike Hansen","Thanks.","Paul Adler","Thanks.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Mr. Adler, Mr. Hansen, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Mike Hansen","Well, thank you very much for joining us tonight. As a reminder, we\u2019ll be issuing our fourth quarter earnings in mid July. So we look forward to speaking with you at that time. Good evening.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
