At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director, Lavanya Sareen.","Lavanya Sareen","Thanks, Tiffany. Hey, everyone, good morning. Thank you for joining us for Alaska Air Group's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. On the call today are CEO, Brad Tilden; CFO, Brandon Pedersen; and our Senior VP of Planning & Revenue Management, Andrew Harrison, will provide highlights from the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter. Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.","Our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a third quarter GAAP profit of $198 million. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio, Air Group reported a record adjusted net income of $200 million or $1.47 per share. This compares to our first call mean estimate of $1.42 per share and to last year's adjusted net income of $157 million or $1.11 per share.","Additional information about cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging, capital expenditures and other items can be found in our investor update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brad.","Bradley D. Tilden","Thanks, Lavanya, and good morning, everyone. Lavanya just shared the numbers. I thought I'd provide a little context on our performance and then talk for a bit about how we're looking at 2015.","I thought this was a very good quarter on almost all fronts. It starts with the flight schedule and our folks in planning and revenue management continue to do an excellent job of letting in capacity in places where it's most appropriate based on underlying demand and of defending and protecting our route network. As you know, this group of people is nimble and they move quickly.","Employees across our system did a great job growing and creating new demand for our service by continuing to run a great operation and by doing the little things for our customers that make us who we are. Our folks in marketing and external relations, in particular, have done a terrific job getting our name out in the communities where we fly and building loyalty. And we will share some impressive loyalty numbers with you in just a moment.","And our folks throughout the operation did a great job with very high volumes, much higher than in the prior year. And our folks in finance are making sure that all of this performance translates into this stock being a great investment for our owners. They're also doing a good job keeping our team focused on the things we need to do in 2015 to keep our costs going down and to keep this machine running smoothly.","Our $320 million pretax profit resulted in a pretax margin of 21.8%, which is 340 basis points higher than last year. It may be that this result leads the industry. Our ROIC for the trailing 12 months is 17.2%, and that performance was driven by 4 factors: strong revenues, very strong nonfuel cost performance, lower fuel prices and, increasingly, by the benefit of much more fuel-efficient aircraft which are coming online. This is shaping up to be a year of record profitability despite increased competition.","Pretax income for the first 9 months of the year is $716 million, about 15% higher than our full year result last year. I think our results over the last couple of years demonstrates that we're building a business model that works through the cycle.","Finance and operations are humming along well, and customer service is at an all-time high. New competition is making us reach higher and is creating an imperative for us to challenge ourselves and make necessary changes to achieve more. And we've got a fantastic group of frontline employees who are fully engaged and a talented and dedicated leadership team that's working together and providing great direction to our folks.","I think it's right to point out that a lot of airlines are putting up great numbers. This demonstrates that the airline industry is evolving into a return-focused industry. The airlines as a group are performing much better on many, many fronts than we were just a few years ago. For some time now, you've heard Brandon compare our results and encourage you to compare our results not just to other airlines but to other high-quality industrial companies. If you look at our balance sheet, our operational performance, our earnings, our consistency, you might conclude that he is right to do so.","Year-to-date cash flow from operations is just shy of $900 million, which is enabling us to both reinvest in the business and return cash to shareholders. On the reinvestment side, we've firmed up options for 10 737-900ERs, bringing our firm order to 37 aircraft over the next 3 years. We're very excited about the economics of these aircraft, which Brandon will elaborate more on in just a moment, and about the improved experience they provide for our customers.","On the returning cash to shareholders side of things, we repurchased $159 million worth of stock in the third quarter, an amount that represents 2.5% of the company. When combined with dividends, we're clearly on track to hit our target of $350 million in returns to shareholders this year.","Operationally, the third quarter was challenging with additional capacity in some of our markets, but our people did a great job rising to the challenge and running a strong operation. Almost 87% of our flights in the first 8 months of the year arrived on time, and that was the highest percentage amongst the 8 largest airlines. If we look at our performance by a hub, LAX was strong, up 6 points from last year, while Seattle struggled a bit with the high volumes and was down 1.5 points from last year.","Customer satisfaction was very strong. Alaska continued to exceed our 2014 target of 82%, with the score of 84.4% for the quarter. The score is a blend of 3 questions we ask our customers. September score of 85.7% is the highest we've achieved since we started tracking this in 2007, and it's about 15 points higher than our score from 2007. Our launch of Alaska Listens, our online customer feedback form, has been instrumental in raising scores. We survey about 50,000 customers a month and follow up on many comments and on all negative comments within 72 hours. The follow-up is done by frontline management at the station or division responsible for the relevant area. The feedback we're receiving has been very powerful in helping us recognize great employees and in helping us change policies and practices or coach employees where needed.","I think we talked with you in the past about Flight Path, which was a series of workshops we ran with our 13,000 employees to talk about how we're doing and where we're headed together. It has had a positive impact on our alignment and on our service.","And finally, we also believe that Gear Up, a series of training sessions we've recently done with our leadership team, has contributed to the sense of ownership that our supervisors, managers and directors feel.","From a network perspective, we are growing profitably. We added 8% capacity and carried 8.1% more passengers during the quarter. Our total operating revenue was up 7%. Our Seattle figures for both passengers and revenues were virtually identical to our system averages. I thought it was a very solid revenue performance given the capacity headwinds. Both load factors and yields were down just a touch.","We launched 3 new markets in the third quarter from Seattle to Albuquerque, Baltimore and Detroit, and they're performing very well. With those, we have 13 new markets year-to-date that will continue to diversify our revenue stream. We now serve 79 of our roughly 100 cities from Seattle, giving our Seattle customers tremendous schedule utility. We believe that our success with this growth and with a total of 50 new markets we've added over the last 3 years has been driven by our 3 elements of competitive advantage, which are: low fares and low cost, a very reliable operation and, most importantly, great customer service.","On the labor front, we reached an agreement in concept with our flight attendants on October 9. I want to thank our flight attendants for continuing to provide great service throughout the negotiations. We believe it's a fair agreement that recognizes the great work that our 3,300 flight attendants do every day. Assuming this becomes a TA and ratifies, we will have long-term agreement in place through 2016 and, in most cases, 2018 or 2019 with all of our larger workgroups.","I'd like to talk for a minute about the 2015 plan, which we're just putting the finishing touches on. We'll share details of this with you at our Investor Day in New York City on December 4. What I'll say now is that there is a huge emphasis in 2015 on projects that directly impact our customers, a huge emphasis on projects that are going to be completed within the next 12 to 18 months. And with respect to execution, we're putting a big emphasis on continuing to move our culture to one of high performance.","As I close, I'd like to thank our employees for just a terrific quarter. I want to specifically call out our flight crews, our people on the ground in Mexico, L.A. and elsewhere and our folks in our SOC for an incredible response to Hurricane Odile in Los Cabos. As I think you all know, we operated 12 humanitarian relief flights to rescue 2,000 stranded passengers, and we were one of the first airlines back when the airport reopened on October 8.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew R. Harrison","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our revenue performance for the third quarter was very strong, given competitive capacity in our markets was up 9%. Passenger revenue increased 7% on an 8% capacity growth. While PRASM was down 1.1%, underlying demand was solid. PRASM was flat in July, down 1.7% in August and down 1.4% in September. We knew summer was going to be strong, but we were particularly pleased with the September shorter period as PRASM performance was down less than in August.","The up-gauging of our fleet with the 737-900ERs has helped drive unit costs down while growing total revenue. We were able to make extensive use of our new ERs during the peak summer months, with many of these aircraft deployed into Hawaii and transcontinental markets. We ended the quarter with 22 of these impressive airplanes, and they allowed us to generate up to 15% more capacity on high load factor routes without additional frequencies.","In addition, and without compromising passenger comfort, our seat retrofit program is allowing us to add seats on our 737-800s, the backbone of our mainline fleet. We've completed 55 of 61 aircraft, and we expect to complete the remaining 6 aircraft before years end. The seats retrofit program should provide an incremental benefit of about $25 million next year.","We continue to make changes to our network and revenue management practices. Earlier this year, we added a new booking class to our first-class pricing structure. These fares are lower than our full first-class fares and allow us to stimulate demand in the first-class cabin as well as remain competitive with other carriers during weaker demand periods. We've been very pleased with the results to date.","For the third quarter, total first-class revenue was up 9% or $14 million on a 4.4% increase in capacity. This translates to a 4.6% unit revenue increase for the front cabin, with paid first-class traffic up 7 points versus last year. And we've only rolled out our new first-class pricing structure to about 50% of our markets. We expect to roll out the remaining markets in the first quarter of 2015 when we upgrade our revenue management system.","With respect to our network, we saw interline and codeshare revenue with Delta decline 53% or $38 million for the quarter. However, we were able to recapture 85% of this revenue through our own distribution channels and generating higher codeshare and interline revenues from other airlines. Overall, interline and codeshare revenue for the quarter is only down 5%.","Total revenues for the quarter increased 7.3% or $100 million on a year-over-year basis and continues to be helped by ancillary revenue, which was up 18.7% or 10% per passenger.","The benefits of our modified agreement with Bank of America annualized during the third quarter. However, we expect to continue to see benefits from our initiative to increase the number of members in our loyalty program.","Our loyalty marketing team has done an outstanding job as active Mileage Plan members are up over 10% this year on a 6.2% increase in passengers, the largest increase we have ever seen. In addition, both credit card miles sold and the number of cardholders continues to increase. Both were up approximately 10% for the quarter. We appreciate our customers' loyalty, and we'll continue to work hard to earn their business.","Now looking ahead, Alaska's fourth quarter capacity is expected to be up 10%, half of which is driven by efficient gauge and paid plan changes. This brings our full year capacity growth to 7%, which is consistent with what we have been guiding to all year. And bookings are holding up well for the seasonally slower fourth quarter. Advanced book load factor is down, 0.5 points for October, up 3 points for November and down 1.5 points for December.","Now some of you have asked whether Ebola is negatively impacting bookings and if lower oil prices are an indicator of softening demand. From what we see today, the answer is no to both these questions. When we last spoke to you, we expected other airline capacity in the fourth quarter of 2014 and Q1 of 2015 to be up 12% and 22%, respectively. But as we look at published schedules today, we now expect Q4 to be up 9%, that's a 3-point reduction, and Q1 of 2015 to be up 17%, and that's a 5-point reduction. Now many of these reductions are coming out of key markets in Seattle and Portland. But notwithstanding this downward revision, this is still a large amount of capacity in our markets, and we continue to make the necessary changes to our business in order to successfully address these pressures.","We have a laser focus on building our loyalty base of customers in the Pacific Northwest, especially here in Seattle. An important foundation of earning customer loyalty is making sure we provide the best schedule utility to customers out of our hubs. As Brad just mentioned, we started 3 new markets out of Seattle this quarter, and we've launched or announced a total of 9 new nonstop markets from Seattle since the beginning of last year. We expect these markets to add over $100 million of revenue annually when fully developed. And of the 9 markets, 8 have already launched, and they generated a pretax margin of 11% in the third quarter. We believe our return on invested capital of over 17% warrants continued investment in our business, and therefore, we expect to grow between 7% and 8% on a consolidated basis in 2015. Now to put this growth in perspective, if all of this growth was in our Transcon markets, it would be equivalent to 8 daily round trips from Seattle to New York.","We continue to invest in our network and our product while driving unit cost lower, which Brandon will talk about in a moment. We are confident that we can offer our customers a great product at a reasonable price.","We will provide further details on our 2015 plan, which includes changes to our network and our revenue strategy at our upcoming Investor Day on December 4.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everybody. Air Group's adjusted net profit improved by 27%, and our earnings per share improved by 32%. The trailing 12-month fully cash ROIC of 17.2% was 420 basis points higher than at this point last year. On an adjusted pretax basis, we earned $320 million, a nearly $70 million increase. As Andrew said, revenues grew by $100 million. These revenue gains were offset by a $31 million increase in nonfuel expenses, slightly higher total economic fuel costs and lower net nonoperating costs. As Brad said, pretax margin improved by 340 basis points to 21.8%. We think pretax margin is a better metric than operating margin when comparing ALK to other airlines given the substantial net interest expense incurred by others.","Consolidated nonfuel unit costs were down 3.6% on the 8.1% increase in capacity. Some of that can be attributed to having 2 quarters' worth of increase in pilot wages in Q3 of last year given the timing of ratification of that contract and the high Port of Seattle lease costs that we were accruing in Q3 last year. But notwithstanding those items, cost control continues to be really solid. In fact, if you factor out the onetime items that distort the comp, unit costs were down 2%.","Productivity continues to be an important part of the story. It was up another 2.2% this quarter on a passengers per FTE basis. Across all our divisions at both companies, we're seeing a focus on productivity, and I want to thank everyone for it, especially Ben Minicucci, Alaska's COO; and Dave Campbell, the new leader of Horizon; and their entire operating teams for the productivity gains.","Technology is helping, too. Our great website and mobile tools contributed to a 2.1% increase in the share of bookings that go through alaskaair.com. Today, nearly 70% of passengers check in on the web or using their mobile device.","We expect nonfuel unit costs to decrease about 2.5% in the fourth quarter on the 10% capacity increase. The net result is a unit cost reduction for the year of just over 1%, making 2014 the fifth year in a row of cost reduction. We'll end 2014 with our lowest x fuel cost structure ever.","Air Group has real and durable competitive advantages over our larger rivals, and our growth in our cost structure is one of them. Lower cost will also make growth in new markets more attractive.","Right now, we're finalizing our 2015 budget. We're not ready to share guidance on next year's unit costs yet, but we are working on a plan that leverages the 7% to 8% capacity growth that Andrew mentioned and know that, directionally, we need to keep costs coming down further. We'll share more color on expected 2015 costs at our Investor Day in December. Stay tuned.","Moving to fuel. Total expense grew by 1.8% on a 5.1% increase in consumption. But here's the more interesting point. Our fuel burned on an ASM per gallon basis improved by another 2.8%, and it will continue to just get better as we phase out the 737 classics and take 900ERs. We've taken delivery of 10 of these fantastic airplanes so far this year and have 35 more coming by the end of 2017 that will help us transition out of the 27 737-400s left in the fleet. With fuel representing about 1\/3 of total airline operating costs, fuel efficiency gains add to our competitive structural cost advantage.","Let me tell you why we like these airplanes so much. The 900ERs have 37 more seats than a 400 but burn about the same amount of fuel. They're more reliable and have much lower maintenance cost. The customer feedback has been great, too, because they have Recaro seats with power at every seat. We look forward to 11 more joining the fleet in 2015.","We're also making other investments to improve the fuel efficiency of our fleet. Today, we've installed split scimitar winglets on 23 airplanes and expect to have 45 aircraft completed by year-end. These winglets should save us another about 1.5% or so.","We also saw the benefit of the changes we've been making to our fuel hedge program over the last couple of years through lower hedge cost per gallon in our economic fuel number. We've also spent less than $2.5 million on new hedges this year. As a reminder, we only hedge with call options that cap the price we pay for fuel. So we are fully participating in the recent decline in jet fuel prices, which is reflected in our Q4 guidance of $2.77 per gallon. The steep decline is providing a nice tailwind to our profit outlook.","During the first 9 months, we generated just shy of $900 million in operating cash flows, an increase of about $70 million over the first 9 months of last year. For the trailing 12 months, operating cash flow was close to $1.1 billion.","Our adjusted debt-to-cap stands at 31% today. We're in a 300 -- excuse me, $238 million net cash position. Some investors have asked if we're underlevered and are concerned that our low leverage increases our weighted average cost to capital. I totally get that question but believe we're in a place of strength.","Our investment-grade balance sheet rivals other high-quality industrials and puts us in an excellent position to defend the franchise we have created here in the Pacific Northwest and to withstand any other shock that we might face, whether pandemic or weakening to global demand, which, as Andrew said, we aren't seeing.","With after-tax ROIC well above our cost of capital, investing in our business is the right thing to do in order to create long-term value for our owners. To that end, we recently exercised options for 10 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft. So we now expect full year CapEx to be $685 million.","Our aggressive program to return capital through the dividend and share repurchases underscores our long-term commitment to ensuring our owners get an appropriate return. During the first 9 months of the year, we paid out $51 million in dividends. We've also repurchased 5.3 million shares of our common stock for $242 million. We took advantage of the pullback in our stock price to accelerate repurchase activity in Q3, repurchasing $159 million compared to $83 million in the first half of the year. As Brad said, our Q3 repurchases equated to about 2.5% of the company, and our year-to-date purchases equate to more than 3.5% of the company.","But taking a longer-term perspective back to the start of 2009, we've repurchased more than 18% of the shares that were outstanding at that time. Combining the dividend and the buyback, we now expect to substantially exceed the $350 million capital return that we've been talking about for much of the year. With no more deleveraging required, plenty of cash-on-hand, with pensions fully funded and CapEx very manageable, all of our substantial free cash flow is available to return to our owners next year.","Before I close, I want to recognize our treasury team. They recently finalized a 3-year extension of one of our $100 million lines of credit. I want to congratulate them on an outstanding outcome with a lower interest rate and a lower commitment fee. We can achieve great results like this because of our investment-grade balance sheet.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Brad.","Bradley D. Tilden","Thanks very much, Brandon. So to recap, we run a safe operation, a reliable operation, we offer low fares, we have award-winning service and we have terrific customer loyalty. We've got one of the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleets in the industry, we have an investment-grade balance sheet and we're returning cash to shareholders. We bought back 2.5% of the outstanding stock this quarter.","We look forward to seeing you all in New York on December 4. It looks like you're going to have a busy first part of December with at least 2 other Investor Days in New York, but we're looking forward to that time to share with -- more with you about our 2015 plan.","And now we do want to move to Q&A. As we do that, I want to introduce 3 new members of our team. First, Dave Campbell, who comes to us, he's running Horizon Air as our President, long career at American Airlines and some time at JetBlue. Very excited to have Dave aboard. Curtis Kopf is here. Curtis has been with the company for 4 years. He runs our Customer Innovation group, and he is the Interim Head of Marketing. And then finally, Herman Wacker, he's with -- he's been with Alaska Air Group for 7 years and recently succeeded Keith Loveless as General Counsel.","So we're all here available to answer questions. Operator, if you want to queue them up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just on the -- I mean, unit revenue has been performing really well and to your point, and then I think September, especially versus how August performed, did very well. And I'm just wondering, in your markets that you're growing, and some of it is in response -- competitive response, some of it is just the opportunity. How is the unit revenue performing between those 2 categories?","Andrew R. Harrison","Savi, it's Andrew. What I will tell you is, obviously, where this heavier competitive capacity coming into our market, they tend to marginally underperform our system average. But what we have been finding, especially as we looked at the third quarter, the largest areas of growth, which was Midcon, Mountain and Transcon, their unit revenues were all actually above the system average. So we are actually finding meaningful benefit for the maturing of these new revenue streams that we're building on.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just on the ancillary revenue front, it was up about 10% per passenger, I believe. How much of that is from the kind of revenue initiative? And what's kind of the ongoing trend?","Andrew R. Harrison","Most of the increase in ancillary revenues was the bag fee and the change fees we made last year, and they will annualize in the first quarter. But as we go into 2015, we're going to be continuing to look for ways to maintain that ancillary revenue growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I appreciate it, Andrew, the commentary about competitive capacity trends looking sort of still not good but better than maybe some of the numbers that had been recorded earlier. One of the things that is a little bit uncertain though is, as we keep seeing schedules that look out a little bit farther, the first quarter instead of the fourth quarter, it always seems like the worst is still in front of us. I wonder if the team has a sense of what quarter things are sort of as bad as they can get. Or at what point can we sort of look at results and sound the all clear and we just sort of know that those RASM numbers reflect more of a steady-state competitive environment?","Andrew R. Harrison","John, it's Andrew. Yes. I think as you look at the booking schedule as I do, all we know is what we see today. And to your point, as we go into the first quarter, that is a high watermark. Honestly, what we're doing is focusing completely on how we're going to continue to change and evolve our business. And as you've seen, the last 4 quarters, even though we've -- our unit revenues have lagged the A4A for the last 20 months, we've been able to grow, we've been able to expand margins, expand our absolute profit and expand our ROIC. And for 2015, we are squarely continuing to work on plans to continue our momentum.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. Okay, that's very helpful. And Brandon, if we could talk a little bit about the buyback. The amount that was bought back this quarter was fantastic. It was tremendous versus the authorization that you have out there. If I remember correctly, when you put out that authorization, you didn't really put a clear time line around it. You did offer some comments here that future free cash flow would continue to go to capital returns in one form or another. I was hoping that we could sort of revisit the authorization time line a little bit. And maybe you could talk about the appetite to continue to accelerate the buyback here as the stock, I think by many people's argument, is still depressed by the Delta threat.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Well, John, it's Brandon. Thanks for your comments. We really appreciate it. You're right, we did accelerate the buyback in Q3, and we took advantage of the pullback in the share price to do that. As you guys know, we have the flexibility to do that, and this shows that we will exercise that flexibility. In terms of looking forward, I don't think we're going to give anything more today on how fast we think we're going to use the existing share authorization. I think you can look back at our track record and say, \"Man, Alaska has done a pretty nice job managing the buyback, using it appropriately when the timing is right.\" Being in the market -- I can tell you, we're in the market every single day, and we're just continuing to do the right thing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So I just had a couple of questions. As we think about the aircraft that you're taking delivery of next year, should we think about that as going into owned aircraft? Or do you think you would use the opportunity to add more leverage back to the balance sheet?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Helane, it's Brandon. At this point, we kind of divorced those questions a little bit. I think we would own the airplane, and then what we'll do is separately manage the capital structure. We have a strong bias toward ownership. We like it for a lot of reasons. And then as I said, use -- we'll flex the capital structure as necessary.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I don't want necessarily for you to give away any, I don't know what the right word is, but cities that you might think about flying to going forward. But maybe you could just talk about the opportunities you have to expand out of either Seattle or Portland or both over the next 1.5 years or so, maybe into markets internationally or further East and the eastern part of United States.","Andrew R. Harrison","Helane, it's Andrew. What I would say is, as I shared a little bit earlier, what's especially exciting is as we continue to grow this company and as our unit costs continue to come down and we get these new fuel-efficient ER aircraft, we're finding more opportunities given our cost structure and our network that we can look to fly. So I think the opportunity is being created by the way we're running the business. The other thing I would point to is, obviously, we're getting the MAX in 2017, looks to be a fantastic airplane as well. And we're just beginning to look at all the call options that might come available to us as we look at the range of that aircraft, its cost structure and where we want our company to be by the time we actually receive that airplane.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Can I just follow with one? Just last question about Seattle and the fact that -- I think somebody mentioned that there was congestion at the airport. Is the airport authority doing anything to help you out there with -- and I think you guys are having some construction on the North Terminal. So how will that affect on-time performance as that continues?","Benito Minicucci","Helane, it's Ben. Yes. We did have some congestion this summer, and it is more a time of day and a summer phenomenon. So we are putting a lot of work right now modeling day of week, time of year. And it also depends what flow of the airports in north flow and south flow, which makes an impact. So we are working with the airport with ATC. We're working with network scheduling to make sure that where we see the constraints of the time of day, that we're going to try and move flights, maybe add a bit of block time. Our on-time performance in the summer, although was lower, was about 84% for July and August, which is better than most. But it's below where we want to be, but still fairly strong. So we are working hard and we will have plans in place by March to mitigate any of that impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Two questions for you. So has Alaska ever in its history evaluated a wide-body strategy to Asia given that you would have such a dominant share of that market from Seattle? And if you did evaluate it, did you not do it because of the cost -- mostly, did you not do it because of the cost complexity it would introduce or because of a concern over the amount of local demand to Asia?","Bradley D. Tilden","Hunter, I don't know that we'll talk a lot about that. What I will say is that we love the strategy that we have today as we've moved Alaska to all 737s. So this is maybe a direct answer to your question. As we moved Alaska to all 737s, Horizon to all Q400s, we have just seen tremendous economies as we sort of become, we think, best-in-class at operating these 2 airplane types. And Alaska's got -- you're familiar with all the benefits. There's easier pilot training costs. The pilot reserves, there's a fewer number of reserves that you have. With the 737s, we're up-gauging. So we're getting tremendous economies with fuel and maintenance and so forth. Horizon you've seen a massive turnaround of that company as we move from maybe 3 fleet types a few years ago to 1 now, and it's gone from basically a breakeven operation to producing $100 million a year of pretax income. So we love the simplicity. We love the focus that a single fleet type brings us. And that's our answer.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. I understand. And then you talked about how 70% of your passengers are basically checking in on their own right now. So is the number of kiosks that you use down 70%? And why not maybe give that final push, get rid of some kiosks, get rid of your footprint, because presumably, that 30% of passengers that are not checking in on their own are customers whose loyalty you have to worry about the least. And I can suggest a way to get that 70% up a lot higher, if you want, by the way.","Curtis Kopf","This is Curtis, and I'd love to talk offline about how to get the 70% higher. But you're exactly right. We're seeing explosive growth in check-in via mobile. And in fact, customers who check in via mobile are also happier about the whole process. And then secondly, we're seeing web check-in continue to grow. And we're seeing kiosk check-in steadily decline. So I do think we will see that trend over time. It may not be immediate, but I think you're right. And...","Benito Minicucci","It's Ben Minicucci. I think what you're seeing is a shift of how people are checking in. So there's a lot of opportunities for us at the airport to look at really changing the customer experience. And what you'll see us do in 2015 is put some initiatives in place that really transforms what we're thinking about the lobby area. So it will have a lot of benefits that I hope we can share with you in the next few calls.","Bradley D. Tilden","And Hunter, even though they're using their mobile phone to check in, they're still using the kiosks to print bag tags. So that's where we're looking to go with this technology.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just can't sit here and resist calling out Hunter. Alaska did in fact order the 747, though I appreciate how that nugget of airline trivia might have slipped by. Following up on John's question, you mentioned the recent scheduled filings. And even with some slight trims, the Delta overlap in your current markets rises considerably this quarter and into the first as well. The total OA impact was challenging. I know you guys don't want to provide quarterly RASM guidance, but can you at least remind us of any sort of year-on-year comparisons unique to your own flying that might provide some RASM benefit year-on-year, things that we should consider in potentially offsetting what appears to be just really, really nasty RASM headwinds as we move towards year-end and beyond?","Andrew R. Harrison","Yes, thanks, Jamie. I think the couple of ways that we are working hard to address the obvious pressures that will come into the first quarter is, again, continuing to capitalize on our seasonality, and we're going to do that in 2 ways. You see a number of the capacity adds are in our Pacific Northwest to Hawaii, which is more of a winter season for us. And of course, deploying all those ERs and those fuel-efficient aircraft to the islands where we can is going to be helpful. And we continue to be very surgical and try to be really smart about the day of week cuts and when we fly and when we don't fly. So those are the things we continue to work on, as well as the new markets, even in the softer demand periods, continue to mature and get stronger. So those are 3 areas of water level that we hope to continue to rise and offset some of the unit revenue pressures.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Brandon, going back to the aircraft that you're going to add over the next 3 years, I think you said 37 aircraft. How should we think about the split between replacement versus growth? Would it be fair to say that the majority of those airplanes are replacement airplanes?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Yes, so right now -- actually, I said 35 in my remarks -- there's 36. So we have 36 900ERs on order for '15, '16 and '17, and we want to replace the remaining 27 400s. So on a net basis, it does represent growth, but it's not a huge amount of unit growth. But it is a fair amount of ASM growth just because of the up-gauging that you get, and that's pretty efficient growth, too.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Definitely. And then my second question, and maybe this is for Andrew, when I look at some of the other markets that you're expanding into, like, for example, you've been doing a nice job building out San Diego. When you make the decisions to add a route, how important is it to have a codeshare partner involved in a new route to bring them on as a risk-sharing partner? And maybe sort of as a second half to that question, is -- a large number of those San Diego flights, do they have, say, for example, the American codeshare? Or for the most part, are they being just operated under the Alaska code only?","Andrew R. Harrison","Yes. I think history has taught me personally. I think the more dependent we are on ourselves in our own network, I think the better we're going to be off on the long run. So the way I view the codeshare relationships is we never start a market purely based on what we might get from a codeshare. We do it based on our own economics, our own network and our own strategy. And then what we hope to do, once we've announced it, then we can legally go talk to codeshare partners. And if codeshare makes sense to help the network and grow the pie, then we'll do that. But pretty much, we focus on what we can do with our aircraft.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just on ancillary revenue. You mentioned you're round-tripping the credit card deal, and I think you'll begin to round-trip some of the change fees in the fourth quarter. So can you talk maybe broadly what levers you can pull to reaccelerate other revenue growth into '15?","Andrew R. Harrison","Duane, it's Andrew. What I will say is we've been spending a lot of time looking at what the industry does. And as you know, we're about $13, $13.50 per passenger, and some of the industry is up closer to $20. So we know that where we can find the value-add opportunity for customers, we're going to look hard at that. And what I will tell you is that we are looking at additional things that might provide opportunity for us and our customers in the ancillary revenue. And that's probably as much as I would say right now.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then one for Brandon. Could you just help us with kind of where your cash tax rate stands this year versus last year and what your outlook for 2015 would be?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Yes, sure, Duane. I think we'll be at a cash tax rate this year of about 35%. I think that's up about 10% from last year. My recollection is, is that we were in the mid-20s in terms of cash effective rate. And then as we look forward next year, there is some question out there as to what happens with bonus depreciation, but I would expect our cash rate and our effective rate on the book side would be pretty close to even.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Engel with Bank of America.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Few questions on the cost side. I'm not sure if you touched on this. Wages were actually down 2%. Did that reverse any of the flight attendants? And would you expect that not to be the case in the fourth quarter?","Chris Berry","No. Glenn, this is Chris Berry. Wages were down. There's a lot of things going on in there. Last year, you might recall, and Brandon mentioned it in his comments, that we had the retro pilot pay as part of the agreement that they signed. That was about $6 million in the quarter last year. We also have year-over-year pension decline, which is kind of consistent throughout the quarter, of $10 million. And then there's just a few other things, but that's the majority of what's happening. There's nothing in there with flight attendant this year or last.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess it surprised me because it was even down from the second quarter, and you were certainly flying more in the third quarter than the second.","Chris Berry","Yes, there were some other things, medical costs and a couple of other true-ups as well. But for the majority, I mean, it was really the pilot retro was in last year's and then -- as well as the continued benefit from pension expense.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Same for the -- same as other line. That was down also 3% despite a lot more flying and down from this second quarter.","Chris Berry","The other line, the other operating cost line?","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes.","Chris Berry","Yes. There's a lot of noise in there, but there were some decreases in property taxes this quarter from an assessment. We got a favorable change to an assessment and in a couple of states we operate in, as well as we had a couple of warranty claims that we were able to get in the quarter as well. So that drove the year-over-year decline there.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And utilization was down 1.8%, yet you're showing great unit cost improvement. This utilization down is just the less off-peak flying that Andrew was talking about?","Andrew R. Harrison","For which period you're referring to?","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Third quarter versus last year, it looked like utilization was down.","Andrew R. Harrison","I might have to take that one offline and take a look.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Glenn, it's Brandon. We'll get back to you on that one.","Andrew R. Harrison","Yes.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And finally, the selling cost was up tons, selling expense?","Chris Berry","Yes, selling -- this is Chris again. Selling expenses were up, I mean, mostly because of advertising that we're doing here locally as well as some other things. And Curtis or Joe, you want to add to that?","Curtis Kopf","Sure. Yes. We have increased our advertising in Seattle in light of the competitive environment, and we're seeing fantastic results on that. That said, we still spend less in similar sized airlines, and we expect that spend to be flat going into next year.","Andrew R. Harrison","Glenn, this is Andrew. We were just having a brain freeze there. Of course, our COO just told me again. We have the -- we're adding the extra row of seats, and there's a couple of lines of aircraft that are in there getting mod-ed and that's why we're actually down. Because we're actually -- in utilization, we're flying the airplanes harder but on a fleet basis, that's what's going on there.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So these unit costs are coming down despite those headwinds? Impressive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob McAdoo with Imperial Capital.","Bob McAdoo - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. Just one quick one. What are you paying for fuel today?","Mark G. Eliasen","The raw price we're paying is $3.71.","Bradley D. Tilden","2.","Mark G. Eliasen","$2.71. Sorry.","Bob McAdoo - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","$2.71?","Mark G. Eliasen","Yes.","Bob McAdoo - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","And so the $2.77 that you've got, that you're telling us, what is that -- what are you assuming happens going out in a quarter or 2?","Mark G. Eliasen","Yes, Bob, that includes $0.06 of hedging costs. So $2.77 would be the all-in economic costs of fuel.","Bob McAdoo - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","So basically, you're just assuming today's price straight out when you're talking to us, not making any assumptions, any other changes?","Mark G. Eliasen","That's right, for the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Andrew, I'm wondering, on the improvement and the competitive capacity trends you're seeing, can you just kind of walk us through who's pulling back relative to the last look there?","Andrew R. Harrison","Joe, yes, it's mainly -- we've seen -- it's really split between sort of Seattle and Portland. And we have United pulling down a fair bit of regional capacity out of there from Portland. We're also seeing some of the bigger carriers just true up, some of their winter flying out of their hubs as well. And then basically, other than that, it's spread across a number of pieces here and there. So it's actually sort of a mixed bag, but I think it's just people truing up schedules.","Joseph W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then, Brandon, on the investment-grade rating, can you just maybe help us -- walk us through kind of how that helps you guys maybe on the income statement? I mean, are there areas maybe that we would consider where that would help you out?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Joe, I'm going to ask Mark Eliasen to answer that one.","Mark G. Eliasen","Joe, it's Mark. It helps us in multiple ways. As Brandon already said, we renewed our lines of credits. We've gotten a lower margin and a lower fee for those lines. That's one place. It helps us when we buy fuels in terms of credit terms. It helps us with pretty much anything, any place where we're going in and getting credit, whether it's operational credit or financial terms. And when we do start financing again, it will help us a lot there as well.","Bradley D. Tilden","I mean, Joe, the hope would be that one day -- between the strength of the balance sheet and the investment-grade rating, which gives us low interest cost, the hope is, one day, we start to think of it as nonoperating line. It's just a net 0 cost line, 0 benefit, 0 cost line, which is an incredible thing for our business that's as capital-intensive as ours.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve O'Hara with Sidoti & Company.","Stephen O'Hara - Sidoti & Company, LLC","I'm just curious about the 400s that are coming off. Are those unencumbered? Are they encumbered? Are they leased? If you could talk about that a little bit. And then maybe on the MAXs, when you take those, what's your feeling in terms of your competitive position in the industry when you have those? Does it improve? Does it stay the same based on the other orders you see out there?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Well, Steve, I'm going to let Mark take the first part of that question.","Mark G. Eliasen","Yes, Steve, it's Mark Eliasen. 18 of our 400s are leased. So those will be just straightforward lease returns. And then we do have the Freighter and Combis, which we own. And we also own 3 of our passenger 400s. So the bulk of that fleet of 27 will just be returned as part of the lease.","Brandon S. Pedersen","And on your second question, in terms of the MAX, Andrew touched on it a little bit, we're super excited to get the MAX. We're excited for the efficiency gains that are going to come with it. We're excited for the longer legs that provide us the opportunity that gives us on the network. To the extent we're getting those earlier on, that will certainly just add to our fuel cost advantage that we already have.","Stephen O'Hara - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And yes, I mean, I guess maybe a tougher question is, what do you see in terms of the industry doing -- as maybe their costs get better, how much of that goes to the customer versus shareholders? And then I guess you guys had talked previously about a brand update. I'm just wondering where that process is as well.","Bradley D. Tilden","I'd like to take the first part, and we'll ask Curtis to do the brand. It's hard to say. Lower fuel costs and when they get trend -- I mean, I do think in an economy like ours, when costs go down, over time, a lot of that benefit does get competed away. Our job is, just on a relative basis, to have low cost and capital and have enough margin to cover the growth that we're doing. So I don't know that we have a strong view on what -- how lower fuel prices ultimately translate to revenues. Curtis, on brand, do you want update on that?","Curtis Kopf","Yes. We are refreshing our brand look to be more consistent and more modern, and we've already started that. And you'll see updates across all of our customer touch points, like our website in the airports, over the next 12 months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I've sort of been in and off the call here, but I apologize if this has been answered. But what's the potential here for an expanded codeshare with American? Is it a dead opportunity? Is there a potential opportunity looking ahead? Where are we at there potentially?","Andrew R. Harrison","Dan, it's Andrew. As we've shared on previous calls, we continue to enjoy a good solid relationship with the new American. In fact, even this quarter, our codeshare and interline revenues were actually up 10%. And again, as we have anything more new to report, as it relates to American, we will do so.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Understood. And then following up on the new fare bucket for paid first-class. If I heard correctly, $14 million -- $14 million benefit in the quarter, and that was just 50% of the first-class opportunity. So the implicit math, of course, roughly $100 million in incremental revenue annually based on the commentary. But I would say it's all about the supply-demand dynamic and revenue management technique. What's really the right way to think about that on a potential annual run rate here?","Andrew R. Harrison","I may not agree with the $100 million. It'd be very nice. But I think then $14 million was our overall performance of our first-class cabin. But a little bit to your point, we've only ever had one fare for our first-class cabin. And the opportunity we're seeing is to bring incremental paid passengers into that first-class cabin and also connecting traffic, haven't received any benefit of this new fare yet. So I think overall, what I will be watching for is outperformance of unit revenues in our first-class cabin relative to our system. And as we move forward on this, we'll have a better view of how much it's actually going to be, but that's sort of where we are today.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Got it. And then just can you remind us what percent of your revenues come from your, say, top 5% of your customers?","Andrew R. Harrison","I'm not sure we've really given that number before. I think what we have shared before is probably about, I think, 10% or 12% of our revenues come in our highest classes, the business first-class type.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Derchin with CRT Capital Group.","Michael W. Derchin - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Along the nostalgia line, I mean, I was curious how big an opportunity is Salt Lake City. I remember when Western Airlines built it up -- and it was a pretty decent operation for them, both as local as well as connecting hub. So I wonder how big that could be over time.","Andrew R. Harrison","This is Andrew. I think like any new markets, what we've found generally with Salt Lake City is we perform much better when it's into our core Pacific Northwest hubs. The other West Coast key city flying, they're a little bit more challenging, obviously. We're continuing to work that. Our marketing group have gone out and got some fantastic contracts and corporate contracts, LDS contracts. We're doing a lot of marketing. The most exciting thing about Salt Lake City is that the folks there didn't really know who we were. And we're starting to see that they're actually knowing who we are now, and I think that's just very rewarding for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just one quick question. On the debt funds, what's your latest thinking on where you want your debt levels to be and if you're thinking of increasing that or just maintaining current levels?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Savi, it's Brandon. We're very comfortable where we're at. I tried to address that in my prepared comments. We think it really gives us some gunpowder to do some things, if we need it. It really fortifies our position here in the Pacific Northwest. Just to share some facts with you, we have been comparing ourselves to high-quality industrials. And so if you look at the S&P 500, for example, and you look at the industrials within the S&P 500, half of them roughly have debt-to-cap levels that are lower than 40%. And so that's really the sweet spot that we want to be in. We like that company a lot, and so we think that, that's a good place for us.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just next year, so I may, are the kind of the biggest cash flow items just aircraft beyond operating cash flow?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Yes, for sure. Debt repayments are extremely modest. And as we alluded to maybe with Helane's comment, we're going to manage the capital structure, I think, a little bit. But yes, really just CapEx and a lot of operating -- or a lot of free cash flow beyond that.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference back over to Brad Tilden.","Bradley D.

Our debt to capitalization ratio declines to 41% and our return on invested capital was 12.2%.","As a reminder, our comments today will include forward looking statements on our expected future performance, which may differ materially from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings.","On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. And as usual, we've provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's earnings release.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Brad for his opening remarks.","Brad Tilden","Thank you, Emily, and good afternoon everybody. As we discussed in the last couple calls, we feel that 2019 marked a turning point for us as we got to the bulk of our Virgin America integrations and begin to see the returns on that investment.","And more importantly, as we focus our energy on running a fantastic airline and on executing initiatives, which we designed to strengthen our long-term competitive advantage.","As Emily shared, today we reported that our 2019 adjusted pretax income grew by 43% to nearly $1.1 billion and our adjusted pretax margin expanded 3.1 point to 12%. Our operating cash flow was exceptional as it grew 37% to $1.8 billion.","Our free cash flow of $1.1 billion and our net income to free cash flow conversion of about 140% were also very strong. We've now paid down 75% of the $2 billion we borrow to buy Virgin America and as Emily said, our debt to cap ratio is now down to 41%.","These results deliver terrific value for our owners. In 2019 ROIC grew 280 basis points to 12.2% and our earnings per share for the full-year group 44%, which is the highest growth rate of any airline that reported so far.","Of this value we've returned $250 million to shareholders in 2019 through dividends and share repurchases. Brandon will talk in a moment about our capital return plans for 2020, which will include the $0.10 increased our annual dividend which we announced today.","We've made progress on many fronts. But we're especially pleased with our momentum on commercial initiatives designed to improve the guest experience and drive revenue gains.","For both the fourth quarter and the full-year we expect our unit revenue growth will be the best in the industry. I want to congratulate Andrew and his team for this exceptional performance and I want to thank our Frontline employees for operating safely and reliably and for operating -- and for offering genuine and caring service to our customers.","These things are sometimes overlooked, but I think we all know that no airline nor any business for that matter can deliver on value creation opportunities if the underlying product is not inherently good.","Its not just the leaders of Alaska that believe we have outstanding people. J.D. Power, Cond\u00e9 Nast, Newsweek and U.S. News and all -- U.S. News & World Report, all spoke up in 2019 to validate our views. Tomorrow over $130 million in annual performance-based pay bonuses will go out to all Alaska and Horizon employees.","This is the 10th year that our program which focuses all of us on safety, low-cost, remarkable service and financial performance will pay out. And the average over those 10 years is about an extra month of pay per year.","Even with these results we've got work to do. At our 2018 Investor Day we shared our roadmap detailing plans to return pretax margins to the range of 13% to 15% over the cycle by improving performance in the controllable parts of our operation. This is our number one financial priority in 2020.","And as I close, I want to take a minute to recognize that this will be Brandon's last earnings call. Brandon has been with Alaska for 16 years and has served as our CFO for almost 10 of those years.","As you know Brandon is an exceptional CFO and he's been recognized as one of the best CFOs in the industry because of his financial abilities and because of the clarity with which he communicates our plan to use the investment community, as well as to our employees.","We will miss Brandon dearly. And all of us at Alaska wish him and his wife Janet the very best in retirement. Shane Tackett will be Alaska's new CFO effective March 3rd. Many of you know Shane well and we're excited to see him step into this role.","Shane has been with Alaska for nearly 20 years and has led financial planning and analysis, e-commerce, revenue management and labor relations. He has a terrific understanding of our business and of how we work with people to continue to grow and nurture Alaska. We're confident in his leadership and we're anxious to see the imprint he leaves on Alaska in his new role as CFO.","Last week leadership team and I returned from two weeks on the road for employee meetings in seven cities across our network. The goal of these meetings was to share our strategy for 2025 and we found employees throughout the operation were energized about the road ahead.","This industry can be challenging, but our people know what it takes to win. A relentless focus on safety, an on-time operation, truly remarkable service and a low-fare, low-cost, high-efficiency financial profile. We continue to do the things well and will continue to grow. You'll hear more about this from others today.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.","Ben Minicucci","Thanks, Brad and good afternoon everyone. At our Investor Day in the fall of 2018, we laid our a roadmap to achieving our goal of 13% to 15% pretax margins and a series of revenue and cost initiatives that would move us closer to that goal.","Building on that momentum, we been working on our strategic plan for the last six months that sets the vision for Alaska for the next five years. The plan builds on our strengths and addresses key areas of opportunities for our company to thrive in a consolidated and increasingly competitive industry.","The plan is comprehensive and for obvious reasons we won't share specific details, but at high level that's focused on three areas. The first is growth, which includes how we build our network and hubs. How we unlock the value proposition of our brand in California. How we build the best-in-class merchandisers. How we become the best-in-class merchandisers. And how we drive guest and employee facing innovation.","Second is people, which addresses how we continue to nurture our fantastic culture. How we build excellent labor relations. And how we develop that leaders in the industry. And third is our business model, which builds on our strong safety culture and operational excellence. Our path of being leaders and sustainability. And our focus on creating a robust financial engine that allows us to generate appropriate financial returns over the long term.","Alaska always has been and will continue to be a growth airline. Since 2000 we've grown at a rate that outpaced industry 3:1 [ph]. We were able to do this because of our durable competitive advantages. We're safe. We run a good operation. Our people provide remarkable service. And we have low costs, so we can offer our guests low fares.","Building these muscles as required enormous discipline. Of the last 10 years, we've demonstrated our ability to be at or near the top of the industry in each of these areas. We know that preserving these competitive advantages is key to continued profitable growth.","But we're seeing increasing congestion in our largest hubs that is challenging us. Gary Beck, our new Chief Operating Officer and his leadership team will be laser focused on operational excellence and changing processes, so we can continue to operate in our congested hubs with a low cost, high productivity mindset.","Recently, we began building another muscle that is key to our future as a growth airline, building our commercial advantage through improve merchandising and demand generation. We saw the impact these efforts had on our performance in 2019 and believe there's additional opportunity to improve in these areas.","Andrew will be sharing more about these plans in a bit. Finally, our business model. You know that we are committed to achieving a 13% to 15% pretax margin and that remains unchanged.","Additionally, we been working on concrete goals around capital allocation specifically related to free cash flow generation and returns of capital. You hear us talk often about the value we create for our guests and employees in our board has always been supportive of this.","They've challenged us to also model the same clarity and our long-term commitments to owners. So we've created a document that we hope to share with investors this spring that provides insights on our management philosophy and that covers the financial targets that we should be held accountable to.","The working title of this document is called the Owner's Manual. We plan to share more about it at our Annual Shareholder Meeting on May 12. If you don't typically dialing for that, I suggest that you do so this year.","Before I hand it over to Andrew, I'd like to mention several achievements during the quarter. First, we completed our busiest holiday travel season ever. Our fantastic people helped over 11 million guests get to their destinations this quarter. Both Christmas and New Year's falling midweek, demand was higher than usual as evidenced by elevated load factors in yield throughout two holiday weeks.","And despite a rough Christmas week operationally, our people providing excellent service to our guests and I want to thank them for their efforts over busy couple of weeks. Second, with the recent ratification of the Joint Collective Bargaining agreement with our Airbus and Boeing aircraft technicians, all workgroups across the company are integrated, completing a significant milestone in under three years after the merger with Virgin America.","Third, Horizon delivered one of the best financial and operational performances in its history in 2019, with lowest unit cost ever. Gary Beck and the entire team at Horizon have led a remarkable transformation. Congratulations to them and looking forward I may going to see how new Horizon President, Joe Sprague and the team build on the success, including continued cost management and moving even more to best-in-class C175 operational performance.","As I reflect on my almost 16 years with Alaska, I know that our success has been fueled by our fantastic people, many of whom I've been here for decades building our brand and the special connection we have with our guests. Our culture and focus on kindness is truly unique and we will continue to nurture that even as we continue to grow. Our employee meetings over seven cities the last two weeks were inspiring and energizing and it gives me confidence, we can execute this ambitious plan.","And now, over to Andrew.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks, Ben and good afternoon everyone. Eco what you've heard from others. The commercial business ended the year on a very strong note. Our total revenue grew 7.9% in the fourth quarter on just 3.5% capacity increase.","This translates to unit revenue growth of 4.2%, which we believe will exceed industry by over 350 basis points. Both leisure and business demand was solid this quarter. I'm pleased report that New York and California Transcon performance were both among the top three TRASM improvement stories for Alaska.","Our team have worked hard this year to recover from the challenges we faced early in 2019 and have made a positive impact turning those markets around. This is a testament to what we know to be true, putting the right aircraft in the right markets when combined with Alaska's high quality product and service is a win for both our guests and Alaska airlines.","An important contributor to our revenue growth has been a premium product. You may recall the prior 2017, our mainline fleet was segmented into just two classes. First, in main cabin with the regional fleet only main cabin.","At that time premium product revenues comprise just 7% of all revenues, with 70% of revenue generated by main cabin seats. Today first class and premium class represent 22% of our total revenues. This mix will grow as we complete the reconfiguration of the airbus to bring the premium product mix in line with the rest of the fleet.","On the regional side of our business, we also see solid demand for premium seating on the Embraer 175s. We are intentional about how we manage our premium product business. Our goal is to keep out premium cabins affordable, provide generous benefits to our loyalty members while competing effectively against our peers.","In the fourth quarter, first class revenue was up 19% on 13.6% more seats. Premium class revenues were up 16% on 14.5% more seats. This momentum will continue into 2020 as we complete the remainder of the retrofit and focus on more effective merchandising of our premium cabin.","RASM from our premium products was 54% higher than generated by our main cabin and a six-point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2018. On the loyalty front, we once again saw double-digit percentage growth in our revenues this quarter. Revenues include mileage plan commissions on a credit card as well as redemption revenues included passenger revenue.","This quarter's performance caps off incredible years of growth in our loyalty program since the acquisition. I'd also like to note that this quarter's results concluded four consecutive quarters of year-over-year RASM growth and a strong close to the year.","Total revenues in 2019 grew 6.3% to $8.8 billion on 2% capacity growth. RASM for the full year is up 4.2% more than 200 basis point of industry. An additionally, this represents approximately 50 basis point over expectations we've shared with you at our Investor Day in the fall of 2018 and represent the highest full-year relative RASM increase since 2011.","We started talking you about an inflection at the beginning of 2019 and we are pleased that our results this year demonstrates that we achieved. As Ben mentioned, it is imperative that we carry the momentum we built in 2019 forward and we will be squarely focused on building strength in the areas of merchandising, demand generation and innovation.","To improve the execution of revenue initiatives and the guest experience, my organization has recently undergone a structural realignment to better anticipate and serve the needs and desires of our guests. The drivers of our revenue have fundamentally changed over the past decade, where that were once predominately driven by main cabin ticket sales, we now manage a fully segmented cabin that houses numerous in dollar segments including first class, premium class, save affairs and loyalty revenue.","A new organizational structure better reflect how we do business today and we'll improve both the guest experience and our revenue performance. The company is long been a leader in merchandising and technology, a key enhancement to the commercial organization was appointing Charu Jain as Senior VP of Merchandising and Innovation. This new division will also include responsibility over distribution and e-commerce.","Charu who was previously Alaska's CIO brings the technology experience. She'll be working with all our leaders to not only drive merchandising, but innovation that will be squarely anchored in revenue generation, improving the guest experience and developing tools for employees so we can deliver our products and service with excellence. We are very confident that Charu's leadership will drive us to regain a top position in the disciplines.","Also on the technology front, the implementation of our new revenue management system is well underway. This project is a multiyear investment, which will bring advanced forecasting capabilities along with revenue and network optimization support. We pay plan to complete the first phase in the back half of 2020.","While incremental revenue delivered in the first year is small at around $20 million. The capability and supports will unlock more significant revenue potential in the years to follow. As I shared on our last call, our 2020 revenue includes the carryover of 2019 revenue initiatives and synergies of approximately $125 million, and this will be concentrated in the first half of the year. Half of this represents synergies such as cross fleeting and the other half revenue initiatives such as the annualization of Saver Fare and other ancillary price changes.","Additionally, the focus we're putting on merchandising, demand generation and innovation is expected to drive additional revenue growth with most of the opportunity skewing to the second half of the years, some of the larger initiatives require the activation of new technology. We will be updating you on the progress of our 2020 initiatives throughout quarterly revenue guides.","This afternoon, we established our first quarter guidance ranges. Capacity growth will be approximately 4% and unit revenue is expected to grow between half a point and three and half percentage. While Q1 is the weakest seasonal period in the industry, we've seen indications of strength in the early weeks of the quarter relative to last year.","To-date, pricing is been stable and structural changes to our network in January and February to better match our network to demand patent is resulting in some nice load factor increases and we expect to outperform industry unit revenues this quarter.","2019 with a strong year company by great momentum, delivering margin improvement through higher RASM and a better guest experience remains the commercial team's number one priority as we enter 2020.","We've demonstrated our ability to identify and execute against high-quality self-help measures in 2019 and are confident that the additional opportunities we've identified will be similarly successful in 2020.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Brandon and Shane.","Brandon Pedersen","Hey, thanks Andrew. Good afternoon everybody. As part of our transition you're going to hear from both Shane and me to today as we walk through our Q4 and full-year performance and talk about 2020.","We were pleased with our fourth quarter results. Net income and earnings per share both nearly doubled. Our 10.9% pretax margin was 470 basis points better than last year on the strength of unit revenues, solid execution against our cost plan again and a modest decline in fuel prices. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of margin improvement and the largest.","For the full-year adjusted pretax margin was 12%, a 3.1 point improvement over last year and meaningful progress on our path to 13% to 15% margin. Profits increased because our teams executed well on the initiatives we laid out at our 2018 Investor Day.","Our fourth quarter unit cost increase seven-tenths of a percent on 3.5% increase in capacity. We weren't happy with the result. We did have a modest reduction in capacity given December's weather and some related costs, but we also saw some late adjustments to employee benefit accruals including high dollar adjustments to pilot disability accruals and large medical claims that came in the last couple weeks of the year.","Brad mentioned our performance-based pay program and I thought it might be useful to connect our year-end benefits related adjustments to the PBP payouts earned by our people. These late adjustments reduce the payout of an employee making $50,000 a year by $275. We need to improve the structure of these programs to better manage these costs prospectively.","Overall, our full-year cost performance was solid. Our teams across the company both in operational roles and support roles did a nice job developing aggressive plans and then hitting them. It's notable that our full-year CASM increased only 2.3% on 2% ASM growth.","You might recall that our initial guidance for 2019 was for 2% to 2.5% unit cost growth. We achieve that while absorbing $48 million of costs associated with the new Collective Bargaining agreement with our IAM and AMPA represented employees, not in the original guide.","Productivity was good, but we still have lots of opportunity to get back to peak performance. Overhead was down 3.5% or $25 million year-over-year helped by the outstanding work of our supply chain team and their very successful initiative to improve terms with our business partners and the steps we took to right size our corporate staff. In fact there's more work underway to simplify reporting structures and make us more agile.","Now over to Shane.","Shane Tackett","Thank you, Brandon, and good afternoon everybody. My remarks today will touch on both capacity and cost guidance for 2020. And then briefly on our fleet plan and owners manual.","Regarding capacity, it remains our intent to grow between 3% and 4% this year. This does assume midyear MAX returned to service which given Boeing's press release last week and the likely requirement for sim-based training for MAX pilot is still uncertain.","Regarding cost guidance, we believe unit costs will be up about 2% for 2020, excluding the impact of a new agreement with Alaska's pilots. I would also note, the 2% excludes any impact to capacity due to the MAX delivery timing, as well as any costs associated with potentially required training related to returning the MAX to service.","We'll continue to update both our capacity and cost guidance as we gain more certainty about the timing of the 10 MAX aircraft we are scheduled to receive this year. To discuss costs a little further we just wrapped our annual budget process and although I'm happy that we have a plan that will again grow our pretax margin, we continue to have opportunity on our cost structure.","As you know, during integration, we intentionally be prioritized to a modest degree our cost focus. That is now behind us and we know that our long-term health is secured only with the ability to offer low fares and high-value to our guests and that to offer low fares we need to be relentless again in our focus on efficiency and low costs.","While goals are aggressive for 2020 in light of a few large headwinds, we are committed to demonstrating our continued focus on cost discipline in the quarters and years ahead. For Q1 specifically we expect unit cost to increase roughly 3% and the 4% ASM growth that Andrew mentioned. ","Another important area of focus is our long-term fleet plan. We have an opportunity to replace 61 A319 and A320 aircraft with larger gauge, more efficient asset, either MAX 9s and 10s or Airbus 321neos, all of which would give us the ability to generate more revenue while lower unit cost.","The economics of up-gauging over the next several years are compelling, and we're looking forward to finalizing plans to do this is one of our main 2020 objective. The ultimate timing of a fleet transition will be balanced to smooth incremental training costs especially if moving to a single fleet, and will also be done in a manner that ensures we can meet our free cash flow and capital return goals. We\u2019ll have more on this topic in the quarters come.","Lastly, Ben talk to you about our owners manual, which is something we are excited to share more about later this spring. Alaska led by Brandon these past 10 plus years has established a history of balanced and consistent capital allocation, balance sheet help and cash flow generation that has served the company, our guests, our employees and our owners as well.","The owners manual will serve to build on this history by documenting and memorializing goals in several areas including free cash flow generation, leverage, returns to shareholders, ROIC and pretax margins. It also discusses the factors that have driven and will drive our continued success including the way we serve customers, how we offer value to and create loyalty with guests. And the critical importance of operating with excellence and being a great place to build a career for our people. As Ben said, we will share this in May at our Shareholder Meeting.","And with that, one last [Indiscernible] back over to Brandon.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks Shane. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. We produced a record $1.8 billion of operating cash flow before pension funding, while net CapEx was approximately $700 million resulting in $1.1 billion of free cash flow, a $760 million improvement over last year.","Free cash flow conversion was exceptional at approximately 140%. CapEx was lower than planned because of MAX delivery delays, but plan CapEx was also low because of the intentional constraints we put on CapEx two years ago in order to improve our ability to generate free cash flow.","Our number one capital allocation priority for 2019 was to re-deleverage our balance sheet. We paid off more than $600 million of balance sheet debt that have now paid off $1.5 billion or 75% of the amount we borrowed to acquire Virgin America.","We close the quarter with a debt-to-cap ratio of 41% and with a trailing 12 months net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.9x. We also made a $65 million contribution to our defined-benefit pension plans which are now 86% funded.","Last quarter I mentioned that our treasury team was working hard not only to prepay debt, but to restructure the debt that remains to take advantage of the low rate environment. They've done a great job. We have $1.5 billion of balance sheet debt remaining, 79% of that is fixed and the overall portfolio rate is currently 3%.","Current maturities average only $250 million per year over the next three years, rounding out our fortress balance sheet, our 113 unencumbered mainline and E175 aircraft and $400 million of undrawn lines of credit.","On the capital return side, I hope you all saw that we once again increase the dividend this time $0.10 per share or 7%, signaling our board confidence that we're on the right track and our current expectation that 2020 profits will be eclipsed that of 2019, given that our leverage is basically where we want it we\u2019re poised to increase returns to shareholders with the going in assumption that share repurchases will increase by more than 3x to $250 million this year.","When combined with the higher dividend, we expect return $430 million to our owners this year, the second highest amount in our history. Before we go to Q&A, I thought I might offer some closing thoughts through a more personal lens.","First, you've heard about our competitive advantages. They are real and durable. But the secret sauce of this company is our people. Sure that might sound cliche and I know investors can't model it, but its actually the truth, not just a way they connect with our guests but how resilient and determine they are across all corners of this special company despite our 87-year history of being the underdog.","Second, I couldn't be more enthusiastic about our new CFO. There is nobody here better than Shane that understanding the proper drivers of our business. And finally, we have an awesome strategic plan that's exactly the right plan for where Alaska is today. And we have an exceptional group of leaders especially those around this table that have been incredibly lucky to work with who will make it come to life. Its going to fun to watch.","And with that, let's go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.","Catherine O'Brien","Good afternoon everyone. I think I'd be remiss to not start off by saying congratulations Brandon on your retirement, but I'm sure you know that you will be miss by all. And then from there, I guess, I'll start off with the cost question. So just -- on your cost 2020 outlook, so thinking back, this year's costs were up 2.3% on 2% capacity growth, which as you've just highlight includes about 100 basis points of labor headwind from new agreement featuring [ph] this year? And then in 2020 you're expecting unit cost to increase the similar amount and what could be 150 basis points more capacity. Can you just help us walk through any headwinds you're facing this year? Or any big cost tailwinds dropping from 2019 to help explain that pickup in unit costs? Thanks.","Shane Tackett","Yes. Hi, Katy, this is Shane. I'll take that. And just [Indiscernible], I do think we had a really good year in 2019. If you recall at Investor Day in 2018 we laid out a multiyear sort of roadmap that articulated $160 million of cost savings that we were going to go after over the next couple of years. I think we did really well on a number of those selling related expenses, constraining overhead which was down $40 million. Brandon mentioned the supply chain work that was done this year. So that's all really good. We do have more work to do on the productivity side of the business, asset utilization side of the business.","In order to get those unlocked we need to be able to grow more and to do that we just need more stability in our fleet plan, and we need to unlock some of the constraints in the way of growing which include crew training, and again just sort of knowing which aircraft are going to have over the next year or two. There are a couple of headwind areas principally airport related cost. That is a place we used to be super efficient at, it was maybe 3% or 4% of the cost structure, it 7% or 8% now and I think it can be elevated for a while as aging infrastructure airports does need to be upgraded and we understand and support that. And then, we do have a big maintenance sort of driven expense item this year both on the Airbus and the Boeing side. A lot of the Airbus related costs are related to beginning to account for lease returns that begin in earnest next year.","Catherine O'Brien","Okay, great. Maybe just one quick follow-up on that one. So on the lease returns, do you have any sense or could you give us some color on like what portion of the CASM that's driving this year? Thanks.","Shane Tackett","Yes. Katy, I think we do know that, but I don't think we've given that level of detail on the call. ","Catherine O'Brien","Got it. And maybe just one more on the MAX. So couple of your peers were negatively impacted by lost capacity due to grounding of the MAX in 2019 have reached agreements with Boeing, that should reduce CapEx going forward. Could we see downside to your $750 million CapEx forecast, not only just from the timing shift but also from potential reduction in purchase price if the MAX remains out of service through later this year.","Nathaniel Pieper","Katy, it's Nat Pieper. How are you?","Catherine O'Brien","Thanks.","Nathaniel Pieper","We're talking with Boeing as I think every other airline is on the planet right now. With potential delivery schedules, as you know, we were supposed to have three airplanes last year and take seven more in 2020. It's part of our longer-term fleet strategy and looking at growth and replacement going forward and there's just going to be more to come on that.","Catherine O'Brien","Understood. Thank you.","Nathaniel Pieper","Thanks Katy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth","Hey, good afternoon. Just a little bit of slightly different side of coin to Katy's question on CASMex, but I think Shane you mentioned that your -- the plan is to expand pretax margin. So kind of curious on the revenue side, it seems like there some confidence and maybe you'd outperformed -- you be able to continue outperform in the industry. I'm not quite clear on kind of all the drivers there and what gives you confidence as with everybody having these various revenue initiative. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that?","Andrew Harrison","Hey, Savi, it's Andrew. I think a lot of things that we've had an opportunity to do that we're going to continue to see. The first is, as I shared in my prepared remarks, we do have carryover synergies and initiate that are quite significant. And most of the other carriers had their basic economy in already and of course the synergies in cross fleeting and other things. So that's the benefit that's going to come through. The other thing is that we are really hitting our stride now. We're squarely focused on running our core business. The network team is doing a magnificent job at getting seasonal schedules tighter, more efficient, more productive working with the ops groups and we are now moving away from integration is squarely focused on getting our revenue initiative in more quickly and doing a much better job of it. Overall, from what I'm saying in the first quarter, we feel really good about how all those things are working together on the revenue momentum front.","Savi Syth","Thanks. And then Brandon, if might ask you a question as Brad pointed out, you been doing this for -- Alaska for 16 years and I think longer being part of Alaska. Just wondering over this time, what you consider to be advantages that Alaska have today you didn't see when you kind of joined? And maybe what are the challenges that you see today that are different than that maybe 10, 15 years ago?","Brandon Pedersen","Hi, Savi, that's an interesting question, just off the cuff. What I would say is we're way more discipline than we were 16 years ago, and that just comes from us maturing as a company and getting a better leadership team and focusing more on process that cuts across the operation and how we think about our service and also things cuts across the finance part of the business, as well. In terms of challenges going forward, I think it's just continuing to grow profitably in an industry where four carriers have 85% market share. But I'm confident as I said that we've got a mix of competitive advantages, some tangible and some intangible that will allow us to do this going forward, and I'm really optimistic about the company's future.","Savi Syth","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Caiado with Credit Suisse.","Joe Caiado","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Congrats again, Brandon and Shane. Congrats to Kyle Sangita, lots of congratulations to go around over there. As you as you work on putting together your five-year plan, how was the uncertainty around the MAX impacted that process internally? Have you had to delay certain decisions? Or could it even be seen as an opportunity as you revisit your delivery schedule with Boeing? Shane, you talked about, you're thinking about up gauging, might this actually afford you more flexibility in terms of fleet or CapEx planning as you think about putting together that five-year plan?","Nathaniel Pieper","Hey, Joe, it's Nat Pieper again. I think what we've been focused on is really defining our fleet requirements for the next five to 10 years covering our replacement needs and covering growth. Shane mentioned the 61 A319s and 320s that we currently operate and those are the airplanes that are the primary candidates for replacement. We're looking at the MAX 9 and the MAX 10, looking at the A321neo, and there's going to be upgauge benefits for us with that better cost performance, better revenue performance. Boeing's challenges with the MAX did cause us to rework the sequencing of events and some of our timing. But we're confident that over the next six to nine months we're going to come with a good decision for Alaska. Later this quarter, we're going to start the acquisition process. We will work it through the summer, and we're confident we'll come up with an answer in third quarter, fourth quarter of this year.","Joe Caiado","Appreciate that. Thank you. And then maybe just a quick question on this owners manual, understand more details to come at the annual meeting. We certainly look forward to that. But just can you describe the document a little bit more and its intended purpose? Is that something that would be accompanied by formal changes to the proxy, management compensation structure? Is it more sort of a philosophical documentary or guide post for management. Just how should investors think about that document? Thank you.","Chris Berry","Hey, Joe, this is Chris Berry. It really is more of the latter. I mean, it's, a pretty comprehensive document, but it shares our competitive advantages, our management philosophy, our style, and then really sets up these guideposts for long term financial performance. And so you'll see that laid out in the owners manual. We'll spend more time with you all after we make those announcements to share more of the detail on the sausage making, but that's generally how its laid out.","Joe Caiado","Got it. Thanks, Chris.","Brad Tilden","Chris gave a great answer. I might just sort of maybe add some perspective from the board. Our Board of Directors got very interested in this process. We had two or three investors come and speak with the board 18 months or 24 months ago. The basic idea was we feel like we do articulate how we bring value to our communities, to our customers, to our employees, and they really not just us to say, get more articulate about what the deal is for people that own the business. And I think we've had a lot of fun putting the manual together, I think -- I hope, as we put it out there, I hope you all give us feedback. But it's -- the idea is that we don't want our stock to be a trading vehicle. We don't want as a shareholder roster to be filled with short term investors. We want this to be a fantastic place for you to invest over decades, and we want to be part of getting more respect for the industry, getting people to invest in the airline space to have a mindset when they invest that it's going to be a great long term investment.","So this is sort of us taking a stab at putting -- making some commitments. We know that we've done well when we've made public commitments about what we want to do. So it's Ben and Chris has said, we'll roll this out in May, but we're anxious to get your feedback to it and then have it get better as we move along.","Joe Caiado","Appreciate that insight. Thanks, Brad.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Brandon, and congratulation Ben, it's been a real pleasure with you, dude.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks Hunter.","Hunter Keay","Sure. So I have a question.","Brandon Pedersen","Did you want me to say it's been great working with you dude?","Hunter Keay","No. That's enough for me for now. Thanks Buddy. Giving your comments Ben on hub congestion and Shane some of the comments you made about rising airport costs. So what's the company view on this proposed second airport in the CTAC region? Thanks.","Brandon Pedersen","Hunter, you're talking Paine Field?","Hunter Keay","No, I'm talking about the proposed -- didn't the city Council talk about that there can be some proposal is going to be debated at some point in 2022. about building a second airport in the region just completely from scratch.","Ben Minicucci","Yes. This is a great chance for Diana Birkett Rakow to jump in and she's been working on this, Hunter, and, Diana, why don't you share your thoughts on?","Diana Rakow","Sure. Thanks. Hunter, you've been reading some good, Washington State News. So, the legislature passed a bill last year to set up a governor commission's board to look at potential options for growing capacity across the region. That could be at Paine Field. That could be at another airport in the region, and asked for a recommendation to the governor by January 1, 2022. Shane Jones, who is our Vice President of Airports is on that commission along with many others. And we're very interested in the results. We certainly know that we have fantastic growth in this region, and we have constrained airport space and we want to make sure that we can continue to grow.","Hunter Keay","So Yes, what's your view on it? Do you do you want it to happen? Or I mean, what's your what's your company view?","Diana Rakow","Yes. We do want it to happen. We're really glad that the Commission was set up. We don't have a bias yet as to where that capacity increase occurs. Obviously, there's some underway at CTAC. But we need more than that, and we're anxious to get through the evaluation to make sure we do have a thoughtful answer about where. And it more maybe one location and maybe more than one location at the end.","Hunter Keay","Okay, great. Thanks. And then the second question, Andrew, you talked about sort of the revenue initiatives and network initiatives. It looks like seasonality is kind of creeping back into the P&L a little bit. And that means bad margins in 1Q, and really good margins in 3Q. You guys kind of got away from that a few years ago, and the balance was something you talked about. As you make network changes to sort of return to areas of strength, does it also reintroduce a little bit of sort of quarter-to-quarter seasonal imbalance in your annual earnings results? Is that something you're trying to manage?","Andrew Harrison","Yes. That's how that's been squarely on my team's radar. In fact, just to be frank, I'm watching January and February of this quarter very, very closely, because we made some very significant network moves. And what I'm seeing right now is very decent load factor increases company by yield increases. So, I think going forward, our job will still be in the first and the fourth quarter. But the first quarter is really our biggest challenge. And I think as we move the network around, as we upguage, as we do a lot of other stuff, I think we'll get this a little more in line. But our first quarter is probably going to be always the weakest.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from a line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg","Hey, everybody, and just to kind of echo the sentiment of everyone else. Brandon, it's been a great run. So on that note, I'm going to ask a pension question, but you can deflect over. One more pension question, right. But I don't know if you may have mentioned it earlier. But do we see in 2020, do we see a benefit in the non-op from maybe better than expected returns in your pension in 2019?","Brandon Pedersen","Yes, definitely, the non-op portion will be a small favorable improvement year-over-year.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, great. And then just my second question, and maybe this is more to Andrew. When we think about, you talk about growth, and I sense that, it's all about margin growth and earnings growth. But we also look at sort of where your supply growth is relative to the industry. And the 3% to 4% number, if we were to go back, 12 plus months pre MAX, was that where the planning was for 2020? Maybe 2021? Or is that maybe even a bit on the low side, because you've had some pretty meaningful network changes. It does seem like you've pulled back some trans cons and some longer hauls. That 3%, 4%, how has that changed maybe post MAX is what I'm asking? Thanks.","Andrew Harrison","That's good question. I think, well, for 2019 we were more deliberate about slowing our growth as we tried to get the integration behind us. I would say for 2020, our growth is lower than we would like, just to be honest. And the MAX for sure, has pushed on that a little bit. But also, we're working through this multi fleet and crew and all the rest. But at the end of the day, as we've shared, it's 4% to 6% growth. And I'm looking forward to getting through some of these decisions and challenges so that we can move this forward.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, great. And just one just one last word to Brandon, and I presumably you picked the march week, the first week of March, because that's when S&P upgrades you to investment grade, right? We should assume that?","Brandon Pedersen","Bless you, man.","Michael Linenberg","Congratulations.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen.","Helane Becker","Thank you very much operator, and Brandon, I will echo everybody else's comments wellness [ph] working with you. Shane, we're looking forward to working with you. And Brandon, I'm looking forward to seeing what your next chapter is going to look like. So two questions. One is, are you doing any accruals for prospective contracts like for the pilot contract? Or is that an after the fact item?","Brandon Pedersen","No. It's an after the fact item for us.","Helane Becker","Okay. And then my next question is kind of unrelated to some of the things we've talked about so far. With --I know you guys have a lot of co-chair agreements and interline agreements with various international airlines, especially ones in Asia, and China. And I'm wondering if you're seeing any declines in passenger transfers between your airline and those airlines? Or if it's way too soon with what's going on in China?","Andrew Harrison","Helane, it's Andrew. We've looked at it. The International connectivity to and from especially China and some of Asia is a very small number for us. And so, as we look at our growth and traffic right now, it has not been impacted at this time because of this.","Helane Becker","Okay. And then just one other question. On Transcon, do you have to rethink your decision not to have live flat seats, as you grow that business or are you not going to grow that business going forward? Thank you.","Andrew Harrison","Yes. Thanks Helane. Actually, that's a fair question, but I have been extremely encouraged by what's happened in the Transcom business. How we've restructured our pricing and the product and the loyalty growth that we've seen. So right now, the product that we have on board is working very well for us. And I still see upside, even going forward. So for me right now live flat seeds is not something that I'm consider -- that we're looking at.","Helane Becker","Okay, great. Thank you.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks Helane.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi","Hey, good evening, everybody. Brandon, congrats.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks Joe.","Joseph DeNardi","I felt like some of the commentary around the fleet transition and the capital that could go with that what was a little bit cryptic. So can you just maybe provide a little bit more clarity around maybe how capital intensive the business could get over that period? Or what your commitments in terms of returning cash to shareholders would be through that? Thank you.","Shane Tackett","Hey, Joe, it's Shane. Yes, we're not sort of in a position to have a lot of precision around that, just because we don't know what this deal might look like or deals might look like as we go out and look at acquiring aircraft. But certainly, replacing 61 aircraft over a period of time is going to require some capital. A lot of those as you know our lease today, there's a chance that we could replace some of those with leases. But our goal is to sort of get the best value and the best deal for Alaska as we go through this process with the manufacturers. And we'll say more about this when we roll out the owner's manual, but also be very committed to returns to shareholders assuming we have good profitability, which is what we're planning to have over the next several years.","Brandon Pedersen","And just Brandon maybe just a follow-up, but it's not intended to be cryptic at all. It's really just the uncertainty around the timing and what we actually do that will drive CapEx for the year. But just to reiterate what Shane said, that's really one of the purposes of the owners manual was to allow some guidelines to make sure that we're meeting our commitments on balance sheet strength and free cash flow generation.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay, and then Brad I think, either you or Brandon have mentioned how much of the Virgin debt you've paid down about 73 times over the past 12 months. So, it's clearly something that you think is important. Can you just give -- help us understand what we should interpret that as like what happens when all of the debt is paid down? What, why is that so important in your view? Thank you.","Brad Tilden","Yes, well, we'd never done M&A before. If I recall, we paid $2.6 billion, the equity value for Virgin America we financed to, 2 or 2.1 billion of that were debt and Brandon, you can audit me as we go here. But that was different, and we are super proud of a very conservative balance sheet, a conservative financial profile. And it was important to get the balance sheet back to what investors think of, what we, how we think of ourselves as quickly as we could. So we are really proud to have paid off 75% of 2 billion and now it's 74 times or whatever that we have mentioned that.","I think the other reason that's important is, is all of this and some of the messaging we're trying to do today. All of this positions us to move forward. Now. It's, as you go through every -- you always learn things, but these are big things. There's all kinds of systems and brand and loyalty and single certificate, reservations. There's so much stuff that needs to be done and for a while you are actually really held into that space. But what we're trying to say is that's behind us now, we're no more looking through the rear-view mirror. We're looking forward where what are the things that make Alaska great, what are the things that make it great for investors and customers and investors? Sorry, investors, customers, employees, and let's, let's -- let's put all eyes to the front windshield moving forward, continuing to make a great airline even better. So that's what we're -- that's the messaging we're trying to do. I'm not sure how well we've done it, but that is our mindset.","Joseph DeNardi","Thanks, Brad.","Brad Tilden","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie Baker","Hey there. Another shout out to Brandon. It's important to me to try to one up hundred sentiments in particular. So, I'm actually planning to send you an aircraft model as a gift currency glass because at that run, it won't run afoul of my compliance policy. It\u2019s a perfect gift. Question on the on the two-week road show that Brad spoke enthusiastically about in the prepared remarks. Presumably the mood amongst the rank and file is positive, but could you identify the typical areas of dissatisfaction?","Ben Minicucci","Hey, Jamie, it's Ben. It\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m thinking back within several roadshows across all our big hubs, there were a lot of questions related to some internal things, internal systems that we needed to operate better within the company, so it's and this will be stuff that borrows you guys with timekeeping systems and scheduling systems. But I would say overall what was really good for me, my big takeaway is they were really energized about the vision and the plan over the next five years. There was growth and the big thing, yes, one of the biggest things was that the Virgin America questions weren't there anymore.","These people were gelling as one team, and it just felt for the first time in three years doing all these road shows that it felt like the airline was one, and that was so inspiring. And again, we did all our big stations it was a lot of fun.","Jamie Baker","Okay, thanks a lot. Second, when I think back, pre-merger Alaska, went through a phase of innovation. I think you were the first with, self printing bag tags, I remember to experiment with our RFID key chain that would check customers in when they enter the terminals. So obviously that switching back before smartphones. It's not going to impact my 2020 model or anything. But was that, was that just a phase? I mean, I'm wondering if the march to 13% to 15% margins also includes, once again, pushing the envelope in terms of technology and I think it more about what the customer experiences, not too much, distribution. Is this also a mandate for choose area?","Andrew Harrison","Hi, Jamie, this is Andrew. It absolutely is, and I think if you just look at the airline industry today, it's not as much about networks anymore. Obviously for the big guys. I fly everywhere. It's about the guests. It's about the interaction of the guests. It's about making it easy and bringing that all together.","And I think on the innovation front we got distracted by the integration. And I think what I'm really excited about is organizationally, and I think it's okay to say too we also have an order. Excuse me. We have a subcommittee of the board now, that's focused on innovation, that true and I are accountable to. So, I think you're going to see some real momentum here. You're right. 2020 won't be started. But on the next few years is a big focus for us.","Jamie Baker","Excellent. I appreciate the color. Take care, everybody.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey thanks, not much more to add at this point. Best wishes Brandon on the next chapter. Not sure if you'd be willing to talk about it. But do you have a non-compete and if you do, how long does it last?","Brandon Pedersen","It last\u2019s 15 years. And actually, not willing to talk about it because it's not focused on Air Group going forward. So next question please?","Duane Pfennigwerth","Fair enough. On free cash flow. Great to hear you're stepping back up the buyback in 2020. Just checking the math a little bit, because if you truly are done re-deleveraging, it feels like it could be substantially bigger than what you've outlined. So, should we think about this as a starting point? Or are you looking to build cash for now?","Brad Tilden","Duane, maybe I'll take that one. Yes, we're not looking to build cash. We ended the year with a billion five. That's probably about where we see it ending next year as well. You are absolutely right with the math that you are doing. There will be more, but it's all dependent on what we end up doing with the fleet decision. That's why we started at 250. But we're going to be flexible on that and we have capacity under our existing repurchase program to do more than 400. So, we'll wait and see.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks. And then if I could sneak one last one in for Andrew sorry for the baseball analogy. What inning would you say you're in with respect to the premium revenue push, both in inventory, availability, availability and your ability to merchandise it? Thanks for taking the questions.","Brad Tilden","Yes, I'd say we're sort of in the final innings as far as putting the inventory on the shelf. We took 25 175 and all the conversions. We're now turning over to upselling and all the rest of it. And we've got, we've got ways to go there to do a better job there.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you.","Brad Tilden","Thanks, Duane.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Matthew Wisniewski","Hey, this is actually Matt Wisniewski on for Brandon. First Congrats, Brandon. But I just had one quick question. One that is think about to get some additional color on how we should be thinking about growth this year. Last year, I was focused on regional this year shift towards the main line. Whether that's new markets. And then, in the case of the Max not returning, what levers potentially could you pulled it potentially mitigate the impact whether it's utilize, utilization or anything else?","Brandon Pedersen","Yes, basically, the -- I'm sorry, I got distracted on growth\u2026","Matthew Wisniewski","Where it was reasonably, geographically where it\u2019s going to be\u2026.","Brandon Pedersen","The growth is 100% mainline, the regional is shrinking just a little bit. And then we do have some levers to pull, whether it's paint lines, mod lines or some other things that we really don't want to, but if we needed to, we might be able to squeeze some more out, possibly Airbus lease extensions as well.","Matthew Wisniewski","Okay, thank you.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS.","Myles Walton","Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering in the context of the 3% to 4% capacity growth you are looking for in 2020 kind of what you're looking for from the regional versus the main line and also in the context of your fleet planning decision? How intertwined is the exercise of the options and the 175s to the decisions on the main line side, and did they kind of have to happen in sequence?","Brad Tilden","Just on the growth as I just shared it's all mainline this year, regionals flat down.","Andrew Harrison","Yes. And on the question about the options for E175, we've, we've done a bunch of regional growth recently, we're going to focus on mainline, fleet plan over the next several months and then by the end of the year miles, we do plan to make some decisions about what we want to do with the regional fleet over a five to 10 year period as well.","Myles Walton","And you guys have that kind of unique advantage of having in the past operated the single fleet and going to get the complexity of the second type and I know in the prepared remarks you, you hinted at the evaluation of that single fleet benefit. Can you maybe lay out economically what you've seen as that complexity costs of the dual fleets and maybe what that is as a put, if you decide to maintain a dual fleet?","Brad Tilden","Hey Myles, I might not provide a specific number. We do -- we have looked at it, there are clearly some hard costs associated with just crew and some maintenance, provisioning and those sorts of things, some training, there are a lot of soft costs that sort of get lost that it's hard to quantify around just schedule efficiency and making sure you have the right planes in the right, the right cities on every single flight and it gets more complicated during the regular ops. But I mean, it's not insignificant and so if we maintain a dual fleet, we'll just need to make sure we can get the revenue out of the aircraft.","Myles Walton","All right, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darryl Genovesi with Vertical Research.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi guys. Thanks for time. Hey Andrew as a follow-up to Savi the 2019 RASM outperformance of the industry really just reversed the underperformance that you saw in 2018 despite the synergies and commercial initiatives. So just wanted to ask you when you say you will be similarly, you think it will be similar successful in 2020? Do you think that you have enough in the toolbox actually outperformed domestic industry RASM in 2020? Particularly starting in the second quarter when the prior comp start to get more difficult?","Andrew Harrison","Yes, and again, I'm only going to comment on the first quarter, but I think what I would share is that we have some good initiatives and some good momentum here to continue to grow unit revenues over the course of every quarter this year.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. And then Brandon, I apologize in advance because the overall body of work speaks for itself. But Shane, without completely front running the Investor Day message, what do you think Brandon might have done a little differently over the last 10 years?","Shane Tackett","Brandon was a particular stickler for not allowing us to enjoy box lunches, but expected us to work at the same time. But I'll probably adopt that, it was a good a good message of reality.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. And then Brandon now that Shane has completed the airing of grievances in a [Indiscernible] way as possible, how sympathetic to this situation where you feeling when you came up with this 2% CASM ex-guide?","Brandon Pedersen","Honestly, I'm really not to dodge the question. I actually do love the discipline we have in the 2020 budget. And I know everybody's aligned around, just really getting back to a place where we reinforce that competitive advantage. We have that as the cost advantage. And I don't know what you thought of the headline 2% number was that some uncertainty with respect to capacity, but I'll tell you we are really focused on making sure that this place rocks when it comes to cost performance.","Darryl Genovesi","Right. Thanks a lot guys. Congrats, Brandon.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks.","Brad Tilden","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay, and your last question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Dan McKenzie","Hey, thanks good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Congrats Brandon and Shane. Nicely done, echoing everybody else here of course. So I guess a couple questions Andrew or Shane, I wonder if you can elaborate a bit more on how you plan to integrate the Max's into the fleet once they come, so, specifically once you get the green light from Boeing, how much time are you building in for filling the plane before they go into service? So like, a one month booking window two months. And I just, I guess what my question is getting at is could this shorter booking window, way on system revenue? And are the new revenue initiatives that you, you kind of outlined intended to offset some of those challenges?","Brandon Pedersen","Yes, Dan, we've got we've got pilots that are available to fly. I think at the end of the day, what I would say is, is that we're going to start this thing off, we're just going to fly it up and down the West Coast. But we will have enough flexibility, given the number that we're getting to be able to weave these into the schedule, maybe first as spares and then build into revenue production over a period depending on the market 60 to 90 days.","Shane Tackett","But Andrew, I think it's true, we're going to sell as if we plan to lift the capacity one way or the other. So, I'm not going to shorten the booking window, right, but we intend to deploy the Max's.","Dan McKenzie","I see. Okay, very good. And then, the reference on the premium revenue and the repaired prepared remarks. What is the plan growth on premium seats this year? And, and where are you at in the premium seating reconfiguration of the Virgin fleet?","Brandon Pedersen","So where the growth is going to slow significantly, we've got about 20 units to convert, of which the front cabin goes from 8 seats to 12 seats, but at the end of the day, we're now really Dan the opportunity is now we've got all the premium class out there all the 175 out there, and all the conversions that's really the upsell and growing that nicely.","Dan McKenzie","Understood. Okay, thanks for the time you guys.","Brad Tilden","And I think that is my understanding is correct. I think Dan McKenzie was our last question for the quarter. Thanks, everybody, for tuning in. Thanks for being a part of this and we look forward to talking with you after the first quarter earnings and we as Ben said, I hope many of you can join our shareholder call where we talk more about the owner's manual.

My name is Megan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Investor Relations, Chris Berry.","Chris Berry","Thanks, Megan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Alaska Air Group's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. On the call today are CEO, Brad Tilden; and our CFO, Brandon Pedersen, will provide some highlights from the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter. We will also provide capacity growth projections for 2014. Several members of our senior management team are also here to help with the Q&A.","Our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings available on our website. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a third quarter GAAP profit of $289 million. The GAAP result includes a $192 million pre-tax or $120 million after-tax noncash special revenue item related to the accounting for our recently modified affinity card agreement. Accounting rules required us to revalue the deferred revenue associated with miles previously sold to our bank partner, with a corresponding benefit to revenue.","Excluding this special revenue item and the impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio, Air Group reported a record adjusted net income of $157 million or $2.21 per share. This compares to a First Call mean estimate of $2.14 per share and to last year's adjusted net income of $150 million or $2.09.","Additional information about cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging, capital expenditures and other items can be found in our Investor update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Brad.","Bradley D. Tilden","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased to report our best quarterly profit ever. Our people worked together to produce these results in the face of significant competitive incursions into our core markets on the West Coast and in the State of Alaska. I want to thank them all for operating safely and on time and for continuing to provide JD Power-caliber service to our customers. Our people at Alaska led the major airlines in on-time performance for the most recent periods available, both for the 3 and 12 months ended August 31, 2013. And in the month of September, they achieved the highest customer satisfaction score we have received in the 7 years that we've been tracking this metric.","Our record adjusted earnings of $157 million marked our 18th consecutive quarterly profit and represent an 18.4% pre-tax margin. We believe this will be one of the highest margins in the industry. Our trailing 12-month return on invested capital is 13% and 2013 will be our 4th consecutive year in which we'll exceed our 10% after tax target.","As you know, we're also returning significant capital to shareholders as we continued our share repurchase plan during the quarter, and as we initiated our first quarterly dividend in 21 years.","Let's talk for a moment about the competitive incursions we saw this summer. Although total industry domestic capacity in the third quarter was only up slightly, nearly 1\/3 of all additions took place in city fares where Alaska flies. Specifically, our long-haul Alaska routes and our North-South West Coast routes were impacted disproportionately causing significant yield pressure. In fact, yields were down about 15% in the long haul Alaska markets.","In the face of these significant increases, we posted our best quarterly result ever, a result which speaks to the strength and diversification of our route network.","Unit revenues increased in nearly every other region during the quarter, and we were especially pleased with Hawaii. You'll recall that we've talked in the past couple of calls about a surplus of capacity in our California-Hawaii routes. We made scheduled adjustments which were effective in late April and unit revenues in this region responded nicely, especially in the Bay Area.","We know that many of you are wondering about Delta's capacity additions in several of our markets, including Seattle-Los Angeles, Seattle-Las Vegas and Seattle-San Francisco. United has also added capacity to the Seattle-San Francisco market by adding frequency and up-gauging their service to mainline jets. There's really not a lot we can say about this, except that we're focused on the situation and we're confident in our ability to deal with it as we dealt with new competition in the past. Alliances can be complicated. It's likely that in the future, there will be markets where it's in our interest to work together with Delta and there will be markets where we will compete because it's in the best interest of Alaska Air Group to do so. We have a long-standing alliance with Delta, but many of their recent domestic additions are in core Air Group markets, and we intend to compete aggressively and defend them vigorously.","We talked about cash generation and the improvement in our balance sheet in other quarters, but it's worth emphasizing again as both continue to improve. For the past 12 months, our operation generated $940 million of cash flow. We've used this cash to buy 8 new aircraft free and clear, to pay down $175 million of debt and to repurchase $91 million of stock.","As we sit here today, we have essentially no net debt, we have $1.4 billion in the bank, we have 46 unencumbered 737s and our pensions are almost fully funded. This is all made possible by our profitability. And at this point, we're expecting to post a record full year result in 2013 and we're optimistic about 2014. We've been working hard to ensure that we have a plan for next year to continue this strong performance. As we look forward, we'll have typical inflationary cost pressures and rising pressure from competitive capacity adds. But these will be offset by our baggage and change fee increases, which will take effect in the next couple of weeks; by our cabin upgrade project, which will come online beginning in December; by our new affinity card agreement, which was signed in July; and by what we believe will be a material reduction in pension expense in 2014.","Switching gears, Alaska was recently named the most fuel efficient airline in the U.S. by the International Council on Clean Transportation. This was the first study of its kind done in the U.S. and the recognition is gratifying. Our goal is to be the industry leader in environmental stewardship and this award validates that the work we've been doing is paying off. Fuel-efficiency is important, not only in protecting the environment, but also in protecting our bottom line.","When we declared a dividend back in July, we did so with the confidence that our financial success was sustainable. We have loyal customers who view Alaska as their hometown airline. We earn this loyalty with low fares, with industry-leading operational performance and with award-winning customer service. We have single fleets of fuel-efficient aircraft at both Alaska and Horizon that are well-suited to flying in our markets and that have better cost than the legacy airlines. And most importantly, we have great employees who have helped us restructure this company and who are fiercely proud of what we have built. Of course, this business is challenging but we're in this together, and we're very much looking forward to the future, a future where we plan to continue to perform for our customers, our communities, our employees and our owners.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Thanks, Brad. Hello, everyone. The $251 million adjusted free tax profit this quarter represents a $7 million improvement over the third quarter of 2012. Excluding the special revenue item that Chris described, total operating revenues increased by $93 million or 7% on the 7% increase in capacity.","Passenger RASM declined by 1.2%, largely on the competitive pressures that Brad described, partially offset by 0.6 of 1 point of PRASM benefit from the modified affinity card agreement. Total RASM was about flat, helped 1.5 percentage points by the affinity card agreement, including $8 million related to additional compensation received for miles sold in the first half of the year. We'll continue to see favorable impacts to unit revenue comps for the next 3 quarters as we annualize the deal.","Total nonfuel operating cost increased by 9%, resulting in a 1.4% increase in CASM x fuel. Wages and benefits were the primary drivers of the year-over-year increase. This was mostly related to the new long-term agreement with Alaska's pilots. The quarter included about half a year's worth of annual increase because the contract was effective back to April 1st, even though it was ratified in July.","Productivity continues to improve. On a passenger per employee basis, Air Group's productivity increased by 4% this quarter. This was consistent with our guiding principle that we want to pay our people well with a goal of reaching the industry's best productivity over time. Our productivity today is 43% better than where it was back in 2003. This has been a significant factor in our financial success and I want to acknowledge our employees' contributions and openness to change that made that kind of progress possible.","Landing fees and other rents were higher in the quarter as we continued to accrue the higher rates imposed on us by the Port of Seattle that we told you about last quarter. We just recently signed a new lease with the Port that has lower rates than those imposed, but it still needs to be signed by enough carriers for it to be effective in 2013. We'll know much more in the fourth quarter and we're hopeful we can record the favorable adjustment to reflect the lower rates in this fiscal year.","Based on what we see today, we expect full year nonfuel unit cost to be about flat to up very, very slightly. Estimated incentive pay has increased, which reflects healthy profits but puts pressure on CASMex, and we had hoped to have the Sea-Tac lease resolved sooner.","Looking forward, our system level of growth will slow from the pace we've seen recently. For Air Group, we expect capacity growth of just under 5% in the fourth quarter and just over 5% in 2014. With much of that growth coming from larger 900 ER airplanes and the impact of the extra seats that we'll be adding to the 800 and 900 fleets. Right now, we're deep into the 2014 budgeting process. We're not ready to give guidance on next year's costs just yet, but as our growth slows, bringing unit cost down may prove to be challenging. Some of the headwinds are familiar: higher wages, much of which is associated with new labor agreements; medical cost inflation and additional significant investments into important IT infrastructure and innovation projects are all putting pressure on costs.","Our 2014 profit will be helped, however, by the powerful profit drivers we announced back in July. The seats, the bag and fee changes and the modified affinity deal that together, when fully implemented, are worth $150 million or more per year.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. Through the first 9 months of the year, we've generated $820 million of operating cash flow compared to $638 million last year. Capital spending was $395 million, resulting in free cash flow of $425 million.","We've used that free cash flow in a balanced and deliberate way to strengthen the business by paying off $139 million of long-term debt, which has dissolved normal maturities, using $14 million to pay the first dividend since 1992 and repurchasing over 1.5 million shares of our common stock for $83 million. We currently have $150 million remaining under our $250 million authorization. Our goal of finishing the program by the end of next year remains. However, we do have the authority to accelerate buyback activity and may do so, especially if we see any significant pullback in our share price.","We're now projecting CapEx to be $520 million this year, up a bit because we just exercised options for 5 aircraft that will be delivered in 2015 through 2017. We also worked with Boeing to move options for 5 additional aircraft out of 2015 and '16 and into 2018 and '19 where we previously had no options. This gives us a bit more flexibility with the fleet in those later years, slows closer in growth, allowing us to digest all of the recent new markets and helps us lower CapEx somewhat in 2014 and 2015 to maximize free cash flow generation.","Our adjusted debt to cap ratio now stands at 47%, which is comparable to high-quality industrial companies outside of our industry. Improving operating results and a stronger credit metrics were cited by Standard & Poor's recently when the raised our credit rating a notch to BB. Our strong balance sheet and access the liquidity will continue to and have served this company well.","With the de-leveraging basically complete, a larger percentage of future free cash flow will be available to return to capital providers.","I want to mention one other item before we go to Q&A. We're happy to report our pensions were about 95% funded on a PBO basis at September 30. This is because of our multi-pronged strategy to address our pension obligation, including the $575 million that we've contributed at the plans over the last 5 years, even though none was required and the plan restructuring that we've done. As a reminder, all of our defined benefit plans are closed to new entrants and the management DB plan will be frozen on January 1, 2014. We've also had some help from strong investment income and the recent increase in interest rates.","As a result of all these factors, we expect a reduction in pension expense next year that could be $40 million or more. That's a very preliminary number, but lower pension costs will offset some of the cost pressures I talked about earlier.","Finally, I hope to see you all at our Investor Conference on November 14 in New York. If you haven't registered yet and you would like to, please let Chris know. With that, we'd now like to open it up to Q&A. Chris?","Chris Berry","Alright Megan, go ahead and prompt for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I'm just wondering, it feels like State of Alaska, probably a little bit better but clearly, some more competition in the fourth quarter along the West Coast. How much do you think competition cost you or incremental competition cost you in the third quarter? And how do you view it sort of fourth quarter, first quarter, it is it getting worse? Is it getting better? Is it about the same?","Andrew Harrison","It's Andrew. The competitive pressures from other airlines peaked at about 10% growth in the third quarter. As we see it, it's about 7% growth in the fourth quarter, and then about 8% in the first quarter. So it's reducing. At the end of the day, we've seen good strengthening of our development markets and we feel very good about our lower capacity in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter to help offset these adds.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And you mentioned some favorable cost items in 2014. I may have missed it, how should we be thinking about sort of your total x fuel cost looking into next year?","Brandon S. Pedersen","It's Brandon. We haven't given guidance yet on 2014 x fuel cost, you can expect more at Investor Day. I did make the comment that as the growth slows, it will be more difficult to bring down unit cost. We are totally focused on it. We're in the midst of the budget season right now. We've have a long track record of bringing down unit cost. We recognized its importance. We're trying to balance that with some of the normal inflationary pressures we're dealing with, plus our decision to continue to make strategic investments into IT and perhaps, the brand as we move into 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Trahan.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","For the brand, Brandon?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Brands Brandon, yes.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","What do you meant by that?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Yes, well, Hunter, as you know, we've had a project ongoing by about 1 year, 1.5 years now, to see if there were ways that we could make our brand more energetic and compelling, particularly to folks outside of the Pacific Northwest. We are early in that process, but we're making good headway. I'll let Joe talk about it more. We may end up spending some money on that in 2014. We haven't quantified that. As I said, we're early on in the process, but it may cost us something to make changes to the brand.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Well, that's fine. We can talk about it later. But my question was, first of all, I love the commentary on the buyback acceleration potentially, but why, just to play devil's advocate for a second, why would you wait for a pullback if your stock if so cheap? You know it, I know it, everyone knows your stock is undervalued, so the stock chart doesn't necessarily mean that the stock is appropriately priced or whatever. So why would you not accelerate the buyback now anyway, given what your stock trades in relation to the returns that you're generating?","Brandon S. Pedersen","We may very well do that.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Wonderful. And in terms of the TRASM gap to PRASM in the third quarter, it was a little bit bigger than I thought and my beloved change fees and bag fees don't even kick in until next week. So should we expect that gap between TRASM and PRASM to continue to accelerate into the first quarter of next year?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Hunter, it's Brandon again. We don't give a lot of guidance on PRASM or RASM numbers I think you hit on an important topic which is the change fees do kick in later this year and we'll really start to see that in the first quarter. Our total revenue number includes some other things like cargo, which has been relatively flat. We did see some growth in the quarter, but relatively flat when compared to overall capacity growth. So it's a complicated question. The other thing and we did mention it into our prepared remarks is that PRASM included $8 million of retro associated with the new bank deal that won't carryover, that's a one-time deal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Godyn, Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Brandon, I was hoping a follow-up on one of the cost comments earlier. I can appreciate not giving sort of a point estimate for guidance in 2014, but we've heard this commentary in the past where you highlight a whole long list of cost pressures and then once that guidance comes out, we're still seeing down CASM x fuel year-over-year, you mentioned a good guy with a pension expense here. Just in broad strokes, are we still -- I mean, is the management ideology still in the world where we think we can improve the CASM x fuel cost structure year-over-year? Are there still opportunities to do that as we look out the next few years?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Yes. I think the management -- our head is totally in continuing to reduce cost as we look forward. As you said, we're not ready to give a specific estimate, but we do think that there's continued opportunity to improve productivity, for example. And while it may slow next year, longer-term, we do think it's important for us to be able to continue to drive down cost to get our cost structure closer to the low-cost carriers.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then just on ancillary revenues, kind of big picture, we've seen you guys do some very thoughtful ancillaries recently and they're very powerful in a sense that they're not the types that necessarily drive a substitution effect with yields or PRASM or how we think about it. Can you just kind of speak to the ancillary strategy bigger picture? Are there more of these types of opportunities down the line that you guys are investigating?","Joseph A. Sprague","John, this is Joe Sprague from marketing. I think at a high level, the first thing as you point out, we're wanting to implement and do so successfully with our new bag fee and change fee increases that will go into effect next week. Overall, I think we're actually pleased with, even before those changes take effect, how ancillaries are performing this year. For the quarter, our ancillaries per passenger were at $11.94 and that was up from $11.78 in the same period last year. And bag fees was a big contributor to that, so they're performing better even before the new increase goes into effect. And we've also seen some great progress with our buy on board food program as well. So I think high level, are there other things we can do? You bet, and we absolutely look at those all the time. And as we get these current changes implemented, we'll continue to focus on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on the topic that's been discussed much. But just with Delta's action, I was just wondering, is the positive aspects of Delta having a lot more international and therefore, needing a lot more feed from you over -- is that business overshadowing the negative impact it's having from a competitive standpoint?","Andrew Harrison","Savi, it's Andrew. Yes, Delta is continuing to grow its international presence. And as we have 55% of the seat share in Seattle, we obviously, bring a lot of that traffic into Seattle. But as Brad eloquently put in his opening remarks, we'll work together where there's benefit as we work with them on the international growth. And then where there is competition, and we work there, head-to-head competition, then we'll vigorously defend our core markets.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just -- have you taken any kind of moves in the near term in relation to that?","Andrew Harrison","As far as the competitive, we have. We have increased our market presence in both Seattle-LA Seattle-Las Vegas, Seattle-San Francisco. So we absolutely have and working to vigorously defend that. We also -- Joe's team did a double miles earning elite on qualifying status on those markets as well.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And one last question, just on the West Coast market. So the pressure that you saw in the summer, is that continuing into the fall as well?","Andrew Harrison","The specific pressure that goes on into the fall, Savi, is not so much in the State of Alaska, but more up and down the West Coast, the Seattle-LAs, Seattle-Vegases, Seattle-San Francisco.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So that continues to the same magnitude?","Andrew Harrison","If not, a little bit more.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I actually wanted to know one kind of housekeeping item, or maybe 2. Landing fees were up 16% and so there's a two-part question. One is the drivers for that, and two is, with all the new capacity going into Seattle, I know that's it historically been a high cost airport for you, does that help that line item slow growth? I probably asked that backwards. Does that help in terms of lower cost increases going forward?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Helane, it's Brandon. Maybe I'll start with the first part and then Ben can help with the second part. On the landing fee increase, much of that increase is related to the increase that we saw at Seattle or you might be back -- remember back at the end of the second quarter, we told you that the Port of Seattle had imposed rates on us in the absence of a lease agreement that go back to January 1 and we're still accruing at that higher rate. So if you carve that out, the increase is basically a volume-related increase, as well as just what I would consider more normalized increases at other locations. As I mentioned, we did sign a new lease with the port and once enough airlines are able to sign that, we're hopeful that, that will be reflected in 2013 as a favorable adjustment because the new lease has rates that are lower than those imposed. In terms of the growth in Seattle and how that might help us, Ben, do you want to talk about that?","Benito Minicucci","Helane, what I could tell you just about cost is that year -- I mean, before resolution rates, rates are increasing. So it's a volume and rate equation that's causing our rates to go up. So even with increased capacity, we'll still see higher cost for ourselves in Seattle.","Unknown Executive","More volume theoretically helps. I don't think it's going to actually help, Helane.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Did that help?","Helane R. Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","All right, so -- yes, that's fine. I don't have a problem with that. And then my other question is, with respect to fuel hedging, given -- I know you guys believe in it and so on, but any talk to changing the amount you hedged going forward, maybe with fuel cost coming down?","Mark Eliasen","This is Mark. We have quite satisfied with our program. It's worked for us, as you know, for 13 years. We have made some adjustments with the deductibles but overall, we're happy with the program, and I think we're going to stay the course.","Brandon S. Pedersen","[indiscernible] let [indiscernible] to remind [indiscernible] on the call -- this is Brad, we had gone from hedging 50% of our fuel with basically half the money call options to 50% and starting 3 years out, to 50% of our capacity with 20% out of the money call options starting what, Mark? 12 or 18 months out?","Mark Eliasen","Yes. Well, we're at 6 months. Yes.","Bradley D. Tilden","6 Month. So our -- Helane, our premium expense, that -- it may not sound like that's a material change in sort of the premium money that we're spending to hedge. And that's happened over the last 18 months or something.","Mark Eliasen","Yes, that's right. And the premium should go down from about $45 million so far year-to-date, down to about $20 million to $25 million a year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Fintzen with Barclays.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A question, I think Brad, you kind of referenced this in your opening comments but I'm just curious how Southern California and some of the new flying you added about a year ago is developing, particularly, some of those transcons. And then how San Diego, et cetera, kind of fits into your growth plans going forward?","Bradley D. Tilden","We'll ask Andrew to give some color on that.","Andrew Harrison","David, we're seeing continued improvement in our transcon markets. We just recently moved our San Diego-Orlando to a daytime flight from a redeye and we're seeing very nice unit revenue increases moving out. As far as San Diego goes in general, we just look for opportunistic things to do there. We have a decent presence there. We've served that market for a long, long time. And again, a lot of new markets but they're basically developing in line where we expect but it will take them a few years to mature.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And just -- did I understand the comments -- the 5-ish percent was a 14 ASM growth? Was that -- -- I think it was in Brandon's comments.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Yes, it's actually that Q4 number and basically the 2014 number as we see it today. And I made the point in the prepared remarks but it's worth mentioning again that a lot of that comes from the gauge of the 900 ERs that are coming in, as well as the additional row of seats that we'll be adding to the 800s and 900s. So unit growth or airplane growth, maybe is a better way to say it, on the main line side, were only up 2 units next year.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And so just remind us, I think you have said this before, the added seats, what does that translate into the ASMs? Is that a full point?","Andrew Harrison","Yes, about a point in 2014 and a point in 2015, just because we'll be working through much of '14 to get that project done.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two questions here. Just back on the pension expense, I think you indicated that it was going to be down, it could be down, I mean, rough estimate's $40 million. What is the base?","Brandon S. Pedersen","What is the base in courier pension expense? It's right around $50 million.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Wow, so that could fall like 80%. Okay.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Yes, and the accounting rules require us to snap the line as of December 31 and that sets the bar going forward. So that is a preliminary number. But based on what we see today, we're encouraged that our costs are going to go down a lot in that area.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, very good. And then just my second question, when you look at the new flights that Delta's putting in and you're adding additional flights, are those markets that you currently codeshare on or are you not codesharing on them now? Can you talk about that?","Bradley D. Tilden","This is Brad. I might chat about the Delta relationship for a bit. First of all, the new flights that Delta's putting in into some of our North-Southwest markets are markets that we will not be code sharing on. And a lot of folks have asked question about Delta and I guess one of the things that I want folks to know that we're trying to do here is take the emotion out of this process and make the best decisions that we possibly can. I would think that as we move forward, there are going to be places where it's going to be in our interest to work with Delta and we're going to support them, they're growing internationally by itself, that should be a good thing for both of us, and so we're going to work with them to grow the connections between the 2 airlines. And then there are places where they are growing in North-South markets that have been long-term core markets for Alaska Air Group. And in those markets, we will compete and we'll defend what we've built over the next years. But we got a long-standing relationship with these folks. We had a lot of competition North-South and the West Coast over the years. It will be a little complicated, but that's the world we're moving into and I think it's going to be okay.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Is there -- just as a follow-up, is there -- I mean, there's a lot of players in these markets. I mean, is there the possibility that maybe someone else besides you or Delta or even United may end up actually scaling back supply? And is there anything out in the forward schedule data that maybe suggests that there are some pullbacks, maybe by some who are being hurt disproportionately from this?","Bradley D. Tilden","Mike and Andrew has talked forward schedules, in particular, but to your first question, I would say absolutely. If you look at just the way the West Coast makeup has gone over 5, 10, 15, 20 years, it's changing all of the time in terms of who's doing what flying. And I think net-net, Alaska's been a winner in all of those moves for a long, long time now. But absolutely, markets, new capacity comes in and someone told maybe that new capacity comes out again or somebody else comes out but, absolutely. I would not expect somebody makes announcement that it wouldn't be right, I don't think to say okay, that's the permanent structure of the market. People are moving all the time and the water will sort of find its level again at some point here. Andrew, do you want to talk? Is there any data that we see in forward schedule?","Andrew Harrison","Nothing significant. We've seen Virgin move out of Portland-LA and put that into San Francisco. We've seen some winter capacity reductions. But on the whole, we haven't seen any changes yet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The relationships between airlines, well, big airlines and their regional partners are pretty well disclosed in terms of breakage policies. There's typically a notification period limits on how many aircraft you can roll out per year. There might be some early out provisions related to work stoppages or operational metrics, but the details are out there. But this is not the case with codeshare relationships. Who really wears the pants in those agreements? Or put differently, if one of your partners simply decided to call it quits, how easily can they do so? Can they just walk away at a moment's notice? And the same applies to you, to Alaska, of course, unilaterally deciding, call it quits?","Bradley D. Tilden","Jamie it's Brad. This is as you say, it's a codeshare relationship, it's got marketing, it's got other features to it. The basic relationship is the long-term agreement. And I don't think we said publicly and probably not going to say now exactly what the duration is. But it is a long-term agreement that does contain certain contractual minimums. So that's the nature of the deal. As I said in the last question, I mean, our thinking now, I mean, our -- as you know, Jamie, our alliance structure has changed a lot over the 20-year history of this company. And if it needs to change, it will change. Our thinking now is to sort of keep the emotion out of this thing, deal with the facts that are in front of us, deal with what we see happening in the marketplace and make decisions at every juncture that are in the best, long-term interest of Alaska Air Group. So that's how we're thinking about it.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And would you be willing to quantify as a percentage of your total codeshare business, and whether you want to answer this in passengers or preferably revenue -- well, actually, preferably profitability, the component that AMR makes up?","Bradley D. Tilden","Yes. Do you mean Delta or AMR?","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","AMR.","Bradley D. Tilden","Okay. I don't -- here's what I'll tell you, Jamie, interline revenues in total are about 13% of our revenues. About 4% of that comes -- is enabled by Delta, either through codeshare or miles or interline agreements. American would be a little less than that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Engel with Bank of America.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The Seattle, if you get a new airport agreements, how much is that worth? And would that be another good guy for 2014?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Glenn, it's Brandon. Yes, it would be a good guy for us in the fourth quarter and into 2014. I'd say the 2013 impact could be in the neighborhood of $8 million, and that's probably a fair representation of the benefit that we see going into '14 as well.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So the higher cost guidance in the fourth quarter is Seattle now being included in the higher incentive pay?","Brandon S. Pedersen","The higher cost trends in the fourth quarter is incentive pay and it includes the existing rate structure. If we are able to get this thing pushed over the goal line in the fourth quarter, it would be a favorable -- it has a favorable impact to Q4 costs.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And Brad, not to beat a dead horse on this Delta issue, but it does seem like you're subsidizing a competitor by codesharing with them on these international flights, making him stronger in a market he's going against you. Why don't you want it to make it more painful for Delta to not dump on you?","Bradley D. Tilden","Glenn, it's Brad. Good question. I think what I'd say is that we're looking at this closely. We are studying it. There's all sort of things, actions that Alaska could take. It's just probably not in our interest to talk a lot on a quarterly conference call about what those actions might be. I think the best thing for us to do is to look at this and make whatever decisions we make and execute those decisions in the market.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","One quick clarification. I think I heard you say the new ancillary revenues were enough to offset the competitive capacity from Delta, but did you say that you thought it would be enough to offset the anticipated cost pressures as well, heading into next year?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Dan, it's Brandon. No, we did not say that directly. What we said was the impact of the new ancillary structure plus the new seats, plus the modified agreement, they would all work together to offset or certainly at least, mitigate some of the impact we're seeing from competitive capacity incursions, as well as cost pressures in other areas.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Got it, okay. And then I guess Brandon, while I have you here, for purposes of evaluating the return of capital, can you remind us, are you using a gross CapEx number? Or if it's a net CapEx number, what are the adjustments that you're making to that gross number, exactly? And I guess, related to that, does the corporate finance map suggest that it could make some sense to add a small amount of debt to the balance sheet for potential share buybacks?","Brandon S. Pedersen","There's 2 questions there so I'll try to take them one by one. One is just your question about gross CapEx versus net CapEx. All of our CapEx numbers are gross, we really don't have a lot of proceeds coming in from the sales of any assets, certainly nothing material and so it's all gross, to answer the question. On the corporate finance math question, we get the whole cost of capital question and how if we raise more debt, it would theoretically reduce our cost to capital. We're definitely mindful of that. We do that calculation. The history of the airline industry though, and I've said this in prior calls, is that there's been way too much debt. So we really like where we're at, kind of in this 40% to 50% range. Not saying that we would always be there necessarily, but maybe it's a long winded way of answering your question to say that we are looking at that, we may raise debt just to manage the capital structure. We wouldn't keep that cash just in the checking account and so you can do the math from there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve O'Hara with Sidoti & Company.","Stephen O'Hara - Sidoti & Company, LLC","I was curious, in terms of the $150 million or so from the change fees and credit card, I mean, it seems I guess around $5 a share in terms of -- or I'm sorry, $5 a passenger in terms of ancillary. I mean, am I close on that? And I mean, it seems like it does a pretty good job of kind of vaulting you guys higher and I think -- I don't know if you mentioned this yet, but maybe you could talk about if you've seen any customer reaction in terms of the change\/bag fees and maybe it's hard to determine given kind of what's going on competitively.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Steve, it's Brandon and I'll start -- or I'll start and then give it to Joe. Just in terms of how we measure ancillaries, the impact of the seats, that would come through passenger revenue, even the mileage plan or this affinity card deal, that gets split between passenger revenue and other revenue. We don't count that in our ancillary numbers, just the modifications to the bag fee policy and the change fee policy would get included in ancillary revenues. So that's just kind of how we think about it and how we do the math. Joe, you want to take part 2?","Joseph A. Sprague","On the bag fees, in terms of customer reactions, it's a good question, Steve. We're going from $20 to $25 for each of the first 3 bags. We've always felt we had a good value proposition, if there is such a thing when it comes to bag fees because of number one, our simplicity, relatively low rate structure. In both cases, we believe we're maintaining that with $25 for each of the first 3 bags. And then we still have the industry's only baggage service guarantee, which gives customers truly something of value in exchange for checking their bag with us.","Stephen O'Hara - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And then I guess maybe as a follow-up, I mean, you guys talked about being on the forefront of technology. I mean, can you just maybe give us a preview of what you see down the road that maybe would cut cost or drive for further ancillary revenue?","Benito Minicucci","Steve, it' Ben Minicucci. So we have -- I think in the last quarter, we announced Vice President of Innovation and Technology that has put a team together that's going to drive a lot of innovation into our operation and into our company. So at Investor Day, we're going to give you a preview of what that looks like. But we have definitely, a pretty set goal by 2017, of being the most hassle-free airline of the world and we're on track to be there.","Joseph A. Sprague","Steve, it's Joe, again. I might just add, Ben's exactly right. One area that's been particularly encouraging, we'll talk more about this Investor Day, is our efforts with our mobile apps. We think we have the industry's leading mobile apps. We just had our millionth download of the mobile app and importantly, how it affects sort of productivity and make our whole operation more efficient. We're now just under 10% of all check-ins happening via our mobile apps, so that's good. And if I can just correct one thing, I said to you Steve, on the bag fees, our first 3 are $25, $25 and $75, still a good value proposition and simple to understand for customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wilhelm [ph] with Petersound [ph] Business.","Unknown Analyst","One of the questions just went away so I just had 2. One is I've heard that this redesign might include shedding the Eskimo motif. I wondered if you could discuss that or say where that might be leading? And then one more after that.","Joseph A. Sprague","Steve, this is Joe. As Brandon mentioned earlier in the call, we're at a relatively early phase of taking a fresh look at our brand. Our particular goal is to make certain that our brand expression is more consistent across all different touch points. There may be some possible changes to the design. We're not ready to talk about that just yet. I would just say the Eskimo is a beloved part of our brand expression and something that customers and employees resonate and relate to very closely.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then secondly, I know that you touched on this before, but in terms of the Delta competition, there's sort of this discussion that this might lead to a merger acquisition at some point because things are different now. Can you sort of refresh where you're at in terms of that?","Bradley D. Tilden","Sure, Steve, this is Brad. I guess what I would tell you is that we are very happy with our strategy. We've proven over the years that us being independent has been a good ownership structure for our customers, for our communities, for our employees, and most importantly, for our owners. So we like our strategy a lot and our plan is to continue executing it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Banse with KUOW Public Radio.","Tom Banse","I had just one last question on the Delta competition. I'm wondering if do you think there's anything materially different from Delta attacking your West Coast core routes, compared to Alaska's earlier expansions to Delta's hubs, like Salt Lake, Atlanta and Minneapolis?","Andrew Harrison","This is Andrew. I don't think so.","Tom Banse","Is there any aspect of payback here?","Andrew Harrison","I'm not going to answer that question. What I will tell you though, is that part of the relationship we enjoy is that we connect into each other's hubs and connect our traffic beyond each other's hubs and that will continue to evolve over time and there will be adjustments made down the road. But as Brad has very well said, we are going to focus on our instrument panel and what we need to do we'll do and guide through this to make sure that things work for the best of Air Group's shareholders, customers and employees.","Tom Banse","And then just last 1 question in terms about the past history and the present. Were your expansions into what you might call Delta's core territory friendlier than what's just happened here on the West Coast?","Bradley D. Tilden","Tom, it's Brad. I don't know that it makes a lot of sense for us to talk about that. I mean, competition is the nature of the industry. It's been this way for 80 years and it will continue to be. People do go into each other's markets. Our deal is just to deal with the facts that we have in front of us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Farley with KING Television.","Glenn Farley","My question really goes to fleet planning. We were looking at the -- you guys never owned 757s before, but there has been some sort of increasing buzz within the industry about bringing something with those performance characteristics back. And with your route structure now, with your 737, 800s, and 900s, do you feel like in -- I know you're getting maxes going forward, do you feel like you're sort of pushing the envelope there? Could you see getting a larger airplane, a longer range airplane than what those the 9 max and the 900 offer?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Glenn, it's Brandon. We have worked really, really hard to get both the fleets in Alaska and Horizon down to a single fleet type within even the 737 family. As you well know, there's a number of different variations. The 900 ER is a big plane and that's a super, super plane for us right now. So we have no plans to move to a larger airplane at this time.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Brad Tilden.","Bradley D.

Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session for analyst and journalist. (Operator Instructions).","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Accounting, Chris Berry. Sir, you may begin.","Chris Berry","Thanks, May, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2014 earnings call. On the call today, you will hear from our CEO, Brad Tilden; and our CFO, Brandon Pedersen; as they share some highlights from the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Other members of our senior management team are also here to help answer your questions.","Our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on our Risk Factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings available on our website.","We will refer often to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings or unit costs excluding fuel. We have provided reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a first quarter GAAP net profit of $94 million. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio, we reported a record adjusted net profit of $89 million compared to $44 million last year. On a per share basis the result translates to a $1.28 per diluted share versus $0.62 in the first quarter of 2013, and compares favorably to the first call consensus estimate of a $1.24 per share.","Additional information about our unit cost expectations, capacity plans, capital expenditures, capital allocation, and other items can be found in our investor update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com.","And now I'll turn the call over to Brad.","Brad Tilden","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Today marks another milestone for Alaska. It wasn't that many years ago that we created an objective of simply not losing money in the first quarter. Our business like a lot of other airlines have been very seasonal and unfortunately we had become used to digging the whole in the first quarter; it would have to dig our way out of in the second and third quarters.","Today we posted a substantial profit for the first quarter; essentially double last year's number and the result that would be strong for any quarter. The majority of the improvement is due to strong demand across our system and the revenue enhancing initiatives such as the new credit card agreement and the increase in baggage and change fee that we put in place last year.","Our pretax margin for the quarter was 11.8%, up 550 basis points from last year, and a 12-month trailing return on invested capital was 14.8%, which is roughly twice our cost of capital. This strong first quarter sets us up nicely for another good year.","Our revenue performance was managed by good cost control. Our people once again did a great job running a safe and on time operation and they took excellent care of our customers. I want to take them for their above and beyond efforts to defend our franchise and produce these results.","We're mindful of the growing capacity in Seattle specifically from one large carrier. We believe our competitor's actions are creating a surplus of capacity in many of the markets we serve, which we will be dealing with until supply and demand come back into balance, which is something that we do believe will happen.","Alaska has many advantages which would help us in this battle. We have a safe and reliable operation where we focus on doing things right. We have a cost structure which is materially lower than the large airlines and which enables us to offer lower fares. We have an extremely lower customer base, which is nurtured with our award winning service. We have a diversified route network and we have a very strong balance sheet.","In fact S&P has commented recently that Alaska has the strongest financial profile of any U.S. airline. Given these strengths we expect to have strong financial performance in 2014 notwithstanding all of the new capacity. We are also taking several steps to ensure our success is sustained.","First we're reallocating capacity to new destinations out of Seattle such as Tampa, Detroit, New Orleans, Albuquerque, Baltimore, and Cancun. These moves strengthen our position in Seattle as the airline that serves the most destinations and offers customers the greatest utility.","Second, we are reallocating capacity to new markets outside of Seattle where additional capacity can bring new revenue into air group. In June, we will be starting new service from Salt Lake City to seven cities in the west. We are optimistic about this new service and believe it will allow us to tap into new revenue. We are funding this new service by exiting some underperforming markets not touching Seattle such as Portland, Atlanta and Los Angeles, San Jose and by increasing utilization.","Third, we are making our mileage point even stronger. Members can already redeem mileage for award travel to more than 700 global destinations and they can earn elite status faster on us than on any other frequent flyer program. We are now offering elite qualifying miles on all international partners meaning any trips our customers take on our international partners will count toward elite status on Alaska. Now we are offering double mileage in eight key competitive markets from Seattle.","And finally, we continue to work on other initiatives that will improve our product offering and enhance loyalty as we face a challenging competitive environment in the months ahead.","Switching gears a bit, I'm happy to report that Alaska's customer service agents, reservations agents, and accounting clerks, recently ratified a five-year contract and Horizon's dispatchers recently ratified a four-year contract. All of our workgroups with the exception of Alaska's flight attendants, who recently turned down a tentative agreement now have long-term agreements in place. I want to thank our flight attendants for being very professional and for continuing to provide great service to our customers as we proceed through the negotiating process.","Three of our four largest represented groups now have contracts that extend through 2018 or later. This is a level of clarity in our labor structure that we haven't seen in years. We are proud of what we've been able to achieve working together with our unions to move this company forward. We are also proud to share the success of both Alaska and Horizon with our employees through our incentive program, which is averaged 8% of pay or roughly an extra month's wages for the last five years.","We also know that to be successful long-term we must ensure that shareholders get returns that are appropriate for the risk they assume and they must get meaningful returns or distributions of capital. As you know we've been leaders in this area and we recently increased our dividend by 25% just six months after initiation. We remain one of a few airlines paying a dividend and our yield is the highest of all U.S. carriers.","Brandon will talk more with you in just a moment about our cash flow generation and our thoughts on future capital returns.","We recognize that to be successful over the long-term we have to do a lot of things right. We have to be safe and we have to offer low fares to our customers. Our leadership team and all of our employees have worked very hard to make this company successful. By keeping our cost low, by building a strong and flexible network, by producing operating numbers that lead the industry, by providing great customer service, and by being nimble in responding quickly to changes in the marketplace.","We believe that our customers appreciate these strengths and are staunchly loyal and we believe that our employees embrace this plan and are aligned around it. Finally, from what we hear from you when we speak with you on the road, we believe that our shareholders like our strategy and our execution; we appreciate your continued support.","In a nutshell, we are building a company built on trust that will be here for the long-term and we plan to keep delivering.","With that I'll now turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks, Brad, and good morning everybody. Air Group reported an adjusted net profit of $89 million compared to $44 million last year. Adjusted earnings per share more than doubled because of the growth in net income and a 3% reduction in diluted shares. Our trailing 12-month return on invested capitals grew to 14.8%, a 1.4 improvement over the 12-months ended Q1 of last year. Our ROIC figure is fully taxed and as Brad said, nearly double our weighted average cost to capital. We are creating substantial economic value for our owners and will continue to do so.","On an adjusted pretax basis we reported a $144 million profit, which was $73 million better than last year's result. On a capacity increase of 4.6% total revenue climbed by $89 million or 8% non-fuel operating expenses increased $35 million or 5% and economic fuel expense was about flat.","Our results also include $13 million in non-operating gain associated with the sale of an equity stake in an IFE provider and stock received in connection with America's bankruptcy.","Looking at revenues we were pleased with the 1.7% improvement in PRASM that came despite the 7% increase in competitive capacity in our markets. Total PRASM grew by 3.1% reflecting the new bag and changed fee structure that went into effect last year and higher mileage planned revenue driven by a boost and economics from the affinity card agreement modified last year and higher total spend on the card.","Generally speaking unit revenues are under pressure in markets where we see increased competitive capacity and the resulting in supply\/demand imbalance. However, the scheduled changes we've made in other areas of the network, along with improvement in newer markets, have helped to offset that weakness. We also benefitted from traffic that came to us from other airlines during storm related cancellation and favorable ratios to determine how a carrier is settled up for this kind of traffic. We estimate that the additional revenue favorably impacted the Air Group PRASM by about one point.","Looking forward we see strength in broad underlying demand and bookings for the spring are shaping up nicely. April should benefit from the Easter shift as well. Longer-term however we expect to see continued pressure on new revenues because of the increase in competitive capacity. On a weighted average basis we see competitive capacity up 8% in Q2, 7% in Q3, and 7% in Q4 of this year.","Turning to costs, CASM ex-fuel increased slightly on the 4.6% increase in capacity quite a bit better than our initial guidance at the start of the quarter that cost would rise by more than 5%. Several factors explain the more favorable result.","First and most importantly in terms of impact our people continued to do a great job managing costs. They know that maintaining and even widening our unit cost advantage is important as we compete with much larger network areas.","Second, we saw a shift of certain cost out of Q1 into later quarters. This is especially true with some of the larger IT projects we had in process and our brand initiative. In total we estimate that we had about $9 million shift to future quarters.","Third, our guidance assumed that the deal with the flight attendants would be ratified because we did have a tentative agreement in place at that time. Our full year cost guidance now excludes the impact of the future deal with Alaska's flight attendants, which is more consistent with our historical practice simply because we are unsure of the timing or amount. When and if we reach an agreement with our flight attendants we will adjust our guidance accordingly.","Looking to the second quarter we are expecting unit cost ex-fuel to be up about 1.5% on a 4.5% increase in ASMs. For the full year we are now expecting ex-fuel costs to be about flat, which is better than our initial guidance back in January. We have a long track record of very good cost management and have reduced cost 11 out of the last 12 whole fiscal years.","Moving to the balance sheet we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. We generated $249 million of operating cash flow in the first quarter compared to $212 million last year; a higher Q1 profit drove the increase. Capital spending was approximately $93 million resulting in a $156 million of free cash flow. We expect 2014 to be the fifth year in a row of strong free cash flow generation.","We currently expect full year CapEx to be between $530 million and $545 million. Even though our mainline fleet will only increase by 3 units this year, we are actually taking 10 very efficient 737, 900 ERs and retiring seven older and smaller aircrafts further improving our fleet's efficiency.","We repurchased 350,000 shares of our stock for $30 million during the quarter leaving just $50 million under our current $250 million authorization at quarter-end. We still expect to return roughly $350 million to our owners this year through our dividend and share repurchase programs.","We've been talking for a year now about our goal to be known as a high quality industrial company that has a balanced and shareholder friendly approach to capital allocation. We make value creating investments in our business and building on the practice we started in 2007, we returned capital to our owners in a thoughtful and discipline way all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our numbers support that. We ended the quarter with a 32% adjusted debt to cap ratio and a $400 million net cash position.","Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words, for that end we had included a chart in our investor update this morning that shows how our cash deployment has changed over the years. I want to point out two things about it. First, we have a long track record of making substantial but prudent investments in our business to fund growth, renew our fleet, add feature like seats with power that benefit our customers, help reduce costs and strengthen our systems. The second is that more and more of our cash flow is being used to ensure that our shareholders are getting an appropriate return.","I want to join Brad in congratulating all Air Group employees on a great first quarter and thanking them for what they do every day.","And with that, we are ready for your questions. As always, we have several members of the team here in the room to help us with the answers. Operator, would you please let folks know how they can ask a question?","Chris Berry","Go ahead, May.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions)","And our first question comes from the line of Hunter Keay.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Research","Hey Brandon, I am at slide -- and by the way, thank you everybody for reporting in a Friday night and I had a ridiculous Thursday yesterday, its great move. The slide where you talked about, Jamie's conference, you guys showed $385 million of potential cash available to shareholders now showing $350 million and something has changed on it. Your CapEx is about $55 million, lower than it was on that slide. Your debt, even from inflows are $140 million to $170 million of payments. So two part question, Brandon. Your leverage is already below 40%; you said you do not want to free handle on that before. So why are you paying them more debt if you are going to be building equity, presumably hurting into this year and paying down more debt? You are probably going to have a two handle on that leverage unless you add debt and deploy back that to equity holders. So should we expect that $170 million of debt payment to actually swing and be an inflow of debt as you raise it to keep your leverage up?","Brandon Pedersen","Yeah. Good morning, Hunter. The chart was really just meant to illustrate debt payment; it did not reflect any expected increases in debt. We will like very likely borrow this year probably I do not know on a neighborhood of $100 million to $200 million. And then the $350 million of the chart, that is meant to be an approximation. I do not think that you should interpret anything different between the $350 million on that chart, which we booked up from First Call consensus, and the $385 million on the chart that I had it at JPMorgan conference. I think our point is to say we are generating a considerable amount of free cash flow and we intend to use that in a way that benefits our owners and the cash distribution opportunity for us is significant. ","","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Research","Okay. Yeah, that is totally fair. I just want to make sure that I am thinking about this properly in the sense that if you are going to be raising debt then and you are operating cash was is going to be higher. I think it is probably fair to assume that $350 million is a baseline minimum of that you guys fee comfortable committing to right now. And to that, and this is my last question, can you help us understand the mix of what it's going to be between dividend and repos? Thanks a lot.","Brandon Pedersen","Sure. We have a dividend. As you know, we started late and in the middle of 2013, we increased it after just two quarters. And that dividend cash flow-wise is about $70 million. We recognized that high quality industrial companies like us have a very solid dividend and have a track record of increasing the dividend. We do not want to talk about specifics on that. What I can tell you is, just in terms of the proportional return, a much larger part of our cash distribution this year will come through share repurchase activity.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Research","Thank you very much.","Bradley Tilden","Thanks Hunter. And I think it's probably perfectly good. But the big point they were all going to make with this chart is that, pensions are fully funded, we've spent hundreds and hundreds of million dollars over the last several years getting them to that point but they are fully funded, and debt is largely paid down, the company is in a net cash position. So as we have good cash flow from operations, the two opportunities are really investing in the fleet and returning capital to shareholders. (inaudible).","Operator","","And your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth.","Savi Syth - Raymond James ","Couple of questions. Just you did good job of highlighting how you are going to approach the competitive situation. I was just wondering, you've had a history of competing fiercely and keeping your position in the Pacific Northwest, but we have not seen a competitor get to this level of market share from a seat perspective before. Are there -- is there a difference in competing against the position like that versus what you have seen historically?","Brandon Pedersen","And Savi, it's Brad. What do you mean by -- just say a little more about what you mean about seat perspective?","Savi Syth - Raymond James ","So it looks like maybe they will get to about the high teens percentage of seats by the end of this year out of Seattle. And in the past I think the bit largest competitor has maybe had 10% or 11% of seat share?","Brandon Pedersen","","Yes.","Savi Syth - Raymond James","","And that's just kind of larger presence in competing with other competitor with that much of a greater presence?","Brandon Pedersen","Got you. Well, maybe I will start. And one of the things that I needed to say at some point in the call is, Andrew Harrison is actually out with this today. He and his wife gave birth to a baby boy yesterday morning. So in his place we have got Ben Munson, our Director of Capacity Planning and Miko Schneider Director of Revenue Management. But I know I may be starting this question. We'll ask Bennett in this case he wants to jump on and say something additional.","But yeah, I think -- I mean the first thing to note is that we are or we do have favorable overlap of Delta. If you look at that overlap, I -- we sort of break it into three different categories. First, a lot of it, they are growing a lot internationally out of Seattle, so why white bodies do -- I know I think this summer may be roughly 10 different destinations. The second would be their airplanes that are really flying to their hubs, places they have always flown, places like Mini and Detroit and Atlanta and Salt Lake and so forth.","And the third is the, this new capacity that they are overlapping directly with us, which is really the share of their capacity that we are concerned with. I guess what I -- are we concerned about it? Yeah, well, I think there is going to be more capacity in these markets and these markets need. As we have said in our prepared remarks, we are going to be dealing with that. And we have got a multipoint plan that covers our own network where we are flying, the timing of our flight, it covers alliances, it covers our loyalty program, distribution, we -- the whole gamut, our involvement with community advertising and so forth. So yeah, this is a very important sort of strategic area that the company is focusing on. And I will say my -- this is how capitalism in America works. I believe that we are going to get through this and I believe that this competition is going to make Air Group a stronger company. And we are looking forward -- we're looking forward to the next little bit.","Ben, I might ask you to sort of jump in and just sort of comment a little bit on what you are seeing in terms of numbers in the marketplace.","Ben Munson","Yeah. For the first quarter, Delta was up about 12% in our market in Seattle on an ASM basis. Looking forward is whether it is a bit more concern from a competitive capacity side that will increase to close to 40% year-over-year by the fourth quarter. And strategically from a network side, we are kind of thinking to fund about this. It's really a two point strategy. One is on the market side, making sure that we have the best schedule and just against Delta but against all competitors and being the career choice market place Seattle-LA, Seattle-San Diego. But then also, expanding the whole strategy in Seattle in improving our customer proposition by adding 6 new non-stop designations that Brad mentioned in his opening remarks and just overall strengthening the hub here.","Savi Syth - Raymond James","","Got it. That is helpful. And just a secondary question. Wondering how the E190 flying in Alaska is doing?","Brad Tilden","Q400.","Savy Syth - Raymond James","Q400 I apologize.","Brad Tilden","That's the other airlines.","Glenn Johnson","Good morning, Savy. This is Glenn Johnson.","Savy Syth - Raymond James","Hey, Glenn.","Glenn Johnson","So I'm the President of Horizon. And we did take Horizon up to the state of Alaska and we're flying a number of round trips between Anchorage and Fairbanks and then also one round trip seasonally between Anchorage and Kodiak. The objective of those airplanes was best matched capacity with demand and so we're able to increase the daily round trip frequencies in Anchorage Fairbanks to almost shuttle like pattern up to nine round trips a day. And so we're very, very pleased I think with the initial introduction, a lot of work going on we have both for Alaska and Horizon setting up for that. And from both a customer perspective and then the community perspective I think it's been very successful.","And I could actually just tag on to one that speaks to the market economics and the introduction of the Q400 into the State of Alaska in March and both Kodiak and Anchorage Fairbanks has been really positive for the performance of both those markets.","Brad Tilden","Good. Thanks, Glenn.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Godyn.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Brad, I wanted to follow up on what is going on with Delta. And I know that the team has done a tremendous job sort of in the face of this threat already. But when we think about -- well, I guess there are two parts to this question. First, if you could just talk about what inning you think we are in, in Delta's expansion. And second, as we think about the very long-term implications of what's going on here, to what extent, when we think about Alaska five years from now, is this going to change what you look like? And I guess what I mean is, we've heard that you are expanding from Seattle to some other cities. You mentioned that in your prepared remarks. I wonder are we ever going to see Alaska with a new hub outside of Seattle. Is there a point where we would have to revisit the long-term ASM growth rate that the company is capable of doing? I'm just curious what the very long-term implications of this threat might be as you see it.","Brad Tilden","John, good question. In terms of what of inning we're in, I don't think a lot, I don't think we're in a great position to say that. We're not in the last half of the game we know that. Even if we look at 2014, in terms of I sort of broke the market into three categories early, in terms to this group of markets where Delta's flying overlaps with us, 18 -- there have been out 96 flights for 2013 and 2014 and they're flying 18 of those today. So there is more service to come in the next two, three, four quarters than we have today.","In terms of longer-term I think one of the things that served this company really well over the last 10 or 15 years is the industry has gone through all sorts of strides it's sort of keeping our head down and focusing on what we can control and doing that stuff well. And so as we're trying to emphasize that stuff in the script we do sort of have a basic belief that we operate well, we operate safely, if we operate on time, if we build the line and with our leadership team and our people and we all go out there and offer terrific service for the right fare, we think we're going to be okay. As you looked at what happened in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, this company came through that in great form. We've had a couple of big competitive onslaughts over the last 20 years and we've come through just fine and I'm very confident that we're going to come through this and as I said earlier come through this as a stronger company.","In terms of how it plays out and what we look like three four, five years now I don't think there is a lot of return and sort of speculating and I will just point to a couple of reasons that there are now 42% or 43% of the company are transcontinental Hawaii we wouldn't been able to get either of those three years in advance. So there's not a lot of return in guessing where we're going to be but we're quite confident about where we're going to be.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","In a world where the competitive threat continues to grow, can Seattle, as a main hub, sustain a 5% or so, like a mid-single digit ASM growth rate, are there enough accretive opportunities as you see it today?","Brad Tilden","Yes, again I don't think there is huge value and in trying to predict the future what I would say is that Alaska has grown at a rate that's considerably more rapid than the industry. We have grown may be two, two-and-a-half times the industry growth rate if we go back 10 or 12 years and that growth comes from underlying economic growth and from stimulating markets or stealing share in. We've done sum of all three and I'm confident about our prospects going forward.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joe DeNardi.","Joe DeNardi - Stifel Nicolaus","Brad, on the CASM gap between you and the low-cost guys, it would appear, based on the guidance you've given relative to what they're providing, that the gap is going to continue to narrow. So I'm just wondering how that influences your growth strategy. If you get to a point where your cost structures are closer to one another, does that change the way you think about competing with them? May be you're a little bit more aggressive. Or should we think about that more as just a continued driver of margin expansion?","Brandon Pedersen","Hey Joe, it's Brandon, maybe I will take that one.","Joe DeNardi - Stifel Nicolaus","Sure.","Brandon Pedersen","Our folks have done an awesome job over the last 10 years reducing cost, it's been through a lot of hard work and a lot of different things, productivity has certainly played a huge part, the fleet changes have played a huge part and that is an initiative that has been really important to us as everyone on the call knows.","It's done a lot to improve the advantage that we have over the network carriers and you're right, our costs are looking more like the low cost guide. In terms of what that means from a growth or competition standpoint or an opportunity standpoint, I think it does just continue to expand the number of places that we can fly too profitably and we might use Cancun as an example, we've filed an application of start flying to Cancun, it's a market we had been in before, we've seen some improvement in the revenue environment, but our costs are lower too and that makes Cancun a good opportunity now versus one that we had to access just a few years back, it's something that also strengthens our utility out of sale. Also lower cost do strategically remain really important to us and I think we've done a good job bringing those costs down.","Joe DeNardi - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And then, on the branding initiatives, Brandon, I know that's important to you. Can you just kind of update us on how that is going and may be how you are measuring the effectiveness, what type of metrics you are using?","Joe Sprague","Hey Joe, this is Joe Sprague from marketing. So maybe I will take that one.","Joe DeNardi - Stifel Nicolaus","Sure.","Joe Sprague","I would say the brand project is continuing at a major pace. We've got into this effort as a way to help attract even more customers and some of our growth markets. But as we get into this even further, I think obviously we have to take into account the current competitive situation. We do want the brand to be more compelling for new customers and new markets but we need to maintain the strong loyalty at core market customers as well.","So I would just say we are kicking a major pace and as we continue to work through that in the next several months, one of the ways well sort of major success of that is penetration in new markets, but also sort keeping a strong loyalty core here on our core markets in the northwest.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker.","Helane Becker - Cowen Securities LLC","Just two questions. One, with fuel prices being somewhat more stable, any thoughts to changing or modifying the hedge program?","Mark Eliasen","Hey Helane, this is Mark Eliasen.","Helane Becker - Cowen Securities LLC","Hi, Mark.","Mark Eliasen","We are looking at our hedging program and we did last year as you know made some substantial changes, we lowered the tenor and we're doing more out of the money hedging. We are going to take a strong look at it again this quarter and stay tuned. I don't have anything to announce right now, but we are always cognizant of what we want to do. We won't make major changes from the standpoint, we won't run away from our principles of treating hedging like insurance and it's something that we buy and hope we don't use because we hope fuel prices stay low and stay stable. So that's basically we don't have anything to report right now but we will be looking.","Brad Tilden","But Mark, may be to quantify it I think we have done this on other calls. We've gone from buying 3 years out by 18 months out and correct me if I am wrong and we have gone from buying half the money that's 20% out of the money?","Mark Eliasen","That's right.","Brad Tilden","So our premium expense has gone up from what to what?","Mark Eliasen","It's gone from about $60 million a year down to about $40 million; steps we have taken now and we are going forward that. We are looking at.","Brandon Pedersen","Hi, this is Brandon. One more clarification on the premium side Mark is right, through the P&L this year just because of the way we announced pretty obviously but in terms of the cash flow perspective if you look back at 2010 we were using $60 million, $70 million to buy option. This year we are going to spend about $10 million. So the amount spent on hedging has gone way, way, way down as to these changes we made in our approach.","Helane Becker - Cowen Securities LLC","That is awesome to know. Thank you. And then I just have one quick follow-up. I do know this, because I think you moved in Newark, because that day I flew home after seeing you guys a month or so ago, I went to a different terminal, right? I went to A instead of B. So can you just may be update us on the cost and where that flowed through the income statement, and if you have moved now all over the East Coast?","Ben Minicucci","Helen, its Ben Minicucci. We did 13 moves to make in the first quarter 12 out of the 13 are complete. We have one more which is Boston to be accomplished in several weeks. The moves have done extremely well. I have to thank our airport folks, our IT folks, our CRE folks, our corporate real estate folks for doing a phenomenal job. Yes, we did move in New York and our cost rather one-time cost. The total cost of the moves are just shy of $5 million. But we'll see our recurring cost actually be lower because of the vendors we have put deals in with. So we're really looking forward with try new facilities in our new vendors.","Chris Berry","And Helane this is Elaine on a line item basis, a lot of that is in the contracted service where we kind of double up on vendors during that move.","Helane Becker - Cowen Securities LLC","Okay. So when we think about that, that line item isn't going to stay right at that level because you had double costs in the first quarter that you don't have -- that 13% increase. Is that what you mean?","Chris Berry","Well there was some of that but there is also -- that's where we put our flying; some of the regional flying outsource flying on SkyWest so that is ramped up as well. So that will be more of a permanent increase but yes there's a little bit of a blip in there for some of this, this vendor move in different station.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfenningwerth.","Duane Pfenningwerth - Evercore Partners","Can you help us understand the potential impact of your code being removed from competitive overlapping flights? It feels like you have done a great job so far of managing through this OA capacity growth, which obviously is, as you have articulated, gets a little bit worse over the next couple of quarters. But correct me if I am wrong. Is the loss of code revenue new? And can you just help us think about, is that an incremental impact or how do we think about that?","Brad Tilden","Duane, I can take that one and we're seeing some slight impact with the Delta relationship. We have shown I think at the Investor Day about $200 million overall revenue exposure per year from Delta and I can say that our first quarter number was down about 5%. We're making a lot of that up with our other coach air relationships in particular with the new American in the first quarter revenues from that relationship were over 20% year-over-year.","Duane Pfenningwerth - Evercore Partners","That's helpful. Thank you. Just a housekeeping question. What was operating cash flow in the March quarter?","Brandon Pedersen","$212 million, I believe but let me check that. Just a second. $249 million.","Duane Pfenningwerth - Evercore Partners","Okay. Thank you.","Brandon Pedersen","$249 million, Duane.","Duane Pfenningwerth - Evercore Partners","Thanks, Brandon. And then, Brandon, just one more on the non-op line in Q2, obviously in the first quarter here you had some one-time or some found money. In the second quarter, how are you generating income on that line?","Mark Eliasen","Yes, Duane, this is Mark Eliasen. And I can tell you that we still have some of the stock we got through that other than the bankruptcy to come through to Q2. We will see a little bit more of that and then it should pretty much over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Engel. ","Glenn Engel - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","A couple questions. One, what was the Easter hit to you in March? And I assume a boost in April. And, two, you mentioned something about 40%, I thought, competitive capacity from Delta. In which markets are we seeing in some of the other markets, besides Delta, what's competitive capacity looking like?","Miko Snyder","This is Miko Snyder from Revenue Management. From Easter shift from March to April, March had a hit of about $7 million.","Brad Tilden","Yes. And then Glenn I can take the capacity question. So we mentioned that Delta is trending upward in our markets but we're actually seeing really good capacity discipline from other carriers in the West Coast in particular from United, from Virgin and from Southwest making pretty material reductions in our network.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And the Alaska market itself to 48 states?","Bradley Tilden","Alaskan market is actually just about flat year-over-year. we've got some additions coming from Delta but that's being offset by United has exited the Anchorage Seattle market and we're also a lot less capacity Anchorage San Francisco this year and Virgin that market and United has reduced as well.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And it seems like you've added a lot more destinations with not a lot of planes. So I assume that means fewer frequencies. So is there a change in strategy favoring breadth over depth?","Unidentified Company Representative","So some of those additions in the six markets may be is what you're referencing from our Seattle hub. That's really a combination of incremental units year-over-year and also reductions that we've had in our network in markets that were underperforming.","Brad Tilden","Glenn, I think we are up three units for the year. that's not a change but I think we're up three airplanes year-over-year.","Unidentified Company Representative","Yes, that's correct.","Brad Tilden","Yes.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And finally you're talking about returning $350 million in cash this year on that chart in the update, but you did only $50 million in the first quarter. Is this all going to be backend loaded or what held you up in the first quarter?","Brandon Pedersen","Hi Glenn, it's Brandon. No, the first quarter was low. What I can say though is that we feel really comfortable with the cash flow this year. we're going to have a really strong year. Sometimes if you look at in just three increments you get pinched into things like board meetings and how you restructure a share repurchase grid, when blackout periods are, etc, but we wouldn't have put that number out there in such a public way unless we're really comfortable with it. So what I can say is that we've been really good stewards of capital and we will keep our commitments.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Daniel McKenzie.","Daniel McKenzie - Buckingham Research","In general, we are spend on corporate travel that accelerated modestly heading towards quarter end and heading into the second year. and the GPTA is calling for a fixed percentage increase in spend for the second quarter. I'm wondering if you can comment whether Alaska is getting its fair share of that travel spend from business travelers just given some of the competitive dynamic that we're seeing.","Joe Sprague","And happy Friday, Dan. This is Joe again. Yes is the simple answer. We are getting our fair share. What's interesting with Seattle our route system is such that there's a number of places of in our route where we're not particularly well-suited for corporate travel but Seattle a definite exception to that. This is an area where we've always had strong utility accounts and it's unique because it's a -- for a relatively small city there is obviously a large base of corporate travel here. So we have had years of building up relationships there and have good agreements in place with all the top corporate accounts in town. And I would say they are performing for Alaska very similar to the GPTA numbers that referenced and our expectation is that we'll continue to address the year.","Daniel McKenzie - Buckingham Research","Very good. And then if I could go back to the earlier comment about strengthening Alaska's position in Seattle. I'm wondering if you can just help clarify what that means because it seems like you're obviously already strong in Seattle. So I'm just wondering where you -- what the right way to characterize it, where you might need to go to feel like you've got the strength that you need? Is it perhaps an enhanced code share with American that might help that? What are some leverage you control to make Alaska or to make Seattle where you'd like it to be?","Brandon Pedersen","Dan, its Brandon. Maybe I'll start with the first part, and then just in terms of future stuff Joe can chime in if I miss something. Our ads in Seattle are specifically designed to be pan Alaska, to be the carrier that operates in Seattle that goes to the most places that people who live in Seattle want to go to. And we've added cities to achieve that objective over the last few years, just out more in the recent quarter.","In terms of our interaction with other code share partners, our strategy for a long time has been to have lots of partners that through those partnerships we can take our customers to more than 770 global destination as for the mileage redemption and for travel to other places, and we've got a great suite of partners right now. But that might evolve over the years as it has in the past.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve O'Hara.","Steve O'Hara - Sidoti & Co","I guess I was just curious in terms of the competitive moves in Seattle and so forth, I mean, do you think this has just set the potential to kind of end capacity discipline as we know it? I mean, it seems like its benefited the industry quite a bit, but it almost seems like an arms race in some ways to where one carrier maybe thinks another one is getting a little too aggressive maybe they have to start kind of making their moves too. I mean, do you see it that way at all?","Brad Tilden","Steve, I mean, you guys are the analysts and I think it's probably a better question for guys to sort of opine on, but what I would say is it does -- I think one of the benefits of the last decade has been the consolidation and the control of capacity. And I do think that you see that nationally I think that's a real positive for the industry. And I think in Seattle, I think we there is going to be more capacity than we need, an extra little bit. But I do also believe that we have been around for a long time. Water sort of finds its level and so when you over bake it then it gets under baked. And so I think there might be some jostling around here in the next few quarters, but I guess I'm confident at the end of the day that the right level of capacity will exist and I'm also confident in the company's strengths particularly in the Seattle market.","Steve O'Hara - Sidoti & Co","Okay. And then this is a follow up I guess did you talk about what you are seeing from the other competitors in Seattle as well, I mean, there is an increase you're talking about. Was that primarily just one carrier with that net of subtractions from others or what kind of actions you are seeing from the other carriers in Seattle?","Brad Tilden","I'm going to ask Ben Munson to chat a little bit about that, but I think it is fair to say that we are seeing more from Delta and we are seeing less from others but then Ben maybe he can provide more detail.","Ben Minicucci","Yeah, Brad, that's exactly right. So just kind of looking forward maybe into the summer months, Delta capacity and Alaska market in Seattle be up 30%; we are actually seeing about an 8% reduction from other carriers in our markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker.","Jamie Baker - JPMorgan","I thought I heard my name whispered there. I'm not sure what that's about. I would eco Hunter's commentary, it is nice to see you monopolize the reporting data same way that you monopolize double digit pretax margins in the first quarter. On to the question, I do agree that you can certain take the stage with other high quality industrial transports and stand shoulder to shoulder with most, if not all, of those companies. The only obvious disconnect that emerges relates to your earnings multiple or lack thereof. I'm not suggesting you change course, but in the event that you don't eventually rerate, if you continue to trade at a significant discount these are the high quality transports is there a plan B -- or actually let me ask you in other way. There is your multiple have a bearing on how you address capital deployment going forward or is that merely an output that doesn't influence your behavior?","Brandon Pedersen","Jamie, its Brandon. That's a hard question, but I will give it a shot. We have always lagged on a multiple basis and what we are focused on is just trying to do things right. We are trying to do things right from an operational perspective, from a customer perspective and from a shareholder perspective, and we are optimistic as folks will notice and we will get the multiple that we deserve particularly given our performance and the balance sheet strength that we bring. And that's why we have been talking for 12 or more months about this notion of being a high quality industrial. We really want the market to understand that this company, it's solid balance sheet, it's great financial profile. If you look back on to 2009, we have generated $3.5 billion of operating cash flow and we have invested more than $2 billion into the business.","More than $1.3 billion of free cash flow, we have brought our debt down from an 81% debt to cap to a 32% debt to cap. Our pensions are fully funded when they didn't have to be at all and we have returned $440 million to shareholders. So as we go out on the road and we do these earnings calls and we talk to investors we are hopeful that our multiple will catch up with this company's actual performance.","Brad Tilden","Brandon, that's a great answer. One thing I might add is that at the moment we're buyers of the stock. So there is a silver lining for owners.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Crissey.","Kevin Crissey - Skyline Research","Hey guys, sorry to go back to Delta. Had three quick ones on this. Well the routes that they have now added competitive capacity were those more profitable than your system average and, therefore, we are kind of more attractive in that regard? That's the first part.","Brad Tilden","I don't think they are unique in any particular way, Kevin.","Kevin Crissey - Skyline Research","Okay. Would you expect those routes to remain profitable during this period for your guys?","Brad Tilden","Again, we'll ask Ben to say something, but we are not really in the business of giving future forecasts on route profitability, but I do think that some of these routes there's going to be more capacity than would be ideal.","Brandon Pedersen","And Kevin, it's Brandon. As you know we don't talk about specific market level profitability.","Kevin Crissey - Skyline Research","How about for them? Are they going to lose money on those routes?","Brandon Pedersen","You will have to ask them, Kevin. (Inaudible).","Kevin Crissey - Skyline Research","I know what I'm going to hear when I ask them, but okay. Thank you.","Brandon Pedersen","All right.","Brad Tilden","Thanks Kevin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Derchin.","Michael Derchin - CRT Capital Group","I just wanted to ask you about your Switzerland strategy, alliance strategy and whether or not, looking longer-term, like 5 to 10 years out, and again, given -- assuming Delta does not continue, let's say, to be a major presence right in your home market. How do you go about considering looking at some of the other global alliances? Very specifically, a One World, which is the American, British Airways, clearly some of your issues you are having with Delta relates to you not wanting to drop relationships with these kind of carriers. So what is -- longer-term, can you talk about that Switzerland strategy versus going into a One World?","Brad Tilden","And Mike, this is Brad. It's a great question. Our thinking about these global alliances is that they were best when there was one carrier from each geography or from each country. Means our issue is that we are a U.S. domestic airline and we think that given that it makes a lot of sense for us to really occupy this position of being neutral with respect to the global alliances. We have to stand for something. There is got to -- we have to have a brand, it has to matter that we are Alaska Air Group, we got to have a vibrant mileage plan, all of those -- the royalty programs, all of those are things that helps raise demand or preference for our service and they help create their earnings that we are producing. So I think, Mike, we do not believe it would be good for us to sort of be the number two domestic airline inside a global alliance because I think you begin to lose your brand, you reason for being, I think you begin to lose the earnings capacity. So that is how we think about global alliances.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg.","Mike Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","Hey, Brad, I want to go back to the point that you made earlier. You talk about the sort of the capacity increases and I apologize, this is a Delta question so I'm going to preempt it. But you indicated that the capacity that's going in is more than those markets need. But as you look out because I realize some of the positions are coming in the summer and so especially at this point, you can probably get a pretty early read on how the leisure bookings are starting to sort of build. I mean, are you seeing anything now? Is there really anything out there, I mean, pressure on fairs or at this point is it still too early?","","Brad Tilden","","Mike, I think it is probably early. We actually see a -- I think again, we are going to refrain from talking too much about the segment results too far in the future. But I would say it is pretty early. In the next little bit, business conditions actually look pretty good to us going into the spring and summer. ","Mike Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","This is -- okay.","Brad Tilden","How far of a long term situation of just how much natural demand is there in a market in the city bear between point A and point B how may airplanes fleet should be in that market, it is kind of a high level longer term concern.","Mike Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then, just if we go back to the last year, I mean there was -- initially, there was kind of a bit of a build up, I mean, there were some additions like Delta but also, others as well. And so even though that we have that data I mean -- and I am sure you booked through it carefully. I mean, were you able overall to maintain your revenue premium? I mean, did you -- degradation that maybe what would have happened and maybe it just did not happened because the numbers seem to bore out otherwise?","Brandon Pedersen","Yeah, I can take that question, Mike. And I think what has been really good, whether it was last year or this year there is one thing we have been I think right about is really the diversifying the network and getting strong results kind of across the board. And what we have seen, we have this in 2013 and are experiencing this in 2014 as well, is when we do have competitive pressures in one area, we have had improvements in other regions to offset those.","","Mike Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","","Okay, great. And then, just lastly, if I could just squeeze personal question which is kind of following upon Hawaiian. The 13 airport moves that you had, I realize for some of them you did have access to the Delta Club. Were you able to preserve club access for all those moves and presumably it's with American I think?","Joe Sprague","And Mike this is Joe. Our agreement with Delta for the Sky Club reciprocal access remains in place. Obviously, with some of those gate moves, the geography at the airport no longer works. And so to the greatest degree possible in each case, and it varies by airport a little bit, we have tried to find another partner, another club room partner with which we can still offer access for our Alaska Airlines board room member. So I think mostly all the airports still has some sort of club room access in place where it hadn't it before.","Mike Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. Good, very good. Thank you.","Brad Tilden","Kim, maybe we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. Your final question comes from the line of Tom Vance.","Tom Vance - KUOW Radio","","Hi, everyone. I wanted to just hit some of the themes we talked about over this hour but more from a consumer or frequent flyer perspective. I'm noticing on social media and other places like Flyer Talks online chat room that a lot of Alaska's frequent flyers are predicting the imminent demise of Alaska's partnership with Delta Airline. What can you say about that prediction?","Brad Tilden","","Hey. Good morning, Tom. This is Brad. Again, I would say that there is not a lot of value in trying to guess the future. What I would say -- and I appreciate the question. We have a really loyal base of customers in Seattle, we sort of natured and built that over many, many years. And we appreciate their loyalty. We are going to work really hard to make sure that our offerings are very, very compelling and that includes everything from the cities we fly, the times we fly, the partnerships we have and all of that. So I think that the Delta thing will sort of play itself other due course, and when it does play itself out, we will have more to say about that, but I do want to say we are very committed to the Seattle marketplace and ensuring that Alaska has just the very best offerings across the board for our Seattle based customers.","Tom Vance - KUOW Radio","Well, what do you -- what would you say is keeping that partnership together at this point?","Bradley Tilden","It limits to what we can talk. But we are in the midst of a long term agreement. We have a long term contract with Delta right now.","Tom Vance - KUOW Radio","Thank you.","Brad Tilden","Yeah. Okay. I think that's the end of the questions. We appreciate everybody dropping in and listening. And we look forward to talking with you three months from now.

My name is Krista and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group First Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for analysts. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Investor Relations, Lavanya Sareen.","Lavanya Sareen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Krista, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Alaska Air Group's first quarter 2017 earnings call. On the call today, our CEO, Brad Tilden, will provide an overview of the business; our Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Harrison, will provide color on the revenue environment; followed by Brandon Pedersen, our CFO, who will discuss our financial results and outlook for the rest of 2017. Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.","As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. We've provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","Moving to results. This morning Alaska Air Group reported a first quarter GAAP net profit of $99 million. Excluding merger-related costs and impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio, Air Group reported an adjusted net income of $130 million and earnings per share of $1.05, $0.04 better than the First Call consensus of $1.01 per diluted share.","As a result of the merger, our business this year is nearly one-third bigger than last year. Passengers are up 28%, revenues are keeping pace and up 30%, and we've announced 37 new markets since the deal closed, with a lot of this growth coming in the state of California. While we're excited about this growth to help investors make meaningful comparisons about the changes in our business, we have included certain unaudited supplementary data labeled Combined Comparative statistics on page 7 of our Investor Update.","Unless otherwise noted, the numbers discussed today will be on a Combined Comparative basis. In other words, comparing our Q1 results this year to the combined results of Alaska and Virgin America last year. We think this provides investors better insights into how the overall business was performing.","Additional information about cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging, capital expenditures, and other items can be found in our Investor Update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning, and available on our website at alaskaair.com.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brad.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks very much, Lavanya, and good morning, everybody. A few weeks ago we had the chance to speak with you at our Investor Day about our strategy for the combined company, including our integration plans, the brand decision, our updated synergy commitments, and our approach to capital allocation. For today, we want to focus on our first quarter results and provide a more near-term look at the business. We'll try to keep our comments brief, so that we have plenty of time for your questions.","Well, one quarter into 2017, and the business is looking good. The West Coast economy remains very strong, as you saw with the Crane Index that we showed you at Investor Day, and this strength is not only benefiting our existing routes, but it's also helping unlock the value of the merger, as shown by our many recent new route announcements.","Speaking of the merger, the integration continues to progress well. Last week, the flight attendants became the first labor group to receive a single carrier certification from the National Mediation Board. This is an important milestone and enables them to start moving forward with things like seniority list integration. Most of the other groups \u2013 other labor groups have also filed for certification and are currently going through the approval process.","Finally, from a financial perspective, we reported $202 million of adjusted pre-tax profit for the quarter, which is down from last year with the higher fuel prices we've experienced, but still very solid. This marks the eighth consecutive year of profitability in the first quarter and an 11.5% pre-tax margin, in what has traditionally been our weakest quarter shows the strength of our business model.","Moving on to the operation being safe and reliable is one of the core promises we have for our guests, and we have a history of delivering, as shown by our recent number one spot in the 2016 airline quality rankings. However, this business has a way of keeping you humble and a rough winter on the West Coast shows that we have room for improvement in our handling of irregular operations, particularly snow, de-icing, and ATC delays. And this is especially true in locations where real estate is already highly constrained.","We had five times more snow or freezing rain events in Seattle and Portland this year versus last. But even accounting for this, our performance is still disappointing. For the quarter, Alaska and Virgin Mainline on-time performance was 78% and 65%, respectively, and on the Regional side, Horizon came in at 71%, while SkyWest came in at 80%. We are committed to doing a better job of getting our guests to their destinations on time, regardless of the weather, and we're in the process of reviewing our operational procedures, including the winter ops program.","While we need to improve our processes, our people did a fantastic job taking care of our guests throughout the quarter. Although Alaska's Mainline customer satisfaction results were down in January, our employees quickly rebounded and exceeded our target in both February and March. I want to personally thank each of them for their hard work and for staying focused on our guests, despite weather and operational challenges.","I also want to thank our social care team. When the operation is under pressure, guests often post on social media, and they expect a quick response, and this team delivers. A recent study found the average response time was under 5 minutes on Alaska's social media channels versus over an hour for the industry. Given the text-savvy nature of many of our West Coast guests, this is an important and growing part of the customer experience and it's one we remain focused on.","As we look ahead to the rest of 2017, I'm mindful that success isn't only about having the right strategy or plan. It's about execution. For the past year, we've been focused on getting DOJ approval, arranging financing, setting up integration, and doing all the other things that go with acquiring a business. In fact, we've got so many new things going on right now, you might say that our business is under construction. But in the midst of this construction, it's time for us to refocus on the fundamentals of running a good airline. This includes taking care of our guests, running a tight operation, and having a frugal mindset with respect to costs and capital spending. In other words, it's time for us to execute the plans we've laid out and to make sure that we're doing the right things day in and day out to make this a great airline for our employees, our guests, and our owners.","That's it from me, and now I'd like to turn the call over to Andrew and then Brandon, who will share more detail with you on how we did in the first quarter.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. As Brad said, in the spirit of keeping things crisp, I'm going to briefly walk through our first quarter performance, share a few thoughts on our capacity and the revenue environment, and then close with a brief update on our commercial integration work.","So starting with the first quarter, our passenger revenue grew by $22 million, or about 2%. This outpaced the industry, which grew less than 1%. And as anticipated, our March leisure travel was impacted by the Easter, shifting into the second quarter of this year. In total, the Easter shift cost March revenue approximately 3 points of unit revenue growth, which will shift into April. But, overall, we were very pleased with our first quarter, our traditional softness shaped up. Our load factor of 81.3% was essentially flat year-over-year, despite a 4.9% increase in capacity, as we saw a solid demand across our network.","Importantly, we saw continued strength in our loyalty program during the quarter. In fact, during March we had the largest number of new members enrolling in both the state of California, as well as our overall Mileage Plan on record. Building loyalty is a critical part of our growth strategy in California, and while it's still early stages, initial results are encouraging.","Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect competitive capacity increases in our markets to be approximately 2 points. While this is a fraction of what we've seen over the last several years, it is an increase from the last call when the second quarter capacity changes were tracking closer to flat. Our capacity will be up about 6% in the second quarter, with roughly 3 points of this growth due to the new markets Brad mentioned, 2 points due to longer stage length, and the remaining a mix of core adds with some gauge adjustment. Although these forms of growth generally have a negative impact on PRASM, the new markets are already performing in line with our initial forecasts and we're confident that this growth will be profit accretive.","Overall, we feel good about what we're seeing system-wide for the second quarter. And even after removing the benefit from the Easter shift, we expect to have positive unit revenue in the second quarter due to maturing markets, stabilization of competitive capacity, and solid demand. We foresee the second quarter being the best quarter of the year with respect to year-over-year revenue performance, given our growth is weighted more heavily towards the third and fourth quarter.","Speaking of capacity, our guide for the full year is 8.5% and remains unchanged from previous guidance. With capacity in the first half of the year around 5.5%, this implies growth of approximately 11.5% for the second half of 2017. For comparison, our growth in the second half of 2016 was 8%, or 350 basis points, lower. This will make unit revenues comps more difficult; however, we're also confident this added capacity will contribute to Air Group's long-term track record of profitable growth.","Moving to our progress on the revenue commitments and integration. As Dan and Darryl pointed out at Investor Day, revenue synergies can be hard for investors to see and measure. So I wanted to highlight recent changes at Love Field as tangible examples of progress on the fleet deployment and network growth synergies.","First, as many of you know, Virgin's existing routes from Dallas Love Field to DCA and LaGuardia were losing money. The network team moved quickly to downgauge these routes to a 76-seat Embraer 175 regional jet, which was something Virgin couldn't do, because it didn't have the breadth of fleet options that we do at Alaska. What this allowed us to do was offer business travelers the same utility on DCA, and more in the case of LaGuardia, with a three cabin product, while improving the economics of these routes.","Secondly, we also announced that we're adding new routes from Love Field to four points of strength on the West Coast; Seattle, Portland, San Jose, San Diego, which are routes we believe will make the best use of the two gates we have at this highly constrained airport. This is incremental revenue growth that was unlocked by the merger, will increase our relevance and loyalty on the West Coast, and generate higher utilization of gates and airport space, thus reducing unit costs.","I'm very proud of the revenue management team. In April, we finished bringing three years of Virgin America's booking history into Sabre. This will help us better manage inventory as a single entity. We're also on track, thanks to our airports organization and real estate, to collocate operations at key airports, including Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, L.A, Newark, and JFK by the end of this year. This will allow us to operate more efficiently and also eliminate the potential source of confusion for our guests at airports, as they make connections across our expanded network.","So, in summary, we're really excited about the opportunities for the combined network and are moving forward on our revenue synergy commitments, consolidation of airport operations, and aggressive brand and loyalty marketing, now that the question about the Virgin brand has been answered.","We look forward to a solid second quarter, and with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey. Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everybody. Air Group's $130 million adjusted profit equates to a pre-tax profit of $202 million, which was $117 million, or 37%, lower than last year on a combined basis. Although operating revenues were up $39 million, they weren't sufficient to offset the $56 million increase in non-fuel costs and the $88 million increase in fuel prices. Non-operating costs also increased by $12 million due to the higher interest expense.","Overall, our first quarter pre-tax margin fell by 710 basis points to 11.5%. We expect that to be the largest decline of any quarter this year, given what we see currently in the revenue and fuel environment. Andrew talked about unit revenues, so I'll focus on unit costs. CASM ex-fuel was basically flat, which was consistent with our initial guidance. While the operational challenge, as Brad mentioned, did create some added costs during the quarter, we benefited from having lower than forecasted maintenance costs and certain marketing spend that has shifted into the latter part of the year.","For Q2, we're currently forecasting CASM ex-fuel to increase by 3% on the 6% increase in capacity. There are number of drivers for the increase, including the timing of maintenance events, some costs that shifted from Q1, and an assumed ratification bonus related to the tentative agreement that we reached with Horizon's pilots earlier this month that will improve our ability to recruit and retain pilots. Despite the 3% expected increase in unit costs in the second quarter, we're still on pace for flattish unit costs for the year, excluding the impact of an agreement with our Alaska and Virgin America pilots.","There is a lot going on at Air Group right now, and some of those activities drive costs that don't captured in the merger cost line on our external P&L. We're working hard to make sure those costs don't get embedded in our long-term cost structure, because we know how important low costs are to our long-term success. Although profits are down, we continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, approximately $470 million for the quarter, and ended Q1 with $1.7 billion of cash on hand. Reinforcing what I said at Investor Day, we remain committed to a thoughtful capital allocation strategy.","First, we're going to make smart investments to leverage our acquisition of Virgin America. Those include growing the fleet to support our West Coast expansion, retrofitting the cabins of the Virgin America aircraft to add premium class, and adding satellite connectivity to Alaska's aircraft. We're also making important investments into airport and other facilities in many of our locations. Given the elevated level of capital spending, we're working hard to make sure our controls over capital are robust and we're spending money as if it's our own. And, yes, that comment was directed to other group leaders.","We're currently projecting 2017 CapEx to be above $1.2 billion, consistent with prior guidance. Most to that, of course, is fleet related and we've added a bit more detail to the fleet section of our Investor Update to help investors understand all the moving parts.","We did have two notable fleet events since Investor Day. The first was Horizon taking delivery of our first E175. The second was Virgin America taking delivery of our first LEAP powered A321neo. In fact, we were the global launch customer of that aircraft type. Both airplanes will be great additions to the fleet. We're also equally committed to re-deleveraging our balance sheet, our debt-to-capital by 1 point since the year end of 58%, and we expect to end the year at about 55%, driven by profits and roughly $320 million in scheduled principal payments.","Overall, our first full post-acquisition quarter was solid. There is a ton going on right now, and I want to credit our frontline folks for taking great care of our guests. But I also want to give a shout out to all the back office folks, who are working so hard to put these two companies together. This is really hard work. But having said that, I hope everyone listening to the call today, or reading the transcript, can sense the optimism that we have here.","With that, we're ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning, Savi.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning, Savi.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Just \u2013 if I may ask a question on the Dallas strategy. You guys talk about being a West Coast airline, and I think in past discussions you focused on that being your strength and knowing not really wanting to grow anywhere outside of that, and I know the \u2013 so I was kind of curious about the thinking on the Dallas-New York and Dallas-DC flights as to how that fits in that overall strategy. I know it's very small, but in the grand scheme of things.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Savi. It's Andrew. I think those were two routes that, obviously, we inherited on the purchase of Virgin America. So as we look at those, as we look at our relevance in New York City specifically and the network we're going to have there, these are two routes that, I think, as they get incrementally better, we're just going to watch and see. But the greater strategy, as you point out, is really directing things to the left side of the country to the West, where we want to continue to build loyalty and the top destinations folks want to go. So that's where we are there. West Coast will be the focus.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right, helpful. Thank you. And then just on the kind of 2Q RASM color, wondering if you can give us a little bit more if you're seeing an improvement. It sounds like it's beyond just capacity that you are seeing an underlying improvement. Just any more color on that and how that \u2013 maybe that progresses through the quarter.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","I'll maybe start with a high level, and I'll kick it over to Shane. But I think in generally what we're really excited about is as we continue to put the two airlines together, single revenue management system and start to work all the levers and the loyalty, as well as going into the second quarter is a much stronger quarter from us traditionally with the Easter move. We feel very, very good about the demand environment. But Shane can give you a little color on the details there.","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. Yeah, Savi, I think the quarter, April will probably be the best month, just because Easter is sitting in it. But if you sort of look at Q1 and you adjust Easter out, we sequentially got better every single month. We would've been close to flat in March had we not had the Easter shift. So I think we kind of see that basic progression happening through April, and then \u2013 I think that (20:05) on the comments, we see that May and June being good and positive. Just want to continue to note the second half of the year will be challenged with the uptick in capacity.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Makes sense. All right. Thank you, Shane.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Savi.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thank you very much. Just one question for Andrew and one for Brandon. Andrew, you guys are pretty unique, in that you have actually increased the value of your currency for your loyalty program members. Other airlines have kind of gone the other way. You're still distance based, others are spend based. I'm wondering if you could just talk about whether you made those decisions based on kind of the value of just being different or if you made them in the context of actually trying to improve the value of the currency for your customers in the context of how the value that you get from that relationship and the credit card.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Joe. As we've shared on Investor Day, and as we've moved with our strategy, we very much want to be the low-cost airline and provide great value to our guests. And we have a huge percentage of our guests who are earning miles and using miles, and that's just as equally as important as how much you actually pay for that ticket. To your point being different in the industry, we all have different business models, but at the end of the day we believe that a generous loyalty program for our business on what we want to achieve will be a very, very good thing for us longer term for our investors.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, Brandon, you spoke about the focus that you have on the cost side and you guys have obviously done a really nice job in terms of CASM performance. But on the CapEx side, you're right, 2017 went up a tiny bit, 2018 went up a little bit more, 2019 went up more. It seems like that number kind of goes up every quarter. So can you just talk about why that is? And if we're sitting here, and we're modeling a 20% margin for you guys in 2019, should we just assume that you're going to \u2013 that CapEx for you will be $1.7 billion, $1.6 billion? I mean, that's a pretty big number.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hi, Joe. Yeah, it is a really big number. I would say is, at this point I would not read too much into the modest adjustments that occur in 2018 and 2019. I think what you're seeing is changing estimates on the timing and the amount of the various initiatives that we have going here, and those range from putting satellite on the airplanes to the transition of the interiors of the Airbus airplanes into the Alaska configuration. And so all of those business cases are in work right now.","So, as we get through the next three, four, five, six months and pin down the timing and the scope of those projects, I think you will have more confidence in the 2018 and 2019 numbers. I would say, substantially, all of those changes come in the non-aircraft lines. On the aircraft stuff, what I would say is that right now we're in the process of finishing the final transition of the \u2013 out of the 400s into the Boeing 737-900ERs, which is a great investment into a more fuel efficient, more reliable, more comfortable airplane. We're at the frontend of taking E175s into Horizon, which is going to be a great machine for us to reach thin Mid-Con markets. But we'll do the right thing with respect to aircraft deliveries, like we always have, and to the extent we don't feel like they wouldn't be profitable endeavors, we would change that order book.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. So how much of the fourth quarter capacity growth had to do with Southwest being flat in the quarter? Because one may conclude that you're using Southwest's fleet transition and their own flight capacity growth as an opportunity to kind of move in and take some share and be a little more aggressive.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Hunter. I had media training a long time ago and I'm pretty sure that's called [Technical Difficulty] (24:25), but the [Technical Difficulty] (24:28) is really what you're seeing here, which we're being very transparent about, is really unlocking the synergies and the potential of the acquisition is to build a more firmer network on which to build loyalty, efficiency, and revenue growth. And really that's what you're seeing going on here as it relates to our growth and, again, you're going to see these new markets slowdown, but that's the reason.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah, Hunter, I might just jump on it. We've really wanted to sort of activate the merger with Virgin with some of this stuff. I think we actually go through and look at the markets, no carrier is being targeted or anything like that. We're really trying to improve the utility for our customers. I think San Diego is an interesting example. I think we fly to \u2013 46 flights with 29 or 30 different airports out of San Diego. So we're not picking on a route. Same thing in the Bay Area. We're really trying to add new utility for our customers, and we believe that adding that utility is going to grow loyalty. And so, I mean, honestly, we don't think a lot about \u2013 we think about our customers and growing loyalty and doing good things that will help our business [Technical Difficulty] (25:32) competition might be. And I think a lot of these markets you might \u2013 Andrew, you were saying could pop in, but I think a lot of these markets are unserved today.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","On a non-stop basis.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's fair. I am disappointed by the way that you have given Andrew media training. I liked him better the old way, but the paid load factor in your premium cabin, what is that? And how many Delta Elites have historically gotten free upgrades on you guys? And as that partnership kind of dissolves away, does that free \u2013 have you done the analysis in terms of how many premium seats that frees up for you to now sell on your own?","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","The load factor in first class, Hunter?","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, paid load factor in premium. What, sorry?","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","In first class \u2013 in premium economy or just first class?","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","First class.","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Yeah, paid load factors are sort of 35% to 40%. They've ticked up a little bit as we've removed four seats out of the 800 to make room for premium economy, but they've held steady there for a number of years now. And I think the Delta Elite upgrade was a very small overall number.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","I mean, Hunter, at the end of the day, Alaska Elites got first preference than the Delta Elites, and so that's the way it works. So really what we are seeing now is, as Shane has pointed out , is we're adding premium class, but reducing the number of first class seats in the first class cabin. We are seeing a tick up in higher paid load factor there, but we're also being mindful of making sure that we \u2013 as again, the philosophy for us have generous upgrade policy.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Cool. Thanks a lot.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Hunter.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, operator. Hi, team. Just a couple of questions, first is on the Virgin network. As you get into that, how much more is available to do changes like you did in Dallas, with changing gauge and being more \u2013 I don't know what the right word is, but adjusting capacity that way I guess?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","So we've made two big changes at the Love Field, obviously, and then also where we \u2013 on our trunk routes, Seattle-San Francisco, Seattle-Los Angeles, where we have a lot of overlap we've sort of got better schedules. But with all the new markets, we're moving to the single operating certificate in the first quarter of next year. And so the cost bleeding is what you're referring to is, you're going to see much more of that starting in the spring of 2018. Right now we're sort of holding tight until we get all this integration done. So that's the last of it you'll see, but spring next year you're going to see some more in some of these high opportunity routes of the West Coast (28:23).","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then when you do that, will you talk more about the financial impact of those kind of changes? Like what do you think \u2013 like as you changed Dallas, like how should we think about the financial impact of that? Because obviously load factor has improved, presumably pricing can improve a little bit. So how should we think about that benefiting you guys?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","I think, Helane, you won't find us getting into the specifics that I think you're really asking about. What I hope that you will see is just a continual improvement and forward motion on the strength of both our margins, our unit revenue, and our loyalty program. And I think when you see all those things working together, we will get confidence that these moves are a good thing.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then did you say how much the ratification bonus was for the Horizon pilots?","David L. Campbell - Horizon Air Industries, Inc.","Hi, Helane. This is Dave Campbell. It is really about $9.6 million, but the real key for us, as you recall, last year we actually completed our (29:32). It was really about productivity and really driving that. So this agreement that we have really preserve that productivity, allow us to go out and be competitive, and really grow this network the right way. And so I really feel good that it's a great deal for our pilots and for our employees. It's a great deal for Air Group, and I feel really good about the opportunity and growth it creates for Horizon.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then this is a topic and actually, Brad, you may not have seen this, but just as your conference call started, your pilots put out a press release talking about your first quarter earnings and I'm kind of amazed that they would write this. But they talked about the fact that you guys are not being as forthcoming with them as they want you to be. I don't know if you saw what they wrote, but it's out there. So you might take a look at that.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Helane. Somebody just handed me a phone and we took a quick peek at it. I might talk about it a little bit and get \u2013 ask Ben if he wants to chime in, but I will just tell you from my own perspective. We've invested a tremendous amount of time and energy into the relationships with all of our labor groups at all of our companies over the last ten years, and it's something we're really proud of. It's something we care a lot about. It is in integral. Those great working relationships are integral to the culture that we've built here about us, everybody being committed to this airline and making this airline great, making it great for our customers.","Things are changing in the industry and I think we're \u2013 they're changing in Alaska with this merger and things are moving fast, and so expectations are changing. And I think people are a little bit more on edge, and I think that we're showing some \u2013 there are \u2013 we are showing signs of it. That's what's going on right now. But I'll just \u2013 I'll tell you, Helane, and I'll tell any of our pilots that happen to be listening that nothing has changed at Alaska. We value our employees. We are going to work with them. We have a model of working with our people to make this company great and do great things for our customers, and that's what we're going to do.","We also need to keep our \u2013 we survive, as an airline the size we are, by keeping our fares low. So the needle we've been able to thread the last couple of contracts with the pilots, that we will continue to try to thread, is how do we come up with a deal that honors them for the fantastic work that they do, while keeping this company strong and in a way that we can keep growing. that's what we're about and that's what I have to say about that press release. Ben, anything you want to add to that?","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","No, Brad you said all. What I'll say is just the very nature of negotiations are not easy. In your negotiation process, these things \u2013 just the process is not easy. And I know our pilots are listening, and what I'll say is we are committed to getting a deal. And we \u2013 philosophically for the last 10, 15 years we've used an approach that we're going to pay people well and fairly. We're going to provide them great benefits, both share in our profits and our PBP. We have high productivity, and historically that's what we've done. We've all got deals and we will continue to get deals going forward in the future.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thank you very much. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to put you on the spot with the question.","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","No, no, that's all right.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","It's just that, to your point, you've always had great labor relations and to see them do that right after start of the call is kind of surprising, that was all.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Helane.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Not to hammer you guys on the RASM commentary, what you said about the second quarter was pretty clear. But when I think about the sequential revenue production, how your revenue typically rises from the second quarter to the third quarter, and then contracts from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, assuming those trends are consistent on a pro forma basis with what we've seen in recent years, it seems to all but rule out anything but negative RASM in the back half. Is that too punitive of an interpretation of your earlier commentary?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Jamie, again, media training 102 kicking in now. As you know, we don't comment on the unit revenue performance and certainly whether it's negative or positive in the backend. But I think the thing that we are focused on is that by \u2013 in the back end of the year, a lot of the things that we're working on and the momentum and the strength of the company going from one level to the next level with the integration is what we are clearly focused on, and I'll let your models...","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Let me put it a different way, and we'll take RASM off the table altogether. Given the shifts in the network, would you expect the seasonality from one quarter to the next to differ slightly or materially from that in the past?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Jamie, it's Brandon. Maybe I'll take that one.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","The forecast for the next three quarters, I think the seasonality is going to look pretty similar to what it has looked like in the past. We are currently seeing Q2 rise, Q3 would be above Q2, and consistent with all of our prior recent years, Q4 is going to fall.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","And so that \u2013 I think your sense is right. You know our business very well and we don't see anything that would change that seasonal pattern.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's all right. I appreciate that. I should have asked it better the first time out. Second question, head count, obviously, a touching subject in the case of post-merger American. They purposely staffed up in order to ease some of the complexities of integration. The result is today they're kind of top-heavy from a head count perspective. How should we think about your staffing levels as you approach the periods of heavy lifting? Is there going to be any sort of similar cost build there?","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Jamie, it's Ben here. We've done a lot of work in the last two months building the transitional forward structure to take us through different milestones. So what you'll see in 2017 is we're carrying a certain level of staffing to get us through to single operating certificate, and then people fall off. We have people \u2013 we had people going away in the first quarter. We have people going away in June. We'll have people going away after single operating certificate. And as we reach everything (36:21), the next big milestone is our passenger [Technical Difficulty] (36:24) Sabre system, more people will drop off. So we have direct line of path on what our full-time equivalents are going to be from 2017, 2018, and through 2019.","And the goal is to have \u2013 when you add the Virgin head count \u2013 and I'm talking more management here, because we're going to be growing on the front line, but when you add the Virgin head count and the Alaska head count, the goal is going for us to be less than that \u2013 than 19 (36:53).","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That color is helpful. And if I can just sneak one in, simply the passenger \u2013 the consolidation of both airlines in the T7 at JFK, new lounge facility, BA facility, UA facility, what are you going to be using?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","The business case is pending with my CFO, but we have space already working with British Airways to create a lounge, and we're just working out the details. But either way we will have a facility there, whether it's our own or someone else's.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Looking forward to it. Thanks for letting me ask so many questions. Take care.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. And, Andrew, a question for you in terms of lower competitive capacity, it's clearly showing up in schedules and pricing. Can you just provide a little more color on the markets that it's showing up in and just some real data points if you can?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah, Rajeev. As you know, we use this weighted model, but I think the easiest way to describe what's going on is really the majority of that \u2013 big chunk of that capacity is really related to Basin and Bay Area satellite airports. So our Seattle hub, Portland hub, even San Francisco did some growth, but what you're seeing is increment in capacity from many carriers from the satellite airports around the LA Basin, and then, of course, the San Joses and the Oakland in the Bay Area to their hubs and other destinations. That's what you're seeing is really the movement. The rest of our four hubs are pretty stable.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then another one for you, Andrew. As you've added capacity fairly aggressively in some of the West Coast markets or traditional Virgin markets, what's been the reception to the Alaska brand? And maybe if you can share some quantitative data points on booking color or surveys, if you don't mind?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","I don't have the quantitative data per se on the brand and all that good stuff. What I will tell you is that what we're hearing anecdotally and seeing is that the increased utility, the increased options, as well as the loyalty growth that's coming along with all of this has been extremely positive. Again, with we're about 15% of all the traffic being booked on Virgin America metal is coming through alaskaair.com, and we continue to roll out benefits, such as free bags, companion fares on to the Virgin metal, so that's sort of what's going on there. I don't know, Shane, if have you any comment, but...","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","No. Most of the new markets are actually on Virgin metal. Some of the inter-Cal stuff we've done recently is actually super strong. Virgin has a long history in inter-Cal, but the E175 has been performing well for us.","And then the Dallas Love Field change, we actually had to move a lot of folks off of Virgin ticket onto Alaska metal. We actually called everybody personally, and most of the anecdotal sort of report backs from the res agents and team mates on the Virgin side have been super positive. People haven't had a problem with switching metal.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for the question. I guess, Brad or Andrew, you've done a good job articulating the opportunities you have in California. I certainly agree with that. But I guess I do see this as a little bit more risky growth than you've done in the past. You're growing in much more mature markets with a lot more competition in San Francisco and the LA Basin.","I guess, Andrew, can you maybe give us some color around what kind of response you've seen from others in those markets as you've kind of built out your schedules over the last few months? And is it fair to assume that the uptick in competitive capacity that you've mentioned in your prepared remarks is from new markets that you've recently put schedules on?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Andrew, I think Brad sort of hit the nail on the head a little earlier, but again on the acquisition of Virgin America, they were already in the largest O&D markets in California, certainly to the East Coast and other places, so there was no change in capacity there per se. What you've seen us doing is filling out some of the more secondary and third tier cities, in some cases with smaller aircraft, where we connect the cities that we serve from the Pacific Northwest. So we believe that, overall, this is actually utility growth and opens up opportunities for folks to get directly to where they want to go versus connecting historically.","Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just on the competitive capacity, have you seen it come on to those new routes that you put in or are they on all the Virgin America routes?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","We have not seen anything change really in what we're doing...","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Andrew, I think we're \u2013 we're not thinking of any \u2013 knock on wood, but I'm not thinking right now of any significant competitive reaction to any of our growth. Again, most of that growth, I'll \u2013 Virgin was in all of the largest cities. I think out of San Francisco is an example. They flew to all of the top 10 cities out of SFO already. And so the cities we've added are smaller cities with lower demand. They're cities that add utility for our customers, enable our customers to get to those places on a non-stop basis, but they weren't \u2013 they're not highly competitive cities in terms of other service.","Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hello?","Unknown Speaker","Hey, Mike.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Sounds like Mike is not there.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Van Kegel - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning. This is actually Van Kegel on for Brandon. Thank you for taking my question. You've announced a record number of new routes. Do you think that with a bigger Virgin footprint now in the West Coast, you can spool up revenue faster relative to route additions in the past, or it will take a little bit longer, just given the magnitude of the acquisition and integration?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. I think, Van, it sort of goes both ways. On the one hand, when we add capacity in the Pacific Northwest, where we are well-known and have a big loyalty program, that goes well with it. In California, we're certainly less well-known, but now we have the breadth and the depth in that and the loyalty from Virgin America and their network and their presence. So, as Brad mentioned earlier, these are tougher markets, but we are also bringing equally new tools to the table, whether it's aircraft, loyalty, international partners, connectivity. So, overall we feel like we've got a good formula to continue to do this well, and as we build network utility I think it will get easier.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Van Kegel - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then maybe just, do you have any initial expectations for revenue performance in these new markets relative to maybe the network?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","We don't normally comment on that, Van. What I will say is, what we track very carefully is what my teams forecast the new route should do and then what they actually do, and that's what we focus on to get to maturity.","Van Kegel - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for the time.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. My first question is on connectivity, so probably for Andrew or Shane. There is a lot you guys can do to increase connectivity and drive revenue, even before you have the single operating certificate. So, yeah, just simply making sure the planes of both airlines land and takeoff when you ideally want them to. I guess, that's what I'm really talking about here. So, I guess, just looking at the second quarter schedules, I'm wondering what adjustments have been made along these lines and how far along you are in this area, and then just, of course, what incremental revenue that's helping to drive.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah, Dan, just on the network, we've made very, very few changes, as you can appreciate, since closing. Certainly the first and the second quarter, the biggest change that we've made is trying to get some of those trunk routes a little bit more lined up. Shane and the team have done a fantastic job about rolling pricing across the whole new network connectivity across metal, across cities, and I think you're just about done with that. And so that's going to be one of the biggest ways that we're going to open up the routing of our network going forward. But really, honestly, you're going to see it more basically after single operating certificate is where you're going to see the really big changes going forward.","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Yeah. Dan, I may just add, the other thing we're really focused on is the customer experience on these connections. These are mostly codeshare connections right now and that experience is different. So, we want to be careful and make sure people have a really good experience with us when they sort of first do an Alaska to Virgin connection. We'll get all that worked out throughout this year, and then we'll really turn this on next year.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Understood. I guess the second question actually will be for Ben here. I know \u2013 I think the commentary earlier in the call was to take a look at the operations and maybe make some adjustments. So I'm just wondering at this point, is the mandate to be cost neutral with these operational fixes or is there some money that perhaps might need to be invested here that potentially could \u2013 that might not be factored into how we're thinking about cost for this year.","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Dan, thanks for the question. So a couple of things we're looking at. There is winter operation, so today a lot of cost is done. Internally we use our own people. We are looking at other options. We're getting an outside provider to provide de-icing operation in Seattle. So we're just looking at the business case now. Our hope is to make it as cost neutral as possible.","On the other operational issues with \u2013 in terms of block times, we have an enormous amount of analytical data that will be very, very laser like in where we add more block in specific markets and time of day, day of week. So it'll be very, very laser like. Our goal is to get the highest performance at least cost, and today we have the lowest block times in the industry and we will continue to be the lowest block time with the highest performance, which is what our goal is.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. That will do for me. Thanks, guys.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Catherine M. O'Brien - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, everyone. It's actually Catherine O'Brien filing for Mike. Can you hear me now?","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yes, ma'am. We can hear you.","Catherine M. O'Brien - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Sorry about that, technical difficulties. So since the close the Virgin merger, how have your corporate contracts faired? Have you seen uptick in your corporate signing up, given the addition of Virgin service and the new markets that the merger has made possible?","Joseph A. Sprague - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Catherine. Good morning. This is Joe. Thanks for the question. Yeah, the corporate activity has been very encouraging since the close of the merger. Our corporate sales team \u2013 and it's worth noting that we took the entire \u2013 was albeit a small one, but the entire Virgin America sales team and just brought them in with the Alaska team, brought them together. They've been working well together. From the time of deal close, we quickly reached out to over 300 corporate accounts that either Alaska or Virgin or both had agreements with and basically synced up those agreements to give the benefit of the agreement on one airline to the other, if it didn't already exist. And so that's been very positively received by corporate accounts. Also worth nothing that a lot of those accounts are in both Seattle and in the Bay Area where the tech activity is quite strong right now. And so over we're seeing an uptick in corporate revenue, and particularly so from the Bay Area.","Catherine M. O'Brien - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's great. Thanks. Maybe I could just ask one more. So, we've recently seen a strengthening in transcon fares. One of your main competitor increasing fares in their economy cabin and in their front cabin last week. If that continues, do you think that could provide upside to your revenue synergy target?","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Thanks, Catie. Yeah, we actually don't put \u2013 we didn't put fares into any of the revenue synergies, so I'm just \u2013 that's why I'm stumbling over that question. So, no, not on the synergy side. And just know a lot of times those fares are sort of on the higher end of structures and you don't always sell a lot of those. So, a lot of the airplane gets sold on discount. That's really where you need to focus.","Catherine M. O'Brien - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. If I could just sneak one more in then. While it's probably too early to count on, the fact that you generated free cash in the seasonally tough March quarter, given especially what fuel did, seems like that bodes well for the rest of the year. Do you have any updated thoughts on capital allocation this year given that or the focus going to remain on re-deleveraging?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Catie, it's Brandon. The focus is going to remain on re-deleveraging. I went through it a little bit in my remarks. We've got a lot of things we need to do on the fleet and non-aircraft side to just activate the merger and pursue our growth plans, and then beyond that we really do want to stay focused on re-deleveraging the balance sheet. We recently increased the dividend. That's a positive fact we announced at Investor Day. We're going to do a little bit of share buyback this year, but I would say in general our capital allocation plans remain unchanged.","Catherine M. O'Brien - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks for all that color.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Catie.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Catie.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Crissey with Citi. Your line is now open.","Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for the time. Couple big picture questions maybe for Andrew. Just general \u2013 maybe this in general. When you look at a flight, how far in advance do you know that you have a revenue problem or that it's likely to depart with a weak revenue performance?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","It varies. What I will tell you is that, as we built our image, Shane and his team have done a good great job. Essentially, if it's Hawaii, you booked at a certain period, if it's into California, it's a different period, but the team has built in mechanisms and reports that will tell us when aircraft booking stall, when we sell too many seats relative to last year, and it's a whole sophisticated program going on. And I think really what we do is focus on the bigger picture what's going on in the industry, what's going on with capacity, and then Shane and Kevin Ger, head of VP, translate that down to our fleet of analysts to do that. So we have very good and robust system as it relates to that.","Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, okay. I appreciate that. Thank you. The second question I guess is, when you have a problem with a flight, and this is in general for the industry, I guess, but speaking for your firm specifically, what leverage do you have to pull? Because it seems like what happens is there is a fare sale, like oh, the flight is not booking, and so the problem has to be on the price rather than maybe the quantity demanded. For instance, why is price necessarily the answer? Maybe it needs more online marketing dollars and stuff. Do you incorporate other types of marketing beyond just, hey, sending out an e-mail with lower fares. How does that work when a flight isn't working well? What other levers beyond price are there?","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Thanks, Kevin. This is Shane. We could go on and on this. I'll try to be brief. I will say just to append like, I mean, what Andrew said, we can watch our forecast pretty closely, and they tend to settle down about 45 days in advance. So we're pretty good at predicting the final flow in revenue well over a month out, notwithstanding the ever elusive closing yield situation the industry has dealt with.","But, yeah, Kevin Ger, who runs RM for us now, he came over Virgin America. He actually hosts a weekly coordination meeting with ecommerce and with marketing and they through any number of sort of potential opportunities, whether it's digital marketing, sort of search marketing, sort of email marketing. Sometimes we just say, no, we don't need a fare sale, we'll accept slightly lower load factors and sort of hold out for good closing yield. So there is a real mixture based on our relevance in the market or strength in the market sort of historically what's worked well.","Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Terrific. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","And we have time for one more question, which comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. On the fleet, I was just wondering, it looks like the retirements might be a little bit less than previously disclosed. Are they \u2013 the retirements of the 400s, is that getting pushed out or is that still expected to be done this year?","Mark G. Eliasen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Savi. This is Mark. We are definitely going to be retiring the 400s. So I think what you're seeing is just the last few coming out of the fleet, and by the end of the year we will be out of the classics completely.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. And if I may ask, just on the unit revenue front, I think you're getting close to being maybe one of the only airlines that will be providing monthly revenue data and maybe one of the few that don't provide a kind of quarterly outlook on expectations, so I appreciate the color. Any thoughts on switching the way you manage expectations?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hi, Savi. It's Brandon. Yes, I think we would ultimately want to join the rest of the industry in that regard. I think it's a mark of what good industrial companies do. I think what we need to do is get through this year and we need to get through a good year of comps and have a clear forecast due to windshield that these two companies put together. But as I sit here today, if I had to say what does our guidance look like in 2018, I think there is a strong bias toward more forward-looking guidance and less on the unit revenue side looking in backwards.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","All right. Thanks very much. So is the operator \u2013 thanks very much, Savi. Thanks for tuning in today. We look forward to talking you all at the end of the second quarter.

Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group\u2019s Managing Director of Investor Relations, Chris Berry. Please go ahead sir.","Chris Berry - Managing Director, Investor Relations","Thanks, Michelle. Good morning or afternoon for those of you on the other coast. Thank you for joining us for Alaska Air Group\u2019s fourth quarter 2012 earnings call.","Today, our CEO, Brad Tilden; and our CFO, Brandon Pedersen, will share their thoughts on our financial results, our operations, and our outlook for 2013. Several members of our senior management team are also here to help answer your questions.","As usual, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings available on our website. We will refer often to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings or unit costs, excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a fourth quarter GAAP net profit of $44 million. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio, Air Group reported a record adjusted net profit of $50 million or $0.70 per diluted share. This result is in line with the first call consensus and exceeds last year\u2019s adjusted net income of $37 million or $0.51 per diluted share. For the full year, Air Group reported a record adjusted net profit of $339 million compared to $287 million in 2011. Adjusted earnings per share grew by 21% from $3.92 per share in 2011 to $4.73 per share in 2012.","Additional information about our unit cost expectations, capacity plans, future fuel hedge positions, capital expenditures and other items can be found in our Investor Update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brad.","Brad Tilden - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. Chris mentioned our record fourth quarter results, which represented our 15th consecutive quarterly profit. Our pre-tax margin grew to 7.2% for the quarter, which compares to 5.5% in 2011. For this call, I\u2019d like to focus the majority of my comments on our full year 2012 results and on our plans for 2013.","For the full year, we produced our ninth consecutive profit on an adjusted basis and it too was a record result. Here is some additional color on this result. Against a backdrop, where the industry capacity was flat, we grew capacity by 6% and revenues by 8%. 2012 revenues were fueled by our growth into new markets. We added 15 new city pairs net of reductions, including 5 new cities during the year bringing our total new routes over the last five years to 24. This winter, we have 26 flights per day to Hawaii and roughly a 30% share of the West Coast Hawaii market. This region now represents 20% of our network and a second in size only to California.","To ensure that growth was profitable, we continued to focus on increasing productivity keeping overhead in check and lowering our unit cost ex-fuel. Our mainline CASM ex-fuel was down about 1.5% and our consolidated CASM ex-fuel was down about 1%. Productivity was up 3.5% representing our fourth consecutive year of improvement. As a result of the revenue growth and the good cost control, our pre-tax income for 2012 was $552 million compared to $463 million in 2011.","Our pre-tax margin was 11.9% for 2012, up one point from 2011. And as Chris said our adjusted net income for the year was $339 million, which is an 18% improvement over 2011. This record profit translates to $4.73 per share, an increase of 21%. Those of you that have followed us for a long know that we are big believers in understanding our cost of capital and in articulating our goals and our actual results. We earned an ROIC of 13% for 2012, which is a record for us and which reflects returns that are 500 basis points or 600 basis points higher than our cost of capital.","So, 2012 was a good year for Alaska Air Group. None of the success in 2012 or over the past several years would have been possible without the talented and dedicated people we have at Alaska and Horizon. They are the backbone of the company and the rest of the leadership team and I want to thank them for all that they do. I also want to take a moment to offer my sincere thanks to the leaders at Alaska and Horizon, who put in lots of long days and nights to produce these results. They are an extraordinary team of people with expertise in their areas, a focus on performance and a real desire to work together and see each other succeed.","I want to now highlight how our strong performance over the years has affected our financial position. Looking back to just four years ago to the end of 2008, we had a somewhat highly levered typical airline balance sheet, with the debt to cap ratio of 81%. We knew that was unacceptable and focused our attention on improving our profitability and our cash flows, so that we could improve the balance sheet. Specifically, over the last four years, we have generated $2.3 billion of operating cash flow. This has allowed us to make some positive changes and I want to mention a few of these.","First, we have invested $1.4 billion in modernizing and growing our fleet to make it one of the most fuel efficient fleets in the industry. And our success has allowed us to place a new order with Boeing that will allow for fleet replacement and growth over the next decade. Second, we\u2019ve reduced our long-term debt and operating leases by more than $1.1 billion bringing our debt-to-cap ratio down to 54%, a 27 point reduction. Third, we have repurchased over $200 million of our common stock and we are currently executing a $250 million buyback program.","And finally, although it\u2019s included in the operating cash flow numbers, we have demonstrated a real commitment to our people by contributing $535 million to our pension plans and by paying out over $325 million in incentive pay including $88 million for 2012. Every Air Group employee participates in the same incentive plan because we believe in having all of our employees regardless of their role aligned around a common set of goals. This is a powerful incentive and it could \u2013 and is consistent with our long-held belief that when the company does well, our employees should do well.","So, taking all of this into account, our balance sheet is in much better shape today than it was at the end of 2008. As we close the books on another good year, we began 2013 with engaged employees that are working together better than ever before. Excuse me, it\u2019s no secret though that this is a tough business. We are in an environment of high fuel prices, slow economic growth and increasing competition. We are not resting on our past success but working on initiatives that will sustain this performance in the future.","In that vein many of you heard us discuss the company\u2019s five focus areas. Our five-year strategic plan, we are entering the second year of the plan and I want to briefly highlight some of the things we will be focusing on in 2013. First, our highest priority is safety and compliance. It will always be our top goal. In 2013, we are implementing a new safety management system that will help us better track and analyze safety risk factors and take appropriate action.","Our second focus area is our people. We are wrapping a series of workshops with all of our employees, which we are using to communicate our strategic direction, so our people support it. On the labor front, we\u2019ve recently signed a six year extension with our Horizon pilots and our teams continue to work for equitable long-term agreements with flight attendants at both Alaska and Horizon and with pilots at Alaska. We have some momentum getting labor deals done by amendable dates and keeping our people focused on taking care of customers and beating the competition. And we are anxious to see this continue. Of course our new deals need to meet the needs of our employees, our customers, and our owners. Third, our goal is to be the easiest airline to fly and we are working hard to take the hassle out of flying. This includes everything from self-bag tagging, to further leveraging mobile technology to reducing stress in airport security lines. We are striving for our customers to have a seamless transition from the airport curb to their seat on the plane.","And fourth because we want to grow outside of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest, we are taking a look at our brand and how it resonates with potential new customers. Our simple objective is to ensure that people understand our network, our low fares, our award winning customer service and the high quality of our in-flight experience. We are also taking steps to enhance the customer experience. For example, we have added Starbucks coffee and Northwest wines on all of our flights and we introduced the Boeing Sky Interior on all of our aircrafts delivered in 2012. We are also considering other changes to the interiors of our aircraft such as seats, cabin layout, seat power, and enhanced in-flight entertainment.","And fifth our goal is to use our various initiatives to lower our unit cost, so we can keep offering low fares to our customers and keep growing. We have done a lot to make flying affordable with one way fares, reasonably priced first-class tickets and an award winning mileage plan. But we want to become known for low fares and great value. These five focus areas, well executed will be our path to continued success in the years ahead. They will prepare us for the inevitable challenges that come in this industry and they will bring all of us together as we execute the related initiatives. I am optimistic about the future of this company and what we will be able to achieve if we continue working together.","In closing, I want to again thank all of our employees for a record year. As I look back, I am simply humble by the passion, determination, and hard work of the people who make up Alaska and Horizon. It\u2019s been an incredible year and I look forward to working with this great team to raise the bar in 2013.","With that I will turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks Brad and hi everybody. We are very pleased to report that Air Group\u2019s fourth quarter adjusted earnings grew by 35% to $50 million. The fourth quarter profit brings our full year results to the numbers that Brad mentioned. 11.9% pre-tax margin, $339 million of net profit and 13% after tax ROIC. I want to join Brad in congratulating all of the Alaska and Horizon employees for another outstanding year.","Our financial results reflect their efforts along with the structural changes we have made over the last decade such as moving to a single fleet of efficient airplanes of both companies, better matching capacity with demand, reducing our costs, and more efficiently using the capital in our business. Our fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax profit improved by $24 million, a 42% increase. The $88 million or 8% increase in revenues more than off set the $33 million or 10% increase in economic fuel costs and the $42 million or the 7% increase in non-fuel operating expenses. Non-operating expenses were also a $11 million lower this year. About half of the decline is due to lower interest expense. The other half reflects the fact that last year\u2019s results include a $6 million impairment on an MB-80 that we had leased to another operator.","Fourth quarter passenger revenue grew by 9% on a nearly 8% increase in capacity and a 1% increase in consolidated PRASM. Our main line PRASM increased 1.1% compares favorably with the A4A domestic PRASM gain of 1.6% particularly given our 5% increase in stage length. We were very pleased with the unit revenue performance in our core markets. New developmental markets such as Seattle, Filly and San Diego, Orlando brought down aggregate trans-con PRASM a bit, but they are meeting our expectations.","Hawaii PRASM was down in the fourth quarter, pressured by seasonality of travel and the 35% year-over-year increase in our capacity. We have already adjusted our schedule in certain markets to better match capacity and demand and are considering whether additional adjustments should be made. We know that having the right capacity is the best thing we can do to improve unit revenue performance going forward. Bigger picture, I want to quickly remind folks how that market has evolved. In 2008, two carriers that served the West coast of Hawaii ceased operations, with their exit daily seats off the West coast went from 13,700 seats to a low of 11,400 seats. We have been adding capacity every year to take advantage of that unique market opportunity. Today, with our new service and the service added by others, capacity between the West Coast and Hawaii is back to more than 14,000 seats a day, a 3% increase over the 2007 high.","As a result, the double-digit year-over-year capacity growth to Hawaii that we have seen since 2008 will subside considerably. And in fact we don\u2019t anticipate any year-over-year growth in the second half of 2013. In our Investor Update today, we noted advanced book load factors are flat for January and March and up 0.5 point for February on capacity increases of 7% to 8% in each of those of months. Broadly speaking, both business and leisure demand remains stable, although we are mindful that the expiration of the Social Security tax holiday may impact disposable income and concerns about the federal borrowing limits do create an overhang that may impact consumer confidence.","For the quarter, consolidated CASM ex-fuel was down over 1% to $8.72 on the 8% increase in capacity. Three areas drove the flattish unit cost performance. First, maintenance cost increased by 15% largely because of unscheduled engine removals at Horizon. Second, food and beverage costs increased by 24% because of the growth of buy-onboard sales and the investments that we have made to improve the in-flight experience. The response from our customers has been good, but we are working to reduce shrinkage and waste in order to improve margins on these sales, as we seek to get a better handle on what is becoming a very significant retail food and beverage operation. And finally, variable incentive pay was $8 million higher than in the fourth quarter of 2011.","And speaking of incentive pay, we are proud to report that Air Group employees have earned $88 million through our Performance Based Pay or PBP plan and the Operational Performance Rewards or OPR program, a $16 million increase over last year. Under the PBP program, the vast majority of our employees have a target bonus equal to 5% of pay. Similar to 2011, we exceeded many of the goals set by our board, including the profitability goal which represents 70% of the PBP waiting. As a result, most of our employees will receive a PBP bonus equal to 8.1% of earnings, which is nearly the equivalent of an extra month\u2019s pay. In fact, over the past four years, PBP has averaged over 8% of pay for most employees, and as Brad said, totals over $325 million.","I mentioned earlier, that economic fuel costs were up $33 million or 10% in the fourth quarter on a 6% increase in consumption and the 3% increase in the economic price per gallon. For the year, economic fuel costs were up 12%. The net cost of our fuel hedging program was $24 million for the year or approximately $0.06 per gallon. Those numbers, however, don\u2019t reflect the fact that in 2012, we spent $40 million in cash to buy options that will settle in future years. This is $27 million less than what we spent in 2010, even though our consumption is up by 12%. That decline reflects our move to buy options that are up to 20% out of the money as we elect to take on more risk in exchange for lower premiums that will be expensed in the future.","For the full year, Air Group\u2019s consolidated CASM ex-fuel declined by nearly 1%. Mainline CASM ex-fuel declined by 0.5 point. We have been able now to reduce mainline unit costs 10 out of the last 11 years and much of that improvement has come from productivity gains and keeping a tight lid on overhead. Our play book for 2013 will have more of the same. For example, the self-bag tagging that Brad mentioned reduces the time it takes our customers to drop a bag by about 40%. Another example is shifting a higher percentage of sales directly to alaskaair.com, which improved by the way by 3.5 points from 2011 to 54% of total bookings in 2012. Our goal is to push this to 60% in 2013 saving us distribution costs and getting us close to our customers.","As we look at 2013, we are planning Air Group capacity to increase 7% to 8%. Although with our fleet, we have a great deal of flexibility to adjust that if needed. We expect consolidated non-fuel unit cost to again decline by about 1% and we expect mainline ex-fuel to decline, CASM ex-fuel to decline by about 0.5%.","Let me walk you through some of the larger cost increases. First, we expect consolidated wages and benefits to increase by about 6% to 7% on a 3% to 4% increase in FTEs. Like many companies we\u2019re seeing inflation in employee medical expenses which are going up by 10%. Pension expense will actually be flat year-over-year. Although the P&L impact was less than we initially anticipated, it doesn\u2019t reduce our conviction to keep working out of legacy style benefits such as DB plans. In that vein, we will be freezing the management plan on January 1, 2014, leaving less than a third of our employees actively accruing service credit.","Second, we will again increase our spending on technology. We have budgeted a $20 million increase this year as we continue to strengthen our IT infrastructure to improve speed and reliability replace several legacy systems and invest in new technologies such as mobile that will both improve productivity and our ability to serve customers.","Maintenance expense will grow by 10% much of that relating to lease return costs for 737 aircraft that we intend to return over the next 15 months and an increase in the number of schedule airframe and engine events at Alaska offset by lower maintenance costs at Horizon on a tough 2012 comp. Our guidance reflects those and other volume driven increases offset by lower variable pay. This of course fluctuates through the year depending on how we are tracking vis-\u00e0-vis our goals. Our unit cost guidance does not however include any costs associated with new labor contracts.","During the year we\u2019ll take delivery of nine Boeing 737 900ERs brining our total to 13. With 181 seats these larger airplanes are our powerful tool to help us continue to drive unit costs down in 2013 and beyond. They also allow us to sell more seats and grow revenue without increasing the number of departures. For example, we\u2019ve been using the 900ER between Seattle and New York where we own the have two slots. By doing so we\u2019re able to sell up to 24 more seats each way in a high density market with very little incremental cost.","Moving to our balance sheet we ended the year with more than $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. Brad covered some of the longer term improvements in our balance sheet and cash flows, but I would like to highlight some of this year\u2019s accomplishments. In 2012 we generated $750 million of operating cash flow compared to $696 million in 2011. And it\u2019s notable that the 2012 figure is net of more than $80 million paid in federal and state income taxes. We expect to pay more than that in cash taxes in 2013 perhaps at a 30% cash effective rate. This is only a very high level estimate at this point but it isn\u2019t important consideration when forecasting operating and free cash flow.","In December we again made a supplemental contribution of $75 million to our pension plans. This is on top of the $35 million that we had contributed earlier in the year and despite the fact that we had no required contribution. This marks our fourth consecutive year of making substantial year end contributions to our DB plans and leaves our DB plans 82% funded on a PBO basis at year end. We plan to make cash contributions of approximately $38 million in 2013 although again we have no requirement to do so. Capital spending in 2012 was $520 million as we took delivery of three Boeing 737 800s, four 737 900ERs and two replacement Q400a resulting in roughly $230 million of free cash flow.","The strong free cash flow allowed us to pay off $275 million of long-term debt. We also repurchased approximately 1.7 million of shares of common stock for $60 million. As Brad said our debt to cap ratio now stands \u2013 pardon me at 54% and when adjusting for leases net debt stands at $590 million roughly 60% of just 2012\u2019s EBITDAR of $950 million. Capital spending for 2013 and 2014 is expected to be $460 million and $365 million respectively. We have options that if exercised would increase those amounts, but we would only do so if we felt confident we could meet our return objectives.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Brad to kickoff the Q&A.","Brad Tilden - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Brandon. And at this time, we are ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Godyn from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Brandon, you gave a lot of great detail on demand trends and touched on Hawaii, but I was hoping you or Andrew could elaborate further on what happened with the advanced book factor in January just because it went from up 3 to flat. And also in contrast to some of the risks in Hawaii to what extent are capacity cuts at Virgin America an opportunity?","Brandon Pedersen","Hi, John, good morning, I think I\u2019ll turn that one over to Andrew.","Andrew Harrison","Thank you, Brandon. So, John, it\u2019s a couple of things. Yeah, I think in the mid-December guidance, we had January up three points or so at that snapshot in time. There is a few things moving around, but the big picture, number one is the first half of January we had very strong load factor build, Christmas moving out into the Tuesday, we had a strong demand coming in, in January. And the other thing is we still had grown Hawaii 34% in January and those booking start a lot further out. So, overall we expected to see some decline in the advanced book load factor and we are feeling pretty good about where it stands today. As far as Virgin goes, they have launched some new markets mainly Portland to the Bay and Southern California, but overall outside of that, they have just been humming along with a standard capacity with some good winter trims. And then as I understand it, they have slowed their growth in the future. So, it will be interesting to see what they do going forward.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. And just changing topics and maybe back to Brandon, you have emerged as a leader in the industry in terms of returning capital to shareholders and recently up the volume there, I think that\u2019s always major stock a bit more investable than some of your less fortunate competitors. But now as other legacy airlines kind of closed in on distributing cash to shareholders, how important is it to maintain leadership in the amount of cash you are returning relative to the peer group?","Brandon Pedersen","Well, John maybe I\u2019ll start and then Brad can cleanup my mess. I don\u2019t view this as a race, I think your point about us being a leader in that regard is true with something we are proud of, it goes all the back to the 2010 plan on how we wanted to make sure that things were good for all three important constituents, customers, shareholders and investors. And for us what it really comes down to is a balanced approach to deploying capital. And if that makes us the \u201cleader to the pack\u201d that\u2019s great, but I am not necessarily concerned with watching and keeping up with the Jones as if you will. We have a really good track record. And I think it makes a good case for investors to like Air Group stock.","Brad Tilden","Brandon, there is no mess to clean up. I think that\u2019s an excellent answer. John, our basic focus has been to run a good business and then do the right thing in terms of capital allocation. We are proud of what we have done for investors. The important recent change was we went from $50 million share repurchases to a $250 million share repurchase. So, and that\u2019s something we are working on now. So, but it\u2019s a good question of something we look at all the time.","John Godyn - Morgan Stanley","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Helane Becker from Dahlman Rose. Your line is open.","Helane Becker - Dahlman Rose","Thank you so much. Hi everybody.","Brad Tilden","Hi Helane.","Helane Becker - Dahlman Rose","This is my question. You guys did a really great job last year and it looks like this year it could be more of the same. And then I forwarded this to Chris earlier today, there is this e-mail going around from some of your contractors at Seattle-Tacoma Airport about how you guys are doing well and they are not. And can you just like address that issue I mean they are contracted employee? So, on the one hand, you really don\u2019t have control over them. So, how do you make them understand that and how do you keep them from not delivering a great product to your customers?","Brad Tilden","Hey, Helane, it\u2019s a good question, and we want to do the right thing at Sea-Tac and be a good corporate citizen. Keith Loveless is our General Counsel and he is in the room, he doesn\u2019t always get a lot of questions, but this might be a good opportunity for Keith to speak, because this group is called Working Washington and Keith is leading our internal effort to address these issues.","Keith Loveless","Yeah, I guess Helane I might start by saying that, that we are just super proud of what we have been able to do for our employees through this bonus program. It\u2019s been consistently paying out and we feel like the 13,000 employees are \u2013 it\u2019s important that we all be aligned around this. In terms of the working Washington group that issued this press release that to be blunt about it that is a group that is largely organized by SEIU and so we see that as a larger effort by SEIU to organize the contract workers have at the Port of Seattle, not just the ones that work on Alaska airplanes, but also the ones that support the other carriers that Sea-Tac. And as you say we really don\u2019t have a lot of control over that. We do have a lot of control over who we contract with out there and we try to pick good quality vendors that treat their employees right and that have good labor standards as well as safety standards and that have good customer service. And it is unfortunate that they have focused on this but our first obligation is to our own employees.","Helane Becker - Dahlman Rose","Yeah.","Brad Tilden","And Helane you won\u2019t be surprised of this , but we I mean we do understand what our economy needs more than anything right thing now was more jobs and more good jobs. Our philosophy is the best way to do that, the best way to provide more jobs its run a successful business. And so that\u2019s what the 2010 plan was all about, that\u2019s what these five focus areas are all out. That\u2019s why we try to do when we go to work everyday. And we believe that us running this business successfully is the best more good way to provide more good sustainable long-term jobs. So, there is \u2013 there is issues we are working with but I think run good path here.","Helane Becker - Dahlman Rose","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks, Helane.","","Operator","","Your next question comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Trahan. Your line is open.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan","","Thanks. Good morning everybody.","Brad Tilden","Hi Hunrer.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan","Hey, so the Saber agreement you guys singed last summer I believe was full content agreement. So, I\u2019m curious to know how you think you\u2019re going to able to drive traffic to your website. Wondering if it sort of involves like higher ad spend to get people to go there or you are just sort of banking on participating and sort of a broader consumer shift that\u2019s going out of that area?","Joe Sprague","","Hi, Hunter, this is Joe from marketing. Yeah, it is a couple of different things and to be clear, we absolutely have a goal of boosting our direct share of bookings at alaskaair.com. And it sorts of with having number one good platform. Over the last two or three years we\u2019ve completely redesigned alaskaair.com. It went from being about the slowest just as one major performance of the site at today being the first or second classes. We measure things on this side much more carefully than we\u2019ve done before. I think we have the most robust testing program, where we are testing how to optimize the selling activities on our site and drive more conversion. I would argue better than any other airline out there right now.","You mentioned sort of page search, we do our share of that and obviously we\u2019re trying to optimize that as much as we can. Personalization is key we\u2019re trying to do some things that appropriately personal experience for customers coming through alaskaair.com, which great helps greatly in terms of repeat business folks coming back to alaskaair.com. We advertise this side generally, so we expand network into new areas folks that\u2019s the best source for them to come for lower fares. And then mobile as been big factor and this as well having our new mobile site to complement our mobile apps and introducing bookings on the mobile apps is helping us to take advantage of this explosion of mobile commerce and of course step is all coming through us direct. So 2012, I think it was mentioned we had our best share of alaskaair.com bookings ever at 54%. And we look forward to boosting that several points higher as been moving forward into 2013.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan","Okay, thanks.","Brandon Pedersen","Hey, Hunter, it\u2019s Brandon. One more comment on that some of these enhancements don\u2019t necessarily manifest themselves through higher advertising spend, but are really what\u2019s driving some of the increase in IT investment as well we really want to make our mobile site great and takes IT dollars.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan","Yeah. Thanks Brandon and I will do more on this cash deployment stuff. Just to follow-up from some of the stuff that John was saying. I think investors obviously noticed the buyback, so it\u2019s great. And it\u2019s very differentiated and putting aside competitive concerns from what other guys are doing, let\u2019s just forget that for a second. If you guys look at your free cash flow yield and you look at what you can do on the dividend side, I mean the math is pretty compelling. If you really payout a 25% of your earnings you\u2019re looking at 3% free cash flow yield already factoring in self-funding to CapEx, already factoring in paying off debt maturities. I think one of the reasons Southwest gets a better multiple than everybody else is because they have this very small dividend that passes investor screens. Is there something being said I mean you guys, we talk about all the time, I mean you want to open up your stock to new investors, how do you feel just about the basic concept of opening yourself up to a screen just like being a very, very modest dividend that would still allow you to do all the other stuff you wanted to do?","Brandon Pedersen","Yeah, it\u2019s Brandon. I understand that and I think we get that. What I can assure you is that we talk with our board frequently about capital allocation and we are really proud of what we have been able to achieve. Having said that, there are merits to the argument that you are presenting and it\u2019s not lost on us and that\u2019s something that we think about.","Brad Tilden","Yeah, I agree with what Brandon is saying for a long time there was kind of \u2013 if you had cash to return to shareholders, it was kind of a question of do you use that cash to repurchase stock or to pay a dividend. We felt like the returns were better \u2013 it\u2019s between those two, the returns were better for investors by us repurchasing stock. I think with the stock price appreciation, that math is getting closer. And I think you are asking a good question that it\u2019s a good issue for the board to wrestle with.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan","Okay, I appreciate that. Thank you.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamie Baker - JPMorgan","Hi, everybody and hello to Hunter, you beat me on the dividend question. The current pilot contract at American affords very, very liberal domestic code-sharing significantly beyond what the other, your other legacy partners can do. However, the MOU between U.S. Airways and the APA and USAPA meaningfully tightens up the allowance for code-sharing and though I recognize current flying is grandfathered in. I know you don\u2019t want to comment on how much revenue American currently feeds the Alaska franchise, but I am curious when do scope issues like these even impact your business plan, is it a stretch to declare that a standalone American would be a better outcome for Alaska than a potential merger?","Andrew Harrison","Hey, Jamie, this is Andrew. I suppose a couple of big picture, I mean industry consolidation in one way as you look at it has I think helped the industry with capacity discipline and a lot of good things coming from that. So, that might be one part of the question whether there is a standalone or a merger. On the other hand to your point, we have been very restricted with the American code-share agreement historically. And personally, there is opportunity and some things that may come here soon that will be sharing public when it\u2019s ready to help broaden some of this. I think the way I would characterize it is, is that like everything Delta and American are important cogs in the wheel, but they are not the only cog and then not the most important cog, they are actually very much important through the whole thing. So for us personally, there has been a number of areas in our network that I think from a partnership perspective can get better for both careers with its expanded scope in the code-share namely East West stuff and doing a little bit more through their hubs and one of them in particular. So, we are looking forward to that and then we will just take it as we go.","Jamie Baker - JPMorgan","","Okay, good. I appreciate that. I wasn\u2019t asking the question, because I thought it would materially derail your profitability, but at the margin it\u2019s something that\u2019s on my mind. So, I appreciate the feedback.","Brandon Pedersen","Yeah.","Operator","The next question comes from Glenn Engel from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America","Few questions. First, your capacity growth is fastest in the first quarter yet you are assuming that the unit cost comparisons get better as the year progresses, what\u2019s going to drive that?","Brandon Pedersen","Hi Glenn, it\u2019s Brandon. There is a couple of things. One is that you are right, well it\u2019s actually the capacity is about flat year-over-year. And in terms of how that affects the unit cost performance, I think you see a lot of that maintenance cost increase that I talked about landing in the first half of the year, and then particularly the first quarter of the year. I think looking out at just off the top of my head I think the maintenance expense number will increase probably around $10 million in the first quarter alone. So, that\u2019s driving that.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America","On the revenue side in the fourth quarter, it looked like December PRASM was down after being up in October-November, why did your numbers get worse in December, it didn\u2019t seem like the industries did?","Andrew Harrison","I think, this is Andrew December PRASM is down marginally mainly driven a little bit by load factor in December, which was down. And the way I would characterize that would be essentially and as Brandon has alluded to, we are still working to finalize our Hawaii seasonality with capacity. And I will tell you most of our regions did very well, but on the load factor front, the new markets in the trans-con that we have just got going in specifically California, Hawaii booked down their load factors. So, overall though we feel very good with the December performance both from a profitability standpoint and then also our trip plan was up significantly. So, no real major aberration there at all, but it was down marginally for the December.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America","Your fuel price, your first quarter guidance and your fourth quarter is running about $0.25 to $0.30 higher than we\u2019ll say U.S. Airways has un-hedged. Why is the gap so wide, it seems even larger than what the hedge premium would suggest?","Mark Eliasen","Yeah, hey Glenn, this is Mark Eliasen. Just a couple of comments on fuel, to answer your question specifically, hedging cost just about $0.10 and the other thing that we have been wrestling with out here on the West Coast is the jet crack spreads or the refining margins have been about $0.09 to $0.10 higher than the rest of the country. So, that\u2019s been another headwind related to that. I guess, more importantly for us fuel is a real important thing for us all the way around, but what we really focus on is how much profit the business produces from the fuel we do use. And I think if you look at The Wall Street Journal, I would say that we are number one among major U.S. airlines in fuel economy. So, we are really focused on that. And I think both airlines about conserving fuel of both to save money and to protect the environment I think in particular I\u2019d give a shout out to our pilots who have done a lot to conserve fuel at both airlines.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America","And finally when I looked at the fleet plan, it looked like you are not going to grow your fleet at all now in 2014, I thought previously you are planning on growing that fleet some, so what changed?","Brad Tilden","In 2014, the plan right now is to have 10 in and I don\u2019t have the investor update in front of me, probably a whole bunch going out. I think the answer to your question is that there is a lot of things moving around in 2014. We have a lot of flexibility. One of the uncertainties right now is what we do with the Combi fleet there is actually five of those airplanes that we want to retire here as sometime in the next two years. The other thing that we have is a whole lot of flexibility with options. And so to say firmly that we are not going to grow the fleet in 2014, I don\u2019t think its right, I don\u2019t think we have decided. I think the bias is to grow as long as we can do so and meet our return goals, but there is a lot of moving parts between now.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America","Actually, the update shows you we are going to shrink the fleet by three in 2014?","Brad Tilden","Yeah, and that reflects the Combi is going out in 2014, there is five of those. We have tentatively packed those to go out in the fourth quarter, but again that\u2019s still moving around.","Glenn Engel - Bank of America","Thank you very much.","Brad Tilden","Well, thanks Glenn.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Fintzen from Barclays. Your line is open.","David Fintzen - Barclays","Hey, good morning everyone.","Brad Tilden","Hi, David.","David Fintzen - Barclays","Maybe a question for Andrew just I think in some past quarters you\u2019ve talked about sort of getting the State of Alaska capacity right, I mean, if we look at some of the DOT data, it looks like you definitely achieved that in the second quarter. And it sounds like the core RASM has been holding up pretty well. I am just curious like kind of how you think about that capacity going forward and are you at a point where you can get back to some growth in State of Alaska ASMs or is that an ongoing sort of need to cut?","Andrew Harrison","So, the State of Alaska is interesting only because the summer is obviously very different than the rest of the year. We are still watching how that carry us load or make decisions about the summer in the State of Alaska. One of the things that I will say core Alaska outside of summer seasonality is not really growing, it\u2019s very static it\u2019s in all of that. Our biggest challenge quite honestly, which may not be a significant to your world is that we have peaks and troughs. And even this Christmas we were too tight and I heard about it. And so we need to add some more flights during certain peak periods of the time. Overall, I would say that we are very comfortable with the State of Alaska capacity. And again there\u2019s just tweaking going on there, but I don\u2019t see any major changes in that as we see here today.","David Fintzen - Barclays","Okay, okay, thanks. But maybe just to follow-up on maintenance maybe for Brandon, you mentioned maintenance is sort of front-end loaded, I mean, if I look back over the last number of years on an ASM basis maintenance, that is down, I mean I think it\u2019s down sort of the team, sort of over the last four to five years. Are we going to \u2013 is maintenance cost pressure going be an ongoing theme over the next few years or is there will you get past the first of this year and beginning of this year and that sort of the worst of it for the foreseeable future?","Brad Tilden","David, I think this is the peak, it\u2019s been (in any future) here talking. Yeah, I think this year is a peak with some heavy maintenance visits on our Classics 737s. In terms of going forward, we do plan to level load this thing with power by our contracts on our majority of our Dash 7 engines. So, our goal is to make sure these maintenance costs stay within a tight range.","Brandon Pedersen","Dave, this is Brandon just a follow up as I said in my prepared comments a lot of the increase is lease return provision or lease return expense coming through. We had started accruing for those lease return costs about year out. And so as we look at the number of leased aircraft that are going back in the fourth quarter of this year and then the first half of next year, lost of that expense will hit in 2013. So, it\u2019s really the combination of that, the combination of what Ben has talk with \u2013 Ben just talked about offset by some maintenance declines at Horizon. I think it\u2019s also important reiterate what you said in your leading which was maintenance expense has comedown and that really reflects the modernization of the fleet and the great works that our maintenance folks have done to improve their processes and just get much better.","David Fintzen - Barclays","Okay. But it\u2019s not like over the next couple of years, you\u2019re at a point where you start hitting a lot of heavy maintenance on sort of the beginning of that fleet modernization and that becomes a big pressure point?","Brandon Pedersen","Its Brandon again, I\u2019m trying to convince Ben to get rid of those classics\u2026","Brad Tilden","I was just going to say that we get - we started getting more expense on those classics and then ultimately we will get to a point where we have the initial wave of 800s that came in, start to need engine overhauls. But as Ben said we\u2019re looking to various \u2013 we are looking into a power by the hour deal to try to spread that cost out.","Brandon Pedersen","You\u2019ve got these figures, but just as a reminder for everybody on the call about 124 737s, 30 are classics, so it\u2019s a quarter of the airplanes that are kind of subject to the tail end of the maintenance cost curve.","David Fintzen - Barclays","Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate all the color.","Brad Tilden","Thanks David.","Operator","Your next question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Savi Syth - Raymond James","","Hi, good morning everyone.","Brad Tilden","Hi, Savi.","Savi Syth - Raymond James","Just on the Boston market I was wondering if you could comment on some of the new markets that you\u2019ve opened up within the last year and how those are progressing. And also I know this is extremely late stage, so maybe you don\u2019t have any color, but I thought the Boston-San Diego route was interesting and just maybe how that\u2019s looking?","Andrew Harrison","Hi, Savi, it\u2019s Andrew. I think as you might have heard earlier even over 2012 we\u2019ve had 20 new markets, 11 mainline, and nine regional. As it relates specifically to some of the San Diego, I think is what you might be a alluding to. But we\u2019ve had some growth in San Diego, we have had some regional growth in there, while using Horizon Monterey, Santa Rosa and Fresno, we serve Mexico out of there, we serve Hawaii out of there. We\u2019ve been growing that on San Diego-Boston again as in keeping we are there in Portland and Seattle. And really that\u2019s a market where there is no Jet Blue has service there but very much point of sale to the East Coast folks that has no direct service at all to folks living in San Diego. And so we\u2019ve started that. And as you\u2019ve seen Orlando and this is all part of our strategy of balancing you\u2019ve seen us start Philadelphia, you\u2019ve seen us start Salt Lake City, we\u2019ll be starting Salt Lake City markets out of Seattle and also some extra markets out of California. But there all doing as we\u2019ve expected and I will take time to develop.","Savi Syth - Raymond James","How do they compare versus markets in the Pacific Northwest in the sense of, is it greater leisure mix and just profitability in general?","Andrew Harrison","On the Orlando that\u2019s very much leisure mix market and we see that all day long just like Fort Lauderdale from Seattle. On the San Diego-Boston to be determined obvious as we haven\u2019t really we haven\u2019t started that, but we do expect to see some mix of business traffic which is certainly in the Boston marketplaces as well as good leisure traffic.","Savi Syth - Raymond James","Alright.","Andrew Harrison","It\u2019s booking up quite well just to be honest with you.","Savi Syth - Raymond James","Great, thank you.","Brad Tilden","And Savi, it\u2019s Brad. Just to be really clear I would call that a San Diego strategy not a Boston strategy.","Savi Syth - Raymond James","Thanks Brad.","Brad Tilden","Yeah.","Savi Syth - Raymond James","Alright. Thanks guys.","Brad Tilden","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Mike Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","Hey guys, just two questions here. One, Brandon, when you look at your numbers and whether you look at leverage or coverage ratios, right now Alaska is performing probably the best that it\u2019s performed. And then if you go back 20, 30 years and even profitability etcetera and yet when we go back and we look at how the rating agencies looked at you as a company back in early 90s, in early 90s, you were an investment grade credit on a senior unsecured basis. And you look at a lot of the metrics today and they are a bit higher than what they were back then and yet if I look at just on Bloomberg here, it looks like you are a double B minus on a senior unsecured basis from S&P. What do they tell you now like what do you need to do, you need to get to like a 23% operating margin, I mean, what gets to an investment grade, I just because you are well above what you were back then, what\u2019s changed?","Brandon Pedersen","It\u2019s an absolute mystery frankly and you are absolutely right, maybe I\u2019ll ask Mark Eliasen to chime in on that.","Mark Eliasen","Hey Mike, this is Mark. I will just say that we have a great relationship with S&P and we talk to them frequently. We respect what they have done and they will say right away that their standards have changed over time. They changed over time as a result of issues that happen in 2008, but they have I think respect and admiration for what we have done for the business, our leverage going down, they appreciate. We kept them posted before we did our stock buyback we consulted with them. And I think we have a good dialogue there. One thing that they do point out is that we are a smaller airline and that\u2019s the challenge for us. But I think that they respect our numbers and they put us on a positive outlook. So, we are looking for good things coming forward.","Mike Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And I didn\u2019t mean to just take on S&P, I would say Fitch and Moody\u2019s, they sort of all take the same view on the industry, which I don\u2019t know arguably it just it feels like it\u2019s a better industry today than what it was in the early 1990s, but I guess it\u2019s an opinion that they are not on the same page as of yet. My, go ahead\u2026","Brandon Pedersen","Our creditors look at us and they do look at the S&P rating, but they actually put us in a higher category than S&P does and that\u2019s what really counts is the people who lend us money.","Mike Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","Okay, good. And then just my second question I go back, I think it was about a couple of months back, there was a five or six-page press release out between it was from both you and Delta and it talked about a lot of good things going on in Seattle and it talked about the growth of the code share. And it\u2019s obviously been very positive for both of you. And then not too long after that, we see Delta flying from Seattle to Los Angeles, which is obviously important market for you guys. So, I am curious what\u2019s behind that, I don\u2019t know maybe it was just in response to you guys announcing the Seattle Salt Lake service maybe it\u2019s just some funds borrowing between partners what gives there?","Brad Tilden","Mike, it\u2019s Brad. What I would say is that we have extraordinarily good relationship with both Delta and America and there are two domestic alliances or biggest alliances. And I think the partnerships work really, really well. We have kind of a network where we grow, where we fly a lot up and down the West Coast and out of the West Coast. And Delta in particular has all kinds of wide bodies they fly out of Seattle. I think 8 wide bodies a day between Amsterdam and Charles de Gaulle and Narita and Haneda, they are adding and Beijing and Shanghai, so a big picture. It\u2019s an extraordinarily good relationship and we get that what we do in this relationship is we help them fill those wide bodies flying out of Seattle. And then that feed is really important to Alaska, because it helps us justify more 737s flying in places like Seattle-Salt Lake and Seattle-LA and Seattle-New York and so forth. There is once a while in relationships like this, there are little things and you have mentioned a couple of them. And I think there are little things that happened along the edges, but I don\u2019t think we should let them distract any of us from what overall is an exceptionally good relationship.","Mike Linenberg - Deutsche Bank","Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Thanks everyone.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dave Pfennigwerth from Evercore Partners. Your line is open.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners","Still Duane, good morning guys. Dave does sound cooler though I will admit. Just a couple of quick ones for Andrew, historically how much does an earlier Easter help March PRASM?","Andrew Harrison","So, yeah this year, it\u2019s moving to the Sunday on the March 31. For us Duane, it\u2019s not a huge change basically the schools in the Pacific Northwest are sort of staying put there vacation time, its California that moves. So us personally with this week earlier, we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s going to be a major impact on our first quarter results, that\u2019s out there.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners","Okay thanks. And then just you may have touched on this, but just in terms of sort of system competing capacity trends in the March quarter versus what you saw on 4Q, and maybe you could comment on the State of Alaska and Hawaii specifically?","Andrew Harrison","So, looking forward, I look forward to a couple of months \u2013 excuse me a couple of quarters as you know industry capacity changes for the summer going forward. But looking forward, we see certain pressure in some of the Pacific Northwest to the Bay and Southern California. We see a little bit of pressure in the Bay area to Mexico, but overall on a weighted average, competitive capacity in our markets is marginally down over the next few quarters. So, we see that fairly stable there. I think you mentioned the State of Alaska, I think we have our summer schedule out there right now. We are going to be up just a little bit, but again overall no major changes there.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners","Okay, thanks very much.","Brad Tilden","Thanks Dave.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Crissey from UBS. Your line is open.","Kevin Crissey - UBS","","Hi, thank you for taking the question. So, maybe through Andrew\/Joe here, I am not sure, but if I think if a flight is not booking up well, it seems that the industry responses to start lowering fares, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the issue where you could just not be getting enough attention to your website to sell your product, it wasn\u2019t the price that was the sticking point, it was the overall traffic to your selling source. Kind of when I think about it what an OTA does, they might buy more, get more attention on Google or however they want to do it. How should we think as you grow your web direct, how should we think about how your website and that strategy fits in maybe with your revenue management process? Thank you.","Joe Sprague","It\u2019s a good question Kevin, this is Joe. And I would say Andrew\u2019s team and the marketing team were closely together in a number of different areas and this is a particularly key one. I mentioned earlier that our share of bookings at alaskaair.com has grown substantially over the last couple of years. And one of the fun things to track is how much it spikes up whenever Andrew\u2019s revenue management team does do a fair sale and then we get out and really promote that sale. It has a very direct impact obviously on our alaskaair.com bookings. We try and help that process along. And especially as we are sort of going into some new markets whether it be Hawaii or some of the other California new markets, the nice thing about sort of online bookings is that we are able to target our advertising very, very directly. So we can deal target whether its online advertising or the actual search results that would produce a direction for a consumer to come to alaskaair.com.","And so we are spending a bit more on page search, but we are also targeting it pretty aggressively more so than we have done in the past. Then the other thing just sort of general advertising and promotion we are doing a lot more to raise awareness in new markets, both of our new service, but also of alaskaair.com in particular being a great source for those low fares for that new service. So, as we go our customer base, we get people sort of joining the mileage plan. We had big increases in mileage plan membership the last year that allows us to also communicate directly with those customers. We do a lot of e-mail marketing to customers that we have in the database and then also as sort of a channel to shift people directly to alaskaair.com.","Kevin Crissey - UBS","Perfect. Thank you for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve O\u2019Hara from Sidoti. Your line is open.","Steve O\u2019Hara - Sidoti","","Hi, good afternoon or good morning.","Brad Tilden","Hi Steve.","Steve O\u2019Hara - Sidoti","I was curious just about the, I guess restructuring of the Horizon business and making it a branded regional. And I am just wondering in terms of maybe the benefits and the costs of having it in in-house regional versus a partner like SkyWest. I mean, what do you gain by having the in-house regional? What do you lose by having it? And then do you ever look at the possibility of either selling that business or spending it all?","Brad Tilden","Yes, Steve I think maybe just first pause and backup a couple of steps. Horizon has gone through a lot of changes in the last five or six years, but a lot in last couple of years. And you know about the branding stuff, there have been efforts to get some of their costs down to lower levels. A lot of the back office stuff that isn\u2019t completely visible to people outside the company, but back office functions have been hugely streamlined. So there is one team working on all of these functions instead of two. And on other calls we\u2019ve talked about the tremendous job that Glenn Johnson and his leadership team have done. And I look at it and I just I see a lot less effort happening for the two companies and I see regional business its producing $100 million a year of pretax profit. So, it looks really good, your specific question about spinning off Horizon or having someone else do that for us. I think where we look at that is we\u2019ve got something that if we can do it ourselves and make it work well that\u2019s what we wanted to do.","And we feel that it is working well, Horizon has the Q400, there is not a lot of those flying and flown in the United States. It\u2019s a tremendous airplane for the markets what we\u2019re using it kind of shorter stage lengths from Seattle and Portland and so forth, it\u2019s a tremendous airplane. And Horizon has a lot of know-how with that airplane and also a great \u2013 our long tradition of providing great customer service. So, it\u2019s profitable, it\u2019s producing good returns on capital, it\u2019s meeting our objectives and we like \u2013 we like the current setup.","Chris Berry","I am sure we have time for maybe one more question here. Okay, Steven, so you got another follow up there.","Steve O\u2019Hara - Sidoti","And almost done. Thanks.","Chris Berry","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question in queue is from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Trahan. Your line is open.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan","Hey, Thanks a lot for the follow up, do you guys disclose what variable incentive pay would be at baseline target this year?","Brandon Pedersen","At target baseline and incentive pay for PBP and OPR is right around $60 million.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan","Again, okay cool, thanks. And one for Andrew, Andrew as you talked about some adjusting some of the schedule in certain Hawaiian markets. Obviously you can\u2019t down gauge, I don\u2019t think you are going to be taking dots off on the map any time soon. Have you even thought to maybe sort of moving departures around a complement Allegiant in markets where you guys compete? So, they take them out there, you\u2019re taking back or something like that given the fact that some of the markets are very, very low frequency markets?","Andrew Harrison","Sure. So, a couple \u2013 to you point Hunter a couple things on Hawaii is, yeah, with legend coming in and doing two or three a week that we get them bring back or whatever. Big picture here is Hawaii is extremely sensitive to the time of the day of the departure and of the West Coast its 9, 8, 9, 10, 11 in morning. Really what we\u2019ve done is looking at the outer islands like (indiscernible) and you are going to see already in the public booking system there that we are going to split Oakland and San Diego, (indiscernible) to go three to four times a week each of those cities and so. That\u2019s what where we are doing half of ou8r capacity is in the Pacific Northwest, the other roughly is in California. And so what are showing is there is not taking dots off the map to your point. But we are going really match supply with demand because Hawaii is extremely seasonal especially in California. And we are just going to be more focused on that going forward and perhaps we have been.","Hunter Keay - Wolfe Trahan","Okay, thank you again.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks, Hunter.","Operator","I have no further questions in the queue. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Mr. Brad Tilden.","Brad Tilden - Chief Executive Officer","","Alright, thanks everybody for joining us today.

Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session for analysts and journalists. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Investor Relations, Lavanya Sareen.","Lavanya Sareen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Jessie, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for Alaska Air Group's fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings call.","On the call today, our CEO, Brad Tilden, will provide an overview of the business; our Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Harrison, will share more about our commercial plans followed by Brandon Pedersen, our CFO, who will discuss our financial results and outlook for 2017. Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.","As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. We'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","All right. Here's more disclosures. The acquisition of Virgin America impacts the comparability of our results. So to assist investors with comparisons, our investor update includes certain unaudited supplementary data labeled Combined Comparative Statistics. That should help investors understand how our combined business would have performed had we acquired Virgin America at the beginning of 2016. Investors should be aware that these are not official pro forma results as required by the SEC but simply an addition of historical Alaska plus Virgin America data. Virgin America's historical financial information has been conformed to Alaska's financial statement classification where appropriate.","Moving on to results. This morning Alaska Air Group reported a fourth quarter GAAP net profit of $114 million, excluding $83 million in merger-related net costs and a $4 million impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio. Air Group reported an adjusted net income of $193 million and earnings per share grew by 7% to $1.56 per share. This result compares to First Call consensus of $1.40 per share and exceeds last year's adjusted net income of $186 million or $1.46 per diluted share.","For the full year, Alaska Air Group reported a record adjusted net profit of $911 million, up 8%. Earnings per share grew by 12% to $7.32 per share, with the higher growth rate because of the number of shares repurchased during the year. Additional information about cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging, capital expenditures, and other items can be found in our investor update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com.","And with that, over to Brad.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Lavanya, and good morning, everyone. Lavanya just shared the numbers, so let me step back and talk about the underlying business and where we're headed in 2017.","First and foremost, this is the first quarter that we've spoken since we completed our $4 billion acquisition of Virgin America and we cannot be more optimistic about what lies ahead. Air Group is now the fifth-largest airline in the United States and we serve more than 42 million guests through our hubs in Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Anchorage. We have 1,200 daily departures to 118 destinations, almost 300 aircrafts and about 19,000 employees.","The footprint of the combined airline gives us an unmatched ability to serve West Coast travelers and it creates a powerful platform for long-term growth. But to be clear, we know that simply adding routes isn't how you win in this business. For us to be successful over time, our people, our guests and our owners have to be aligned and we have to be focused on running our business in a way that we're creating real value for all of our constituents. With this in mind, we're adopting Virgin America's purpose statement, which is creating an airline that people love. Although this phrasing is new to Air Group, we think this language fits and it captures our commitment to continually improving in all areas.","As we look back on what this team has accomplished in 2016, one of the things that we're most proud of is how we balanced Air Group's commitment to our employees, our guests, our communities and our investors. Let me start with our employees. We have a fantastic group of employees that care deeply about our guests and about the success of this company. We're spending a lot of time with our employees, integrating the Alaska and Virgin America cultures, and we are in fact about halfway through a program called Momentum, where we're inviting all Virgin America teammates in groups of about 120 to sessions where they can learn about the new Air Group, our vision and our shared goals. These sessions are being very well-received and I want to thank Ben and the team at Alaska and Virgin for putting together such a great series of workshops.","Those of you who have been following us know that we've been proud of the fact that all Air Group employees participate in the same goals-based gain-sharing plan, which we call PBP. For 2016, our employees once again earned about a full month's pay, and I want to congratulate them all. And looking to 2017, Virgin America teammates will be rolled into PBP as well.","Moving to our guests, the merger of two safe, reliable and service focused airlines is fundamentally good for guests who benefit from getting a premium product at low fares and an even bigger network. Safety is always our top priority, and Alaska demonstrated this again recently by being the first airline in the United States to have its safety management system approved by the FAA. I want to thank our safety and ops professionals who worked long and hard to get through all of the gates necessary to make this happen.","Operationally, we had an excellent year, despite some rough weather in December, which continued into the early part of 2017. For the full year, 87.3% of Alaska's flights arrived on time, earning our people the number one on-time performance ranking from FlightStats for the seventh year in a row. Alaska also earned the number one ranking in the Wall Street Journal Comprehensive Airline Survey for the fourth year in a row. And as you know, both airlines have a history of offering our guests award-winning services, and this has been validated by Alaska's nine consecutive J.D. Power awards, and by Virgin America's number one ratings from both Travel + Leisure and Cond\u00e9 Nast also for nine straight years.","But we're not standing still. Among other changes, we recently rolled out premium class on Alaska. Andrew will talk more about this in just a moment. We've recently improved our food and beverage offerings, and we were recently the first, and so far only airline, to introduce free texting on-board for all our customers.","And finally, on to our owners. Today, we announced a record annual profit of $911 million. This is our 13th consecutive annual profit on an adjusted basis. And perhaps more importantly, we have reduced our unit cost for seven straight years and for 14 of the last 15 years on the mainline side. One thing that the last 15 years has taught us is that customers want low fares, and to offer low fares, we have to have low costs. On the strength of our strong service, low costs, and low fares, we've grown revenues at an average rate of 8% since 2009. We're also running strong returns and we expect our pre-tax margin of 24% for the year to be among the top 15% of our S&P 500 Industrial peer set.","Our multi-year track record of strong results and our investment-grade balance sheet allowed us to finance the acquisition of Virgin America without issuing any new equity. The acquisition was accretive out of the gate in 2016 and we fully expect it to be accretive in 2017. Also today, we announced that we've increased our dividend for the fourth time in three-and-a-half years. Brandon will provide more information on this.","Andrew and Brandon will also share details about our 2016 results and trends that we're seeing in the business. But before I turn the call over to them, I want to share a few more thoughts on the integration with you. First, we're using the integration as a time to reset our sights on the future. A lot of work is underway behind the scenes and we look forward to sharing more with you at our Investor Day in late March.","Second, our integration management office is fully activated, and now that we've been able to talk openly between the companies, we're finalizing the integration plan. We're on track to achieve a single operating certificate in about 12 months' time, and we expect to transition to a single passenger service system in the second half of 2018.","Third, we're quickly taking advantage of the broader network and greater distribution capabilities of the larger enterprise to build loyalty. For example, Elevate and Mileage Plan members can already earn and redeem miles across Air Group regardless of whether they fly on Alaska or Virgin America. Andrew will share more details with you, but we believe that this has been one of the best and most generous rollouts for guests.","And finally, we're nearing completion of our brand work and plan to have an announcement about the go-forward elements of the brand before our Investor Day.","2016 was a remarkable year for Air Group. Doing a good job with the integration while also running a strong operations takes a tremendous amount of work, and I want to take this opportunity to recognize and thank our people. We have incredible front-line folks, and they are driving this terrific operational performance in guest service. We also have an extraordinarily talented and committed leadership team that is being fully challenged by this integration effort and is clearly rising up to meet that challenge. I want to take a minute and thank all of these folks as we wrap up a simply fantastic year in 2016, and as we collectively turn our full attention to 2017.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, Air Group's total revenue, and that includes $100 million from Virgin America, was up $147 million or $0.11. Given Virgin America only represented two weeks of activity in the fourth quarter, I thought it would be most useful for this call to just generally talk about Alaska's results excluding Virgin America. We were very pleased with our fourth quarter unit revenue results. Alaska RASM was up 0.3%. Our first positive unit revenue since the second quarter of 2014, which exceeded industry unit revenue performance by 2.4 points.","For all of 2016, Air Group's total revenue, excluding Virgin America, was approximately $5.8 billion and grew by $233 million, or 4.2%. This makes 2016 the seventh year of consecutive revenue growth for Air Group. That's twice the top line growth of S&P 500 companies and contrasts with a 1% revenue decline for the airline industry in 2016.","Before we move into 2017, there's a few things related to our business, excluding Virgin America, from 2016 that I wanted to highlight.","First, growth in 2016 was enabled by the addition of 10 more Embraer 175s to our fleet for a total of 15 E175s operating in 30 markets. These aircraft are allowing us to create new market revenue streams and also provide first and premium class products for our guests. The Embraer also provides incremental feed for our mainline business. We're excited to be adding 18 more of these aircrafts to the fleet this year.","Second, our relentless commitment to operational excellence and service continues to fuel loyalty growth. As all U.S. carriers have now abandoned miles-based programs, ours (13:06) continues to prove out time and time again as more generous for the majority of members. As a result, Mileage Plan grew 11% in 2016 and members in our card portfolio grew 10.2%, both growing at a rate almost twice that of our passenger growth. Third, as Brad said, we're now selling premium class and both guest feedback and revenue has been fantastic. We expect this product to add approximately $50 million or even more to our revenues in 2017, and should continue to grow into an $85 million run rate by 2018.","Overall, the core Alaska business performed very well. We continue to build on our proven track record of profitable growth. To put some numbers around this, in 2010 total revenues were less than $4 billion. Since that time, Alaska's (13:56) growth has added over $2 billion in revenues, 50% growth, while continuing to lead the industry in profitability. In fact, about a quarter of our earnings per share today has been enabled by new markets added since 2010.","With the acquisition finally closed, we are ready to leverage Virgin America as a platform for continued growth and create greater value for our guests, employees, and owners. As we look at our capacity plan for 2017, that's including Virgin America in the base, we will grow about 6% in the first quarter. As you might recall from our last call, we stated that we intended to grow Air Group capacity by around 7% for 2017.","That remains largely unchanged, but with the addition of Virgin America as well as new slots from constrained airports, consolidated growth for Air Group is expected to be about 8.5%. That's almost 2 percentage points less than the aggregate businesses, that is Alaska plus Virgin would have been for 2016. That said, we make growth decisions at the market level, taking into account economic conditions, and we feel confident about this growth being accretive to earnings and helping us continue to diversify our earnings stream.","So moving to competitive capacity, when we last spoke to you, we expected other airline capacity in the first quarter of 2017 to be up 9%. As we look at published schedules today, we now expect it to be up only 5%. That's a 4-point reduction. But more importantly, with the addition of Virgin's network, which provides greater diversification, we expect the weighted competitive capacity in the first quarter of 2017 to only be up 4%.","Overall, we're seeing solid demand in our markets, and although the Easter shift from March will negatively impact first quarter comps, we feel good about the underlying fundamentals in the traditional Alaska markets. To provide some color on the first quarter revenue, our preliminary January PRASM, that's excluding Virgin America, was down about 3%. However, excluding the impact of recent winter storms, this would have been closer to down 2.5%.","Although it's only been eight weeks since close, the revenue and network teams have made great progress.","In fact, from a network reporting and segment profitability perspective, we have already folded in Virgin America and are planning network synergy adjustments for the fall. Additionally, under Shane's leadership, along with Kevin Ger, Kevin was Virgin's VP of RM who's now joined us. By the end of the second quarter of this year, revenue analysts will have all of revenue management, including system interfaces, analysis, reporting, pricing all under a single set of tools. And from an integration and synergy perspective, this is huge.","I also wanted to highlight two areas where we've made significant progress since the deal closed to ensure that out of the gate, we don't miss a beat on the revenues. Firstly, seven days after the close of the deal, we blanketed Virgin America's network with Alaska's code. We are seeing healthy bookings on AlaskaAir.com from Virgin America codeshare flights, including routes like San Francisco to New York City that were previously not in the consideration set for Alaska guests. At current rates, 15% of Virgin America operated revenue is now being booked through codeshare flights on AlaskaAir.com.","And then secondly, we've already opened Mileage Plan to Elevate members and are providing generous conversion offers, including 10,000 bonus miles or $100 off their next flight on Alaska. And additionally, Elevate members can now earn and redeem on Alaska's network as well as globally through our international partners. We're especially pleased with the fact that one-third of Elevate elites have already enrolled in Mileage Plan. As a reminder, loyalty programs offer a very real and tangible benefit to Air Group with total cash flows from Mileage Plan and Elevate exceeding $900 million for the full year of 2016.","As a side note, you have likely noticed we've adopted Virgin America's use of the term guest. We have an extraordinary marketing team that's focused on translating all of the consumer and brand research we've done into brand decisions that will build loyalty. And what we've found is that the term guest is much more in line with the unique hospitality and warmth we want people to feel when they fly with us. This underscores our cultural commitment to hospitality and creating long-term loyalty.","In closing, we look forward to seeing you at our Investor Day in March. We'll have a lot to share, including our plans for the brand, fleet and related aircraft configuration, on-board product including connectivity, airport infrastructure, and much more.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter adjusted net income of $193 million. Earnings per share rose by 7% to $1.56 a share. These results include Virgin America from December 14 through December 31, which added approximately $15 million to net profit in the fourth quarter and full year results. Our full year adjusted net profit was, as Lavanya said, $911 million and earnings per share rose 12% to $7.32. This marks the 13th consecutive year that we've reported an annual profit and the seventh year in a row that we've been profitable in every quarter, which shows the durability of the operating and financial model that we've created.","We ended the year with after tax ROIC of 21.3%. Our acquisition of Virgin America adds about $3.5 billion to the invested capital base, bringing the total invested capital about $7.5 billion. As a result, the trailing 12 month ROIC, which uses the average invested capital base over the rolling 12 month period, will gradually fall throughout 2017 until we annualize the acquisition day. To illustrate, if you simply took Alaska and Virgin America's full year earnings for both companies, for 2016, and calculated ROIC using the $7.5 billion invested capital base, ROIC would be about 15%. We remain committed to producing returns that are well above our cost to capital.","Our pre-tax profit for the quarter was $308 million, a $16 million improvement over prior year. Virgin America added $24 million of pre-tax profit, offset by an $8 million reduction in pre-tax for the pre-acquisition Air Group business. I might spend a minute wrapping up the final results for the pre-acquisition Air Group, excluding the impact of two weeks of Virgin. As Andrew said, we were pleased with our fourth quarter unit revenue results. On the costs side, CASM, excluding fuel, is about flat for the quarter, which was a bit better than our last Air Group guidance in early December before we closed the deal.","Our fourth quarter economic fuel costs per gallon was actually up year-over-year, the first time that's happened since the first quarter of 2013. Looking at pre-acquisition Air Group for the full year, I was really happy to see full year CASMex decline by about 1%, and I want to thank everyone for their focus on keeping costs low by being highly productive and maintaining a frugal mind-set. Our long track record of slowly chipping away costs is a major driver of our strong results over the last several years, and as a source of competitive advantage over higher cost legacy carriers that will allow us to keep growing.","I thought I might also share Virgin America's fourth quarter and full year results. For the fourth quarter, Virgin America recorded us on a standalone basis, pre-tax profit of $61 million, a 14% improvement over the fourth quarter of prior year. For the full year, Virgin America's standalone basis pre-tax profit was $244 million, a 14.7% pre-tax margin. I want to congratulate the team there on the really nice year-over-year improvement.","Peter Hunt is here with us and would be happy to add more color to those results. Many have asked about our reporting going forward, we'll give guidance on an Air Group basis, of course, with some more limited guidance for our Mainline segment which is going to include Alaska and Virgin America. The year-over-year comps will be muddy for the next four quarters. To help investors understand what's really happening, we'll give guidance that has both a comparison between new Air Group and pre-acquisition Air Group, which will match our SEC reporting, but we'll also provide some color on what the changes represent had the business been combined on January 1, 2016, as Andrew illustrated with the capacity guidance.","So let's turn the page to 2017. We expect consolidated CASMex to be about flat for the year on what would be an 8.5% increase in new capacity in the marketplace. This is on a combined basis, as I said, assuming a full year of Virgin America in the base. On the positive side, we're already seeing good progress on our cost synergy goals, and there is also other purchasing accounting adjustments that will favorably impact the P&L in 2017 by about $50 million. Those favorable items will help offset the cost pressure we're facing including the impact of a likely new engine services agreement at Alaska and an increase in engine overhauls and heavy checks on Virgin's fleet.","We'll also have the impact of the new contract with our Alaska technicians, assuming it ratifies, and higher pension expense. As Brad said, we're making great investments to our onboard product. And finally, there's some ASM and cost headwinds associated with premium class, which does have a significant margin benefit, as Andrew said. Overall, I like where our cost structure stands and the results for 2017 given all that we have going on and the changes that are happening at other carriers.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $1.6 billion in cash. Total cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion excluding merger-related costs. This marks our fourth consecutive year of operating cash flows of about $1 billion or more. CapEx for the year was just under $680 million, resulting in free cash flow of over $820 million ex integration costs.","We have a busy year with the fleet in 2017. At Alaska, we'll take delivery of 12 Boeing 737-900ER aircraft which are absolutely fabulous airplanes. Those will backfill the remaining 10 737-400s that will all be retired by year-end. We're also in the process of modifying three Boeing 737-700s into freighters, which will replace the five 737-400 combis and one 400 freighter that we currently operate. Say that 10 times quickly.","In the regional business, we're looking forward to taking 18 E175s from Embraer. At Virgin America, we'll take some number of the A321neos Virgin was planning on, but we're working with the lessor on an arrangement where we don't take all 10 that are scheduled to be delivered over the next two years. Virgin America will be the worldwide launch customer for those aircraft, which will be configured with 185 seats, and we're very anxious to see how they perform.","We're also planning more CapEx in non-aircraft related projects. For example, we're making a major investment into our facilities up in the state of Alaska, including a new hanger and significant remodels of several owned terminals. All in we're currently projecting 2017 CapEx to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion.","During 2016, we returned $329 million to shareholders via $136 million in dividends and $193 million in share repurchases. I hope you saw today's announcement that we're again increasing the dividend by 9% to $0.30 per share per quarter. We've now increased the dividend four times since it was initiated, and it's increased threefold in that time. The increase signals our board's confidence in our plan and our ability to continue to generate strong results.","We ended the year with $2.6 billion of long-term debt, with most of that being acquisition debt. Including the impact of leases, our year-end adjusted debt-to-cap stands at 59%. We're well positioned if interest rates rise as half our total debt is fixed.","We remain committed to the idea of being not just a great airline, but a high quality business with a conservative balance sheet. In that vein, we're going to continue to re-deleverage until we hit our target of about 40% debt to cap. So I would expect cash distributions to shareholders to be limited to the dividend and perhaps some modest opportunistic share buybacks.","Overall, I'm extremely pleased with where we are today. We closed the biggest acquisition in this company's history without using any equity, and did this while maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet. This is a testament to the financial discipline that's part of the DNA of this company, and it provides us with a strong foundation as we head into the future. And with that, let's open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Savi.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Brandon, just maybe first off, I was pleasantly surprised by the dividend increase here and now that you know what the funding is and have a better idea of CapEx and putting the plan together, I was just wondering what are your thoughts on how the balance sheet should progress over the next two years? Or at least what your target might be? And also related to that, if there's any kind of change in your fuel hedge strategy?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","I'll take the first, and then Mark can take the second on the fuel hedge strategy. In terms of the dividend, we've talked about this for several years now. We want to have a track record of increasing the dividend. That's something that high-quality industrials do, and we want to be considered that. As we looked, as you said, at our CapEx plan for the year, our cash flow plan for the year, the dividend made sense. And it's something that we're proud to announce, and as I said in my remarks, it shows confidence on the part of the board in our plan going forward.","Mark, you want to take the fuel hedging?","Mark G. Eliasen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Sure. Good morning, Savi. With respect to our fuel hedging, we're going to continue on with what we've been doing. It's worked really well as fuel has gone up or down. So we don't see any reason to change. As you know, we're hedged at, 50% hedged at $62 a barrel. And so our break even is around $64, and we think it's a good place to be.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Helpful. And if I may, just on \u2013 and maybe for Andrew. Could you talk a little bit about kind of the demand and yield trends that you're seeing, and if there are kind of variances in kind of the based on the type of market? And I wonder if you saw any kind of holiday timing drag in December and a benefit in January, and then maybe have you quantified what Easter might be?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Savi. I'll have Shane answer some of those more detailed questions on the timing. I think what I would say at the big-picture level is we were very pleased with the fourth quarter. We continue to see strong demand in our markets. The team is heavily focused on the new Virgin America network. And again, with Kevin, who is the RM leader coming over, we are very well positioned to continue good momentum there in the fourth quarter and going into the first quarter.","But, Shane, do you want to touch on the holiday movements?","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Sure. I can do that. And just to give perspective on what Andrew said, I think throughout the quarter, demand was super strong. Load factors were up a couple of points. Business sort of demand within the month sequentially got better both on load factor and yield October through December, and we've seen that continue into 2017. So that's all good news.","On the shifts, there was a 1-point shift for the month out of December into January just for holiday return. I think others have mentioned there was some day-of-week shifting around more Tuesdays in January this year than last year, and that's impacting January results a little bit. Easter is like we're thinking about 2 points on the month moving out of March into April. But we're sort of hopeful that we have space to backfill a lot of that with business traffic in March. So we're not necessarily thinking March is going to be down that amount, but that's \u2013 we know the actual holiday shift is worth about 2 points.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is open.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thanks very much. Brandon, I think you mentioned on the loyalty program side that on a combined basis it would contribute about $900 million in cash in 2016. I think that's a newish disclosure for you guys. So can you just provide maybe on a revenue basis what the combined program would look like and speak to any profitability metrics you'd like to disclose?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","$900 million-ish is \u2013 I don't remember if it's new, but if it is, great. I'm glad we were able to provide \u2013 I mean, it really does demonstrate the power of the networks. I don't have the revenue breakdown at my fingertips, but that will be in the 10-K. We disclosed what's in passenger revenue and in other revenue. In terms of the profitability of the program, that's probably a longer conversation that's not going to happen on an earnings call, but we can discuss that offline.","What I will say is that just, it does wonders in terms of building customer loyalty and stickiness to Alaska\/Virgin America, and that's, for us, where the power is. In terms of the profitability of each element, that's a little harder to get into.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. I mean, Brad, that's a lot of cash relative to what you guys generate, and I would estimate it's quite a bit of your earnings also. So is there any concern that the way that you guys are disclosing the program now ends up with the airline kind of relying on this program too much and not finding new ways to make the core business flying, one person, one city to the next, more profitable?","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yes. I \u2013 Joe, thanks for the question. I don't think there's any concern at all. I mean, our entire \u2013 and people that sort of live out in our coverage areas do feel this, but our entire focus is going into the community and doing the right thing, being a good company and building loyalty. And when we build loyalty, we want people to get into our Mileage Plan and then we want them to get at least one of our credit cards in their wallet, ideally two, maybe three of our credit cards in their wallet. So that's what we do.","And then what we want to do on the other side is give them huge value for having that card, so they get a free bag, they get miles, they get a companion certificate, which gives them if they buy one ticket, they get a very inexpensive second ticket. And then as we've sort of been talking more about, there's all sorts of benefits through the awards as well.","I think if you look at our 10-K, and this may be wrong, but I think it's close to right, I think something like 19% of our travel on this company is somehow affiliated with the Mileage Plan, and I think that percentage is much higher than other airlines. I think other airlines are closer to 10% or 12%. It might be a full redemption, or it might be a fare when they pay it half with cash and half with miles. So I think this is our core business, and I think it's a really important part of our core business.","We've got a fabulous relationship with Bank of America, and I think it's something that you're going to see us \u2013 if you sort of look back, we've talked about 10% growth in the Mileage Plan for 15 years \u2013 double-digit growth, sorry. We've talked about double-digit growth in the Mileage Plan for 15 years. I think it's something that you're going to see us continue to focus on.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Joe, we're going to send you an application.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for the time. Just on the capacity guide of 8.5% or so, can you just talk a bit more about where that growth will be focused? And then any implications to just being able to maintain that sort of steady margin state RASM that you guys have been putting up despite the higher level of growth?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Rajeev, good morning. It's Andrew. So a couple of things on that. Firstly, I will tell you from an internal perspective, the 8.5% growth is at the top of our range. So I want to put that out there. Secondly, a lot of the growth will be Mid-Continent and Trans-Con, which has been what you've seen recently. The other thing is that we've had a really exciting opportunity with slots. And I think with Newark, Alaska picked up four, Virgin picked up two more. We're hoping to get four slots into Mexico City here shortly, and we're also working on some other opportunities in constrained airports.","So overall, I think that our growth is very balanced as it relates to the core and new markets, and really exciting opportunities. And as Brad has mentioned, this growth is going to fuel utility and loyalty for the combined airlines now, and we believe that this growth that we're going to produce this year is going to continue to basically ignite this acquisition and bring good things to guests.","And then also...","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, Andrew.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","\u2013 I should mention the regional \u2013 sorry, Rajeev. The regional side is growing about 18%. And as you're aware, the Embraer 175, this is really a new tool for us. It hits Mid-Continent routes. It's going to provide very valuable feed. And it also generates first-class and premium-class revenues not available in our current regional fleet. So when you package this all together, we feel very good about that.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. And then just on the integration side, what are some of the big risks we should be focused on this year? And then maybe just some color on the timeline for cost synergies and some of the puts and takes there?","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Good morning, Rajeev. It's Ben here. What I will say is we are well underway, as Brad had in his comments, with the integration management office. We've established 20 integration goals, things like getting a single guest loyalty program, integrated call centers, a single passenger service systems. The work streams, over 100 work streams are established, and on the synergies side, we have established 30 synergy categories, 7 revenue, 23 that are cost-related.","We've got executive owners in conjunction with FP&A and their supply-chain people, and we are driving hard to achieve those synergies. So we're really confident that we're going to achieve and exceed what we've established. And then on some of the risks, we are just working on, when we look at other mergers in the past, we realize labor deals are a big deal. So that is an extremely high priority for us to get labor deals hopefully by the end of 2017, early into 2018.","Brad talked about culture. We are working on hard bringing these two cultures together to honor what has been so great at Alaska Airlines, but looking at Virgin and see what Virgin can bring to really help the new Alaska to greater heights. So I'm really confident about what we're doing now and where we're going.","Operator","Your next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks, operator. Hi, guys. Thanks for the time here.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Good morning, Helane.","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Good morning, Helane.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","So I have two questions and they are completely unrelated. The first question is, Brandon I know you'll be able to earn your way back to your 40% goal for debt-to-cap. But given where the stock price is, have you given any thought also to maybe issuing some equity to bring the debt-to-cap level down, even if it's not from 60% to 40% to like maybe 50%, and then just reinstating the share repurchase program?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Helane, Brandon. Good morning. No, we have not thought about that at all. We wanted to do this acquisition in a way that wasn't dilutive, and we did it, and I think we still have a very strong balance sheet. So I don't feel the need to do that, at all.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. And then my other question is about the Airbus aircraft, and I know \u2013 I heard what you said about trying out the neos and seeing how they work, and working with the lessors to maybe adjust deliveries. But after you're done with integration and you start to think about the route network, are there some markets where the A320neos will work better than the Boeing 737s that you would actually think about permanently keeping them? Or working to buy those aircraft rather than lease those aircraft? Because I mean, given your very strong balance sheet, I'd say it would be cheaper for you to buy them rather than to lease them.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yes, I think there's two questions in there. One is a buy versus lease question, and we've been a big advocate of buying for a lot of different reasons. In terms of where the airplanes fit best operationally, might get Ben to chime in on that because we're learning some things about that already.","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Sure. Hi, Helane. It's Ben, and Andrew and I are partnering on this with his team. The Airbus is a great airplane. As you know, we love Boeings, we're all Boeing and we're proud of that, and we're learning a lot about the Airbus. What I will tell you is where you put the Airbus. It's one of the things we've done well, is we've put the right airplane in the right market. The Airbus is limited to A320 at least, as limited as that Trans-Con airplane we think is a better North to South airplane. So at least in the next five years, I think you'll see Andrew's team work with the ops team really to get these airplanes in the right markets to really maximize their potential. So where the A321s go, whether they go Hawaii or Trans-Con, I think we'll make the right decision for to maximize their potential.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Okay. Well, those were my two unrelated questions. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Good morning, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. So one of the more unfortunate conditions of the DoJ approval was that they're going to make you guys ask for permission to divest Virgin's gates at Love Field if you decide to go down that path. So I know it's a little bit early to start talking about whether you're going to do that or not but can you \u2013 and this might be a question for Kyle, by the way, if he's on the line \u2013 but can you tell me about how pragmatically easy that would be to do given the conditions attached to the approval, what steps you have to go through, and just sort of the legal hurdles that you would have to clear to get that done, if you decide to do it?","Kyle B. Levine - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yes, Hunter. Good morning. The order, as you've probably seen, doesn't specify what steps are necessary. So in my mind, if we ever decided to do that, it would start by a letter saying, hey, we'd like an audience with you to explain our business reasons for wanting to do this. And the discussion would go from there.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","To DoT.","Kyle B. Levine - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","To DoJ.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","DoJ. Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then, Brad, when will all your distribution agreements with the various GDSs be harmonized? And what's going to be your single biggest priority in the negotiations with them? Like obtaining a partial content agreement? Or is it just like lowering the booking fees? And then if you want to just talk bigger picture about how big of an opportunity distribution savings is for the merged company over the next many years, that'd be great too. Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Hunter. I'm going to ask either Andrew or Shane to answer this. And just to be really clear, Hunter's asking about distribution systems and opportunities between Alaska and Virgin to harmonize and find cost synergies or even revenue opportunities.","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Hunter. I won't get into details. Mostly the agreements are actually open for us right now but our costs of distribution are really good comparatively, and so I think this is one of the key areas of cost synergy that has been identified that Ben just alluded to of those 30 areas. So we're working with the distribution providers right now on new contract language. We've got great relationships with them, and I think that this won't be hard for us to achieve pretty quickly.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Nish Mani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you so much for the time. This is actually Nish Mani on for Jamie. I wanted to ask you about customer retention and how that plays into the revenue synergies target that we should be thinking about going forward. I mean you guys have outlined that $175 million run rate number and I know when we had last spoke on the topic, the base case essentially included about 100% customer retention in the acquisition. And I'm wondering, if a, your view on this has changed since the merger has closed, you had the ability to kind of look at the numbers closely and do more channel checks, but b, how we should be thinking about that going forward, and how that could potentially impact the accretiveness of the deal?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hi Nish, this is Andrew Harrison. Thanks for your question. So a couple of things on that. Firstly, we're going to provide a lot more detail at Investor Day but what I will tell you right now is that very much on the revenue synergies of $175 million, nothing has changed there. And as Brad has been sharing, our whole goal here is to really provide significant revenue growth in California, and particularly of course on the West Coast. We are very hard at work, working with elites both Elevate and Mileage Plan, signing up new members and we're getting into it, and we're going to have some exciting changes coming over the next six months. So we feel very confident that we are going to continue to grow our guest base in a major way as we move through this integration.","Nish Mani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. And then I wanted to just ask, kind of briefly, about the evolving nature of the Virgin brand and how you guys are thinking about it. I mean obviously there are a bunch of operational decisions to be made down the road but, is it your sense from where you sit today that the Virgin brand would represent any kind of distinct departure away from what Alaska's product offerings are? Or has that decision kind of still been mulled over so to speak?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Nish, Andrew again. I've only ever had one rule, that as sort of a collar around my neck, was that I wasn't taught to talk about unit revenues going forward. A recent new collar with an electric charge is being placed around my neck and that would include Brad. So what I will tell you is that we will talk to you more about that at Investor Day, but at the end of the day what we can tell you is that as we move forward, we're going to continue to evolve and become increasingly relevant and fresh and new, inspiring for the guests on the West Coast. And I will say, and it sounds like a small thing but it's not; at the end of the day this concept of calling guests, which Virgin America had adopted, it's very powerful. And the more you get into it, and culturally as we rethink how we talk about who we're serving, it's going to make a difference. And so, we're going to start to unroll a lot of this stuff, again, Investor Day, so I look forward to seeing you there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open.","Eric Morgan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. This is Eric Morgan on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about margins. Given that Virgin has had lower margins historically, just wondering how you're thinking about the whole business now? And longer term, is there any reason consolidated margin shouldn't ultimately reach where you were running pre-merger?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Eric, it's Brandon. You are right. Virgin America did run at a much lower margin than Alaska and mathematically, when you add the two together, you get a lower margin or a margin in between. In terms of where the business operates going forward, I think that's largely a matter of the economic environment, fuel conditions, competitive capacity, et cetera. I think Alaska's goal is to just be in a place where we're doing better than the industry on average. And I don't exactly know what that's going to be, but that's the goal.","Eric Morgan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Appreciate that. And maybe just one on the premium class product. Could you elaborate a bit on the rollout and how it's playing out relative to expectations? I mean, it sounded like you were pretty happy with the revenue impact. So do you think that $85 million number you have out there could be conservative?","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Thanks, Eric. This is Shane again. Yes, it's a great start. We had all of our B737-800s, about 60 aircraft, configured to begin flying in January. We started selling those seats in November. So it was kind of a limited release. Our Boeing 737-900s are now starting the process of being configured. I'll just tell you, the revenue out of the gate is more than what we had planned for in January, and it looks to be the same in February. I do think as we get into that part of the year and we have sort of the full complement of the fleet configured, our revenue goals are very, very aggressive, so I wouldn't necessarily say that we're going to outperform the $85 million at this point. But if anything, there might be a little upside to it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Oh, yes. Hey. Good morning, everybody. I guess a couple here. Andrew, you were kind to give us competitive capacity. In the March quarter, you said it was 5% and then I think on a weighted basis including Virgin, it was 4%. Do you have that for the June or September, and\/or September quarters?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","What I can tell you right now, just in the second quarter looking at the tapes which aren't finalized, it's close to flat.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","But again, that can continue to move around.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Very good. And then as I recall, and this is probably a question for Brandon, Virgin paid a royalty fee to the Virgin Group. I think it was, at one point, 1% of total sales, and then I think it moved up to like 1.4% and then it came down. Is that something that you're still incurring? Or is that \u2013 that's gone since the merger closed? I was never sure on that.","Peter D. Hunt - Virgin America, Inc.","Hi, Mike. This is Peter Hunt. Actually, the level is 0.7% of revenue...","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Peter D. Hunt - Virgin America, Inc.","...that we're paying for license fee. And that is still in place. So as long as we use the Virgin brand, under our existing license agreement we would be required to pay that license fee.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And, Peter, does it stay at 0.7%? Or is there some sort of revenue threshold or benchmark that changes that?","Peter D. Hunt - Virgin America, Inc.","There is a revenue threshold. It's a fairly high one, though. It won't come into play for many years, and at that threshold the revenue or the (49:47) drop to 0.5% at some point in the future. But it's like three times what the Virgin revenue is today, so it's fairly high.","Operator","Your next question comes from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Your line is open.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Brandon, I joined a little late, so apologies if you already did this. But would you break out the CASM outlook for 2017 between kind of what's happening with core CASM and then what the purchase accounting impact is?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yes, on a combined consolidated basis, so again assuming Virgin America had been in the base for the full year, CASM is going to be flat year-over-year. We have about $50 million or so of net good guy (50:37) in the base that resulted from purchase accounting, and there's a variety of things in there, some positive, some negative. And then the rest of it would be what I would call core growth including the impact of premium class, which takes out ASMs and adds some cost. But as I said in my prepared remarks, it's very accretive to the bottom line as well as the investments we're making in the onboard products. So some \u2013 I wouldn't call that inflationary growth. I would call that purposeful investment that we believe has a real payback and is good for guests.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And then on the revenue side, did you need to write down the DTL as part of the purchase accounting process? And is that going to impact Q1 RASM?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","The deferred tax liability?","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","I'm sorry. The ATL, the air traffic liability?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","We actually carried over the ATL \u2013 well, I'm going to let Chris Berry answer this. It's an accounting question.","Christopher M. Berry - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","It is an accounting question. Darryl, I'll be brief. Yes, ATL, it was fair valued, meaning there was some write-down within the ATL number. And that would carry through revenue over the next 12 months. The offset of that is there is a write-up in the value of the Elevate program, which has basically an equal offset to that revenue over the next 12 months. So you won't see a lot of revenue change as a whole for operating revenue for Virgin America on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Didora from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Brandon, I guess I have two questions on the cost side. One, I know you've been talking about the $50 million good guy from purchase accounting, but can you give us a sense for what's included in that flat CASM guide for cost synergies? And then second question around cost, we're seeing a lot more fuel efficiency, particularly on the regional side, and does this all relate to the additional E175 flying?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hi, Andrew. On the second question, I didn't quite follow it. Are you talking about non-fuel CASM or fuel CASM?","Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No. I guess the second question on the fuel CASM. We do \u2013 it seems like your fuel efficiency is increasing nicely here. And is that solely a function of the new E175 flying that you have coming on this year?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yes. No. For that flying \u2013 I mean, those are great airplanes. But for that flying, that actually is a reduction in terms of ASMs per gallon, just because the smaller gauge of those aircraft. Where you're really seeing the benefit is the exit of the 737-400s and replacement of the 900ERs, 37 more seats. Basically, they burn the same amount of fuel. It's a nice, nice, nice tailwind in terms of fuel efficiency. On the cost side \u2013 I forgot your question. What was your question?","Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","On the CASMex side, what are you assuming in terms of cost synergies in your flat guidance?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yes. I mean, we're \u2013 I'm not going to tell you exactly the number, but I will tell you that we're really pleased with the pace that we're going on realizing those cost synergies. There is the obvious stuff baked in: head count reductions, including the executive compensation that was in the base last year. But it's not just that; it's synergies that we've already realized in lots of different areas, and we'll give you more color on that at Investor Day. We're well on our way.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Crissey with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. Hey, Brandon, how do you measure the synergy results? Not right away because that's relatively doable. But how do you look at the revenue and the cost as what they would've been had you not merged, say, a year-and-a-half from now?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","I'm going to let Shane Tackett answer that question.","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","It's a great question, and there's not a perfect way to do this, but the way we've done it is we've basically pro forma-ed both companies independently for five years, and then we've pro forma-ed the combined company and what we think we can create in synergies, and we'll just re-baseline those based on some sort of revenue environment index as we go forward.","Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And so if, with us not having the benefit of your projections, assuming you're not going to release those, and I imagine you wouldn't, should we be viewing the resulting synergy in better RASM growth versus, say, the industry in terms of to measure the revenue synergies and better margins overall to maybe for the net of the revenue and cost synergies relative to where you were or where the industry was. Frankly, a year-and-a-half from now when you guys are saying that you're going to be realizing your synergies and you're right on track, how the heck are we going to have any idea that that's the case?","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Kevin, maybe I'll jump in there. Honestly I don't think you will, because a lot of things happen between now and then and I think for some of that, like network connectivity, it does get lost in the mix a little bit although we do feel pretty good about the opportunity there. A good example of that is just the statistic that we mentioned in the script, which is about 15% of the Virgin America bookings right now are coming through AS.com, (56:00) and we believe 30% of that is incremental. That's real dollars that are adding to the bottom line.","The other thing I would say is that some of the synergy benefit is of course network connectivity and things like that which will be a little harder to measure. But some of the synergy benefit comes from things like increasing the number of people that hold the credit card, that is a very tangible and quantifiable number that we can tell you \u2013 we're not going to give you specific numbers, but we're going to say are we on track or not? And we can tell you with confidence.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan McKenzie from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Oh, hey. Good morning. Thanks. Andrew, feel free to sort of re-characterize this but at least from my perspective, what we've learned from Virgin is that growth in the wrong market can cause a lot of revenue pain. And you've made it clear this year that the growth this year is going to be accretive but on the existing network how would you characterize the changes that need to be made on the Virgin side? Are there some re-deployments you're thinking about? And then just tied to this, what is Trans-Con capacity now as a percent of total flying?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Dan. I was expecting an another alliance question, so this is good. All is well there by the way. Here's what I will say, Virgin America's network I think is about 20 markets and they're all in these very large core O&Ds, and I think they've done a fantastic job. So other than looking at gage (57:34) and putting the right airplanes in the right markets, we believe it's a fantastic foundation, and we're going to continue that.","We're also going to start making some changes in the fall to start to get schedules and equipment better, but really you'll see much more in 2018. We've redefined our regions and without going into the details, our Trans-Con, I think we have like New York Trans-Con is about 10% from memory here, I'm just looking at my cheat sheet, 10%. And then you've got \u2013 we also have Pacific Northwest Trans-Con \u2013 excuse me \u2013 California Trans-Con as well. So those two together is close to 20%.","At the end of the day what we hope to do is to take the Virgin America network and then bring to there the loyalty, the network connectivity, the regional fleet, the Mainline fleet and just grow this thing. That's really what you're going to see. So the bare bones of what you see in the network that Virgin America has there is solid and they are not going to be changing materially.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Dan, to be fair, there are a handful of markets that we look at and say we can make some changes to drive better results, and I don't think we're going to say a lot more about that today but I think you will see some changes in the schedule in the next couple of months.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate that. And, Andrew, you actually did front run my next question on alliance (58:53) So I'm wondering if you can provide an update on codeshare revenue. Where are we at just given some of the changes that had to be made as a condition of the merger close? And then to what extent does the new codeshare with Japan Airlines backfill some of that lost revenue.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","I think, real quickly, Dan, not materially since we last changed. We shared that the Department of Justice was about $60 million reduction but we're going to backfill three quarters of that, so it's about $10 million to $15 million of loss. And then I think we also talked about the Delta. So at the end of the day, we are continuing to rely less and less on codeshare revenues and especially with the Virgin America network, we're backfilling that and replacing that with our own revenues. And just on JAL and lastly on our international flag partners, we are seeing significant year-over-year, and of course JAL will be new international traffic. And now with international gateways in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and even JFK, we have a great platform for international traffic growth.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Up next is Dominic Gates from Seattle Times. Your line is open.","Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times Co.","Hi. Good morning. Just following up on Helane Becker's question about fleet plans. First of all, could you just repeat, if you would, the plans for taking new craft, 737s, A320s, E175s in the coming year versus retirements. And then you talked about not taking all of the A321s that were previously planned for Virgin. Give me your thoughts on why you're doing that. The A321 is the one Airbus aircraft that other airlines are rushing to get because it's perceived as doing better than the equivalent Boeing 737. So why does the fact that you're not taking all of those indicate where you may be going in terms of what to do with the Airbus way down the line?","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Dominic, good morning. Thank you for the question. So big picture, maybe just to sort of reset a little bit. We have been proudly all Boeing for I don't know how many years, 10, 15 years we have probably all Boeing on the front of everyone of our airplanes. We're really proud of that. Flying Boeing airplanes has been fantastic for this company. That flying a single aircraft type has been fantastic for this company. So that's fact one.","Fact two is we bought Virgin America and they fly Airbus airplanes. So overnight we now are in the position where we fly both airplane types. So all that we have said is that we're going to go through a process in 2017 where we make a decision as to whether to continue to fly two airplane types, or whether to go back and fly a single airplane type again. And that process is going to take six, seven, eight, nine months, something like that. But we're going to \u2013 as any company would, we're going to go through the right process to make the right decision for everybody at Alaska and we're going to certainly talk with Boeing and Airbus as we go through that process.","You're also asking about sort of what happens in the interim, and what I would say is that the process has become a \u2013 it's a little bit more complicated because Airbus is introducing this A321 like immediately, right away. And I'll just say that we're having conversations with people that delivered the lessor and Airbus about that airplane to see if we can sort of reduce that, that's a new airplane type to Virgin America. We're having a conversation to see if we can sort of reduce that commitment to A321s or put that off a bit while we go through this process to make the right long-term decision for Air Group. And that's really all that we can say about where we are right now.","Dominic Gates - The Seattle Times Co.","And do you mind going over the numbers? What's the expectation for new deliveries this year versus retirements?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","We'll have either Brandon or Mark, but happy to do that, Dominic.","Mark G. Eliasen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Okay. Hey, Dominic. This is Mark Eliasen. I can just give you a couple of numbers here. One is that we have 54 firm Boeing airplanes on order today. We'll take 12 this year, but we have 54 total on order, which includes the MAX airplane. For the Airbus fleet, we have 10 firms on the books today that Virgin America had, and we also have another 30 that are cancelable. So that basically breaks down the ratios there.","Operator","This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Brad Tilden.","Bradley D.

My name is Jesse, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group\u2019s First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call.","Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Director of Investor Relations, Matt Grady.","Matt Grady","Thanks, Jesse. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2018 earnings call. On the call today are CEO, Brad Tilden, who will provide an overview of the business, Andrew Harrison, our Chief Commercial Officer, who'll share an update on a revenue results and outlook, and our CFO, Brandon Pedersen, will discuss our cost performance and cash flow. Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.","Earlier this morning, Alaska Air Group reported first quarter GAAP net income of $4 million. Excluding merger related costs, mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments, and a special items Air Group reported adjusted net income of $18 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.14 ahead of the first call consensus.","As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. On today\u2019s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","And now, I will turn the call over to Brad.","Brad Tilden","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. This is a very important time for Alaska's. We're getting through the most intense part of the merger and looking forward, in the near-term, to shifting our focus from executing the merger to realizing the value of it. I think it's well known to most of you that the integration is reaching a crescendo tomorrow night when we transition to a single passenger service system, or PSS.","As we sit here today, we're encouraged by what we see. We're just 16 months into the merger. And while there is always something for us to learn and improve upon, we see a tremendous amount of strength and momentum. We have a single operating certificate and a single loyalty plan. We've integrated operational control of the Boeing and Airbus fleets in Seattle, and we have new market-based agreements in place for 80% of our collectively bargained payroll.","We've also put in place new engine services agreements and other long-term contracts, that we will leverage across our flying as we move forward. We have an incredible team that's executing our cutover to a single PSS. And when that is done, the majority of our system's integration work will be behind us, enabling us to realize the benefits of this new and expanded platform.","We are encouraged by the strength we see in our core markets. Same-store RASM, including legacy Airbus markets, is positive, versus being negative last quarter. And we see positive signs in the vast majority of our new markets. When we look at new store RASM, as a percentage of same-store RASM, we see sequential improvement. In those markets where we don't see adequate improvement, our team is tuning and refining the network, adjusting frequencies, departure times, block times and day, week patterns.","Mileage Plan revenues exceeded plan by a substantial amount this quarter. The higher network relevance we now offer has made our loyalty program more attractive. And we were pleased to see the rapid growth of this program become a tailwind to our first quarter results. Guest loyalty is a key driver of synergies and, you we believe we're still in the early stages of harvesting the full potential of our combined loyalty program.","As we complete our most important integration milestones during the first half the year, our future is bright. Our platform, which is 33% bigger than it was just 16 months ago and 100% bigger than it was five years ago, maintains the same competitive advantages it always has. We maintain an 18% cost advantage against the legacy airlines. And if you look at the data, our fares are now, and historically have been, on par with the majority of LCC seats in the market.","We offer our first class product with the industry's best pitch, a great premium cabin experience and a loyalty program that our customers love and that was recently ranked Number 01 in the industry by U.S. News & World Report.","Our people have been impacted by this merger, but they are resilient and they care about the company and our future. They're running a great operation and providing outstanding service to our guests, as evidenced by them recently winning that Number 01, position in the Airline Quality Ratings. As you know, this rating is based on on-time performance, completion rate, baggage handling and customer compliance.","At Horizon, our operation is fully stabilized. The new leadership team, led by Gary Beck, hit the ground running and they have not had a single pilot staffing related cancellation in the last six months. Air Group's leadership team is simply the best in the business. They've been working their tails off and I want to publicly thank them now for the amazing things they have accomplished in 16 months.","As we optimize our combined operation and realize the natural synergies that exist, we will continue to leverage our advantages to ensure we deliver strong returns to shareholders for the new Alaska, regardless of the economic or competitive environment. As I mentioned, our integration \u2013 our entire organization has been preparing for months to ensure that our transition to a single PSS goes smoothly tomorrow night. This event will mark our shift to a single brand and customer experience everywhere our guests interact with us.","In addition, all Virgin America stations will transition to Alaskan branding, procedures and process. Many of you have asked how we're preparing for this event and what the risks are. One example of our preparation is the unique approach we designed for the cutover. Beginning last October, we required all reservations for travel after April 25 to be booked in the Alaska Reservation System. This allowed us to bleed down the reservations in the Virgin America system, and this simple step results in us having no actual conversion of customer reservations tomorrow night.","Our cutover is really more focused on training our employees and operating the Alaska system throughout our expanded network. Shane Tackett and others who are leading this effort are hear this morning and happy to address your questions during the Q&A.","PSS is the most critical milestone in our integration and it will be a key achievement for our team. I want to thank the hundreds of employees throughout our operation who are working tirelessly to get this done, especially Sandy Stelling, Rosalie Hollenbeck, Toni Freeberg and Jill Chin.","With respect to revenue, Andrew will discuss a host of new initiatives that we're working on that we'll be rolling out over the remainder of the year. In addition to the network and schedule changes I mentioned earlier, we also plan to roll out a fair segmentation platform in the late fall, which is essentially Alaska's response to the industry's basic economy fares, which are now prevalent. We're also working on a number of other initiatives which Andrew will cover.","With regard to costs, as we get through the merger, we're reenergizing our focus on productivity and proven overhead management. To ensure that the higher revenues we expect from new revenue initiatives and deal synergies flow to the bottom line. Brandon will provide more details on the cost front in a moment.","In summary, our team is executing well against the plan we laid out on last quarter's call. Our capacity will grow just 4% in 2019 to 2020, as we continue to leverage our substantial growth of the last five years. In addition, we expect that our new revenue initiatives and deal synergies combined will produce an incremental $280 million of revenue for 2019. We are absorbing substantially all of the merger-related costs increases this year.","With these profitability initiatives and with our new capital spending budget of $750 million for 2019 and 2020, we expect to produce substantial free cash flow in the next couple of years.","As I close, I'd like to again thank our employees and our leaders for doing a great job in the midst of a complex merger and for moving our integration along in record time. I could not be more excited about our future. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andrew.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks, Brad and good morning, everyone. Total revenues for the first quarter rose 5.3% to $1.8 billion on a capacity growth of 7.5%. Though, our RASM declined to 2.1%, this result was two points better than our fourth quarter performance and nearly two points better than the midpoint of our Q1 guidance. Despite significant competitive capacity in our markets, our business showed resilience.","Our outperformance, relative to guidance, was primarily driven by three things; network adjustments, growth in loyalty revenues and long hours by our talented revenue management teams. None of our outperformance came from any external industry dynamic or overly conservative estimates. Rather, it was solid execution and good old-fashioned hard work. I also want to acknowledge our frontline teams who took care of our record 10.5 million guests this quarter.","Our overall first quarter RASM performance can be categorized as follows. First same store RASM. That's RASM for all markets in operation greater than 12 months. This was up 0.5% year-over-year. This compares to same-store RASM in the fourth quarter of 2017, that was down 1.5 points. The sequential improvement came from solid demand, which was supported by a more aggressive approach to seasonal cuts, particularly in the weaker January and February period, and further fueled by growth in our loyalty program.","Mileage Plan membership and Affinity Credit Card sign-ups are tracking ahead of robust internal targets and credit card commission revenues in particular, outperformed plan. The second category, new markets or markets in operation less than one year. These markets did create a headwind, as we expected, especially during the tough winter season.","New markets, which accounted for approximately 9% of our capacity in Q1, fully accounted for our two point RASM decline. We expect these markets to perform better as we enter the seasonally stronger demand periods of Q2 and Q3 and as they continue to mature. Since we started only a handful of new markets this year, the percentage of our capacity represented by new markets is set to decline to just 3% of ASMs by Q4.","We estimate that these steps benefited Q1 results by about one point of RASM, and we effected that into our Q1 guidance, and that Q2 will be impacted by a similar amount. Given this, and the fact that both Alaskas and industry capacity growth will peak this quarter, we are guiding to a second quarter RASM range of down 2.75% to 3.75%.","As we committed at the time of our last earnings call, we've undertaken significant steps to optimize our business model to ensure we generate strong returns on invested capital, irrespective of the economic and\/or competitive environment. In fact, the current competitive landscape has only fueled a deep conviction to make the necessary changes that are within our control to generate higher unit revenues.","So let's start with the network, as the capacity planning team has been hard at work to optimize our combined platform. Starting with Q1. We became more proactive in dealing with the increase in seasonality in our network since acquiring Virgin America through day of week adjustments and fringing on lower demand days.","We also repurposed capacity that had been allocated to slot-controlled markets, namely Havana and Mexico City. We've exited Havana and returned two of our four Mexico City slots, freeing up aircraft for more productive uses. And we've also made several adjustments to the legacy Virgin America network.","First, we're announcing this morning that we've received approval from the Department of Justice and have executed an agreement with Southwest, under which Southwest will lease out 12 within perimeter slots at LaGuardia and our eight within perimeter slots at DCA. The lease, which commences this October, enables us to monetize these valuable slots, while reallocating our flying from DCA and LaGuardia into Love Field, to more strategic and profitable opportunities of the West Coast. The lease runs through 2028, at which point we have the right to reassume flying using these slots, should we choose to do so.","Second, we relocated two of our JFK slots, one each to Seattle and Santa Hose, while continuing to main robust JFK schedules from LA and San Francisco. And finally, we discontinued a couple of long haul, low yield markets, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco to Cancun, and Los Angeles to Orlando.","The point, we are making leverage network adjustment that ensure we maintain our West Coast utility while driving improvement in both our unit revenues and pretax margins. As we move into the second half of 2018 our capacity growth moderates. We now expect to grow 6.5% this a year. That's a point lower than our previous guidance.","Looking ahead to 2019, our growth rate should settle in at about 4% and become more consistent quarter-to-quarter. We also look forward to the opening of the expanded and modernized north satellite terminal, here at Sea-Tac airport, a terminal, which will be exclusive to Alaska and will house our new 15,000 square-foot rooftop lounge. We are the only domestic airline that provides paid, first-class guests complimentary access to our lounges. So, this will be a very well received by our premium travelers. ","We also expect to open our new lounge at JFK in Terminal 7 at the end of the month. We discussed last quarter how our transition to a single passenger service system will unlock our ability to begin capturing merger synergies. With the PSS transition happening tomorrow night, we now find ourselves on the threshold of this major inflection point in our integration, and one that will support meaningful improvements to our revenues.","So speaking of revenue improvements, and the ones that Brad alluded to, we've been evaluating changes to our revenue model, and I'm excited to give you more definition around these. This fall, we will introduce a new option for our guests called the Saver Fare. This low priced product will be limited to seats assigned at the rear of the aircraft and guests will board last. ","Upgrades for Elites will not be permitted and the ticket will not be changeable or cancelable. We believe this new offering will generate $100 million in annual revenues for 2019 and is incremental to merger synergies. In addition, we are implementing a series of revenue product and policy changes, effective now through June that collectively, we expect to drive another $50 million in annual revenues for the full year of 2019. These include offering exit rows for sale, introducing dynamite pricing for our six million Premium Class seats per year, leveraging new technology to better manage revenue post sale and eliminating fee waivers for changes made outside of 60 days.","We believe these changes provide guests with more options and reflects the significant increase in the value of our expanded network and product. While these initiatives will not hit their full run rate until next year, we do expect them to contribute approximately $20 million in revenue over the back half of this year. Our entire commercial organization is lined up to deliver on these initiatives as well as unlocking the substantial synergies from the combination of Alaska and Virgin.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks Andrew and good morning, everyone. Mentioned earlier, Air Group posted a first quarter adjusted net profit of $18 million or $0.14 a share. Our near breakeven results came during a time of merger integration activities, significant new market development, rising fuel prices, new labor agreements and continuing the areas of competitive pressure in our network. I want to underscore the very important message you heard in Brad's and Andrew's remarks. That is, we're not happy with our results and we're taking a number of meaningful steps to improve the profitability of our business.","Q1 CASM, ex-fuel, rose 5%, near the low end of our initial guidance. Our initial guidance, however, did not include the $9 million impact of the new agreement with our flight attendants, though we did see some costs that we initially expected in Q1 shift into future quarters that basically offset it. The impact to the flight attendant contract and the pilot contract that took effect in Q4, accounted for two-thirds of the 5% increase.","Our flight attendant merger agreement\/contract is extension is another important step toward completing the full integration of our work groups. The contract aligns compensation for all of our fabulous flight attendants and gives us clean line of sight to achieving an integrated seniority list later this year. It also sharpens our labor cost visibility. As Brad mentioned, we now have 80% of our payroll that is represented by a CBA, under contract through April of 2020.","We now expect our full year unit cost to be up about 3.5%. The increase versus prior guidance is largely explained by the roughly $30 million impact of the new flight attendant deal. The 1% reduction in capacity growth announced today does put upward pressure on costs, but our FP&A team has done a good job of identifying volume-related cost and pulling those out of divisional budgets. And we should be able to absorb a portion of the fixed cost by creating favorable variances elsewhere.","For example, we accelerated planned post PSS headcount reductions from the end of this year to July 31. As a result, we only have two-tenth of a point of additional CASM pressure on a full percentage point of capacity reduction. In general, I'm seeing examples of great back to basics cost management across much of the company. The credit not \u2013 goes not only to our leaders, but also to our frontline employees from raising the need for productivity gains.","Our airports and maintenance teams both get a shout out, both are tracking very well on productivity metrics year-to-date. We expect Q2 non-fuel cost to be up 4.5% on 8.5% growth. The new market-based contracts with pilots and flight attendants and higher maintenance cost arising from the power by the hour deal we signed last fall are large drivers of the increase.","Touching on fuel, per gallon cost were up 20% and total economic fuel expense rose 29% or $93 million representing a significant margin headwind. Our fuel efficient fleet is saving us money. Our mainline fuel efficiency defined as ASMs per gallon, increased 1.5% this quarter over Q1 of last year. If we add last year's fuel efficiency producing current ASMs, our Q1 mainline fuel costs would have been $5 million higher.","In addition, our WTI call options reduced our economic fuel cost by another $5 million this quarter. With WTI crude now at $68 a barrel, we're fortunate to have hedges in place covering 47% of planned consumption for the remainder of the year, with an average strike price of $64 a barrel.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.5 million of cash. Total cash flow from operations was $315 million, ex merger-related costs, which are actually pretty modest at this point. Andrew mentioned the strength of our loyalty program and affinity card and we're seeing it in cash flows as well. Our Q1 affinity card cash inflows nicely beat both Q1 of last year and our budget.","Meanwhile, net CapEx for the quarter was $230 million, resulting in about $75 million of free cash flow, again, ex integration costs. Improving our free cash flow generation was a major reason we reduced planned CapEx to $1 billion this year and $750 million in each, 2019 and 2020. To accomplish our CapEx objectives, our fleet team restructured our three-year delivery skyline during the quarter. Kudos to them, and a big thanks to Boeing and our other partners for working with us.","Our balance sheet continues to get stronger, with total on balance sheet debt declining another $120 million since year-end. With leases, our quarter end adjusted debt-to-cap stands at 53%, flat with year-end after adjusting for the book equity impact of adopting the new revenue accounting standard. We still expect to reduce on-balance sheet debt further over the course of the year and for debt-to-cap to improve to 50% by year-end. We remain committed to further improving our conservative investment-grade balance sheet.","During Q1, we returned $51 million to shareholders via $39 million in dividends and $12 million in share repurchases. We still expect to repurchase $50 million of our stock this year, which, when combined with the dividend, will result in about $200 million return to shareholders. We have a lot of work to do to improve our profitability. Today you've heard about important revenue initiatives that should boost our top line. The eminent PSS cutover will unlock revenue synergies.","We're refining the network and have a multiyear capacity plan that makes sense for our larger platform. We're going to aggressively control costs and we've lowered capital spending. This won't be easy. Few things in this industry are. But if we deliver on these plans, we'll generate much higher free cash flow in 2019 and 2020 and should have the ability to return cash to shareholders in the amounts that approach levels not seen since 2015.","And with that, let's go to your questions, and then on to PSS cutover.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jamie Baker of JPMorgan. Jamie, from everyone at Alaska Airlines, happy 50th birthday this week. Please go ahead.","Brad Tilden","Is Jamie there?","Jamie Baker","We are having a lot of troubles with our phones here. Can you hear me?","Brad Tilden","Yes, Jamie, happy birthday.","Jamie Baker","Okay, yes. Thank you. What do you think is driving the momentum in loyalty? I mean, you mentioned that it came in ahead of expectations. I'm curious if that speaks merely to having a conservative forecast or, I don't know, do you have an estimate as to how many Virgin frequent flyer members have signed up for Alaska cards? I\u2019m just trying to gauge whether we're closer to the start or the finish in terms of current loyalty momentum. Anymore color on that?","Andrew Harrison","Jamie, hi, it\u2019s Andrew. I think the best way to answer that question really without going into too much detail is, what we're seeing and what we're sensing is that what we believed from day one is that the new combined network, our product, our fare structure, our people, everything about us that makes us so strong in the Pacific Northwest, we're seeing that the same people in California are very much sensing that and seeing that. And this is something different, something new for them. And it's very exciting. My personal belief is that this is just going to continue to get stronger and stronger as we continue to roll out our product.","Jamie Baker","Okay, appreciate that. And second, on saver fares, and I guess, this is a small point. But it sounds like basic economy to me. And I think consumers increasingly know what basic economy means. I'm just curious about the logic behind not calling it what most people are used to. Is there a trademark issue or something?","Andrew Harrison","I don't know. I mean basic economy \u2013 I mean, I will tell you one thing that is very significantly different, which is really in the core of our brand, as when you book on Alaska Airlines, you get a seat assignment. And while that is not always the case today, if our flights are full but when you book the saver fare, you will get a seat assignment. I think that's extremely important to people. It's very important to our guests. And if you look across the structure of basic, Jamie, people have different rules and policies around it. And I think our structure here is one that I think meets the middle ground.","Jamie Baker","Okay, fair enough. Thanks so much.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Your next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Savi Syth","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Brandon Pedersen","Good morning.","Savi Syth","Just on the \u2013 obviously, a lot going on yet even after kind of the PSS cutover. Could you remind me again about the, kind of the integration synergy, the timing of the rollout of those synergies, and when we will start to kind of see them as you go through this year and next year?","Shane Tackett","Hi, Savi. This is Shane Tackett. Yes, just as by the numbers, we had \u2013 in 2017, I think we quoted $35 million of synergies. In 2018, we've got $69 million. By 2019, we go to $195 million. And then ramp from there is to $300 million at the end of 2021. And we're basically on track for all of those, most of these are actually trackable. They are either cost or things that have to do with props leading or the interior configuration of the Airbus cabins, loyalty growth, cargo revenues. We can track all of those pretty closely. And we're feeling good about where all of that at right now and sort of unlocking this stuff now that PSS is almost behind us.","Savi Syth","Got it. And then just with the new, if I might follow up kind of \u2013 bit of Jamie's question. On the new product, is that coming out in fall? Just any color around like the rollout if there is \u2013 just how the rollout might happen. I'm guessing if it comes out in the fall, it starts showing up two months later in the fare environment is that\u2026","Brandon Pedersen","Yes, that\u2019s correct, Savi. Essentially, we'll start roll out in the fall. We'll be smart about it and then sort of really beginning, January. And Shane and the team are working right now on the whole distribution and e-commerce side, which I'm actually really excited about. I think the industry has been working on this for a few years. And the beauty is we have hindsight here and looking at how everyone has done it and deciding on how we want to do it.","Savi Syth","Make sense. All right, thank you.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks, Savi.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Mike Linenberg","Hey, everybody. Just couple of questions here, Andrew, back, you were talking about the leasing of the gates to Southwest, that LaGuardia, and DCA and you through Love Field into that. Now you just I guess, what \u2013 is it just from those two airports today, you fly only nonstop to Love Field, is that what that is? Is that what you were referencing?","Andrew Harrison","That\u2019s right, Mike. Both of those sort of within-perimeter slots, if you will. So we can only really fly as far as sort of Love Field or that part of the geography. So that's where we fly that today. And of course, we'll be discontinuing that come October.","Mike Linenberg","The money that you'll get from Southwest \u2013 the lease of the, I guess, the gates and the slots. Is that, I mean, is that more of a rounding error or is that something like $5 million, $10 million per year? I'm not \u2013 how should we think?","Andrew Harrison","You know, obviously, I can't comment on the magnitude. That's all privy to Southwest and Alaska. But what I will tell you is that being able to monetize important slots and move flying around and maintain our asset base for the future is really important for us.","Brad Tilden","And Mike, probably more important than the lease payments is just getting our network configured the way we want to have it configured. Our whole idea was to \u2013 is to build pockets of strength. You hear us talk about loyalty all the time and we have fantastic loyalty in the Northwest and we want to push this into California. And then fly, as folks out of those cities. Flying from Dallas Love Field to both LaGuardia and Reagan National, at this point in the company's history, was not strategic. And so we're happy to do this transaction, so that we can line up our aircraft and our assets with our strategies.","Mike Linenberg","And then just Brad on that line about getting the network right, I mean, you did mention earlier in the call that with Horizon the pilot situation is now under control. And yet when I look at some of the route cancellations over the last, like call three to six months, there have been a lot of E175, longer-haul routes out of Seattle and Portland that have been cut. Is that \u2013 when I saw that, I thought that, that was either a combination of pilots and under-performance? But it sounds like it\u2019s not pilots at all. It\u2019s more about performance in getting the network right. Is that the right interpretation of those cuts?","Andrew Harrison","Yes, Mike. This is Andrew. That\u2019s exactly right. And I think we\u2019ve had a lot of mid cuts of rounds stuff out of Portland just we\u2019ve looked at that. And with rising fuel, we\u2019ve decided to make changes.","Mike Linenberg","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Brad Tilden","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Darryl Genovesi from UBS. Your line is open.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the time. Andrew, you gave us some color on evolution, the revenue model. I guess, I was wondering more about this year. I think back at year-end Investor Day, the last one that you had referred to, I think, incremental of $35 million or so. That was supposed to come through from the new premium product. Are you currently realizing that? Is that something that ramps up more in the second half? I think the process is fully available. Just wondering how the revenue generation is going.","Andrew Harrison","That\u2019s correct. In fact Shane the mastermind here, I\u2019ll let him give some color on that.","Shane Tackett","Yes, Darryl. I think you\u2019re referring to Premium Class, which we\u2019ve finally got fully rolled out with all of our Boeing fleet reconfigured earlier this year. It\u2019s been phenomenal. We started with kind of a three \u2013 an easy sort of price strategy, just three or four price for the entire country. We\u2019re now moving price around based on demand and we\u2019re well ahead of all of our internal sort of expectations announcement. It\u2019s been a phenomenal product for us.","Darryl Genovesi","So you\u2019re ahead relative to the $35 million number?","Shane Tackett","Yes.","Darryl Genovesi","Well, and then, Brandon, on the non-op. I don\u2019t think you guided it for the full year. But you\u2019re about $40 million in the first half. Should we think about the second half as being a similar number?","Brad Tilden","I think of it as being slightly less than that. We\u2019re probably tracking to be, if I have to guess, at this point, probably $16 million a quarter in Q3, Q4.","Darryl Genovesi","Well, thanks very much guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Dan McKenzie","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Andrew, I believe the statistic is that 20% of the revenue is tied to business travel spend. And so first, what does an average business fare look like on Alaska? And how much has it deteriorated following the introduction of basic economy by the big three? I\u2019m just trying to get some perspective on how this is going to reconcile with the $100 million estimate that you\u2019ve given for saver fares and the premium economy?","Andrew Harrison","Dan, I might \u2013 if Shane has any commentary on closing. Here\u2019s what I would say and I\u2019m going to probably provide more color. As you may have heard, we have a new Vice President of Sales, David Oppenheim. And it\u2019s just been amazing working with him and looking at our sales structure, where it\u2019s all coming from, our contracts and of course, of the new network. What I will basically says is that, I am very optimistic about where we can go with sales. Specifically to your question, I\u2019ll let Shane comment on some of the closing stuff. But I just see upside on the sales side.","Shane Tackett","Yes. On closing fares, I think, we\u2019ve been watching these for the last several quarters. It is \u2013 there are some that they\u2019re sort of oddly low, just relative to what you would expect. We\u2019ve had really good demand generally across the network. I think everybody\u2019s kind of seen that. We\u2019ve had really good demand across all APs. There\u2019s been no fallout on the business side. So we would anticipate some of the fares on the low to data get to more normalized levels over time.","But the real focus we\u2019ve had is on things that we can control. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s more important to us to really focus on these new revenue initiatives that sort of don\u2019t depend on the economic or competitive backdrop.","Dan McKenzie","Got it. And then the down 25% to 30% in inter-California and transcon, how is that trending? Just relative to the question.","Shane Tackett","Sorry, Dan. Just what\u2019s the \u2013 the 25% to 30% is from?","Dan McKenzie","Yes. You had mentioned in the last earnings call that inter-California and transcon, walk up fares were down 25% to 30%. I\u2019m just trying to get some perspective on how those have inflected.","Brad Tilden","Yes. That\u2019s good. Some of they\u2019re still \u2013 it\u2019s moving around quite a bit honestly market by market. And I don\u2019t recall the specific markets we were quoting before. But there are some that are still depressed California and transcon and others that have sort of rebounded and come back. So it\u2019s pretty dynamic on the West Coast, just from a pricing standpoint today.","Andrew Harrison","But I would say that, it\u2019s basically not any worse. But if anything, it\u2019s actually better than when we spoke in the last quarter. And again, as we move into the second and third quarter, I mean the stronger demand periods, I think we\u2019ll continue to see the dynamic evolve one way or the other.","Dan McKenzie","Got it. And then just a quick second housecleaning question here. Where we in terms of reconfiguring the Airbus fleet? How many planes do expect to have done in the second quarter and the third quarter? What\u2019s the pace of that rollout?","Shane Tackett","Dan, this is Shane again. We start in September of 2018, we\u2019ll get our first aircraft reconfigured. And we\u2019re going to produce at something like five a month. Although, some are three, some are seven. So we\u2019ll have about half of the fleet done by the summer of 2019. We\u2019ll have the whole fleet done by the end of year 2019. It\u2019s pretty ratable how we get through them. There is 70 aircraft to go through. So once we get going, it\u2019s about five a month.","Dan McKenzie","Okay. Thanks guys.","Shane Tackett","Thank you.","Brad Tilden","Thanks Dan.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi, Good morning, gentleman.","Brad Tilden","Good morning, Rajeev.","Rajeev Lalwani","Brad actually a question for you. On the last call and this call too, you talked about just responding to the challenges associated with the Virgin deal and operations for [indiscernible]. Do you feel like you\u2019ve made significant progress? And have line of sight that some of the stuff is behind you? And that you can maybe start beating some of the targets that you\u2019ve laid out ahead of you here?","Brad Tilden","Thanks for the question, Rajeev. I certainly do. I will say that mergers are big deals. And it\u2019s \u2013 you bite up a lot. And I think anyone that\u2019s been through a merger would tell you that. But if you look at us today, we\u2019re 16 months into it. The labor, the cultural side of it is very, very important. And we\u2019ve got more work to do. But we do have 85% of our collectively bargained payroll. That\u2019s got new market-based agreements. And that\u2019s a great accomplishment. It sets us up to get integrated seniority list which sets up to sort of get the cultural stuff settled and moving forward.","Systems, tomorrow night is a huge night. As you know, many, many systems cut over at the beginning of the year. But with PSS behind us, that\u2019s a huge accomplishment. The loyalty stuff, all of the decisions with outside deliveries of airplane, receiving brand, onboard service all of that t stuff is done. And we\u2019re now really in a position to begin to leverage it. So I think the fares we\u2019ve shared are the \u2013 as of this moment, we think we\u2019re 65% or 70% of the way through the merger. By the end of this quarter, by June 30, we think we\u2019ll be 85% of our way through the merger.","And last, just to really focus on taking advantage of this incredible network and incredible product that we do have. So, yes, I think we are in a really good position today. I appreciate the question.","Rajeev Lalwani","Yes. Got it. Andrew or Shane a question for you. Just on the competitive headwinds that you\u2019ve been seeing on capacity or pricing, what are you embedding in your 2Q RASM as far as the \u2013 associated with it? Obviously I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what the tailwind could be as we move forward. And then just on the tailwind in some of the development markets you were talking about, as far as how that\u2019s improving. What\u2019s the opportunity there from a RASM perspective? If you can hopefully provide it.","Brad Tilden","Yes, Rajeev. I\u2019ll take a crack at this. Just, as Andrew noted on the script, and I\u2019ll get to the pricing question. But the entire reduction in unit revenues for Q1 really was from new market. So I think the same stores have been very strong and resilient [indiscernible]. I think the real question, and I don\u2019t know that \u2013 we do have a view on how much sort of the net total of competition and growth and pricing is impacting us. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll break all of that down. But the real question for Q2 for us will be closing pricing. I think that\u2019s what makes \u2013 sometimes these quotes are hard to call because we don\u2019t know until we get there.","But right now, as we look at Q2, we see fares are sort of what we would expect them to be. And especially, as we get into June and higher demand months, they look to be holding up right now.","Andrew Harrison","The other thing I will add is, as I shared in my prepared remarks is that the second quarter looks to be the high watermark obviously of out growth but also industry capacity growth. And I think as we move into three and four unless the world changes dramatically, you\u2019re going to see a declining or a tailwind, if you will, as it relates to those two key factors.","Rajeev Lalwani","Excellent. Sorry, on the development markets, can you guys provide a number as to what the hit was in 1Q or which you are expecting in 2Q?","Brad Tilden","Andrew, had mentioned this in the script. He quoted the entire 2.1% revenue reduction in Q1 was really the new market impact.","Rajeev Lalwani","Got it. Very helpful. Thank you guys.","Brad Tilden","Thanks, Rajeev.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Hunter Keay","Hey, everybody, how you\u2019re doing?","Brad Tilden","Hey, Hunter.","Hunter Keay","I\u2019m sorry. Can you just tell us the Southwest deal again? Just lay it out for me one more time, I want to make sure I get it right. And then does it require regulatory approval particularly given what the DOJ said about Love Field when they approved your merger?","Brad Tilden","So, Hunter, it does require regulatory approval and we have that. We did have to take this to the justice department and we did have that approval. It is a done deal. It\u2019s 20 slots from Dallas, Love Field, to both LaGuardia and Reagan National Airport. And their 10-year lease is 2018. They go through 2020, at which point they come back to Alaska. There is a provision with a couple of the payers, that if they were to become outside the parameter slots during this 10-year period, they could come back \u2013 Alaska could get those slots back. So those are the basic provisions.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Cool. And then as you consider \u2013 Andrew, I think you are the one that mention your work around \u2013 with Shane and some distribution stuff and e-commerce, but as you consider the new products segment here with Sabre \u2013 Sabre. Well actually this is a Sabre question with Sabre. Are you going to be in a position to where you might be able to push for a partial content agreement the next time your GDS contract is up to really drive home some customization and some ability to keep some of your content into the channels that you think is best for Alaska going forward?","Shane Tackett","That\u2019s an excellent question. Honestly one we\u2019ve really spent a lot of amount just with everything else going on. Content, obviously, is a big, big deal to us into the GDS, I imagine, it will be front and center and sort of future negotiations with them. Just so you know, we got a pretty long-term agreement with most of our GDS providers as we sit here today. So this would be, outside of a couple of years in the future if we were able to that.","Hunter Keay","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks Shane.","Shane Tackett","Thanks, Hunter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Helane Becker of Cowen. Your line is open.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much operator. Hi and thank you very much for the time. So my first question is as you think about the capacity adjustments that you made this year, when you go forward into fourth quarter and first quarter of next year, can we expect that there would be more seasonality in the route network and therefore, more seasonality or more adjustments and capacity or are you happy with kind of the changes you made this year.","Andrew Harrison","Hi, it\u2019s Andrew. I think we\u2019re still working through the seasonality. We\u2019re currently working on the fall schedule and were making additional adjustments there. And probably some final requirements so I think sort of over the back half into early 2019 the other thing I will share with you is, Ben Minicucci our President and myself and our teams are working extremely closely together to align our capacity adjustments with their staffing and how their work with us to make sure that this is very efficient and highly productive adjusting to our network.","Brad Tilden","But Helane, I do think we\u2019re in a world where getting that capacity exactly right this is important than it\u2019s ever been. So the stuff that we\u2019ve mentioned about the day week adjustments the last light on Wednesday night or the last night on a Saturday night making those requirements is as important today in this revenue environment as it\u2019s ever been and it\u2019s we\u2019ll be spending a lot of energy on going forward.","Helane Becker","Okay. And then just my follow-up question, last time you talk a little bit about construction and at SeaTac and the limitations at the airport there because congestion. Can you just update us on how that\u2019s going? And if capacity has been kind of adjusted, so that you don\u2019t have the delays that you had in the past and what\u2019s going on with cost associated with that airport. Thank you.","Ben Minicucci","Good morning, Helane it\u2019s Ben. Yes, Seattle, I will say Seattle is full, we have got gate constraints, we have got air space constraints. I will tell you it\u2019s not uncommon to see 20 airplanes lined up for takeoff at peak times of the day. So taxi times have gone up. So cost at SeaTac to operate have gone up. SeaTac is full; there is construction to create hard stand positions to help during the situation. But there\u2019s no doubt costs are going to up in SeaTac to operate at this airport.","Helane Becker","Right. But what are you doing to mitigate that, I guess that\u2019s really my question?","Ben Minicucci","In terms of cost or operations?","Helane Becker","Well, maybe both of them.","Ben Minicucci","Well on operation side, so the taxi times are showing up 60% to 70%, the costs go up, because there are now part of block time so you\u2019ve got to add that time at the block time so as you increase block times the cost to operate that market goes up. So, what you see is, the adjustments of block times and ground times actually go up. And of course the investments that you make in the airport get translated in rates and charges so.","Andrew Harrison","Helane, this is Andrew, one thing I will, since the last quarter I believe is that we now have at least, the SeaTac which was a big deal five-year term, in that lease, it\u2019s very clear on how many companies gets the ports will be taking back over each of the next five years which didn\u2019t exist before, so we have a real sort of line of sight to the infrastructure and where it is all going and then again to Ben\u2019s comments it gives us better ability to manage our operation going forward to be increasingly efficient over the time.","Helane Becker","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Thanks gentlemen, thank you for the time.","Ben Minicucci","Thanks Helane","Andrew Harrison","Thanks Helane","Operator","Your next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Your line is open.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hey, thanks. Good morning.","Andrew Harrison","Duane.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Andrew, as you\u2019ve had more time to study the Virgin network from an optimization perspective what were some of the things they did from a planning perspective specifically with respect to seasonality that you see room to continue to improve from here?","Andrew Harrison","Yes, I mean you\u2019ve got to give Virgin America a lot of credit, just given their size and the markets, and I really didn\u2019t have a lot of opportunity to sort of do any seasonality quite frankly. I mean they rent six flights a day JFK, Los Angeles, a lot of the year. And so I think with the permutations and combinations of our network in connecting and our new markets, and even connections beyond part and half. I think there is a real opportunity to reduce the seasonality, going forward and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, you see that with moving slots around, and we might be doing that directly.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks. And just to stay with you with respect to the series of revenue initiatives that you talked about, exit rows, dynamic pricing, fee waivers, et cetera. I think you threw out $20 million number for the back half but obviously not all of those things get switched on day one. So how would you think about those combined on an annual basis? And thanks for taking the questions.","Andrew Harrison","Again, on an annual run rate, 2019 the saver fare was about $100 million and the ones you just mentioned, we\u2019ve put out about $50 million run rate at 2019.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.","Joseph DeNardi","Yes. Thank you. Brandon or Andrew you guys made a change to the revenue side of your income statement. I\u2019m wondering if you could just spend a minute or two just talking about what is in Mileage Plan and other revenue, what it represents. And then what \u2013 why you chose to break that? Why do you think it\u2019s important? Thank you.","Brandon Pedersen","Yes, good morning it\u2019s Brandon, I\u2019ll take that one. So the Mileage Plan in other line has two things basically, one is the commission revenue that we earn when we sell miles to the banks, some might call it the marketing element, which is actually most of them in that line. And then the other is the net benefit if you will, having our members earn and excuse me \u2013 redeem for travel on other airlines minus the settlement costs that we pay to those other airlines that\u2019s what that.","In terms of the presentation, I would love to take more credit than work, but probably don\u2019t actually deserve that much. We had always talked about that number in the footnotes and what we did Chris and his team decided to move that to the base of balance sheet and I think it makes sense. As you\u2019ve been pointing out it\u2019s a very important part of the business and we wanted to give it a little more visibility given its magnitude.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. And then Brandon just another one for you on CASMex next year, can you just remind us what the goal is, with the 4% capacity growth is it down, is it flat and kind of how realistic are those targets at this point?","Brandon Pedersen","Yes, I think if you go back to last quarter\u2019s call, we said we had a planning mindset of costs having to come or be flat to slightly down. It wasn't guidance but it was directionally where we thought we needed to go. I think if you look at our cost over the last couple of years, there's been some step changes in the cost structure. As we look at it, we have I think a lot of opportunities to do things with the cost structure.","We are actively working, 2018 also we haven't even gotten to the point of thinking about the 2019 budget but what I will tell you is that there's been a fair amount of energy already thinking about initiatives that we are going to undertake this year so that we can really make sure to keep cost and focus going into next. And perhaps, we are mindful of the fact, costs have been a really big part of this company\u2019s success, we are focused not only on the year-over-year change but on the absolute advantage we continue to maintain against our legacy competitors.","Joseph DeNardi","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Crissey with Citi. Your line is open.","Kevin Crissey","Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the time. Maybe for Andrew, I wanted to talk about the $100 saver fare contribution, and maybe what assumptions go in there. I know you probably have limitations as to how you can describe it, but working in a general sense then maybe what assumptions get you to the 100 million percent of markets that's rolled out, how competition responds to it. Generally, I think the numbers that have been thrown out by other airlines haven't remotely been achieved at least in my opinion. So I want to understand what assumptions you've made in your $100 million? Thank you.","Shane Tackett","Yes, thanks Kevin. It\u2019s Shane. I might not get into all of the specifics but I think you've got the variables right, we're sort of assuming a large percentage of the network and a good number of the fair classes would have this product attached to it. We probably wouldn't \u2013 I just if \u2013 I don't know what other people are seeing in terms of actual sellout rates, we know the numbers that are quoted, we're probably less than that, because we don't have as much business exposure. So we haven't assumed a level that we've sort of heard others quote.","Kevin Crissey","Okay. Thank you.","Brad Tilden","It is fair to say competitively, this is in the marketplace today. So I don't think we expect a lot of incremental reaction to this. This is actually we are in the market place today and we are coming up with a product that is competitive with what other were offered already.","Andrew Harrison","Yes, that\u2019s entirely correct, yes.","Kevin Crissey","Okay, thank you. And what was your capacity growth in those same-store markets, if your RASM was up 0.5%, what capacity growth was in those same-store markets?","Andrew Harrison","I think same-store was, I think, down.","Brandon Pedersen","Slightly, we are basically flat, most of our growth is entirely in new markets\u2026","Kevin Crissey","Okay. Yes, I'm just trying to reconcile flat capacity and 0.5% RASM has strong demand that's kind of where that comes from?","Andrew Harrison","Can you repeat that?","Kevin Crissey","You've indicated that you have strong demand in your core \u2013 kind of same-store and that the weakness comes from the growth markets, but if you've got flat capacity in just 0.5% RASM in those markets that doesn't reconcile terribly well.","Brandon Pedersen","Kevin, I mean, the number is \u2013 the flat is really the Alaska capacity growth, we did have as you know significant competitive capacity in many other same-store markets, and that peaks in Q2 and then it starts to abate as we get to the second half of the year.","Kevin Crissey","Ok, thanks for that. I appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Susan Donofrio with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.","Susan Donofrio","Yes, good morning gentlemen.","Brandon Pedersen","Good morning.","Susan Donofrio","Question on sales by channels, looks like there's been a nice ramp-up, if you look at direct to customer, 55% to 62% year-end 2017, I'm assuming given this strength of loyalty program, you could increase that even more and I'm just wondering if you're seeing that still and is there kind of a target that you're thinking of?","Shane Tackett","Susan, this is Shane. Yes, we've actually been very happy with the direct sales that we've had through mostly alaskaair.com and certainly our mobile app as well. It's I think also just given that we were starting to migrate reservations off of the virginamerica.com website on to ours, we didn't know exactly, how we would do getting all of those over but we basically increased our direct sales down in California as well. So we're feeling super good about it 60% to 65% we see our number through \u2013 in that range pretty typically, it\u2019s a little hard to \u2013 just because of how business folks by their fares through agencies. But we continue to see some opportunity as Meda's coming and most of the Meda booking has ultimately ended up as direct bookings on air.com. So it certainly could go up from here and end up, we're ultimately focused on driving it if we can.","Susan Donofrio","Great, thank you.","Benito Minicucci","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey good afternoon and good morning everyone thank you for getting me on the call. So Brad, if I could just ask, in prior quarters I think the perception was that the core Virgin network was maybe facing some commercial challenges. And now that you're saying that same store sales are seeing positive inflection on unit revenue. Can you just talk about what has maybe changed since a quarter or two ago is it demand competition or internal merger related activities that you guys are managing better?","Brad Tilden","Brandon, I just think markets are dynamic. The stuff is moving around. I think when Alaska bought Virgin America and then followed up with 44 new routes or something like that and in 2017 a lots of others added a lot of capacity as well. I do think the capacity is getting to a more appropriate level given the amount of demand that's in the market, I also think as Andrew has talked about, I think that was the reaction to what Alaska brings has been extraordinary, we bring a fantastic loyalty program, amazing operation performance, great folks and we bring low fares. We've got a differentiated experience with fares that did match \u2013 basically they matched the majority of the LCC seats in the market.","So I think as market places move around a little bit and I personally think things are settling down and I also think that customers are recognizing and appreciating the difference that Alaska brings.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay, appreciate that. And then quickly and a follow-up for Andrew, with your 2Q RASM guide down about 3% at the midpoint, I think you said that you can attribute the full 2 point decline in 1Q to new markets. Is there something else impacting the comp there? Is that Easter holiday placement or should we be thinking that new markets could actually have a bigger drag on 2Q, than they did in the first quarter?","Andrew Harrison ","I mean \u2013 there was you know an extra point of strength in the first quarter, so that comes out in the second quarter, so second quarter we have headwind of about a point. If anything new markets, if you just look at the nature of what we are serving, and they're pretty much all started basically in the third quarter.","We started 20 new markets in one quarter these are all now coming into the demand strength period and the reality is that our RM team, our network, our marketing, all the levers and all the systems that we've been building together are starting to really take up steam. So, I personally just see continued maturity and strength as we continue to go forward with these new markets.","Brandon Oglenski","Thanks for the clarification.","Operator","Your last question comes from Adam Hackel with Imperial. Your line is open.","Adam Hackel","Hey guys thanks for squeezing me in here. Couple of quick questions, Just wondering sort of the Silicon Valley crowd, how have they taken to you guys? And, is that what is driving the strength on sort of sign-ups on the credit card side of things on the loyalty side?","Andrew Harrison","I think given that getting into details, we're seeing I mean Silicon Valley we've been there a long, long time but we have been very much a big part of that community, but I will tell you that the loyalty and other aspects are across all aspects, not just saying one particular area.","Adam Hackel","Okay, great and then just last one from, just wondering and I'm kind of off peak period a little bit. One of your peers talked about actually adding some capacity on the off-peak, towards the back of the year, I presume that's probably the kind of post loyalty period. We were also talking about Southwest, talk about some weakness they saw in the first quarter in the off-peak side. I was wondering as to how that came in for you guys in the first quarter and how should we be thinking about that going forward Thank you?","Andrew Harrison","I think if I understand your question it's really coming back for us to seasonality, the peaks are stronger and shoulders are a little softer, and we were very proactive late in the fourth quarter making significant adjustments. So, I think in general, with the industry capacity as it sits today, the shoulder over the top period even more difficult than the historically.","Adam Hackel","Great, thank you guys.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks, Adam.","Operator","That's all the time that we have for questions today with that I'll turn the call back to Brad Tilden","Brad Tilden","All right, thanks operator, thanks everybody for choosing in today, we look forward to talking to you at the end of the second quarter.

Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for analysts and journalists. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Investor Relations, Lavanya Sareen.","Lavanya Sareen - Managing Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Sally, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Alaska Air Group's second quarter 2016 earnings call.","On the call today, our CEO, Brad Tilden will provide an overview of the business and share our progress on the proposed acquisition of Virgin America. Our Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Harrison will share revenue results for the quarter, followed by Brandon Pedersen, our CFO, who will discuss our financial results, capital allocation plans and outlook for the second half of 2016. Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.","As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings.","We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","In addition, today's call may be deemed a solicitation in respect of Alaska Air Group's contemplated acquisition of Virgin America. The information discussed today is qualified in its entirety. The Virgin America's definitive proxy statement that was filed with the SEC on June 20, along with other relevant solicitation materials, which are all available on Virgin America's Inventor Relations page at ir.virginamerica.com.","And now, that I have complied with our GC's request in completeness, we will move to the results. This morning Alaska Air Group reported a second quarter GAAP net profit of $260 million. Excluding the $6 million impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio and a $9 million impact associated with merger-related costs, Air Group recorded a record adjusted net income of $263 million, up 14%. Earnings per share grew by 20% to $2.12 per share.","Additional information about cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging, capital expenditures and other items can be found in our Investor Update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Brad.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman","Thanks, Lavanya, and good morning, everybody. As we progress through 2016 and look forward to the second half of the year, we know that our investors have a lot on their minds and the equity market certainly reflect that.","As you know, we try to stay focused and concentrate our efforts here on building a fundamentally good business. As we look ahead, we feel very good about our underlying business and all of us here are very excited about the future.","The fundamentals of our business are strong. We are running a great airline and we believe the merger with Virgin America is going to create a very strong airline with reach across the entire country and with real strength in originating traffic up and down the West Coast.","I'll start off today by talking about the underlying business and then share an update on the merger. First, we're operating safely and on time. Our ops folks are doing an outstanding job and I want to thank them. 88.7% of our flights arrived on time in the second quarter and we did this with much less block times than the average airline, which is a credit to how efficient and consistent we are on the ground. We expect this on-time performance will lead the six largest domestic airlines. We also completed 99.8% of our flights in the second quarter, canceling on average only one mainline flight per day.","Second, our employees are taking great care of our customers. We spent a lot of time with our frontline employees building alignment and talking with them about the sort of airline we want to be for our customers. We're seeing substantial evidence that these investments are paying off. Our customer satisfaction scores, which have been on a seven-year or eight-year run continue to improve. In fact, our score for the second quarter was the highest second quarter score ever.","And as you know, we also won our ninth consecutive J.D. Power award for customer service during the quarter. We earned the highest score of any airline included in the survey in each of the seven areas measured, including a move from fourth place to first place for in-flight service, which reflects investments we've made in food and beverage service, in-flight entertainment, seating, seat power and bins. This award is fantastic recognition for our employees and I want to congratulate them and thank them for everything they are doing to make Alaska stand out in the eyes of our customers.","Our model is based on building preference for our airline. We built this preference with on-time operations, fantastic customer service and, of course, low fares. This model has worked not only in the last couple of years, but in the last 15 years to 20 years.","Since the first quarter of 2010, we've launched 100 new markets and we've outpaced industry revenue growth by a factor of 3, this in the midst of one of the bigger competitive incursions this industry has seen in years. This growth would not have been possible without our mentality of continually reducing cost, which allows us to offer customers low fares while still maintaining industry-leading margins.","Brandon is going to share more detail in a moment on what the compounding effect of cost reductions since 2008 has meant to our financial performance. But to give you a sense of how powerful a low cost structure is, even if we adjusted our fuel prices to $2 a gallon, markets representing 97% of our revenue for the last 12 months would still be profitable and it's important to note that this is done with a full allocation of all costs. This model is also delivering returns that are consistently in excess of our cost of capital. In fact, our trailing 12-month ROIC of 25.9% puts us in the top 10% of all S&P 500 companies.","Our successful growth shows that providing customers with a high-value experience and low fares is a winning formula, especially in the upper-end leisure and business segments, or what we call the leisure market. This is a great platform for our future. Combining our network, which has strength in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, with Virgin America's strength in California, we will be a very strong airline with strength up and down the West Coast and, of course, we will have national reach.","For example, in the future, we will have 25 flights a day to New York City from seven West Coast airports and 10 flights a day to Boston from five West Coast airports. We also see the increased choice and competition the merger will provide as fundamentally good for consumers.","Speaking of bringing the two companies together, I want to share a few thoughts around timing and the integration process. First, timing. We have an agreement in place with the Justice Department concerning the timing of their review and we are forecasting the close will occur in the fourth quarter. When the deal closes, Virgin America will operate as a subsidiary of Alaska Air Group until we achieve a single-operating certificate, which we expect in the first quarter of 2018.","We are committed to making this a very successful integration. During the post-close transition period, Ben will be the CEO of Virgin America in addition to his role as President and COO of Alaska Airlines. And Peter Hunt, who is currently Virgin America's CFO, will be its President and responsible for day-to-day operations. Ben and Peter are proven leaders who will do a great job leading Virgin America during this time.","The integration management office is up and running and is being led by Torque Zubeck. While there is a lot of functional work going on behind the scenes, I want to share a brief update with you on the key areas of culture, labor and brand.","Starting with culture, we know that when mergers don't succeed, especially in our industry, often people, or in other words the culture, is the culprit. This is an area where we are spending a lot of time. Our high-level goal is simply to retain the best of Alaska Airlines and the best of Virgin America and position the new combined company to be aligned, to be bold and to grow successfully well into the future.","Moving to labor, we are meeting with labor leaders and having positive discussions. We appreciate all the work the labor relations team and our labor leaders are doing to make this a smooth integration and we are optimistic that the process will go well.","And finally, I know a lot of you are curious about the brand. And as we said before, the Alaska brand is staying. We're also doing in-depth market research to better understand the elements of Virgin America's product and brand that customers love most, especially in California and we expect to have a final decision on the brand in early 2017.","To summarize, whether we are talking about Alaska, as it stands today, or the combined company post-merger, we are focused on the same bedrock principles. First, we want to be safe and on time. Second, we want to get the culture right and we want to build alignment with our people. Third, we want to protect and grow our customer base. Fourth, we want to maintain our low cost structure and low fares. And finally, we want to consistently generate the level of returns that you expect from high-quality industrial companies.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter revenue increase $57 million or 4%. This contrasts with the industry revenue shrinking by about 2%. Over the past five years, our revenues have grown 35%, outpacing the industry by 3 to 1. This growth has come with strong returns that resembles high-quality companies.","Our second quarter PRASM was down 7.7%. We were very pleased though that our unit revenue performance was within a 150 basis points to the industry, notwithstanding the fact that we grew capacity by 11% with competitive capacity growing 13%. We're also very pleased to see our load factors at 85% which was flat for the first time since the first quarter of 2013.","That said, close-in pricing has been showing weakness for reasons you're already familiar with. While we are always mindful of the environment we operate in, the fundamentals of Alaska are sound for several reasons. First, we are offering a high-value product to customers at low fares. Our low fares are enabled by low cost and have allowed us to grow profitably. The 100 new markets Brad referenced earlier in aggregate are earning margins at system-average levels and represent approximately 20% of our annual revenues.","I'm also pleased to announce that we just learned we've received approval for four additional flights to Newark. We plan to launch Portland and San Diego-Newark this November and then San Jose and a third Seattle-Newark in March and May respectively.","Secondly, when speaking of offering options to our customers, partnerships are key. Earlier in June, we launched a new Mileage Plan partnership with Japan Airlines making it the third international partner we've added in the last 12 months, Hainan and Iceland Air being the other two. That brings our total partners to 17 and allows us to serve over 950 destinations worldwide. A combination of greater reach and targeted promotion has helped increase the number of our members flying on our international partners by 32%.","And here is an interesting fact, our international partners, along with American Airlines, on a combined basis account for 34% of all international seats into the US. That's more than any one of the global alliances. We expect the benefit of this offering to our customers to take a step change forward with our acquisition of Virgin America. This acquisition will result in us having a strong presence in the largest international West Coast gateway of Los Angeles and San Francisco.","And lastly, membership in our frequent flyer program is up 11%, and our credit card portfolio grew by 12%, both outpacing passenger growth in our network.","Our loyalty program generated $200 million in cash for the second quarter. That's an increase of 16%. We expect this growth to continue given our card offering, which includes 30,000 bonus miles, annual companion tickets, free bags, no international transactions fees, and the lowest annual fees of any comparable airline card.","In addition, Costco, an iconic Pacific Northwest brand with a strong West Coast presence, moved to exclusive acceptance of Visa cards at its warehouses last month. It should come as no surprise that our customers also shop at Costco for its great products and prices. We have seen spend on our card increase significantly as a result.","Shifting our focus to the back half of the year, here are a few things to be mindful of. We expect competitive capacity in our markets to be up 13% in Q3 and 12% in Q4. That's about the same as we faced for more than a year and a half now. As others make post-summer trims to their schedules, competitive capacity has come down by 1 point in the third quarter and by 4 points for the fourth quarter since we last spoke to you in April.","Moving to Alaska's capacity, it will moderate significantly as we move through the rest of the year. Our capacity will be up about 8% in the third quarter and only 3% in the fourth quarter, which is a significant reduction from the 12% we grew during the first half of the year. Our full-year guidance sits at about 8.5%, which includes the Newark flight I just mentioned, as well as Cuba.","In summary, the fundamentals of our underlying business are strong. We are growing and diversifying revenues while continuing to build brand loyalty. We have confidence in our business model to continue to grow profitably and earn strong returns for our owners. I am personally excited about speaking with you next quarter as we expect to have closed on Virgin America, which will begin the next chapter in our journey.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Hey. Thanks, Andrew and good morning, everyone. It's a fabulous sunny morning here in Seattle and it's great to be speaking with you today.","As Brad said, Air Group's adjusted net profit improved by 14% to $263 million, and earnings per share improved by more than 20%. Our pre-tax margin was a strong 28.4%, it grew by 260 basis points and should be among the best in the domestic industry. Trailing 12 ROIC grew by nearly 400 basis points to just under 26%.","On an adjusted pre-tax basis, we earned $424 million, an increase of $54 million over the second quarter of last year. As Andrew said, revenues grew by 4% or $57 million, a result that we're happy with considering aggregate revenues across the S&P 500 are projected to shrink by 0.6% in the second quarter. Fuel costs declined by $56 million and non-fuel costs increased by about the same amount.","Our non-fuel unit cost performance in the quarter was really strong with unit costs declining by 3.7%. We did see a shift in some of the costs into the back half of the year, so our full-year guidance remains unchanged at this point. We continue to believe that our model of high productivity and low overhead is a winning combination to keep non-fuel costs in check.","Passengers per FTE, our broadest measure of productivity, improved by another 2.7% to 199, a new Q2 record for us and it's working at the division level too. I want to give a shout out to our flight ops team. Pilot hard time this quarter was better than both budget and prior year.","We've been chipping away at our costs slowly each year going back to 2009 and in fact, even back to 2003 and sometimes it helps to go up to 41,000 feet to look at the progress we've made. Recently, our FP&A team did that and made a really important observation. If our ex-fuel unit costs had grown in line with the rest of the industry instead of the gradual decline we've seen each year since 2009, our pre-tax profit this year would be almost $800 million lower. That translates to about $4 a share or more than $4 billion of market cap at current multiples. So while each individual year of a 0.5% or a 1% cost reduction doesn't sound like a lot, the cumulative effect is enormous.","Looking forward, we will see the back side of that cost shift and currently expect ex-fuel costs to be up about 3% in Q3 and up about 0.5% in Q4, which keeps our full-year unit cost decline to about 0.5% in line with prior guidance, as I said.","Cash flow from operations for the first half of the year was $900 million and we ended the June quarter with over $1.6 billion of cash on hand. Adjusted for leases, we have a net cash position of approximately $700 million and our debt to cap sits at 25%. Our balance sheet is in the best shape it's ever been and it positions us well for our planned merger with Virgin America in the fourth quarter.","Our treasury team has now obtained committed financing for the deal. Interest was very strong. We ended up oversubscribed and we were able to partner with a diverse set of leading aviation lenders. I want to thank our lenders for their partnership and support. We are finding that it's an excellent time to raise money, market rates are at historic lows and spreads for investment-grade secured loans are tight. Alaska's all-in interest rate will be low. I want to compliment our treasury and legal teams for doing such a fabulous job in this process.","Air Group has built a reputation with both lenders and investors as a conservatively managed company with a strong balance sheet and that's not going to change. After we complete the transaction, we will still have about 20 unencumbered next-gen Boeing 737s and we are going to return to re-deleveraging the balance sheet.","Speaking of fleet, we've taken delivery of 12 737-900ERs so far this year and have 7 additional 900-ERs coming in the back half of the year. As a reminder, many of these deliveries are replacements for older 737-400s.","During the quarter, we also exercised three options for E-175s for delivery in 2017. This is not new capital. Instead, we've chosen to buy them rather than lease them because we preferred the economics of owning.","We expect total CapEx for the year to be approximately $750 million, consistent with prior guidance. As a result of the three E-175 auctions I just talked about, our CapEx for 2017 ticks up slightly to just above $1 billion. And again, this is not new capital in our plan. As a reminder, we have two big fleet initiatives in process \u2013 full retirement of the 737-400s by the end of 2017, which will be good for reliability, passenger comfort and costs and the introduction of 33 E-175s into the Horizon fleet, which will help us grow into longer, thinner markets where we believe we have significant opportunity to expand profitably.","So far this year, we've generated $559 million of free cash flow. We paused on the share repurchase program following the announcement of our planned merger, but continue to pay a meaningful dividend, which is currently yielding about 1.7%","I agree with Andrew. Our business is coming along nicely and we are taking advantage of profitable growth opportunities. The resulting strong cash flow and our fortress balance sheet have positioned us well to complete the planned merger and set us up for long-term success. Everyone around the Company is working extra hard as we prepare to combine two great airlines and I want to thank our 15,000 employees for their efforts, and congratulate them once again on our record fabulous quarter.","And with that, we would like to open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman","Hi, Savi.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. I think Andrew mentioned that there is close-in fare weakness and I wonder if you could just elaborate on that a little bit, particularly maybe how it progressed through the quarter, or if there were certain regions that you saw kind of greater weakness? And maybe along those lines, what the implications of your slowing capacity growth might be to maybe help offset those trends?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah. I'll start off and Shane may have something to add. But we're not experiencing anything materially different than the industry, Savi, but what I will tell you is that our close-in bookings from a business volume is actually up. We still continue to see strong volume and demand closer in.","Big picture, I think the industry is at a place where there's been consolidation and there is new products like basic fares into the marketplace, and I think there is just some adjustments going along, but as we've shared in our remarks, we still feel very confident in how we are managing our revenues and building this business. Shane, do you have any comment there?","Shane R. Tackett - Vice President-Revenue Management, Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Maybe I'll just add in terms of like the progression. I think we started to see the close-in sort of changes in pricing environment walk in to the West Coast somewhere around March, and they've just sort of progressively made their way through the quarter, but nothing sort of unexpected, based on what we had seen going on in the industry elsewhere.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, Shane. And just a follow-up on that. So is the progress since March, is it continuing to deteriorate or is that just kind of now that it's entered it's just throughout?","Shane R. Tackett - Vice President-Revenue Management, Alaska Airlines, Inc.","I mean it's \u2013 just more recently it has felt more stable. It feels like we're sort of at where we're going to be. I couldn't really \u2013 I don't know what will happen in the near future. But nothing is getting worse recently. It's sort of been here for last month or two.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right, great. Thank you.","Shane R. Tackett - Vice President-Revenue Management, Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Savi.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey. Thank you very much. Andrew or Brandon, I'm wondering if you could just talk about capacity, you're going to be coming out of the year at a pretty low number. Does that continue into next year until the deliveries come in? In the release, you give fleet count at the end of 2018. What does it look like in 2017, just any color on kind of capacity plans for next year?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah. I will start with capacity and let Brandon touch on the fleet. You're right, in fact, the 3% in the fourth quarter and I think if you look into the booking schedule into the first quarter, it's quite low. As I did share, we're going to have some very exciting opportunities with some Newark opportunities and Cuba. But, we are going to be firming up and, as you know, we normally set our guidance for 2017 later in the year and of course with the proposed Virgin America acquisition, we're going to be taking a long hard look at 2017 capacity. So, for now, I would just say that you keep focused on the next few quarters, 2017 will be much more information coming on that.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Joe, it's Brandon. Just to follow-up on the fleet question. We'll end this year with a 153 airplanes on the mainline as you see in the Investor Update. At the end of 2017, we'll actually only have one more at a 154 airplanes based on what we see right now. A big delivery year next year with 14 new 737-900s coming in. However, it's the year we finished returning all the 737-400. So, net growth of one. We'll have some gauge growth that we can use for capacity growth but on the fleet side not much.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, Brandon, just on the dividend side, you've made it pretty clear that the buybacks probably going to slow, but you've been pretty good about growing the dividend. Do you see that as sustainable going forward even as the buyback comes down?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","I do. Yeah. We've been saying for the last couple of years, we want to be known as a company that pays a consistent and meaningful dividend, but also one that grows the dividend. I can't speak for the board right now, but that would be our intent.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for the time. Just given all the pressures we've seen out there with the airlines stocks and the pricing and macro, is it maybe causing you to take another look at Virgin and maybe you can just walk through the out that you have to the extent that the extremes out there do continue?","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman","Rajeev, thanks for the question. We continue to be super excited about Virgin America. We take ourselves back up to 35,000 feet or 41,000 feet. I mean, I think this business is actually a better business than it was 5 or 10 years ago. We're very confident in our own company, our ability to do well with the assets we have. As you know, we've got real strength at Alaska. We fly to 35 states and a 115 cities, but real strength of originating traffic in Alaska, Washington and Oregon. And then, Virgin gives us California. So we try to not focus too much on the short-term, on what's happening with PRASM and more think about fundamentally what's going to happen in this industry over 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years and all of us are just enormously excited about what we're going to do bringing these two great companies together. So that's where our head is.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. A quick question for Andrew. Andrew, can you maybe provide on maybe a historical basis what the impact is to RASM to the extent that you have a move in capacity that's 5 points or 10 points. I am just trying to figure out maybe how to think about pluses and minuses going forward just given that things are going to move a lot on the supply side.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah. I think it's been sometime since we've grown at this lower level. So I think you'd have to go back in history. But I think the other dynamic that's going on too is just the change in the competitive landscape. So I am not sure history would be the best teller of the future. I think right now the lower growth is going to be a good move for us in the fourth quarter as we get ready and set our sights on 2017. That's the best I can give you.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. At least I tried.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Good morning.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman","Good morning, Julie.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","First, I will ask a question on labor. At what point you guys began engaging the pilots for single contract negotiations and how long does that take in order? Do you need to get to a single contract to recognize any of the synergies that you guys have laid out?","Benito Minicucci - President and Chief Operating Officer","Good morning, Julie, this is Ben Minicucci. Those discussions are ongoing ,as we speak. So, we've engaged both on our side, the Alaska side and the Virgin America negotiating team and it will probably a 12 month process at the minimum before we get to some common labor agreements and common integrated seniority list so \u2013 and yes once it is combined we will be able to extract more synergy from that.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, great. And then just a second one. You guys mentioned an agreement with the DOJ around the close for the fourth quarter. Is there any update following the second information request (29:33) request or will the next data point to look for really be an approval position?","Kyle B. Levine - Vice President-Legal & General Counsel","Hey, Julie. This is Kyle. We are making great progress with the second request, and as we've said before, DOJ is looking really closely, as we expected. We are still really confident that we can close in Q4 and what's going to come into focus for the department is this is a great pro-consumer combination.","As you'd expect, some of the things, they are looking at right now between now and the ultimate clearance date, if that does come, is that route overlaps, great story there. We have only seven route overlaps, and, of course, they are really interested in our fare philosophies. We have a success story we love to tell as a low fare, high value airline. So, all said and done, we are on track for a Q4 close if things are going well.","J. Yates - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning everybody.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman","Hey, Jamie.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","How are you?","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I'm well. Thank you, all things considered. Brad, you spoke at the Wings Club about the potential for retaining the Virgin America brand as a separate entity. Today, it sounds more like you are studying which aspects of the brand you might want to retain. In the event that you were actually serious about the possibility of keeping it separate, could you identify any airline-within-an-airline construct anywhere in the world where margins approach those of Alaska Air Group?","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman","Jamie, thank you for the question. We've actually thought about this quite a lot. I think we are not going to say a lot more at this point about this consideration. I will just tell you what we are doing is we are looking at lot of data. We have built clean teams with Virgin and Alaska. We are looking at what's attractive in California to customers about the Virgin America offering. We are just trying to think about what might be best for our Company, going forward.","And I just think the best thing for the owners of this company might be for us to do this work in quietly. And then when we have something to say \u2013 I don't think it's going to be all that long. What we've said is first quarter 2017. When we actually have a viewpoint, when we have a perspective on this, we will share it. So sorry to not give you a better \u2013 more information but I just think that might be best for all involved right now.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, okay, okay. I will give you a chance to make it up to me on my second question then. We will see if I get lucky. I know that on paper the merger raises very few regulatory red flags but I still can't escape this sort of nagging feeling that DOJ may prove susceptible to its own emotions when it comes to the subject of airline M&A. In the event that the DOJ does move to block or tries to extract some sort of concessions, do you walk or do you fight?","Kyle B. Levine - Vice President-Legal & General Counsel","Hey, Jamie. It's Kyle, again. I guess, I would say neither. We entered this contract expecting to enter a long marriage with Virgin America and our position really wouldn't change even if DOJ challenges or acquires some divestiture, which, by the way, just looking at precedent, I think that's highly unlikely. Obviously, I can't speak for the department. But, again, we are talking about a pro-consumer situation where there are seven overlap routes, none touching a slot-constrained airport.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. I definitely agree with everything on paper. I don't know, it's maybe having been here before that led me to answer the question or ask the question, but I definitely appreciate the one and half answers that I got today. I'll pass it on to the next guy. Thanks so much, guys.","Kyle B. Levine - Vice President-Legal & General Counsel","Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks very much, operator. Hi, guys. Thank you for the time here. My first question is can you share what the interest rate is on the deal financing?","Mark G. Eliasen - Treasurer & Vice President-Finance","Yeah. Helane, hi. This is Mark. What we can tell you is obviously we won't know the exact rate until we close. What we can say is that margins are very tight. And you know that markets rates are down and, as Brandon said, at historic low levels. So, what I can say is we will be comfortably below 3% and that's about all the guidance I can give you right now.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then my other question is on, actually on the income statement and operating expense line. And maybe Brandon, this might be for you. Given that you've turned over the fleet, why is your maintenance \u2013 started to retire older aircraft. Why is the maintenance cost up 25% in the quarter. Was there something going on last year that caused this increase to be so substantial this year?","Unknown Speaker","Hi, Helane. This is (34:42). I'll answer that one.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. Last year, if you might recall in the second quarter of last year, we had some maintenance credits that were related to some engine work we had done in previous periods. So, we got all those credits and recognized it was last year. That was about $10 million. So, when you look at a year-over-year, if you take away that $10 million difference between the two periods then maintenance normalizes quite a bit. So, that's really the big difference.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. That's hugely helpful. Thank you. Those are really my only questions. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Hi, guys. How're you doing? So, I get a little frustrated when I hear airlines talking about PRASM as some sort of like short-term only metric as if it's some sort of like hedge fund only thing that matters and like long-only guys don't care about it because it's just not true. This was going to be the fourth year where PRASM is basically down or flat or something like that for you guys. And that's not sustainable. Brandon, you talked about the compounding effect of CASM. There's a compounding effect of PRASM too. So is there a thought to maybe thinking about this as you reevaluate a whole lot of things post-merger, whether it's guidance, conventions or long-term targets to maybe making PRASM a long-term metric somehow? And by that I mean we are going to have a target of roughly inflationary-like growth of PRASM plus or minus 200 basis points or something like that because I don't know why PRASM has to be so short-term-oriented and I feel like you guys might be in the","position now to sort of reevaluate things after the merger closes to do something about that.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Yeah, Hunter. It's Brandon, maybe I'll take that. I agree with you. I don't know why there is so much focus on PRASM. What I would do if I were an investor is I would focus on profit, and I think as you think about our business going forward either as Alaska standalone or as a combined company, we are going to make profit-maximizing decisions and some of that is going to come from PRASM and some of that is going to come from CASM.","I think the danger of focusing just on PRASM is that you don't know what happens in any particular market. You don't know what happens with fuel prices and I think you are seeing a lot of that now. But at the end of the day, it's really MASM that matters and profit on the bottom line and actual cash that goes into your checking account that you can use to delever the balance sheet and pay back debt and return capital to shareholders. So I agree with you. I...","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Brandon, Brandon. I am sorry to interrupt you but I think you misheard me. I am saying the exact opposite to be clear. I think PRASM matters a lot because it's a proxy for pricing power and that is what gets this group to rerate?","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman","I was going to jump on to Brandon's answer as well. I think you're making a great point. And I think Brandon does agree with you. If you look at this industry 15 years ago, people didn't know what CASM was, we started talking about CASM, now every airline has three-year objectives for CASM, two year, one year. We give really good, and I think reliable guidance on CASM.","Then, I would say it was roughly 10 years ago ROIC came into focus and we started talking about that. I think you're giving us and other management teams a great challenges. If you were to Andrew Harrison and Shane Tackett, if you were to give these guys a sort of a longer terms message to say what are you going to do for the revenue side of the business, how would you construct that goal in. In the Virgin, it's \u2013 as we sort of thought about these things. They are hard questions to look at them and gotten our head around. It was hard to start producing CASM objectives. But I personally think you have given us a good challenge and we should take that away and think about it. We might come away a stronger airline if we had a way of articulating our RASM objective.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Okay. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman","Yeah. Thanks, Hunter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Catherine M. O'Brien - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, gentlemen. This is actually Catherine O'Brien filling in for Mike.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, Cathy.","Catherine M. O'Brien - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. I know you're announcing closing yield pressure on the West Coast, but last quarter you're actually seeing strength in your corporate segment. And I believe though that corporate was outpacing system revenue. I was just wondering has that trend continued into the June quarter. And if so do you think you've been gaining share because of your relative value proposition versus some of your network carrier competitors?","Joseph A. Sprague - SVP-Communications & External Relations","Hey, Catherine. This is Joe Sprague. Short answer is yes. For the quarter just ended, we did see continuing strength in the corporate sector. In fact, corporate customer activity was up both on flights and revenue. And particularly here in Seattle, really good growth from companies sort of the key local corporations that we do business with here in the Seattle area.","And then just from a sector standpoint, I think, some of the underlying strength in addition to us delivering a great product to our customers and our sales team really getting after it, is the tech sector that we benefit from here on the West Coast is doing especially well right now.","Catherine M. O'Brien - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. What about your share? You are seeing that go up in some of your home markets?","Joseph A. Sprague - SVP-Communications & External Relations","Yes. Yes, we have. In fact share is up across all of our key markets.","Catherine M. O'Brien - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And if I could just ask one more quick follow-up. I know, you guys took a pause on the share repurchase program this quarter. But, should we expect any additional buybacks this year to hit that $325 million target of dividends and share buybacks this year or has that target changed?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Hey, it's Brandon. No, you should not expect any additional share buybacks this year. I think the target \u2013 what was your number?","Catherine M. O'Brien - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I think you guys said $325 million last quarter.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Yeah. I think we included the share buybacks that we did year-to-date plus the dividend payments that we would pay through the rest of the year will be right at that level.","Catherine M. O'Brien - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks so much for the time.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Your line is open.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Maybe I'll start with one for Andrew. Andrew, you had highlighted an outlook for 13% and 12% competitive growth in the next quarters and you'd commented that, that was sort of similar to what you had been seeing. But, it looks like the mix changes a bit, right, because most of the competitive growth that you guys have been seeing has been from Delta, which is building a connecting hub over Seattle, whereas the mix seems to be moving away from Delta, as we move into the end of the year, so just wondering is, is that emphasis on perhaps a little bit more of the local market by the competitors that are going to be growing in Seattle, and your other markets in the second half, does that put more pressure on Alaska revenue perhaps than what you have been seeing?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","I think you are spot on with the mix and I think really the competitive pressure, we are seeing a little bit is, some of the network carriers, with their hubs into Pacific Northwest, and then to a much lesser extent, some of the ULCCs. So, it's not \u2013 it's a little bit fragmented across various markets that we compete in. So, at the end of the day, competitive capacity is competitive capacity, but from our perspective, there is no real changes to the dynamic to our network, given the mix change.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks for that. And then maybe, if I could, a quick follow-up for Brandon. Brandon, I think we've seen something like a 75-basis point compression in 10-year treasury yields this year. I'm just looking at your 10-K where you disclosed a $128 million impact to the pension deficit with every 50 basis point move in the discount rate, is that a good number to use on a prospective basis?","Mark G. Eliasen - Treasurer & Vice President-Finance","Yeah. Hey Darryl. This is Mark. I can just tell you that rates have gone down and as we already mentioned that's really going to help us with the financing as we financed the $2 billion acquisition. So it will impact the liability aspect of our pensions, but it really is, what those rates end up at yearend, we don't know what it will be. They are already going back; I think that they are already up about 20 basis points from where they ended up in the quarter. So not sure where they are going, but it will have an impact on the liability, yes.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","But the sensitivity should be roughly the same as it would have been in 2015?","Mark G. Eliasen - Treasurer & Vice President-Finance","Yeah, it would be.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Mark.","Mark G. Eliasen - Treasurer & Vice President-Finance","And I will just tell you that on the asset side of the pensions, they are growing and as you know, we are virtually or nearly fully funded at yearend and we are still remaining at about that status, so no big story there for us.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Mark G. Eliasen - Treasurer & Vice President-Finance","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Andrew you talked about weakness in closing yields and my question is I think somewhat related to an earlier question, but just yet demand is pretty good here. So I am wondering if you can just elaborate a little bit more and that is, is the weakness in closing yields just simply a function of competitive capacity, is it more of a speared (44:37) effect, is it simply Alaska growing a little bit too fast to absorb the demand, what really has to happen. Well, I guess you can't really talk about pricing, but just wondering if you can just provide a little bit more perspective on what's really been probably the biggest culprit for that from your perspective.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","No, Dan, I think saying a whole lot more is probably not helpful for anyone. I think fundamentally what I will share with you is that we've seen is changes in what are traditionally fare fences and just revenue management practices close in. And I think they are in some part a reaction to changes in dynamics of how people are flowing passengers across their network across the country. There's certainly ULCC dynamics in here and there's certainly new products being launched by some of the network carriers. And I think when you put all of that together, you're getting what you're getting today. And so, I don't have a whole lot more insight than that, Dan. But, as Shane shared, we're dealing with that, we're managing it well, and because this stuff is close-in, we have no view what it would be in three months time because by definition it's close-in, we won't know until we're three months from now. So, I know that's probably only half of an answer of a half, but I apologize. But that's sort of what we're seeing, but we're not immune to what the rest of the industry is seeing.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","No, I understand. I appreciate that, that was helpful. And then, Brandon, I think what stood out to me in the earnings release was mainline CASM ex-fuel of $6.88, down 4% year-over-year. And obviously that factors in some deferred expenses in the quarter, but given that just some of your key labor contracts are out of the way and just kind of given your commentary of locking your non-fuel CASM down a little each year, what goal if any do you have with where that metric lands over the next year or two?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","It's really just to continue to drive it down. We have a long streak of CASM reduction that I think this year will be 15 out of the last 16. As we close the acquisition with Virgin America in the fourth quarter, everything sort of resets. But, the philosophy of the company does not reset, which is continuing to drive cost down, so we can be more competitive, increase the gap between us and the legacy carriers and offer low fares to our customers.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And then, I guess if I could just squeeze one last one in here; just following up on Jamie's question. Just given the strength of Virgin's brand, Brad, of course it's great to hear you talk about how strong the Alaska brand is as well. So, I'm wondering does it make sense to talk about it in terms of a Net Promoter Score, which seems to be at least one of the definitive \u2013 more definitive measures of a company's brand and if so, is it north or south of Google?","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman","So, Dan, what's your \u2013 we like the Net Promoter Score, I think we could say that. What's your exact question?","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Just whether it makes sense to talk about the brand and in terms of a Net Promoter Score, sort of talking about that publicly because just I think there's a broad recognition that there is a very high correlation between where that score sits and revenue production?","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman","Yeah. Yeah. Dan, I don't think we want to say a lot more about the brand, but I think I will say to you that we do like the Net Promoter Score and over time here we've been measuring customer satisfaction. We're thinking about shifting, relying more on Net Promoter Score because I think it does have a lot of validity, but I don't think we want to say more about the brand today.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Understood. Okay, thanks for the time you guys.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman","Yeah, thanks.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys, thanks for the extra question here. I was just wondering if \u2013 I think you're still on track to start rolling out Preferred Class, and if you could just remind us what the timing of that will be and especially a little bit more on how that might ramp up through 2017 and maybe when we'll start to see that benefiting the earnings?","Shane R. Tackett - Vice President-Revenue Management, Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Hey Savi, this is Shane. Thanks for the question. Yeah, Premium Class is sort of the name that we're using to brand it and it is on track. We're still on track to begin configuring aircraft in late September and so we'll have, I think, 60 aircraft done or 70 aircraft done by the end of the year. We did push the date that we decided to pre-sell the actual products from this summer to Q4. There's just a lot going on right now. And we wanted to pay attention to the right things and make sure we delivered this really well when we get there in Q4. So all of the economics are going to roll onto 2017, but they'll be up and running by January and very consistent with what we had shared at the Investor Day some months ago.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. So, the kind of the benefit this year probably not there, but you'll have the run rate in 2017?","Shane R. Tackett - Vice President-Revenue Management, Alaska Airlines, Inc.","I think we had a very de minimis amount.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","I think we have $5 million for this year, so...","Shane R. Tackett - Vice President-Revenue Management, Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Yeah.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. And if I may \u2013 got it. And If I can quickly ask, just any update on how kind of the demand is in kind of the state of Alaska or as well as Hawaii?","Shane R. Tackett - Vice President-Revenue Management, Alaska Airlines, Inc.","I can sort of answer that. I mean without getting too specific, demand has actually been very strong out of the state. It's sort of grown in line with the rest of our system. The state of Hawaii is also very strong, especially out of the Pacific Northwest. And out of California, there's more capacity in the Bay Area that Hawaii and a lot of it's being filled. So both places continue to be fairly strong points for us on the network.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Great. Thank you.","Shane R. Tackett - Vice President-Revenue Management, Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Thanks, Savi.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. Thanks for the follow-up. Andrew just on the other revenue line, I think there is some noise there from the credit card deal. Can you just speak to excluding that or once you annualize that, what the kind of underlying growth and other revenue looks like? And are you guys seeing any headwind to take rates on bag fees or anything like that as you build out your international partners, I think Virgin has actually spoken to as they've done that, that that's been a little bit of a headwind for bag fees?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Joe, it's Brandon. Maybe I'll start with the first part and Andrew can comment about ancillary, I would not call that noise at all. I would call that actual real economics associated with our credit card deal, which are fabulous. As you might recall, we had a new deal in the middle of last year, so we're seeing the annualization of that both on increase in rate and the strong volumes that we're seeing, that should be basically done now in the second quarter, maybe trickles a little bit into the third quarter. In terms of the ancillaries, Andrew?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah. I think, really the main thing on ancillaries is really back to the card, as Brandon said. The significant growth in the card and the first bag free up to seven passengers, but that's all being recouped in other places through the growth of the card, the economics and the strength. So, net-net we expect our bag fees to be down year-over-year on a per-passenger basis, but that's what we were hoping, so.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. I mean, Brandon, can you just speak to, I guess, as you annualized that in the third quarter, kind of what the underlying growth in other revenue is so we can model that effectively in the third quarter?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","I don't have that off the top of my head, Joe, maybe we'll get back to you on that one.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Finance","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Brad Tilden.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and Chairman","Thanks, everybody.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group's Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for analysts. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis, Lavanya Sareen.","Lavanya Sareen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Devin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Alaska Air Group's third quarter 2017 earnings call. Before we jump on to the call today, I want to quickly introduce Matt Grady, our new Director of Investor Relations. Matt covered transports on the sell side and most recently, was part of the corporate strategy team at Starbucks. Matt brings a fresh perspective and deep financial acumen to the team. We're super excited to welcome him into the Air Group family, and I'm looking forward to working with him.","With that, let's jump in. On the call today are CEO, Brad Tilden, who will provide an overview of the business and share progress on Virgin America integration; our Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Harrison, who will share an update on our revenues; followed by Brandon Pedersen, our CFO, who will discuss our financial results and outlook. Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.","As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","On to results. This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a third quarter GAAP net profit of $266 million. Excluding merger-related costs and mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments, Air Group reported an adjusted net income of $278 million, which was $6 million higher than last year's net income of $272 million, and our earnings per share grew by 2% to $2.24.","Said another way, Virgin acquisition has been accretive in the third quarter and was accretive in the first nine months since close of our merger. However, the net income didn't (02:50) decline on a combined comparative basis. We've included certain unaudited supplementary data labeled combined comparative statistics on page 7 of our earnings release, update to help investors make meaningful comparisons to the combined results of both airlines in last year's third quarter.","Additional information about cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging, capital expenditures, and other items can be found in our Investor Update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and is available on our website at alaskaair.com.","And with that, over to Brad.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Lavanya, and good morning, everybody. With three quarters of 2017 now behind us, we continue to be very enthusiastic about our results and our future and about fulfilling our purpose of creating an airline that people love. Economic activity in our West Coast markets remained strong and our core business continues to perform very well.","Our franchise is growing in California, and we're pleased by the response we've seen to our expanding network, to our focus on hospitality, and to our generous mileage plan. While our third quarter results were impacted by some operational challenges and by industry pricing pressure, we're addressing these issues as we'll discuss in a moment.","For the quarter, our operating revenues grew to a record $2.12 billion. On that revenue, we earned a pre-tax margin of 21% and pre-tax income of $446 million, which is up 4.4% from the third quarter of last year. Though down on a combined comparative basis, our results were solid given the ongoing integration and given that fuel prices were up 14% year-over-year.","From an ops standpoint, we've come a long way from the beginning of the year, but we still have work to do. We ranked second out of the six largest carriers in on-time performance for the quarter, up from nearly the bottom of the pack during the first quarter. While we're pleased to have closed the gap with our competitors, we remain committed to getting back to the number one position on this metric.","And as many of you know, Horizon Air has encountered some challenges of late. Pilots have been leaving regional airlines for mainline opportunities at higher rates than in the past and at higher rates than we anticipated. The introduction of the E175s to our fleet has also increased our training needs. We ended up being short pilots, and we scaled back our schedule especially in August and September. We've now adjusted our schedule to match pilot availability, and cancellations have dropped dramatically. We've made a number of leadership changes as well, and we're also consolidating our Horizon leadership team and our operations center in Seattle, giving us a much better ability to develop talent across Horizon and Alaska. I'm confident that these adjustments will position us to run the airline smoothly as we head into 2018.","Now, let's talk about our growth. Those of you that have followed Alaska for many years know that growth is nothing new for us. We've been expanding capacity at a 7% to 8% rate for more than 20 years now. New markets added at Alaska by itself since 2010 will account for about one-fourth of this year's revenues and profits. Our growth this year has been focused on California. 32 of the 44 new markets we're opening this year will serve the state. And with this growth, we're putting the building blocks in place to expand our base of loyal customers. Nevertheless, this growth will not come without challenges.","We know our growth rate is high even for us over the next few quarters, and this is during a period of yield softness in the industry. As has been reported by others, this quarter, we saw pricing pressure especially in our transcon and inter-Cal markets with walk-up fare levels being well below historical norms. While we believe these prices are not sustainable, they are nonetheless continuing into the fourth quarter. And as a result, I've asked our network planning and RM teams to evaluate every market we fly to, to ensure we have the right amount of capacity deployed to generate acceptable margins and returns. And we will talk more about this in a moment.","Turning now to the integration, our team is doing great things. We met several key milestones this quarter including Mileage Plan reciprocity, station colocation at 11 of the 24 airports, and the launch of an internally developed technology that allows gate agents to switch between Alaska and Virgin check-in and boarding applications. The next eight months will be very important as we expect to complete several additional milestones.","In January, we expect to convert to single payroll, HR, and financial systems. We'll fully integrate our loyalty programs. We expect to receive a single operating certificate from the FAA. We'll begin the rollout of satellite Wi-Fi across the fleet, and we'll repaint our first Airbus airplane in the Alaska livery. In the spring, we plan to cut over to a single passenger service or PSS system, and this will allow us to unlock many of the revenue synergies we share with you in Investor Day. And then on October, we'll configure our first Airbus interior to the Alaska layout.","By the middle of next year, our most critical integration milestones will be behind us, and we're thrilled about this. The fact that we remain on track to complete all of our goals on schedule is a testament to the quality and dedication of our fantastic people. These people have been working extremely hard. I want to personally thank them for the many sacrifices they are making to get this integration done and done well.","We're in the midst of an important transformational period for our company. Nothing worth doing is easy, and every meaningful thing we've accomplished in the last 25 years here has faced challenges, and this is no different. But during that time, we've also been steadily and consistently building a great company, and that's what we're going to keep on doing for all of the people who are counting on us to do so, our customers, our communities, our employees, and our shareholders. Thanks very much.","And I'll now turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everybody. As Brad mentioned, total third quarter revenues grew 5.4% to $2.1 billion. Demand in our core business remains robust, and healthy momentum in California continues. Our capacity team has been busy building an expansive network on Virgin America's strong foundation. In addition, we've made substantial progress on the integration with approximately one quarter of all Virgin bookings now flowing through as.com (09:37). Our revenue management system is fully integrated, a clear line of sight to implement new product and services on both the Airbus and Boeing fleets and the colocation of Virgin and Alaska operations at major airports such as L.A., San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, and New York for the convenience of our guests.","Now, some color on the third quarter. Our same-store markets or markets that have been in operation longer than one year performed well. Same-store capacity, representing approximately 94% of our total capacity, grew 0.7 of a point, while RASM was slightly positive. Same-store load factor was strong at 86%, while certain yield suffered from close-in pricing, primarily in intra-California and California transcon, both driven by our need to be competitive with (10:29) actions. And I'll expand in more detail when I get to the fourth quarter outlook.","The challenges at Horizon also impacted our same-store results. Flight cancellations led us to either refund or re-accommodate passengers, which led to displacement of higher yield bookings and lost revenues. We estimate this resulted in about $25 million to $30 million of revenue headwind or about 1.5 points of RASM. But as Brad mentioned, we've adjusted the flight schedule, and Horizon is now running well, and we expect these revenue headwinds to be substantially lower in the fourth quarter and behind us by year-end.","Now, turning to new market growth, which I know is very much on everyone's minds. The 20 new markets we commenced in the nine months ended second quarter of 2017 contributed approximately one-third of our revenue growth in the third quarter with 60% of these markets already profitable and many returning double-digit margins. That said, we fully acknowledge our pace of new market growth is very high yet critical to unlocking the value of Virgin America. New market growth of 44 routes this year will not continue at the current pace and, in fact, will slow to only a handful of new markets in 2018, the majority in the Pacific Northwest.","As Brad affirmed, our customer utility is rising. As a reminder, we define utility as the percentage of total demand for geography where we provide a nonstop flight to help meet that demand. We are on track to achieve 70% utility out of San Francisco by year-end, and that's up 11 points from the acquisition. Now, utility is also growing across the State of California, and by year-end, we'll offer 44% utility to California customers. That's up 28 points from our 2016 pre-merger network of only 16 points.","And our data reaffirms that increased relevance leads to increased loyalty as our loyalty program continues to grow nicely given our network growth. Mileage Plan membership is up 18% year-over-year. In addition, Alaska Airlines' affinity credit card holders increased well above passenger growth. The Alaska Airlines brand also continues a strong march forward in the Bay Area with unaided awareness improving another 5 points and preference up 4 points since May. Unaided awareness for Alaska, which now sits at 50%, exceeds what Virgin America had in the Bay Area prior to the acquisition.","As we look to Q4, we see a more challenging revenue environment and one that is closer to but better than September unit revenue performance rather than July or August. Our 11% percent growth, which includes a 6% increase in stage length, and new markets will pressure unit revenues. But the more significant challenge is what we have been experiencing in California, both transcon and inter-Cal. These two regions represent approximately one-quarter of our network. In some key California transcon markets, we are seeing close-in business fares zero to seven days advance purchase down 20% to 35%, yet demand remains strong, and in some cases, industry capacity is relatively flat. Inter-Cal is no different with close-in fares down 25% to 35%.","To provide color, Boston-Los Angeles industry capacity was marginally down, yet seven-day advance purchase fares were down over 56%, going from $239 to $104. In Los Angeles, San Francisco being an Inter-Cal market, industry capacity was actually down 10%, and seven-day advance purchase fares were down 38%, going from $160 to $99. Now, we're doing our best to work through this, but we do not see any changes in this pricing environment as it stands today.","I now want to move or provide actually a general sense of our planned capacity in 2018. We expect to grow about 8% for the full year, which is nearly 1 point lower than we were originally considering, first half higher than the second half. Our focus will be on maturing what we started this year with substantially all of our 2018 growth resulting from markets started this year but excluding any paying field service tentatively expected to start in late 2018. And we expect our growth in 2019 to come down further at between 6% to 7%.","Before I turn the call over to Brandon, I want to reiterate that while the acquisition of Virgin America has brought a number of changes, our commitment to disciplined growth has not changed. My commercial team and I know full well we need to produce strong margins at the lowest cost. And if we do not see a path to achieving our growth objectives at adequate returns on invested capital, we will adjust course and quickly.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As you've now heard, Air Group posted a $278 million third quarter adjusted profit, a $6 million increase over last year's adjusted Q3 result. This equates to a pre-tax profit of $446 million and a trailing twelve pre-tax margin of 20%. On a combined comparative basis, that is with Virgin America's third quarter of 2016 in the base, our result was $68 million or 13% lower than last year.","Andrew covered revenues, so I'll cover costs. Fuel costs were up substantially or $70 million, which equates to 23%, and non-fuel cost rose by $97 million. Unit costs ex fuel were up 1% on 7% ASM growth. Operational disruptions resulted in about $6 million of incremental cost during the quarter with airports and call centers most heavily impacted. Our call center team has worked extremely hard over the last few months, and our employees there deserve a huge shout-out. Not only did they handle the added volume from the disruptions, more guests are calling with questions about integration-related changes to our network and loyalty programs. The Q3 impact of those costs was partially offset by a shift in timing of some of the maintenance now planned for Q4.","As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect unit costs to be up about 1.5% on the 11% increase in capacity. While that certainly doesn't make for a very impressive headline, there are several drivers. First, we're pleased to announce that we finally signed a new engine services deal with GE that covers all 130 of our Boeing 737-800 engines. We're very pleased with the economics of this deal. A power-by-the-hour structure will help take the lumpiness out of the engine overhaul expense over the next nine years compared to a time and materials approach, but it does result in near-term CASM impact, which begins in Q4 and will impact 2018.","Second, as I mentioned, we do have some maintenance activities planned in Q4 that were deferred from Q3, and we're also planning more advertising and promotional activity in the fourth quarter in support of our transition to one single Alaska brand. And finally, the close-in capacity reductions on the regional side will also impact unit costs because the fixed cost gets spread over fewer ASMs. In fact, our full-year 2017 capacity will now be up 7.2%, down from the 7.5% we guided to as recently as mid-September and way down from the guidance as high as 8.5% at one point during the year.","We are deep into the budget process now and expect to provide 2018 cost guidance in January. Our financial planning team and divisional leaders are digging into their businesses and together will be setting aggressive budgets. Although the budget is still in process, I thought I might call out a few significant items.","First, the result of our mainline pilot arbitration. As we reported previously, the annual impact of the company proposal is $140 million, which we believe puts our pilots' total compensation in a very competitive position versus others in the industry, especially considering our relative size and our growth-oriented business. At the $140 million level, it would result in a nearly 3 point increase in CASMex and will reduce pre-tax margins by more than 1.5 points. We expect the arbitrator award soon and for the decision to impact Q4, which is not included in the Q4 cost guide.","The new engine services deal, this will add about $30 million of incremental expense over what we might have been expected to incur on a time and material basis. But again, this is about timing. The economics over the nine years are significantly better.","Third, the growing mix of regional flying, which will be up nearly 25% next year given all of the E175 adds, this will pressure CASM but also help RASM. And finally, continued what I call integration friction, in other words, costs that don't get captured in the merger-related cost line on our external P&L but are real. This friction should start to decline right after we get through the PSS transition. Our job as leaders will be to ensure that we eliminate these costs as quickly as possible, and we don't let things like consultant and contractor cost get buried into the baseline or change our way of thinking and how we get things done around here.","Bottom line, our costs will rise in 2018, but we understand the importance of low cost to the business model and to the success of the company. We have a long track record of solid cost control, and I'm confident we can continue to maintain a cost structure that gives us significant competitive advantage over the legacy carriers.","Our cash flow continues to be strong. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion of cash on hand, and we've now generated $1.4 billion of operating cash flow excluding merger-related expenses since the start of the year. CapEx for the first nine months of the year stands at just under $850 million, resulting in more than $600 million of free cash flow, again ex merger-related expenses.","We now expect full-year 2017 CapEx to be $1.1 billion and 2018 CapEx to be $1.4 billion. Horizon's deferral of five E175s from late 2017 and early 2018 to the back half of 2018 explains the timing shift. Total 2017 and 2018 CapEx is basically unchanged.","Our fleet continues to get younger as we've now retired nearly all of the Boeing 737-400s. Through September 30, we've taken delivery of 10 Boeing 737-900ERs, two Airbus A321neos and 10 E175s. Meanwhile, our portfolio of unencumbered aircraft continues to grow and is now at 63 aircraft or more than 20% of the fleet.","We're also making steady progress re-deleveraging our balance sheet. Our debt-to-cap fell by another 2 points this quarter to 53%, and we expect to end the year at about the same level. Less than a year since we completed the acquisition of Virgin America, we've lowered our debt-to-cap by 6 points and are well on our way of achieving our longer-term target in the low to mid-40s range. Although funding growth and deleveraging remain our primary capital allocation goals, balance remains important. In that vein, we repurchased an additional 350,000 shares of stock last quarter. We've now completed our plan to repurchase $50 million worth of our shares in 2017. We've also paid $111 million in dividends so far this year.","In sum, this is a very solid quarter for us during what is and what will continue to be a transitional period. There's a lot of work ahead to get through the significant integration milestones so that we can begin to truly be one airline and fully realize the synergies we expect to achieve, which are, by the way, on target.","Andrew described a somewhat challenging fare but not demand environment that is pressuring revenues, and I covered some near-term cost pressures that we'll be dealing with. However, we remain very optimistic about what we're building and the opportunity ahead.","And with that, let's go to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Hey. Can I ask on \u2013 I appreciate all the forward color provided today. On the 2018 growth, I wonder if you can provide some components on gauge and a little bit more color on where that growth is going to be.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Savi. This is Andrew. The growth next year, I think, a few points of that, it's actually more like stage length, longer stage length. Gauge is, I think, roughly flat, give or take. And really, it will break down to about 10 points of growth in the first half of the year. And then second points of growth in the second part of the year. And as I shared in my prepared remarks, fundamentally, all of this growth is just the annualization of what we've started in 2017, which, as we shared earlier, will be a lot of California and then some transcon, Pacific Northwest, and Mexico City flying.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Thanks. And if I might ask on the cost side, Brandon, are you kind of indicating that even without the pilot deal, kind of unit costs will be up next year? Is that fair?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Savi. As I mentioned, we're still in the budget process, so it's too early to say for sure. What I would say is that I gave you a bunch of the pieces. The pilots are going to be probably 3 points of CASM. We do have other cost pressures that are just \u2013 they are just these are the realities \u2013 the reality of the business are like the maintenance deal, really good economics but where the expense impact is different than what I'd call the cash impact. And then there's the mix issue. We do have this friction that I've been talking about and that's real. That will be in the first half of the year. As I said, it will start to come out in the second half of the year.","So, it's probably a fair assessment to say flattish, perhaps up modestly ex pilot, but again, in terms of a specific quantification, really hard to do because I don't know the size of the pilot arbitration decision, and I don't know when it starts, so it's hard to give you a percentage year-over-year change.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Helpful. All right. Thanks, guys.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody. A question on Horizon and the pilot issue. I'm just curious if you think you've taken a sufficiently proactive approach to reducing capacity further out than what you had been doing in the past. It felt initially like maybe you were running the airline just sort of in hopes that the problem might go away or find some solution rather than taking the approach that maybe this is just the new normal. I guess, I'm just surprised that after talking about this in the second quarter, we're still talking about it as it relates to the third quarter.","David L. Campbell - Horizon Air Industries, Inc.","Hi, Jamie. Dave Campbell. Good morning.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, Dave.","David L. Campbell - Horizon Air Industries, Inc.","Hey. Just a little bit of background for you there. I think part of the challenge we have \u2013 just to go back a little further \u2013 I think part of the challenge is really the fact that we got behind hiring initially last year because we were simply not competitive from a pay standpoint. We've only got a deal in place that allowed us to start to hire. The biggest challenge moving forward right now is now catching up on the training piece of this. We're now hiring 30 pilots a month, so I feel really good about that, but it's going to take us another 90 days to really catch up on the backlog of training, and moving forward, I feel very comfortable that we have a solid plan in place. It's going to work.","What we're seeing right now is that pulling the schedule down to the levels that allow us to operate daily has made a huge difference already. So far this month, we've had 24 days in, and of those 24 days, we've had 19 days where we had no pilot cancels compared to last month where we had on average about 500 (27:19) cancels for the month. So, we're getting a lot more control, a lot more flexibility, but it's really now about catching up on the training piece of this.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Jamie. It's Brad. I like to add on to that. This is on us. We should have seen this coming, and that's just all we'll say about it. But I think we're talking about this quarter because it affected third quarter results on September 8, so a month and a half ago, we brought the schedule down, and honestly, since those reductions, Horizon run quite well.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then two just really quick housekeeping items. You mentioned the color on yield pressure. You said about down 25% to 30%. We are having trouble hearing that. That was related to transcon close-in business. Is that correct?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Jamie, Andrew. Let me quickly correct that statement. Yeah, we were just saying in select California transcon and inter-California market, close-in booking is down significantly. It seemed to be base fares (28:30) that seem to be disconnected from demand. What we talked about was really September, looking into the fourth quarter, what we did say was that the fourth quarter will more likely resemble the September revenue performance although we expect to be better than that, but that's sort of where we're seeing things right now.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And just on that topic of premium transcon, can you remind us the timing of when the Virgin premium product starts to kind of harmonize with the Alaska product? I view that, that premium market is one that is increasingly less important over time to Alaska that's why I'm asking the question.","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Yeah, Jamie. Hi. This is Shane. Just to be super clear, Virgin aircraft are going to be reconfigured to resemble the Boeing here (29:24) that we've got. So, we will densify the first-class cabin from 8 to 12 on most of the fleet. And the A321s will have 16 in the first-class cabin. That starts September of 2018. It's going to take us about 15 months after we get going (29:41).","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's right. All right. Thank you, everybody.","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Sorry. (29:46) will be a part of that, too.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it.","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Thanks, Jamie.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Jamie.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Andrew G. Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Brad, I mean, you're already taking a lot of aircraft now through year-end. I was just wondering if as the pace of the delivery schedule sort of limits your ability to cut capacity further in 2018, if you feel like demand or your operations warrant it.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, Andrew, we don't have, as you are sort of saying, we don't have a lot of close-in control over capacity, but what I would share is we feel super solid about this strategy. What we are seeing, the competitive pricing that we're seeing in California is a little different than we expected. And maybe to give analysts a little bit more context, if we look at our third quarter RASM, the Alaska RASM, sort of the legacy Alaska markets was flat. The RASM in the legacy Virgin markets was actually down 8%. We actually are thinking about this. Andrew gave you some sort of insights as we look forward to sort of the back part of 2018 and 2019. We did have some thoughts on 2019 that we're actually pulling in a little bit, but yeah, there's not a huge ability to control capacity near term, but we're always thinking 12, 18, 24 months out, and if anything, we're pulling in that thinking a little bit right now.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","The other thing I would just quickly add there, Andrew, is we do have real flexibility certainly on the regional side. We are taking 25 Embraer 175s next year, and we have Q400s that we are basically putting on the ground starting today and bringing that fleet down. So, we do have flexibility in the retirement of the regional fleet, which is a decent part of our growth next year.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. Andrew, you're making a good point. We don't have huge flexibility with aircraft deliveries. I mean, what we've actually asked these guys to do is go look at ASMs by day of week, by number of frequencies per day and adjust those, and to come up with the best position for the company on our flight schedule.","Andrew G. Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. That's helpful. And then, Andrew, maybe more a point of clarification in terms of your 4Q RASM commentary. I know September had some impact from the Horizon pilots. So, your comments for 4Q, are they referring to the reported September RASM? I think it was down around 5.5% or are you talking more towards the core trend ex the Horizon disruption? Thanks.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","There will be a little bit of Horizon disruption in the fourth quarter. I think my comments were really to try and frame for everybody that our unit revenue performance is more likely this September, but less than that is what we're seeing right now. So, again, I don't want to get too prescriptive there, but on 11% growth \u2013 I'll also tell you that October is our peak growth of 12%, and going forward, that will be the highest capacity growth, and it's just going to come down from there.","Andrew G. Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Would you be able to give us a sneak peek into how October is trending right now?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","I'm getting stares from the CFO so I'm going to defer. I'm sorry.","Andrew G. Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","It's Brandon. This is the answer that again, demand is solid, but we're seeing some close-in pricing that is puzzling to us.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. That's right. Next question?","Operator","Your question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Yes. Hey. Two questions here. Andrew, I want to get back to just how you qualified the growth in 2018. I mean, I think you said that a lot of it or the majority of it was really the annualization of 2017, but the 2018 number, it looks like it's going to come in higher than what 2017 was. And I'm not sure if that reflects the fact that you had to pull down a bunch of E175 services that should have been in the schedule, and maybe they're coming back in 2018. Can you really give us a little bit more color on that?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. I think a couple of things. I think, as you've heard, Alaska's mainline completion rate has been 0.5 point lower than historic standards. Virgin has been 1.5 points lower than, I think, historic standards, and Horizon has been, I think, sort of 4 points lower than historic standard. So, I think for 2017, our completion rate of ASMs was down, operational reasons and, of course, to your earlier point. And I think going forward, as we go into 2018, again, we've got decent stage length increases, and we continue to up-gauge our fleet. So, I think there is a little noise here and there. I think we're going to be at 7.2% this year. We'll get more clear for you, but it's roughly on about the same basis if we run a full schedule this year, Mike, because we started off at 8.5%, I think something like that. We ended at (35:04).","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. That's right. Okay. That makes sense. And then just to Brandon, in the third quarter, you had a free cash deficit, and I see, obviously, you paid the dividend, you bought back stock, and I'm just curious about the fact that maybe you have a more seasonal operation with the transcons, if it was just a shift in the ATL (35:20) and that, that had a bigger impact now that you have Virgin in the fold. What kind of drove that, maybe it was that bad, or was it something else?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Mike, good morning. It's Brandon. Well, I hadn't really focused on the fact that we had a free cash deficit.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Looks like it was about $300 million, and we get that for \u2013 seasonally, we see that with a lot of carriers.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Just off the top of my head, it's probably a pullback in the ATL (35:48) just as we get through the summer of flying. It's probably the timing of pre-delivery payments on the deliveries, and that's probably it. There was nothing significant that jumped out (36:01) during the quarter that would result in a free cash deficit other than, like you say, just the normal seasonality combined just with the timing of capital expenses.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That makes sense. Okay. Great. Thank you.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","For the year, our free cash flow will be very solid though, just to point out.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hi, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. So, look, I know mergers are hard, but it does feel like what's been happening here is really not what people are used to with you guys, that the execution has been sloppy, there's been bad cost control. It feels like the old sort of like Alaskan narrative is increasingly irrelevant to the investor story right now, and a lot of that relates to costs. So, I appreciate you're still in the budgeting process, and you've given us a reasonable amount of color on 2018, and I appreciate that. And maybe you can answer this today, maybe you can answer it in a month or two, but can you guys give some thought to providing a multiyear CASMex fuel look?","A lot of other airlines have done that, but I think you guys have really the track record and the credibility to do it where people can actually kind of buy into it and believe and hang on to it like something that sort of the old Alaska had before you sort of lost this mojo, which I think really kind of started around the Analyst Day. So, have you guys given any consideration to that either today or some point in the future?","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hunter, it's Brad. I'll start and then well, maybe Brandon or Ben want to jump on as well. Mergers are hard is the simple thing. We announced this thing April of 2016. We closed it December of 2016. We sort of have been focused on this thing for, what is that math, a year-and-a-half now or something like that, and honestly, we got another six or eight months to run hard. What we're trying to do organizationally is say, look, this thing is done middle of next year, and we're back to running an airline. I think your characterization is right. We are good airline operators. We're good at managing costs. We're good at managing operations. We're actually good at managing revenues, but we have been a little bit focused on the merger. And the sooner we get to the place where the merger is done and we're running the airline, which means whatever, getting close to our people, budgets, all of that stuff, the better. I think you're asking a great question. Honestly, a hallmark of us, if we go back, we do like to have three-year cost targets, whether we share them or not through each of our divisions in terms of what they're doing with productivity and volume and so forth. So, I think that's a great challenge for the leadership team to see if there's something that we want to come back to all of you and communicate with.","But the big, big picture, it is what it is. This merger, it does change a culture. There are literally hundreds of systems that you have to get through. There is labor agreements, there is people, there are jobs moving, and it does take your eye off \u2013 you actually do have to shift from what I think this company does best. And I'll just say from my own perspective, the sooner we get this thing behind us and get back to doing what we do well, the better. And I personally think that will \u2013 middle of 2018 at the latest, and honestly, I'm shifting my attention to that right now.","Ben, Brandon, is there anything you guys would add to that?","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hunter, it's Ben. Our entire operations team is focused on the same thing. As you know, we're trying to do both. We're trying to run an integration. We're trying to run two operations and keep an eye on costs. For me, for example, Bay Area half the time, and we're looking forward to mid-year when we start getting focused and getting back to what we do best, which is running great operations, keeping costs tight, and delivering on our goals.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","It's Brandon. Maybe I'll disclose \u2013 I can assure you that we are more frustrated than you about this whole thing. And there's a lot of anxiety around here. There's been a lot of tough conversations in the last few weeks about this. We've already started talking about this notion of a glide slope to get from the place we are now to the place we want to be. And...","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. No, I'm not frustrated. You're better than this. Your investors are frustrated. I mean, I'm just an analyst. I'm just trying to just sort of do the work and forecast things. But I get the frustration, but I think a multiyear guide on cost from you guys in particular might be powerful, something to think about just for the future.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","(40:30) we'll give it honest thought.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","David L. Campbell - Horizon Air Industries, Inc.","I'll add one more comment that is the fact that the whole Horizon, we weren't distracted by the merger. Our issue is that we just didn't see the amount of attrition that was coming forth, so not prepared for having a training capacity that actually could handle the operation. So, we have six new leaders inside of Horizon flight ops team, so I have a lot of confidence we're going to get back to running a great airline.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks. Yeah. Okay. I appreciate it. And then, Brad, when you say you're asking your network team to review new markets, that felt like you're trying to tell us something there. I mean, you emphasized this. I think there's a headline in Bloomberg about it. Don't you do that anyway? I mean, I would assume that doesn't mean you guys always do. And then on the comments around sort of like the inflexibility around capacity, I mean, what can you really do there? And then like what's new? What were you trying to tell us in that statement that's actually new and what are the potential outcomes from it?","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Right. Good question. So, in the last 12 months, we bought Virgin America. We got a lot of revenue, a lot of markets that we don't \u2013 these weren't our market decisions. It's not our history. Then on top of that, we've added 44 new markets on it. And I think what we're saying is I am not only pleased, but I'm like really impressed with this team's ability in legacy markets to go in and understand the natural demand to build a schedule day of week, time of day, number of frequencies that is exactly right for that amount of demand and our competitive position.","I would say, yeah, it's a fair point is don't you do that anyway, but it's a good question, but I would just say we haven't done that with the Virgin Network. And I think what you'll see us do, go into that network and I'll \u2013 just to really say, a lot of this stuff is extremely important to us strategically. So, a lot of this stuff isn't going to change, but there are some things in there that you might see change. There are frequencies, markets that were three a day that two a day may be a better or more profitable outcome with this, and there may be things geographically that you see us change. So, that's what we're really trying to say is that we are getting our arms around the Virgin Network. We're starting to think about it. We're not making an announcement today, but I think you will see something down the road. You'll see some adjustments to the part of the schedule that we inherited from Virgin America.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you all very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Donofrio from Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Susan Donofrio - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Susan.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Susan.","Susan Donofrio - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. So, I just wanted to circle back to your new markets. You had made a comment on the last call that you thought that you were seeing kind of a quicker ramp-up than the normal two to three years. And obviously, I recognized that there are some competitive dynamics going on overall, but are you still comfortable in what you're seeing with that?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yes. Susan, this is Andrew. I think we talk a lot about new markets, and there is really two major categories there, the ones that are being in the schedule and selling for one, two, three years now, and then like even in the third quarter, there is 20 where we basically have no real history on as well. I think what we are saying here is number one, that the ones we have started and invested in continue to ramp quickly and do well as a portfolio. And speaking with Shane and his team just the other day and we're seeing good, encouraging build-up on a lot of the new markets. So, I think there's just a real -just to get really clear so there's no confusion that there is \u2013 what we're trying to say is that just standard new markets and growing, we feel very good about our new markets, but we're also in the legacy Virgin America network seeing real pressure in a good chunk of their network, which a lot of it is close-in pricing and some other things going on. So, as a portfolio going forward, we still feel very good about our new markets and how they are building, and we will make adjustments down the road if we need to.","Susan Donofrio - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And then just shifting just your operations, I know you had made some comments about ATC issues and you're kind of working on readjusting some of the schedules. Where are you with that?","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Good morning, Susan. Ben Minicucci here. We're working hard. So, what we've done is we've put a huge initiative with our flight ops team to really understand all the ATC. We have new issues in Seattle, of course, with the capacity. We're really understanding San Francisco-LAX to a certain extent. So, we're working with the network team, trying to make sure our flight schedule, the volume we're putting in at times of day, day of week makes sense for us to achieve a certain operational reliability and customer satisfaction. So, we're working through that. We're learning \u2013 I would say is we're not where we want to be, but we're learning what the challenges are with ATC. We're going to try and develop the best operational performance with the best network and that we can get from that. So, it's still work in progress.","Susan Donofrio - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Do you expect to maybe start rolling that out in 2018 in terms of adjustments to the schedules?","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Did roll out in chunks. So, what we're doing is we're just rolling out in chunks. As you grow, we've got to figure out where the growth comes. So you've seen us growing out in increments over 2018 and even into 2019 as we make \u2013 because honestly, we're working with the FAA as well in Seattle to make sure we get as much throughput out of Sea-Tac as we can get. So, we want to do is get Sea-Tac to actually operate better than it is today. So, we've got to work with several agencies to make sure that happened.","Susan Donofrio - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Crissey with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kevin Crissey - Citibank","Good morning. Thanks for the time. Maybe for Andrew, can you talk about the close-in pricing? You've been pretty clear about what it is, but maybe you could talk about why close-in as opposed to earlier in the booking curve? You would see pressure. You can't speak for others, I assume, but generally, why do you see that occur?","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Hey, Kevin. This is Shane. I think it's a fair question and you're right. I think you'd have to sort of ask other folks about why they might be doing it. The point we want to just sort of get across is we haven't seen a fundamental change in demand. So, we came into the month where we thought we would be from an advanced load factor standpoint. The bookings materialized close-in just as we kind of thought they would. They just came in at lower price points, which were, by and large, brought by others, and I'd really \u2013 hard for me to speculate as to why other people would have done that.","Kevin Crissey - Citibank","It's a challenge for us, and maybe this is more of a statement than it is a question, but maybe a question will come out of it. But it's bad enough when this industry is kind of supply and demand and it's seen as a commodity. This is like worse than a commodity. The demand is strong, the supply is decent, and the prices is actually worse than you'd expect. So, it's hard for investors to take this industry and say it's a good industry and an improved industry when these are the type of results we get.","So, maybe I'll move on to another question. The question would be relevance mattering, I can understand that having been at JetBlue. That was certainly a philosophy that they had there. Can you talk about the speed of getting to that relevance? It seems that the airlines did run into kind of pricing pressures. It's often when there is really rapid growth. So, what was the urgency to grow so quickly to create that relevance? Is it a first-mover advantage? Why does speed to market matter?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","People might have different philosophies, but I'm a simple man and it's really simple. We came out there and just put it all on the table, set it out, our guests knew where we were going, our investors should know where we're going, our employees know where we're going, and the executive team knows where we're going, and that's what we've put out today. So, we have a clear mandate, we have a great foundation, we're going to go \u2013 we weren't going to do this over x years. We just want to get it done, behind, as Brad said, and get really good at what we do best.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. Kevin, it's hard to ask for somebody's loyalty if you can't take them where you need to get them. And as a reminder, San Francisco is an example. We've gone in the last two years from being able to serve 11% of the customers there to 70%. There's no question in my mind it was the right thing to do, but we've got some growing pains.","To your first question of like why you've got strong demand, no growth in capacity and fare pressure, it's a great question. I personally think it's jostling around that sort of competitors compete for a position in the marketplace. What I've seen over my career is dust does settle down in time, and it settles down in the ones that do have competitive advantage, they operate well, they've got great employees, great service, great cost structure, great fare structure, they survive. And I think we're going to survive. That's what we're going through right now.","Kevin Crissey - Citibank","Thank you. Thanks for the time.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Kevin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Operator","Joseph DeNardi, please go ahead. Your line is open.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Let's go to the next analyst.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Daniel J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Oh. Hey. Good morning. Thanks, guys. Andrew, if I can go back to the transcon and Intra-California pricing pressure, to just ask this a little differently, what percent of the revenue is being impacted by basic economy pricing in the third and the fourth quarters? Is it the 25% that you shared or is it something higher? I guess, that's the first question. And then second, of course, I don't expect you to tell me what you're going to do, but are there steps that you can take to put fences around some of the ULCC pricing?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","I'm going to let Shane answer that one. (50:42).","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","He said wait a minute, and that's what he did.","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Yeah. It's a good question on the percent. Basic economy is pretty much rolled out more or less throughout most of our system, certainly throughout California. I mean, there are a few markets here and there where it's filed but not selling a lot. But I think most markets now we at least see it in the sort of 21 AP (51:07) range. We have seen it come into from the close rim pricing (51:10). I don't have the exact percentage, but it's broader than it was before. That was the first question. The second question?","Daniel J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","What can we do?","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Oh. Fences, yeah. I think that's a good question. Look, I think a lot of these stereotypes have been practically gated out of like corporate sort of travel portals in terms of indirect distribution. I do think there is a question here for OTAs. I think they put these products on the shelf, which, in general, people don't like them a lot, right next to our product, and consumers may not know that there is an actual difference, and we've been sort of taking our OTA partners to task over that, and I think they actually need to help do a better job, inform customers. People at the same price would prefer our products generally so they have more stuff included.","Daniel J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. And I actually may circle back after the call with maybe a couple of thoughts, but I guess, Andrew or Shane, I guess, another question here. I think the rule of thumb on RASM when it comes to new flying historically has been around sort of 80% of system RASM, and please correct me on that. But my question really is, what did you see in the third quarter? Was it coming in? And I'm not talking just inter-California, transcon, but just all kind of 44 new markets here. Is it coming in at 30%? And then what percent of the capacity is in the markets that are 12 months or less here in the fourth quarter?","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","So, for Q3, the new markets, it's 6% of our capacity. It's all of our growth basically for Q3. Your stats are almost exactly on. And generally, those are the numbers that we would look at. We would look at a year one ramp that gets to about 80% of the region's average. So, we break our network into 13 regions, and they were below that in Q3, which we would expect it because we started them in Q3, so you have all these outbound \u2013 or the returns of the initial outbounds have nobody on them, but they were in the 65-ish percent to 70% range, and they're moving up.","Daniel J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Just, Brad, you provided some commentary on having most of the merger integration stuff wrapped up by middle next year. You've got a big pilot contract to address next year. And looking beyond, I think you've also got some other labor cost pressure outside of the pilots. Just wondering, I mean, from where you guys sit today, do you feel like you will be able to resume EPS growth in 2019? Because it seems like 2018 \u2013 it seems like you're going to have a hard time growing EPS next year. But I mean, just looking after 2019, the way you guys sort of see your labor cost developing, assuming kind of status quo, macroeconomic environment, I mean, was there an opportunity to actually resume earnings growth in 2019?","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Darryl, we sort of have a proud tradition. I'm not talking about time period that far out. But what I would say is that there is a lot of dislocation right now that we discussed. We are sort of consumed with getting the merger done. We're having a fair bit of cost pressure right now. As we enter some of these new markets, we're getting pushed back that's affecting some of the fares. I do think we're in a transition period now, and I sort of see some choppy water getting better as we look forward. We don't know fuel, the economy, (54:50), a lot of things we don't know about 2019. So, it's probably not smart for us to make a lot of estimates. That's something you guys are probably better positioned to do than us. But I think this firm, this company is going to be through our transition. We're going to be settled down and operating. We'll be in much, much better place by honestly the middle of next year.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. I mean, if you had to kind of characterize the labor pressure that's still to come beyond what you said on the pilots, would you say overall it's kind of more significant than what you're going to see on the pilots in the aggregate or less significant than what you'll see from the pilots in the aggregate?","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Darryl, it's Ben Minicucci. Well, for 2018, we have one contract that's amenable (55:31). There are three coming open. I guess, what we'll say is our philosophy has been \u2013 it's going to be consistent, just like it's been with pilots (55:40) where arbitration is. But we have a principle on being a low-fare, low-cost, high-growth airline. And that dictates having a certain cost structure and labor cost that needs to be consistent with that. That's going to be our strategy going in. The market will dictate where that lies, but that's going to be our strategy going in. So, it's hard for us to predict how much pressure is going to be around there, but I'm just telling you that's our mindset going in with every labor contract.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for the time.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hi, Rajeev.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hi, Rajeev.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just coming back to the comments around developing markets going into next year, can you maybe talk about or quantify what the opportunity is around it? Maybe just quantify what the headwinds were this year, just from having that much in the system.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Rajeev, I think I'll answer this more generally, and that is \u2013 I mean, you heard Brad's remarks around the integration, but our partners now have 46 wide-bodies a day departing San Francisco and Los Angeles globally. All of that traffic and all the rest of it will come on. We'll get our share of that as we work together. As we put in premium class and reconfigure aircraft, as we grow the loyalty program, as we mature the markets, as we get better with revenue management, and as we tweak the schedules going forward. I think the way I would answer that to say we see only \u2013 I'll say I only see upside in all the things coming together, single reservation systems, premium class, getting our first-class cabin configured, densifying our aircraft, building the loyalty. I just see exciting things for us going forward. And so, while I can't comment on specific markets, the portfolio, I believe is going to do well.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. That was it. Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Rajeev.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Oh. Thanks, operator. Hey. Thanks for getting me in towards the end of the call here. I just have a couple of questions. One, when you think about the Horizon training schedule were coming up on the holidays, are your classes filled through that period or will there be a pause while the holidays occur and then resume again in the New Year?","David L. Campbell - Horizon Air Industries, Inc.","Hi, Helane. This is Dave Campbell. We are set for the balance of the year in terms of a steady flow of pilots that have come into the company that are in training right now. We've pulled the schedule down to match the level. So, I have no concerns at all about the holidays. We've actually got a lot of help from the unions on a process called unstacking, which allows us to actually better cover the holiday periods with reserves. So, I feel really good going into the holidays both for Thanksgiving and through January 1.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then I don't know who should answer this question, but I noticed that you dropped your fees on carrying odd, oversized items to $25. And I'm just kind of wondering if the revenue impact is kind of just a rounding error, A. And, B, the other part of the question is really with regard to OTAs and if they don't understand your pricing and maybe can align with what you're doing, why don't you pull your capacity out of those providers and kind of push everybody to alaska.com.?","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Hi, Helane. This is Shane. Yeah, the reduction in sort of sporting equipment is the way we sort of went out with it. Yeah, it was a very, very small overall amount of revenue, and I think it got incredibly good press and play on it. And I think it's a great thing for our customers on the West Coast people. These are near and dear to their hearts. They got a lot of outdoor activities, and we received a lot of sort of good support and response from customers on that. So, we're happy to do it.","On the OTA thing, it's still a large enough distributor of tickets that it probably doesn't make sense for us to just walk away from it. And we're more interested in optimizing the channel and working with our partners. And Expedia is a very large one. They're right up the street from us. We have a good relationship with them. Google is another one. We have a really good relationship. So, we just need to get the way that they merchandise the products to be a little more clear, which is what we're working on.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Good. Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Helane.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Bye, Helane.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for getting us in the queue as well. Andrew or Brandon, I just want to get a point of clarification here because my inbox is lit up with all sorts of questions on your revenue outlook here. Did you say the 4Q range is going to be better than where you were in September? Can you just remind us?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","From what we're seeing today, we are seeing it to be better than September, but we don't want to add more color to that.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that clarification. So, if I were to dissect this call, I think I heard three things. I'm not quite sure where we can place the weakness. So, you guys talked about weaker walk-up fares as expected (01:01:13) even though demand is okay. You talked about new markets that I guess are maturing along the schedule that you would expect, but I guess, that did impact your relative revenue performance here. But I guess, what troubles me and I think Brad mentioned this earlier, you said your legacy Alaska network actually had flat PRASM, but Virgin, I believe, was down was it 7% or 8% you said, Brad?","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I guess, when I hear that, I mean, I understand, Andrew, you're talking about city presence and relevance and everything else. But is there something working underneath the surface here where you guys have lost some customer loyalty at Virgin are you seeing book away? Because I hear the walk-up fares in California, but we're just not hearing that same pressure at some of your very closely overlapping peers.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, is there something else going on at Virgin right now?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","No. As I shared and I don't want to go into details, but our loyalty growth is very, very strong. And again, the whole premise here is that we bought this huge base, and we have nothing but improvements that we'll be making...","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","...to that across every major commercial lever. And I think what you're seeing, just to be putting it bluntly here is the industry is reacting to our new reality here in California, and that's what we have.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you very much.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Joe.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, I guess, at the Investor Day, you guys gave the revenue synergy target of $240 million. The problem with that number a little bit is that as fares come down that most revenue synergy buckets would also come down. The one that doesn't is the credit card program. So, can you just talk about the \u2013 I guess, this is for Brandon \u2013 the process of realizing the incremental earnings from the credit card? Is it just as simple as bringing Virgin customers over to the Alaska card or do you actually need to kind of go to BofA and renegotiate? Just talk about how that works and maybe what the incremental earnings are expected to be next year.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Good morning, Joe. I'm glad we got you in.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","No, it's not a matter of renegotiation at all. We're actually satisfied with our contract with BofA right now. It's a long-term deal. So, we have no plans to go out right now and to renegotiate that deal. Although I will say BofA has been very helpful, and we expect them to continue to be helpful providing incentives for us to attract members to the Alaska Airlines credit card. We do have a process going right now to get people from the Virgin America card over to the Alaska card. But it's more than just conversion. It is growing that credit card presence in California. We gave you some information in Investor Day that even with small penetration, the economics are going to be powerful. I'm not going to give you any quote earnings or EPS number in terms of what that means, but what we will say is that the credit card, as you well know, is a strong driver of cash flow and an economic engine in this company, and we would continue to see that as being an opportunity as we grow the base.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And then, Brandon, just I guess, kind of on top of that, on page four, you guys provide your income statement, and you kindly break out freight and mail revenue. I don't really think anybody cares about freight and mail revenue. Would it make more sense to break out the commission revenue that you received from the card instead of that so investors have something to look at and quantify the benefit of the loyalty program?","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Joseph, it's Ben. I think our cargo (01:04:59-01:05:06) for all our cargo employees out there.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","That is really hard, Joe. It's a fair point just to evaluate what the classification is on the front of the P&L. What I will tell you is that we give plenty of detail in the footnotes, and so you'll have to wait two weeks to get that.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Fair enough. Thank you.","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thank you, Joe.","Bradley D.

Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Just a quick follow-up and you sort of touched on this earlier, but how confident are you that the close-in weakness isn't related to the advent of basic economy at the competitive level and does this cause you to rethink your strategy at all in regards to that product?","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Jamie, this is Shane. Yeah, confidence, look, right now, we're watching basic really closely.

Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for analysts and journalists. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Investor Relations, Lavanya Sareen. Please go ahead, sir.","Lavanya Sareen","Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Alaska Air Group's first quarter 2016 earnings call. On the call today, our CEO, Bradley Tilden, will provide an overview of the business; our Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Harrison, will share the revenue results for the quarter; followed by Brandon Pedersen, our CFO, who will discuss our financial results, capital allocation plans, and outlook for 2016. Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.","As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. We've provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","In addition, today's call may be deemed a solicitation in respect of Alaska Air Group's contemplated acquisition of Virgin America. The information discussed today is qualified in its entirety by the proxy statement that Virgin America will be filing in the future. And that will be available on Virgin America's inventor relations page at ir.virginAmerica.com. All right. With that lengthy disclosure done, let's look at the results.","This morning Alaska Air Group reported the first quarter GAAP net profit of $184 million. Excluding the small important of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio, Air Group reported a record adjusted net income of $183 million. That's up 23%. Earnings per share grew by 29.5%, $1.45 per share. The higher growth rate in EPS is driven by over 7.3 million shares that we have repurchased during the last 12 months.","Additional information about cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging capital expenditures, and other items can be found in our investor update included in our form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com. And now, I'll turn the call over to Brad.","Bradley Tilden","Thanks, Lavanya. And good morning, everyone. Before I jump into the results for this quarter, I want to talk for a minute about our proposed acquisition of Virgin America. Virgin America and Alaska share similar philosophies about building alignment with and taking care of our people and about putting customers first. Both of us run strong operations. We're both recognized for our terrific customer service. We both have a great onboard product, and we have two of the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleets in the industry.","We're excited about bringing together two great airlines to create an airline that will have a national footprint and one that we believe will be the premier airline for people that live anywhere along the West Coast. The next steps in the process involve a vote by Virgin America shareholders sometime in the second quarter, and a review by the Department of Justice.","We believe this combination strengthens our two airlines and enhances competition from the innovative and low-fare segment of the market. So, we are hoping for swift clearance to close which could be a 60 days or less. Even if the DOJ decides that the deal warrants a closer look, we hope to have clearance well before the end of the year.","In the meantime, we remain focused on execution and integration planning. On that front, I want to share that Ben Minicucci, our Chief Operating Officer will be leading the charge on integration. He understands operations very well and while he drives hard for results, he cares a lot about people and that is the real key to success. We're all fully invested on this. But we're also very excited to see Ben do great things with this responsibility.","We're working hard to lay out the groundwork for smooth integration and part of that is making sure our stand-alone business is humming along nicely. So, let's talk about the business that our team of 15,000 people is running today. Lavanya just shared the numbers and its evidence that we're performing well financially, but it's also important to note that the industry as a whole is a lot healthier and producing strong results.","What I'm really proud of is that our team is continuously moving the ball forward. We're off to a strong start in 2016 on almost every front. Let's start with the operation. Our people continue to do a great job of running a good operation. 87.5% of our mainline flights arrived on time in the quarter, and that's up 2.5 points from 2015 and I think Horizon's on-time performance will be even higher than that and our completion rate was 99.3%. We expect that both our mainline on-time performance and our completion rate will lead the eighth largest domestic airlines.","Now, let's talk about customer service which we believe is what really differentiates airlines. Our people are taking great care of our customers in providing them an experience that is unique in this industry. Our customer satisfaction rating of 86.3% is a new record for the first quarter and reflects the time and effort spent by our team last year conducting customer service workshops which we called Beyond Service.","Our customers are rewarding us with their loyalty and voting with their wallets, literally, by signing up for the Alaska Airlines Credit Card. Both programs continue to grow at unprecedented rates and are providing us loyal customers, which make our network growth more successful and more profitable. Andrew will talk more about this in a moment.","Our growth is providing greater options to our customers and generating strong returns for our owners. Our network team does a great job of identifying demand and then matching that demand with the right amount of capacity or supply. Sometimes this means getting out of routes that don't meet our return targets, like LA to Vancouver. Sometimes, this means making small refinements to the schedule, and sometimes it means tapping into new opportunities.","We've added 41 new markets over the last two years, and five of them came in the most recent quarter. 41 markets in the aggregate are not only profitable, but are producing fully-allocated returns that are meaningful to our overall business and well-above our cost to capital. What's more remarkable is that the five markets added in the last quarter are already profitable, and three of them are producing returns that are higher than our cost of capital. So, our strategy is working.","Our folks are running a strong operation and taking care of customers onboard and on the ground. And we're deploying capacity and markets where we enjoy strong customer loyalty. And our assets are producing returns that exceed our cost of capital. And these returns are reflected in the numbers that you saw this morning.","Now, let's look at those numbers. Our net income for the quarter was $183 million, which was 23% higher than 2015. When we factor in the 7.3 million shares we bought back over the last 12 months, our earnings per share of $1.45 increased 29.5%. We expect this EPS growth to lead all but 36 companies in the S&P 500. In fact, our strong EPS growth stands in contrast to the average company in the S&P 500 where earnings are expected to shrink by 3.5%.","Our pre-tax margin grew by 260 basis points to 21.5% bringing our trailing 12-month pre-tax margin to 24.5%. We expect this to be one of the best margins in the industry. And we also expect it to lead about 80% of the company in the S&P 500. And finally, our ROIC for the trailing 12 months of 25.6% is more than 3 times our cost of capital and substantially higher than high-quality industrials in the S&P 500.","As we look forward, our 15,000 employees are operating safely and they're taking care of our customers and each other. Our core business is strong and we're seeing robust demand for our product. And as a result, our business is producing the sort of returns that you should expect from high-quality industrials.","I want to thank everybody here, our very talented and dedicated front line employees as well as a terrific leadership team, all of whom are working very hard to produce these strong results and just as importantly to position us to continue to do so in the future.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter revenue performance was solid especially when compared to the industry. We grew revenues by $78 million or 6.1% while industry revenues declined 1%. We're able to achieve these revenue results in the face of 13% competitive [audio gap] (09:51).","Our load factors remained high while growing our own capacity 12.9%. Despite expanding capacity over two times the industry, our RASM decline of 6.1% was within 50 basis points of the industry. A growth enabling us to continue to offer our customers more destinations, grow our revenues and most importantly grow a diverse and stable earnings stream.","A strong business performance is a result of a number of key drivers. First, adding new markets is giving our customers more nonstop choices as well as providing greater options for connecting passengers. In the last 12 months, we've added 23 new markets to our network. In retail [indiscernible], we are putting new products on the shelf and they're selling.","Second, we have new regional jets that enable us to provide customers with nonstop service to destinations previously could only access via one or two stops.","Seven, about 23 markets launch in the past 12 months were only made viable due to the introduction of the Embraer 175. This aircraft delivers the trip costs and range to ensure longer, thin markets can be served profitably. We're excited about the possibilities of this aircraft and Brandon will share a little more about our delivery stream in just a minute.","Third, our costs have come down approximately 1% for the 12-month period ending March 2016 while we expect industry costs have risen by about 3%. That's a net GAAP of 4 points in just one year. Our low costs are a sustainable advantage allowing us to offer low fares and enabling our growth.","Fourth, the combination of a reliable operation, customer friendly service, growing destinations and low fares is helping us continue to grow our loyalty customer base. Our loyalty program gives members access to over 950 destinations worldwide. We grew our active membership another 12% on the heels of 15.5% growth in 2015. Our base of loyalty members is actually 30% larger today than it was two years ago which is remarkable for a mature program especially in the face of vigorous competition. And then, lastly, with respect to the credit card accounts, they're up over 12% for the quarter. That's the highest growth since 2010. In addition, the revised economics of our newest credit card agreement is helping our revenue performance. For the first quarter, we're tracking ahead of plan and on track to achieve our annual run rate of $60 million.","We expect our growth in card members to remain strong because come June 1, we'll be able to go to market with new cardholder products we negotiated with our new agreement and includes a 30,000 bonus miles on approval that's an increase of 20% from today and a free bag. In addition, new and existing members will no longer incur international transaction fees. We believe that this is the best airline credit card offering in the market, bar none.","As we shift our focus to the second quarter, I want to highlight a few data points around capacity and demand. Let's start with capacity. Alaska's capacity will be up approximately 11% in the second quarter. Almost half of that growth is driven by new markets we launched over the last year and about a third is driven by the increase in our stage length. Said another way, ASM growth from core departures will only contribute 2%, which we believe is in line with the strength of the economy in the markets we serve. We expect capacity growth in the second half of 2016 to slow down to 5.5% to 6.5% which puts our expectation for the full year capacity growth at 8%.","Moving to competitive outlook, we expect competitive capacity to remain elevated through the summer, up 14% for Q2 and Q3. This is 1 point higher than competitive capacity in the first quarter. Also as a reminder, the shift of the Easter holiday to March is expected to reduce April PRASM by about 1 point.","As we look ahead to the rest of 2016, we will continue to grow our revenue base and deliver strong results. And here's why? First, over 90% of our capacity is deployed in domestic markets. Nearly all U.S. point of sale and demand continues to remain solid.","Secondly, you might recall that 18 of the 21 new markets added last year started in the last six months of 2015. So, as we move through this year, the percentage of our capacity in markets that have operated less than 12 months drops from 5.5% in the first half of this year to 2.5% in the second half of 2016.","Third, we expect to introduce Premium Class in September with 75 aircraft in service by year-end. This will help with both revenue and loyalty growth. While the contribution in 2016 is marginal, we expect Premium Class to add about $85 million in annual profit by 2018. So in summary, we're running a solid operation, taking great care of our customers. The first quarter saw us adding new aircraft, cities, customers, loyalty members, revenue, and profit, all against the backdrop of an industry that shrank revenue this quarter.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks, Andrew, and hey, everyone. As you've heard, Air Group's adjusted net profit improved by 23% and EPS grew by 29% to a $1.45 a share. Our trailing 12-month ROIC of 25.6% was 550 basis points higher than at the end of this point last year. On an adjusted pre-tax basis, we earned $290 million, a $50 million or 21% increase over prior year. Revenues grew by $78 million, fuel cost declined by $66 million, and those gains were offset by a $94 million increase in non-fuel cost. This is the seventh consecutive year of profitability in the seasonally weak first quarter, and profit has increased steadily for each of those seven years.","Consolidated non-fuel unit costs were down 1.2%. Our leaders are doing a good job managing divisional cost to budget and hitting productivity metrics. For example, our broadest measure of productivity passengers per FTE is tracking at 1.8% better than planned on main line. Our flight ops group is spot on their hard time plan, and our maintenance division productivity is tracking slightly ahead of plan, just to name a few. Our people understand how high productivity is an important source of our cost advantage.","For the second quarter, we forecast unit cost ex-fuel to be down 1%, and for the full year, we now expect ex-fuel cost to decline by 0.5%. There are three main drivers from the change from our initial full year guidance. First, we've changed our performance-based pay or PBP plan to increase the participation level for our supervisors and our managers. These are incredibly important roles, and our board wanted to have their PBP participation better reflect their level of responsibility. PBP has been and continues to be a very strong driver of engagement among our employees.","Next, third party regional expense was understated in our initial guidance. The new guidance now properly reflects the increase in SkyWest CPA flying cost through the year, and finally, new minimum wage requirements in certain markets are having a greater impact than we initially modeled. In addition, our results in Q1, and thus our full year forecast, include some costs associated with our Virgin America deal. Going forward, we'll be excluding deal and integration cost from our guidance since the timing and amount of these costs are variable. We also began excluding them from our adjusted results.","Even with the revised cost guidance, 2016 will the 14th year out of the last 15 for mainline cost reduction and the 7th year in a row for Air Group. As a result, our cost advantage over the legacy carriers will further widen this year.","Turning into fuel. Our economic fuel cost per gallon was $1.29, down from a $1.98 in Q1 of last year which contributed to the $66 million decline in economic fuel expense. Our fuel burn, on a ASM per gallon basis improved by another 1.8% since Q1 last year and will just continue to get better as we work to the retirement of the 737-400 classics by the end of 2017 and replace them with 737-900 ERs which are 25% more fuel efficient.","Our cash flow from operations was $527 million and we ended the quarter with nearly $1.6 million in cash. Even after adjusting for leases, we're in a net cash position of almost $600 million. Our debt to cap including leases, now stands at 26%. Our net cash position, the 95 unencumbered in our fleet are investment-grade balance sheet and our long track record of conservative financial management put us in a strong position to raise the capital necessary to fund the proposed acquisition of Virgin America.","Our treasury team is hard at work with potential lenders. Initial results are very encouraging, both in terms of the number of and diversity of lenders that want to work with us. Andrew mentioned the order for E175s. We're excited to add this jet to the Horizon fleet and the profit opportunity that it opens up in new markets. We're impressed with Embraer's commitment to working by our side as the Horizon team incorporates the E175 efficiently into our operation.","We currently have seven SkyWest E175s operating on our network and expect to have 15 by the end of the year. Horizon will start taking delivery of the E175 in 2017. The Q400 will continue to fly our shorter routes and Bombardier remains an important business partner of ours. In the Mainline operations, we took delivery of six 737-900ERs in the first quarter, and we'll take another 13 by year-end.","On an Air Group stand-alone basis, we're currently expecting CapEx to be approximately $750 million this year which includes $685 million of CapEx associated with firm orders and $70 million of CapEx for Boeing 737 options that we are likely to exercise.","We've produced over $400 million of free cash flow in the first quarter of 2016 alone further strengthening our balance sheet while allowing us to continue to return capital to our owners. Through yesterday, we repurchased a total of 2.1 million shares for $161 million or 1.7% of the shares outstanding as of the beginning of the year. We also paid $34 million of dividend so far this year.","As we announced on April 4, we're planning to slow share repurchases in order to help fund the acquisition. We expect total share repurchases for 2016 to be between $190 million and $200 million. So, when combined with our dividend which will continue and is currently yielding 1.4%, we expect total return to shareholders to be about $325 million this year.","We're off to a great start in 2016 but we have much work ahead as we go through the integration effort. Although there's a lot going on, we're mindful that we need to remain focused on the core business. We're going to maintain the same level of discipline and budget rigor so that we hit our operational and financial goals. I'm super focused on the risk that we lose a bit of budget discipline with the integration work. And we're setting up controls now to ensure that that does not happen.","I want to thank everyone involved in the integration in advance for the huge effort that they're about to undertake to combine Alaska and Virgin America into the premier airline for people on the West Coast.","And with that, let's go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll pause for just a moment and compile the Q&A roster. And your first question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Savanthi Syth","Hey. Good morning.","Bradley Tilden","Hey, Savi.","Andrew Harrison","Savi.","Savanthi Syth","Based on the \u2013 hey. On the CapEx front, we are seeing this step-up in 2017 even without the options. And wondering if you could provide a little bit more color [indiscernible] the next couple of years on CapEx and the likelihood of those options. And then also maybe on the funding side, I know there's $2 billion related to the acquisition. Are you planning to raise any more debt beyond that? And with the E175, any chance of the sale leaseback or is that financing?","Brandon Pedersen","Hey, Savi. It's Brandon. Maybe I'll start with the first, then Mark can take the second. In terms of CapEx specifically for 2017, if you look at our old guidance on the firm, it was about $620 million. Our new guidance on firm is $925 million. That change is about $300 million. Nearly all of that is related to the E175 purchase. So, if you just look at those 30 firms, kind of the way it staggers out is $40 million in 2016, $280 million in 2017, and roughly $250 million in 2018 and 2019. So, the big increase in CapEx is simply related to the regional jet order that we placed.","Mark Eliasen","Great. Savi, this is Mark. Good morning. On the financing side, we are going to raise the $2 billion as we talked about a couple of weeks ago. And that process is going very well. We're getting strong demand. We've got exceptional collateral and it's a rare opportunity really for a lot of these lenders to work with Alaska because as you know we haven't been borrowing over the last six or seven years.","Going forward, we're going to manage leveraging that 40% to 50% range and borrow for some aircraft and pay cash for some aircraft.","Savanthi Syth","Very helpful. Thank you. And just for the second question on the State of Alaska and I know there has been some concerns with the budgetary cuts there and the [indiscernible] oil and gas sector there that there might be some demand impact. Could you talk about what you're seeing there and how's that impacted demand?","Joseph Sprague","Savi, this is Joe. If I screw this up, Andrew can correct me on the demand, but I don't we've seen anything really appreciable up or down with respect to demand in the State of Alaska. We're heading into the summer months and they are expecting a record summer for tourism.","So, I think our numbers over the next few months are likely to be quite strong. But with respect to the oil-and-gas traffic, there's still a fair bit of exploration activity happening on the North Slope and I think things have been more or less steady.","Savanthi Syth","Yeah. It's very helpful. Thank you.","Unidentified Participant","Thanks, Savi.","Bradley Tilden","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hey, gentlemen. Thanks for the time. I wanted to ask about just competitive capacity, I guess, specifically from the ULCCs. They've added some in recent weeks and months, and I was just curious to see how that's been playing out. If there has been just a rational competition if you will or anything like that, that's the first question.","Andrew Harrison","Hey, Rajeev, it's Andrew. From our perspective, the competitive capacity hasn't materially changed as it relates to the ULCCs that's both in Portland and Seattle about eight departures a day. And if you look at our competitive capacity numbers, which we've been dealing with double-digit numbers since the fourth quarter of 2014, over 70% of that is actually from the big network carriers. So, again, we remain vigilant as it relates to competition, but there's been no material changes for us since the last time we spoke.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. But in terms of places where the ULCCs have added, the pricing activity hasn't sort of gotten out of control or hasn't been incredibly weak with new legacies matching the sorts of welfares or anything like that?","Andrew Harrison","I mean, I'll take this Shane because we have seen some pricing activities that really more coming from the majors versus anything else.","Shane Tackett","Yes, Rajeev. Yes, in Vegas and LA, it's a little hard to say if [indiscernible] ULCCs because there's been a lot of capacity from others coming into those markets. There are full flights, the demand has been really strong. There are lower prices in the market, but we haven't had to use them at time, and so our goal is just to use as many of the discount prices as we have to and get back into our structure. And we do a good job of that and haven't been too concerned about what's going on in those two markets.","Rajeev Lalwani","Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.","Unidentified Participant","Thank you.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks, Rajeev.","Operator","And your next question comes from Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Michael Linenberg","Yes. Hey. Two questions here. It looks like that Horizon's margin performance had declined March quarter versus fourth quarter, and maybe I'm doing the numbers wrong, but it look like you had like a 9% operating margin last quarter, and it look like it actually went negative this quarter. Is that right or is there some sort of one-off in the numbers that's on this thing?","David Campbell","Michael, this is David Campbell. What you're seeing there is the restructuring cost from our commit to compete size window was about $7 million worth of cost from severance pay for the reduction in force, as well as a signing bonuses. That's the bulk of the shift that you've seen. Operationally, the revenue I think is still very solid there. We were down a little bit in terms of capacity for the first two months of the year. We actually pulled down two lines of flying just to make sure we have enough focus on taking care of our customers.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. Great. Thanks, David. And then, my second question. This is to Mark. Mark, when you mentioned the $2 billion of financing and how there was a positive response to the market, you talked about, you mentioned exceptional collateral, is the $2 billion financing that's being used for the Virgin deal, is that all secured or you're going to look to do a mix of secured and unsecured? What's going on there?","Bradley Tilden","Yeah, Mike. That's a great question, and I would say that it will be all secured. We are able to do unsecured. We just like the pricing frankly better on the secured borrowing. 737-800 and 737-900 that we have are very new. We've got over 70 of those really desirable aircraft. They're unencumbered, and it's just a great source of borrowing.","Andrew Harrison","And my comment to that is I've asked that question to these guys several times, should we be doing some unsecured and the pricing does look attractive but it's just not good enough to take you there instead of to secure financing.","Bradley Tilden","Yeah. And we will be an unsecured borrower at some point. Just for this transaction it made sense to use that collateral we have.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. Great. Is that just all, is that aircraft assets or would you consider, I mean, I know you do have some slots at airports like Reagan National, and I'm sure you also probably have some hard assets maybe you could potentially pledge, or is it a 100% aircraft?","Bradley Tilden","This will be 100% aircraft. We do have a lot of assets, but the aircraft is what will get us the lowest rate, frankly.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Bradley Tilden","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Your next question from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Hunter Keay","Hey. Good morning.","Bradley Tilden","Hello there.","Hunter Keay","Hey. How you doing? So, okay. Hey, Andrew, as we look at your own growth slowing and your competitor capacity growth, I don't know, maybe slowing a little bit in the fourth quarter. Is there a scenario where Alaska actually starts outperforming the industry on RASM again in the second half or towards the end of the year in sort of an [indiscernible] environment and let me give you an out if you don't want to answer that way. Is there a scenario where maybe the improvement in the rate of change in PRASM actually moves faster than your capacity decelerates for whatever reason as we move through the year?","Andrew Harrison","Thank you for testing my intellectual ability here, Hunter. What I can tell you is that when we look at this we do still believe that really the pricing environment is somewhat connected to the price of fuel today.","As you know, we don't give guidance that far out. What I will tell you though, is that our load factors are based \u2013 they were flat in March. They were \u2013 they'll be flat in April and they'll be flat in May. So, we're seeing good solid demand as we come into the peak season for us.","Hunter Keay","Got it. All right. That's cool. And then, I only want to ask two questions, so I'm going to ask a sort of a loaded one. Ben, can you talk to me about your plan of attack on integration at a high level? Are you going to be using consultants and then just \u2013 can you have maybe some targets that maybe we're not going to see underneath the surface and as you ramp up the integration process, are you going to be more inclined to maybe slow the organic growth a little bit?","And then also, a separate question for Brad. Can you talk to us about how the meetings went with DOJ?","Brandon Pedersen","We'll get Ben to answer the first one and I cannot talk to you because I wasn't in them, but we'll get Kyle Levine \u2013 we'll see if he's willing to say anything about the DoJ meetings.","Hunter Keay","Great.","Brandon Pedersen","Well, go ahead.","Benito Minicucci","Good morning, Hunter. It's Ben. Yeah. I'm really excited so far at how we've begun this integration process. At this point, we've created the structure of which how we're going to attack the integration. We're starting to fill the structure with strong team members. I've been down to San Francisco a couple of times. I met with their folks. So, we've got a lot of strong momentum.","I will tell you that we are focused on and we're going to be disciplined at achieving the revenue and cost synergies that we identified through our due diligence. And a little bit about us, a little bit about me. We're going to be extremely disciplined with metrics and score cards as we drive this thing through. But we're going to be also very sensitive to the cultural and the brand niches that we have to bring together as well.","So, I'm extremely positive and optimistic we're going to do this well. And our goal is to do this hopefully in a way that people can look back and say this is one of the best integrations that's been executed in a long time.","Hunter Keay","Okay.","Unidentified Participant","Hey, Hunter. This is Kyle. So, as you know, the regulatory review situation is just getting started. But what I'll say is so far so good. I'm not going to presume to say what the DoJ is going to \u2013 how they're going to view it or what timing they're going to impose. But I'll tell you that we're answering their questions. And we're working really hard to show them why we think this is such a good combination for consumers and competition. And we are hoping, conservatively, that we're going to have closing before the end of the year.","Hunter Keay","Thank you, Kyle.","Brandon Pedersen","Hey, Hunter. It's Brandon. Just to add one more thing, you asked about our use of consultant fee. We are going to use some consultants. But one of the controls that I talked about in my prepared remarks is how much we're going to use on consultants. We're going to keep a very tight lid on that. Price matters a lot. We want to build the talent internally and take ownership internally. And so, while there will be consultants, the budget for consultants is going to be tightly controlled.","Hunter Keay","Great. Thanks, Brandon.","Brandon Pedersen","Yeah. Thanks, Hunter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much, operator. Hi, guys. Thank you very much for taking my question. One of the things that we are seeing a lot of here on the East Coast is \u2013 and we're seeing in Seattle, really increased security lines. I mean, people having to wait more than, maybe, 20 minutes up to an hour sometimes. And I'm just kind of wondering how you guys are thinking about handling that as you go into the busy summer months because SeaTac is pretty close to full capacity at this point. And you've got a lot of people wanting to fly and yet, you don't really have the staffing that you need \u2013 the TSA, actually, doesn't have the staffing you need to process all those passengers. How are you thinking about that for the summer?","Benito Minicucci","Hi, Helane. It's Ben. We actually met with the TSA administrator messenger and we had a real positive meeting. I came away actually feeling a lot more optimistic than when I went into it. They are on top of the problem. They understand their staffing issues. They're looking at technology. They're looking at dogs. Adding more dogs which actually accelerates the screening process. What I'll say, from a month ago to now, we have seen improvements in Seattle. And I'm actually \u2013 we're actually going to use also third-party vendors in certain parts of the screening process to help TSA move their staffing where it's critical. So, we're looking at all our key airports and working hand in hand with the TSA. This is now just a TSA problem, this is everyone's problem. And I'm actually more optimistic than I was going into the summer. They know it's a big issue and they're focused on it.","Helane Becker","Okay. Is that going to cost you more money?","Benito Minicucci","There will be some cost not \u2013 I don't think it's going to be material just to help with some screening, just identification \u2013 personnel identification prior to entering the screening process.","Helane Becker","Okay. Thanks, Ben. Brandon, I just had a question about interest expense. It was $13 million in the quarter, up from $11 million. And yet your debt went down a little bit. So why did that extra $2 million occur? And can you also say what the credit card contributed in the first quarter?","Benito Minicucci","Helane...","Andrew Harrison","Go ahead. [Ph] Chris will take that.","Unidentified Participant","Hey, Helane. This is [ph] Chris.","Helane Becker","Okay. Thanks. Hi, [ph] Chris.","Unidentified Participant","On the interest expense line item, one of the things that happened that you might recall we \u2013 at the end of the year last year, we had a \u2013 for this proposition one here in Seattle, we had to sort of accrue some staff wages associated with that. There's some statutory interest on those staff wages that we recorded in the first quarter. So that's why the interest is up even though debt is down. So that's related to that.","And then the credit card, really, the mileage plan overall sort of on that other line item, really, was up about $25 million, $30 million in the quarter. So that was kind of the contribution there and a lot of that is driven by, again, the new credit card deal that we have and the new economic on that deal started in January and then just the volume. As Andrew mentioned in his remarks, credit cardholders are up 12%. So that really drove volume in the number of miles that we sold to the affinity partner.","So overall, it's really good economics and really good result for the quarter on that.","Helane Becker","Great. Thanks very much for your help.","Unidentified Participant","Anytime.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamie Baker","Hey. Good morning, everybody. As you know, I happen to be in the Bay Area when the deal was announced, and I must say that as a New Yorker, you grossly underestimated just how strong of a cult-like following Virgin has built out there. And I don't ordinarily allow my earnings models to be influenced by passenger preference and stuff like that.","But I'm thinking I might have to make an exception this time. I know it's only been two and a half weeks, but does your analysis still assume that you retain 100% of the Virgin loyalists? It really seems to me that you might be \u2013 you might want to be modeling for some spill there.","Bradley Tilden","Jamie, it's Brad. I'll start. Maybe Andrew wants to pop in. But I think it's a really good question. We were attracted to Virgin because they have built an incredible company in nine years. You are right. There is a very, very strong allegiance to that company. The employees feel tremendous amount of passion for the company and the customers too. And that's \u2013 I'll just think that's why the company is so attractive to us.","So, the biggest challenge, I think, for this leadership team isn't \u2013 we're going to have all kinds of challenges, bringing the [indiscernible] together, bringing this \u2013 doing this safely, integrating collective bargaining agreements, [indiscernible] and all of that. The biggest challenge is going to be bringing the customers together, and that's what we're focused on.","And that's why we've talked a lot about the brand. We're going to go into this with a humble approach. We're going to look at both product sets, the tangible product features. And we're going to look at Virgin's approach, look at Alaska's approach in over 12 or 18 months, make a decision of what's best for our collective customers. As we look at the brand, we're going to think about the brand and do what's best.","But our goal \u2013 I guess what I just want to reassure you, we are aware of the value that that company has brought to its customers. And our goal isn't to lose that. Our goal is to gain that as a foothold in the State of California. It's something that we grow in a decade or two ahead.","In terms of specific modeling, I haven't done any specific modeling on this. Maybe our team has but I think the long-term idea isn't to lose passengers, it's to grow them substantially over the...","Jamie Baker","Sure.","Bradley Tilden","...next 15 years that are in front of us.","Jamie Baker","Have you put any thought into what the costs would be to retrofit your current flying with much of the hard product that makes Virgin so curiously popular \u2013 to me?","Bradley Tilden","There's a lot to be done there. We are really just starting that now, Jamie. We are starting to look at the transcon service out of San Francisco and L.A. to JFK. In particular, the product offering is different than what we've [indiscernible]. But it will be complex analysis. There's RASM implications, there's [indiscernible], there's countless implications. And we're going to try to do this in a way where we are known for innovation, we're known for great service, we're known for low fares.","And for the analyst community, we're known for making money and making returns. So, we've got \u2013 we have a work cut out for us but that's where we're going to be thinking about.","Jamie Baker","Okay. And as a follow-up, other than maybe just an e-mail or a phone call saying congratulations, have either Boeing or Airbus reached out in a meaningful way to start discussing how they might participate in the fleet simplification process? I'm just trying to gauge how eager they might be or if that is a work-in-progress?","Mark Eliasen","Hey, Jamie. This is Mark. I'll just answer it, start out by saying that we have a fabulous relationship with Boeing. We have a terrific partnership and really with all the manufacturers we work with. We don't work directly with Airbus today but we will be talking to them and we anticipate the same type of relationship.","Bradley Tilden","All right. I'll just...","Jamie Baker","Okay.","Bradley Tilden","...that Mark has said, we couldn't be more apperceive of the relationship we have with Boeing. We get treated like an airline that's much bigger than we actually are and they've been fantastic to us.","Jamie Baker","Okay. Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.","Bradley Tilden","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julie Yates","Hi there. Good morning. I'm going to try to crack at Hunter's first question a little differently. So, Andrew, you mentioned you have a 23 new markets for the network in the last 12 months. And as you knew market additions slow in the back half of the year and perhaps into 2017, when do you start to see a tailwind to your unit revenues from the market maturation dynamic and how many could that be?","Andrew Harrison","Julie, I think we're already seeing good tailwinds as we go in. And as Brad mentioned on his remark, I think the bigger issue honestly is just where do competitive capacity numbers continue to be over the remainder of the year and then, really the industry pricing environment. So, I think those two things are the biggest variables for us.","At the end of the day, as we look into the back half of the year, we're entering into a very strong demand periods for us. We feel very confident about how we've setup the summer, how we setup our network, so we feel very good about that.","Julie Yates","Okay. Is there a preliminary estimate on competitive capacity in the fourth quarter?","Andrew Harrison","No. I took a look at that. Honestly, especially with Southwest and others, they not all nailed down. So I look at that and it's a little elevated but I don't believe it. There's a lot of cleanup and through-up that's going to happen over the next few months of the fourth quarter.","Julie Yates","Okay. Got it. And then, are there any trends you can highlight just maybe between leisure and business in Q1? And then, also, just how advanced yields are looking for the peak summer period?","Andrew Harrison","Joe, you should take the business. I can talk leisure.","Julie Yates","Okay.","Joseph Sprague","This is Joe. I'll just mention that the corporate traffic for Alaska Airlines was actually really strong over the last quarter. It did outpace system revenue a bit. And the strength of that is really coming from the Seattle market where the economy is not only doing quite well, but a lot of the large corporations that are headquartered here are some of the most prosperous companies in the country right now. Tech is doing well, professional services, and also the retail sector. Companies like Costco and Amazon are doing well and they're traveling a lot.","And, Julie, the leader side of the business is very strong. As you know, a lot of our ASMs are in the Hawaii and other part of Mexico, East Coast, leisure destination. I might just sort of backtrack on to what Andrew said and mention a couple of other things. From our perspective, if you look at the pricing environment in general, it's actually very stable. There's a little more discount used in the trough periods, that's what we would expect. And if you want \u2013 we don't give guidance, but what I would say is yields most likely to come when and if capacity sort of slows down and oil starts to go up.","And the only other thing I just \u2013 I would want to say is we're here today due to low cost and low fares. And we sort of believe that carrying more people at a slightly lower fair is the best thing long term folks, and we want our customers to know they don't have to aggressively price shop us. And we think over the long term, that's ultimately proud and positive for us.","Julie Yates","Okay. And then, just one more longer term \u2013 maybe, how do we think about the percent of your business that's corporate today and then how you expect that mix to change with the Virgin acquisition, as you have a stronger foothold in major markets like LA and San Francisco in a more expansive network?","Joseph Sprague","Julie, good question. Thanks. This is Joe again. I think today, it's relatively small. We do have great network utility out of Seattle and that sort of overlaps with a lot of corporate activity here in Seattle. Outside of Seattle, historically, we haven't had a strong base for corporate travel. That certainly will change with the Virgin America acquisition. We're really excited to get down and get smarter about what the opportunities are in SoCal and especially in the Bay areas, there are lot of overlapping some of the tech companies between Seattle and the Bay areas. We'll have a little bit of a head start in the relationship there. So, I would just say that we don't have exact numbers today, but that is going to evolve, and I think corporate will become a more important of our network going forward.","And I might just jump on that. Julie, it's the business travel will be important and we will want to be the go-to airline for business travel up and down the West Coast, but [indiscernible] just sent out some updated information, which sort of confirms something a lot of us already do. It basically show the roughly 70% of the market. I think it's a survey period within the last 12 months. 70% of the market in the last 12 months was leisure. And that's up from 50%, Joe, you might remember, but it's 20 years ago or something like that. But the business has just moved more and more towards leisure. And for leisure to work, you got to have a stronger economy business that seems to be doing well. You got to have people with money in their pockets buy tickets. The point I'm making is this we feel really good about this combination with Virgin because we're really well set to serve the high end of that leisure markets as well as the business markets. So, we think we're really in the sweet spot of where the demand is and perhaps and even in underserved segment of the market here.","Julie Yates","Got it. All right. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Fintzen with Barclays. Your line is open.","David Fintzen","Hey, good morning, everyone. Just a quick cleanup question. On the second half capacity growth could, could you repeat that, I thought you said five but also, is it pretty constant through 3Q, 4Q, is it really tail off 4Q?","Andrew Harrison","Hey, David, it's Andrew. It tails off. So, my prepared remarks with 5.5% to 6.5% but it really tails down in the fourth quarter. I do want to add one thing though that as part of our guidance, as you will know, we've applied for two flights to Cuba and also with Newark being, I suppose, unconstrained for some period of time, and we've often wanted to grow in Newark. So, if there is anything to report on opportunity for us in Newark and Cuba, we will update you on that when we have something to update you on, and adjust our guidance for capacity growth.","David Fintzen","Okay. Great. And then just a comment, Brandon. Appreciate sort of not losing budget focus, but you're going to \u2013 there's a lot going on Alaska stand-alone, a lot of innovation you're working on \u2013 you have been working on. And now a deal. What falls off the plate in terms of the initiatives particularly on the standalone Alaska time just to get everything done over the next couple of years?","Brandon Pedersen","That's a great question. It's one we actually talked about the other day. We have a lot of people focus on the integration as you pointed out. And so we're asking the question are there things that should come off the list? Some of the really important and revenue positive stuff like premium class won't, but there probably are some things internally that will slow down that we could move to future years. It's an important question, and one that we haven't answered fully yet.","David Fintzen","Okay. And then just is the IT platform in place where you can \u2013 if you have to kind of go about maintaining the Virgin brand or at least the Virgin revenue premium in maybe a different way, do you have enough flexibility in the IT platform to sort of be innovative around pricing or is that a long-term process in the way we should think about it?","Andrew Harrison","This is Andrew. I mean, we're both \u2013 Virgin America and our sales are on SABRE reservation systems. So, from a platform [indiscernible] booking system, we're in a good place there but a lot of work to be done like anything, we will likely find also the technical challenges.","David Fintzen","I'm sure. Thank you. I appreciate all the color.","Andrew Harrison","Thank you, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Dan McKenzie","Hey, guys. Thanks for the time here. My question, I guess, is perhaps for Brandon or Joe that follows up on the last question. We are seeing some marketing initiatives from your peers with respect to the unbundling and then the rebundling or repackaging of fares. And I'm wondering what work Alaska has done here and how would you characterize the marketing opportunity just in terms of ancillary revenue per passenger?","Shane Tackett","Yeah. I might take that. This is Shane again. We've been sort of interested as the industry has evolved sort of back towards fare families or bundling. We haven't done a lot of that. We haven't need to really. So, it's sort of a greenfield opportunity for us going forward. The biggest ancillary revenue opportunity, as you know, is paid seats and that's really what we're working on the premium economy project that Andrew talked about in the opening remarks and you guys know about. We are starting to think about what happens after that, and I think there are a lot of opportunities for us to look at bundling or fare families, those sorts for things. But it's early days yet for us to talk about what sort of valuation that might have.","Dan McKenzie","Got it. And Shane, I guess, if you could just remind us what is the ancillary revenue per passenger today at Alaska and how do we think about that trajectory?","Shane Tackett","It was $12.91 this last quarter. It was actually up 11.8% then but that was primarily due \u2013 you might recall we had a big credit card or free bag promotion for our loyalty in January, so that's really the driving force of last year where we're giving a lot of way, free bags, but would normalize again. So, it was actually up to $12.91 per passenger.","Brandon Pedersen","And premium economy add something like $3 or $4 to that ultimately.","Dan McKenzie","Okay. Thanks for the time, guys.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Hackel with CRT. Your line is now open.","Adam Hackel","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. You know, while I'm in the queue, I'm going to ask some sort of tech related questions, so here it comes. A couple of things. First of all, I'm just curious more \u2013 kind of coming back to the Virgin products here. Just some personal experience and some \u2013 those I talked throughout in the Bay Area. It seems like you do things very differently but they are kind of smaller things. Just curious what you guys think about things like \u2013 I mean, the ones that are obvious, the moonlighting, the inside video, and the touch screen ordering, all those kinds of smaller in-flight things, how are you guys looking at that in terms of bringing that potentially to Alaska?","Benito Minicucci","Adam, this is Ben. This is what the integration team is going to do. We're going to bring those teams that specialize in those areas and from both airlines, and together with the joint team, we're going to be thoughtful, we're going to be deliberate, and maybe to go back to the other point is we want to make sure we keep the existing Virgin customers and make this thing even better than it is. So we're actually excited about getting our energies behind that. And I think we're going to be in a better place than we are today.","Adam Hackel","Okay. It seems like between the Virgin product than Alaska's, [indiscernible] you have to have a pretty nice combination there. And I guess one more, just we talked about it a little bit before, but in terms of the job versions within the corporate side of kind of Silicon Valley tech world, what are some things that they've done that you guys could potentially apply in Seattle and if you've done anything of that yet?","Benito Minicucci","Sorry Adam, could you \u2013 we missed that first part of that question.","Adam Hackel","Sure. Yes. Just the success that Virgin's had in the corporate side on the Silicon Valley and the [indiscernible]. I know they said 7 of their top 10 corporate accounts were [indiscernible]. So, just some of the things that they may have done that you can maybe learn from and use in your Seattle base.","Unidentified Participant","Hi. This is [indiscernible]. One thing is we've operated down in San Francisco, our sales obviously a much more limited presence, but we've actually had our own corporate sales people in the Bay Area for 25 years. So, we've got a couple of folks down there now that know these accounts.","Obviously, Virgin America has their own team down there and as you've heard from them, they do have good relationships with these companies down there. So, between the small presence we've down there combined with their work side if they can get to know those accounts better and as I've mentioned earlier in the call, a lot of them are companies that also have a presence he in Seattle. So, we're looking to build on those relationships as much as we possibly can.","Bradley Tilden","The other thing I would add to is if you think about global alliances and our foreign flag carriers. I think we will be bringing a very deep and rich portfolio of international carriers to California where we have also reciprocal benefits in earning and burning opportunities. So, we really see opportunity for the corporate both domestic and international travel as we move forward.","Adam Hackel","Great. Thanks, guys.","Bradley Tilden","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Banse with KUOW Radio Seattle. Your line is open.","Tom Banse","All right. Thanks for taking my question. I've got follow-up on the keeping the loyalty of the Virgin customers. I'm curious maybe for Ben or Brad perhaps. Did your meetings down in San Francisco or your assessment of the customer reaction after the acquisition made public change and if you're thinking about how long to keep the Virgin ground house an independent operations?","Brandon Pedersen","Tom, it's Brandon. I'll start and maybe Ben want to jump on as well, but we did have a good meeting down there, I think, a week ago, Tuesday with a huge turnout of Virgin employees. And we also got a chance to walk around the terminal and just sort of visible [indiscernible]. I don't know that it changed our perception, but we did sense firsthand the love those employees have for that company and the loyalty of those customers for the brand and the product.","So, we got closer to it. We sensed it firsthand and that was \u2013 I think that was an important thing for us to experience. So, this \u2013 I must say, we're looking forward to the challenge. I'll just restate the big challenge in front of us is to get all of the value out of this acquisition, but we're really \u2013 the reason we're doing this is to get a foothold in \u2013 a bigger foothold in the State of California, something that we can grow in the decades ahead. I mean, the good news is that the Alaska Airlines is good and building loyalty and growing customers. And that's what we're going to be doing in California and one of these days, we're all really looking forward to that.","Anything you want to add, Ben?","Benito Minicucci","That's perfect, Brad.","Tom Banse","Thank you.","Brandon Pedersen","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Your line is open.","Dominic Gates","Good morning.","Bradley Tilden","Dominic...","Andrew Harrison","Good morning, Dominic.","Dominic Gates","My question is for Brad, can you tell us what has been the financial impact on Alaska of the $15 minimum wage legislation that's gone into effect or has been pressing you? And do you intend to continue fighting it?","Bradley Tilden","Dominic, maybe we'll just chat about that for a minute. I think Alaska's position on that has been misunderstood. When that actually started, it started in the City of SeaTac which is a community here with 11 square miles and our minimum wage at that time went from something like $9, changed to $15. And Alaska's position was, hey, this is kind of a \u2013 the playing field isn't leveled. This is sort of a patchwork way of rolling out a new idea for our society. And so, we've sort of said that this does have the ability to penalize the hometown airline and an airline that we think is a tremendous \u2013 we think we bring a lot of value to the community for customers and employees and so forth.","So, we just said we did push back on the SeaTac minimum wage ordinance. But it was really in the sense of let's do something in a less patchwork fashion. As you know, I think, we, at the same time as we did that, we asked our contractors two or three years ago to take their own minimum wages up from the rates they were to $12 an hour and I think they've gone to $15 an hour now, if I'm not. I think they've all gone to $15 an hour.","So, I guess in that sense, we're not fighting it anymore. They are at $15 an hour. But, yeah, I guess \u2013 the other point, Dominic, that we've tried to make throughout this thing is, I don't know. I think there's a challenge for all of us right now to work with our economies for this economy's benefit, everybody who is participating in the economy. But we don't damage the businesses too much in the process. And that's another point Alaska is trying to make as we roll through this.","But I don't know. So, maybe to summarize where society is going through a process here. We're participants in that process. We want to be \u2013 we want to do our civic duty. We want our \u2013 these jobs to be good jobs for people. But what we do want to do is make sure you've got an environment or an economy where businesses can thrive and grow and bring value to customers and employees and owners.","Dominic Gates","Well, now that it's \u2013 so you're saying that it's essentially been implemented now and you don't have to fight it anymore, has it damaged? What has been the financial impact like in the first quarter of that? Have you been able to assess that?","Brandon Pedersen","Dominic, it's Brandon. Maybe I'll take that. We're not going to share a number only because it's hard to share a number because it's really hard to say how you measure that. Is it just the direct impact on the contractors? And do you measure that from where they were three years ago when it started or versus the voluntary increases that Alaska implemented? And then, how do you measure the impact it has on the other network groups that aren't directly impacted by the $15 an hour. So there's a trickle-down impact into other work groups. So, it's really hard to put a specific number on it. But what I will say is that it has been meaningful. But it's something that is real and we're doing our part here.","Andrew Harrison","Brandon, you guys, we did \u2013 in the fourth quarter we shared a number as we \u2013 as our contractors took their employees to $15 an hour.","Brandon Pedersen","We didn't share the specifics on that.","Andrew Harrison","Oh, we didn't share the number [indiscernible].","Dominic Gates","Yeah. Got it.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Brad Tilden for closing remarks.","Bradley Tilden","Thanks, everybody, for tuning in.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for analysts. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Director of Investor Relations, Matt Grady.","Matt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Amber. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2018 earnings call. On the call today, our CEO, Brad Tilden, will provide an overview of the business; Andrew Harrison, our Chief Commercial Officer, will share an update on our revenue results and outlook; and our CFO, Brandon Pedersen, will discuss our cost performance and cash flows. Several other members of our management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.","Earlier this morning, Alaska Air Group reported second quarter GAAP net income of $193 million. Excluding merger related costs and mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $206 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.66 ahead of the First Call consensus.","As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","And now, I will turn the call over to Brad.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Matt, and good morning everyone. We're halfway through 2018 and 19 months have passed since our merger closed. We're very pleased with the operational and customer service performance of the company and we're very happy to have the vast majority of our systems and processes and facilities integrated and have this work done at a pace that is equal to or more rapid than virtually every other merger in the industry. But we're not satisfied with our financial performance and we're working hard to lean out our cost structure and to achieve revenues in the marketplace that the \u2013 that recover the much higher fuel prices that every airline is experiencing.","Fuel prices have been steadily increasing for 10 quarters now and they are about $1 per gallon higher than they were in the first quarter of 2016. At our volumes, that means we have about $850 million of cost increases. It may be that the early 2016 prices were unusually low, but it's clear that we have higher costs and we need to be focused on taking actions that help us recover these higher costs.","Mergers are complicated as anyone who's been involved in one can attest. Ours has required significant focus and has brought our front line employees through a period of considerable change, transition and growth. At the same time we've been managing rising fuel prices, significant network expansion and elevated competition. Our team has been resilient and has secured a number of important accomplishments that have laid the foundation for our long-term growth and success.","As we sit here today, we believe we've now passed through the inflection point of the merger and while we have a lot of work ahead of us to lean out our cost structure and drive revenues higher, we feel very good about the plan we're putting in place and I'm optimistic about our future.","Before we talk about the work that lies ahead, I'd like to highlight a few of our employees' key accomplishments during the second quarter.","First, on April 24, we transitioned to a single passenger service system with zero disruption to our operation. One of our most basic goals at the outset of the merger was to avoid any negative impact to our customers during the process. And unless you are at one of our 31 Virgin America airports on the night of April 24, you most likely would not have noticed that the PSS conversion occurred. This is a great accomplishment for our team.","Next in June, we reached an agreement in principle with our dispatchers' union which was ratified earlier this month. We now have all but one of our labor groups or 93% of our unionized payroll under single collective bargaining agreements. This is extremely important for any airline, but especially at Alaska where we have such a unique culture that drives our success.","Third, our operation has been running very well. Our team delivered on-time performance of 84.1% in the second quarter, up four points year-over-year. We see operational strength today across our mainline and regional fleets. At Horizon, our on-time performance is the best in the regional industry and our pilot staffing pipeline is full.","Finally, we were very happy to see our employees win the J.D. Power award for the 11th year in a row during the mergers toughest period. This continued recognition by our guest is fantastic and we want to congratulate all of our employees for delivering the differentiated service that makes Alaska what it is. With 85% of the integration work now behind us, the focus of the leadership has fully returned to the basics of running the airline. We are pleased to be getting back to our roots, working together with our people to deliver operational improvements, growing our cost advantage and earning our guest loyalty every day through our fantastic route network, our low fares and our genuine and caring service. This is a group of leaders that have been together for a long time now and we operate the business today with the same philosophy and mentality that we always have. At the same time, we've been fortunate to add a number of new, highly skilled leaders to key post in recent years who are complementing our core strengths and making us stronger.","Today, we're dedicated to realizing the value of our significantly larger platform. This means we're focused on delivering meaningful unit revenue improvements while tightly managing productivity and overhead. After a period of margin declines which have come due to higher fuel prices but also due to the integration, investments in our network and a step function increase in labor costs, margin improvement is our primary focus today.","We believe we're on a path to deliver significant improvement in margins in both 2019 and 2020. And we see four specific opportunities in the near term that will help us do so. These are: first, network optimization; second, increasing upsell and other ancillary revenues; third, improving productivity; and fourth, investing in our culture. Let me address each one of these briefly.","On the network, we are actively managing the ROIC targets at the market level to make adjustments to total capacity and how we allocate it. We're just beginning to capture synergies from cross-scheduling Boeing and Airbus aircraft, which will ramp up between now and early next year. We've made several accretive network adjustments that take affect this quarter and next and are slowing our 2019 growth rate to 2%. More on this ladder change in a moment.","Next, on revenues, we're further segmenting our product to compete more directly with the basic economy fares that have been prevalent in our markets for several quarters now. As we introduce additional choice for our guests, we believe some will prefer the lowest fare while benefiting from an assigned seat and a carryon bag not offered by our competitors, while others will be willing to pay a bit more for the greater ticket flexibility and changeability. We're making changes to other ancillary revenues as well.","On productivity, we're targeting improvements within each operating division to get us back to or better than pre-merger levels, while also aggressively managing overheads. Andrew and Brandon will talk more about these three focus areas in a moment. They're all designed to get us back to our long-term margins and ROIC targets.","Our fourth and final focus area is culture, which is the critical intangible asset that has always enabled Alaska to be different, and that we believe will help us do so in the future. With most of the integration behind us, we're spending more time with our employees, addressing their issues, helping them to be and feel empowered, and to foster the sense of teamwork and camaraderie that results in the genuine and caring service that put Alaska on the map, and that has enabled us to compete effectively with airlines that have far greater scale.","Finally, a note on 2019 capacity. Given the very substantial increase in fuel prices over the last couple of years and a capacity environment that has not adequately adjusted to them, we have reduced our 2019 capacity growth to 2%. As we've said on prior calls, we want to be good stewards of capital, and in this environment, we're just not seeing the returns that justify higher levels of growth. However, given the competitive advantages that we maintain, we think there will be a time in the intermediate term when higher growth will once again make sense for us and our owners.","As we move forward with our initiatives, I'm encouraged by the strong foundation we've laid since the merger closed in late 2016. We're very happy that the integration proceeded at such a rapid clip. We're very happy with our new and expanded route map and the geographies we serve. And we're very encouraged by the loyalty growth that we've seen. From here on, we'll be pulling levers within our control to materially improve the company's financial performance. We have a good plan and I'm confident that this leadership team, and in fact, the entire Air Group team will deliver.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Total revenues for the second quarter rose 3% to $2.2 billion on capacity growth of 7.8%. As we shared on our last call, the second quarter reflected our highest capacity growth of the year, the highest competitive capacity growth of the year and a difficult comp with Easter. In addition, we had a significant increase in award travel following our conversion to a single reservation system in April.","As you know, the conversion went flawlessly from an operational perspective, but it did release pent-up demand for award redemptions on our broader network. In fact, redemptions grew by 22%. Our goal is to make award travel easy for our guests, but we need to balance that with the revenue dilution it creates. We've already made the adjustments necessary to award seats and redemption prices so that the impact of higher award redemptions will moderate by the fourth quarter. So while we are not happy with our unit revenues, we believe they represent the low point of our march towards stronger revenues and margins during the second half of the year and into 2019.","Before turning to the future, I'd like to provide more color on our results, roughly 3 points of our 5 point RASM decline was driven by same-store markets and the remaining 2 points resulted from new markets, and I'll address each of these separately. First, same-store markets or markets in operation longer than 12 months, 1 point of the decline came from the shift in the timing of Easter, while another 1.5 points came from the increase in award redemption activity I just mentioned. And while we had budgeted for 50 basis points of dilution from award travel, the rapid acceleration in redemptions in May and June led to an additional 100 basis points of impact.","Based on the redemption demand we see in our bookings for the remainder of the summer, we expect this 150 basis point headwind to continue into the third quarter, but then moderate after that. From a loyalty and brand perspective, higher redemptions are very encouraging and our go-forward objective is to strike the right balance between paid tickets and offering great value to our loyalty members.","Setting these 2.5 points of headwinds aside, same-store unit revenues would have been close to flat for the quarter. Overall, demand and pricing continue to be strong in our core Pacific Northwest markets and uptake on our Premium Class product continues to exceed our expectations. While competitive capacity remained elevated and pricing was still generally soft in the state of California, we have seen improvement in pricing over the past 30 days that sets us up for positive momentum in Q3 and Q4.","Turning to new markets or markets in operation less than 12 months, these accounted for the remaining 2 points of decline. New market capacity remained high at 9% of ASMs this quarter, though this will decline over the next two quarters, with new markets set to represent 6% of ASMs for Q3 and just 3% by Q4. We are encouraged by recent performance of these markets, especially in the volume builds, and we expect them to contribute to stronger unit revenues later this year as many of them begin to annualize in September.","Looking ahead, our own growth slows to 5.9% in Q3, 3.1% in Q4, and competitive capacity based on today's schedules goes from 7.4% growth in Q2 to approximately 5% in the third and fourth quarter, again, setting us up for sequential unit revenue improvement over the next two quarters. This upward trajectory in unit revenues actually began during the second quarter as we look by month. April was down 7%, May was down 5% and June was down 3%. In that light, our third quarter RASM guidance range established this morning of down 3% to flat continues the upward trend. Of note, this guidance assumes 150 basis points of continuing headwinds from higher award redemptions and 25 basis points of demand softness in Hawaii from ongoing volcanic activity.","After two years of substantial capital deployment and execution of a complex integration, the commercial team is committed to improving returns on invested capital. A number of the initiatives currently underway will enable us to deliver on this. First, we are capturing merger synergies as we fully integrate and optimize the deployment of our fleets, network, schedules and crews. We will improve the revenue generation of the Airbus fleet starting this fall by modifying the cabin configuration and adding more seats. We are enhancing our competitive position in transcon markets. These markets represent 31% of our network as we swap in larger Boeing aircraft with better product segmentation and additional opportunity to reward out elite guests with upgrades.","We are optimizing our network and schedule and we believe we have opportunity to more profitably assign our regional fleets across our West Coast short haul network. We will launch our Saver Fare product in December, which will create significant revenue upsell opportunities in the order of $100 million plus annually. We are increasing ancillary revenues through the adjustments to change fee policies, offering exit rows for sale and adding dynamic pricing to our premium class. And as we mentioned last quarter, these adjustments represent another $50 million run rate opportunity, $20 million of which we expect in the second half of 2018 with these initiatives now in market.","And finally, we expect to reap the benefit of the new markets we launched in 2017 and 2018 as they mature, and expect to add only a handful of new markets in 2019. And to that point, with our team fully focused on delivering higher margins and returns going forward, our decision to reduce capacity growth to 2% in 2019 will be favorable both unit revenue and for profits. We still expect 2020 capacity growth to be 4% and as Brad mentioned we believe our durable competitive advantages will permit us to grow faster than both GDP and the industry over the medium to long term.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. As you've seen Air Group posted a second quarter adjusted net profit of $206 million or $1.66 a share. Our pre-tax margin was about 13%, an 11 point decline from last year. These results reflect the revenue pressures we faced, markedly higher fuel prices and a step function increase in payroll costs.","I'm going to echo the theme that you heard already, that these results are not the \"new normal\" for Alaska. We're working hard to improve the returns that this business can generate. I too want to offer a bit more color on our decision to scale back 2019 growth. We believe the slower growth rate makes sense because with fuel and industry capacity at current levels we just don't see the same opportunity to produce the returns we're seeking.","We're solidly in returns improvement mode and 2% growth helps us get there because it will improve our ability to manage fares in a way that will help cover the cost increases we've seen. Like our 4% plan before it, the 2% plan lets us leverage the considerable growth that we've had over the last five years, but demonstrates once again that Alaska is willing to right-size capacity when needed. You've heard about the important initiatives that the commercial team is working on, on the cost side of the house we're demonstrating better cost control than we've seen in about two years. We're having a good year in almost all divisions as people embrace the hard work of cost management. There are new processes that occur daily to manage productivity in our operation. Our marketing team gets a shout-out for beating what I would say was an aggressive plan through 6 months and our call center team is not just under plan, but 4% under last year at the halfway mark. This is a prime example of the \"cost friction\" that I referred to last year that would go away as we got farther along in the merger integration. We also have new tools and processes to manage overhead, which, by the way, are tracking $12 million better than plan so far this year. For example, one of our folks developed a dashboard to ensure that contractors are leaving the property on schedule and we're on track to meet our non-union head count reduction goals by July 31.","And with that as the backdrop, let me provide some color on our Q2 cost performance. Q2 CASMex fuel rose 2% which was well below our initial guidance for the quarter. As we saw in Q1, we did benefit from the timing of certain maintenance and marketing expenses shifting to later in the year. Timing accounted for roughly half of our CASM improvement versus initial guide, which means the other half came from true outperformance. Fuel was a significant driver of our margin performance this quarter. Per gallon costs were up 34% and total economic fuel expense rose 45% or $155 million. Though fuel costs are high, our WTI call options did reduce our economic fuel expense by approximately $9 million and based on the current forward curve, we expect these hedges to save us a similar amount in the third quarter.","We currently have hedges in place covering 50% of our planned consumption for the remainder of the year at an average strike price of $67 a barrel. On the integration front, as Brad mentioned, we reached a merger transition agreement with our dispatchers union bringing all, but our maintenance technicians under a single CBA. This gives us great cost visibility, but more importantly the ability to bring our Boeing and Airbus teams together and focus on culture and consistency of service. We now expect Q3 non-fuel cost to be up about 5% on 6% capacity growth which is a bit higher than our most recent guidance in April due to the timing shifts and the fact that capacity growth is lower. We also now expect full-year unit cost to be up 3.2% or 30 bps better than our previous guidance on 30 bps lower capacity growth. This updated outlook reflects the benefit of the favorable unit cost trajectory that we've experienced so far this year.","Turning to the balance sheet, I might start by just underscoring that our revenue and cost initiatives are designed to improve both earnings per share and cash flow. We're trying to be smart allocators of the capital we're generating, balancing prudent investment where we can earn adequate returns, reducing our leverage to protect our long-term shareholders from the cyclicality of the industry and returning capital to our owners.","Total cash flow from operations for the first six months of the year were $800 million excluding merger related costs and the $1,000 employee tax bonus paid in January. Net CapEx was $425 million over the same period resulting in approximately $375 million of adjusted free cash flow. The free cash flow we're generating has allowed us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet. Total on balance sheet debt declined by $258 million during the first half of the year. By year-end we'll have paid down $800 million of debt since our acquisition. With leases, our quarter end adjusted debt to cap stands at 52%, net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA stands at 1.4%, or 20% below the industry average, and we have 83 unencumbered airplanes in our fleet. We remain committed to improving our conservative investment grade balance sheet, which has served this company well for many years.","And rounding out our capital allocation plan during the first six months, we've returned more than $100 million to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases, and expect that number to exceed $200 million by year end. We've increased our dividend every year since we initiated it in 2013 and our dividend is currently yielding about 2%.","I want to close by reiterating what we've tried to convey in the last 25 minutes that there \u2013 that we're through the biggest part of the integration and financially speaking we're now working hard on revenue and cost initiatives with the goal of making sure this franchise that we're building can produce much higher returns than it is today.","And with that, let's go to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, gentlemen.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Good morning, Rajeev.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Brandon, a question for you. You're obviously pulling in your capacity growth quite a bit going into next year. Is that going \u2013 creating sort of a CASM problem, do you think you could do a lot to down or I don't know if that's guidance, but I think your target was to sort of do that. And then just relating to that, I don't think your CapEx numbers change despite pulling in capacity, so just some color on both of those would be great?","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Rajeev, this is Ben Minicucci. Normally, Brandon would take that CASM question, but I think I'm going to start and have Brandon chime in. Simply because on the operations side we drive mainly the execution part of the cost side and what I want to say is from me, I am totally committed and my leadership team is totally committed and accountable to achieving our CASM targets, maybe just a few points just to reiterate from the script. First, we are past the biggest part of the integration. And so, we are now squarely focused on running this operation well, and while I say as a well-run operation has lower costs and on top of that we don't buy our performance. So that is something that after this integration, we are fully focused on that.","Second is this network schedule, we are working hand-in-hand with Andrew in getting this network schedule right, optimizing it for revenue and profit as well as cost and productivity is critical for us as we calibrate our growth to 2%. Third, and I am going to put another exclamation point on this, is getting back to this high productivity. As we have always had high productivity in our history and we are going back to our peak levels that we've had pre-integration. My team's every division has clear goals on productivity. For this year, you've seen good cost performance this year on productivity. And as we're developing the 2019 budget, our productivity goals are clear and we're managing this at the daily and weekly level so that we can make adjustments as we go. We're not waiting till the end of the month.","And lastly, we're going to attack overhead. We got initiatives on healthcare, crew hotel costs and management headcounts. So with all of that, we're feeling confident on how we're going to attack CASM with our 2% growth that we're putting in place.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Rajeev, it's Brandon, good morning, I'll take the second part of the question. Your question was, did CapEx come down, given the lower growth rate? The answer is no. Although we were looking at that just yesterday, I will remind you that we brought our 2019 CapEx guide down to $750 million from like $1.2 billion or something like that. That was a big move. At this point, I think we're through with our aircraft delivery stream restructuring. What we're going to do to accommodate the lower capacity is just try to get the mods done and the paints done more quickly, which I think is ultimately great for the guest experience and great for our ability to get through the integration fully and on to better things.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Just a brief follow-up. Ben, I appreciate your thoughts and your color, but what does it actually means for unit cost going forward? I mean, can we do sort of flattish, down, just some color? Brandon, that's for you as well, obviously?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah, I might jump in. Ben did a good job listing all of the things that we're working on the cost side. What I would say is we had a very aggressive planning mindset around costs coming out of the integration to get those to be flat to down on 4% growth. What I can tell you is things are different around here in terms of our mindset about costs following the integration, as I said. We have no less vigor in the aggressiveness with which we're working in the cost planned, we just have fewer ASMs now to spread those costs over. So we're going to get into the budget process and we'll see where that ultimately takes us.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","And Brandon, this Investor Day, is that your...","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","...target for 2019 cost guidance.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah, exactly.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Rajeev.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Rajeev.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hey. Two kind of network questions here. Andrew, maybe you can help, and Brad, you can chime in as well. When I look at some of the capacity changes that you've made, it's good you're trying to do the right thing and it looks like markets that maybe aren't as relative accretive or even maybe they're relative diluted that you are backing off of. And when I look at a market like Chicago to the West Coast and you scale back maybe to one or two flights a day, on one hand, it may become a more profitable market on one hand and yet, you run the risk of becoming less relevant. And I mean you look at the competition in that market and some of your competitors may have half a dozen or even a dozen flights a day with some bigger airplanes. So can you talk about your thought there? Maybe you just want to cater to that loyal Alaska passenger who \u2013 rather than it's the Chicago passenger or you've got less connecting passengers, I mean does that become a potential concern? How does that weigh on your thinking on some of these cutbacks because some of them are pretty deep?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question. I think big picture number one, the network is a very complicated and evolving puzzle piece. And again, without getting too deep into the weeds, but what you are and what you will continue to see, a deeper off-peak demand cuts, especially on the seasonal flying. You're going to see less redeyes at these fuel prices. And you're going to see us, especially with the Dallas Love Field, for instance, going to the East, getting out of Havana. And as I shared on the prior call, we, for the first time, over the last little bit, have started taking down the legacy Virgin Network where we felt like the capacity and the markets we were flying weren't the right ones. We though \u2013 all the adjustments we're making, we believe strategically are still strong. We're going to pick and choose as we go along here where we're going to cut and grow. But I think in answer to your question, we will be focusing on our strength on the West Coast, we'll be focusing on our growing loyalty base and we're going to be focusing on increasing our unit revenues and profitability.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","And Andrew, I know you and your team have \u2013 you do think a lot about utility. We want to have a schedule that works for people. Mike, to your specific question, we're probably do thinking more about the West Coast origin customer as opposed to Mid Continent or East Coast. So we probably don't need the same schedule coverage as somebody who's really focusing hard on both ends. But, yeah, you just try to balance \u2013 utility does matter, but you're trying to balance utility, returns on capital and so forth.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And this brings up sort of my second question, and I would say that a lot of the things that you just said probably answer this second question. But when I look at Alaska pre-merger, you were spending \u2013 the incremental effort beyond Seattle, Portland, et cetera, was growing California secondary cities, and you were building up a nice presence there. You then have the merger with Virgin and now, all of a sudden, you have big presence in California primary cities, notably San Fran, LAX airports. As I see today, on one hand, you've got Southwest breathing down your neck in the secondary markets and you have the legacies in the primary markets, and I've been watching your schedule changes and you're sort of shifting back and forth. I mean, can Alaska maintain a strong presence and relevance in both primary and secondary California markets and still achieve its return objectives? And I sort of premise this with the fact that you have answered some of that in your prior question, but I do look at that as there are some areas there where I suspect you may be struggling.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Mike, it's Brad. I think you're watching the schedule adjustments we make. What I would go back to is Alaska has real competitive advantage that we believe in. We've got a great balance sheet, a great fleet, our people offer fantastic service, we've been able to run this thing in a way where we do have materially lower cost than the big guys and we translate that into lower fares. So we are big believers in the competitive advantage that Alaska has. You're right, we do fly into both secondary cities in California and with the Virgin acquisition more into SFO and LAX. I don't think we're going to say on this call what our plans are going to be in the future, but our idea in the future is going to be to grow the network consistent with our sense of where the opportunity are \u2013 is, where the opportunities are consistent with our own sense of what our competitive advantage is. So maybe that's what we can share today.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great, and I appreciate it. Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah, Mike.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Hey, thanks.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Duane.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Can you talk a little bit more or expand on the underlying improvement you referred to in the last 30 days. Was that a State of California specific comment? And to what extent did you bake in that improvement into your 3Q revenue outlook?","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah, hi, Duane, it's Shane Tackett. Thanks for the question. Yeah, it's primarily been California that we've seen improvement in. That's primarily, and I think, you've probably heard this from others on the close-in fares that are sort of within 21 days of travel, those have lapped some pretty low levels from last year and they're inching up in fact in a number of cases. Demand is super strong, there's lots of people flying still, so it's primarily been driven down in California, yes. And I think we're optimistic just about as we move through Q3 and Q4 not only what we're seeing in sort of the pricing environment is stabilizing a little bit, but all of the revenue initiatives and synergy capture that start to turn on that Andrew alluded to in the script.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Thanks. And then just for my follow-up, the Saver Fare $100 million estimate, can you just remind us when that starts to turn on and how you get to that estimate? And then maybe just more broadly what are you seeing in terms of the basic economy fares in the marketplace? Is that where you've seen some of the improvement? Are you still seeing sort of dilutive walk-ups out there? Thank you.","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Duane. I'll take the Saver question as well. I want to just remind folks as Andrew mentioned on the script and we talked about last time, we actually had a 5 or 6 different revenue initiatives that totaled $150 million. Saver is the biggest at a $100 million. We're fully in development mode and build mode now. We expect this to be in market by Christmas of this year if not sooner. The way we got there is there's been sort of publicly discussed upsell rates out of what other folks, these products are basic economy into normal or standard, I mean, cabin tickets. Our expectation is to be a little less than that because we have a slightly more generous product and are slightly less reliant on business revenue network, but we're sort of basing it on what we know other take rates are. In terms of the basic upsell fares, they haven't really changed a lot in the past 6 to 12 months. There is sort of market specific dynamics that they may move around a little bit, but they're pretty much in a range of $15 to $50 throughout the U.S. at this point.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Duane.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone. You mentioned this a little bit and I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit more on the transcon and what you're doing there? One, you know what you're seeing today and then how quickly can we start to see that kind of the benefits of a network optimization as you move some of the Boeing aircraft onto that route \u2013 on those routes?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hi, Savi. We've actually already started that process and as we do that \u2013 it's just simply put, the Boeing equipment has a lot more seats, a lot more premium class seats and a lot more first class seats into these frequencies. So and as Shane mentioned too on these longer haul flights, these revenue initiatives that we're putting in place and that have already started and especially to strengthen premium class. All of these initiatives really lend themselves strongly to these transcon flights. And so we expect good healthy improvement and to Shane's earlier point we are seeing strengthening in the close-in fair environment for these flights as well.","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","And Andrew, I'm just going by memory, I think, there is 200 flights transcon in Hawaii and about 70% of them by the fall, will be on Boeing, correct?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Sounds about right, Ben, yeah.","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah, and then that's only increases.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. I think, Savi, just \u2013 by January, we will be basically fully cross-weeded and beginning that sort of full run rate value from that synergy.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right, great. And then if I might just follow-up on, I know you mentioned kind of the softness in Hawaii, I know, Cancun has been brought up a little bit more and is there any kind of exposure on the some of the international flying that you're doing or is it just too small to really show up?","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Savi. I don't know that we mentioned softness in Hawaii, but Mexico is...","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Volcano, okay.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Sorry.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Oh, volcanoes, sorry, sorry, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's -- we \u2013 I think that sort of stabilized itself. There was a bit of immediate \u2013 you know when it was sort of on national news every single day, there was some buck away, but it pretty much stabilized at this point. Mexico is good. It's a pretty small amount of our network today, so it doesn't have a major impact on results. There is some softness in Mexico beach cities. I think, you've heard other folks talk about that, but nothing like materially concerning.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","It makes sense. All right. Thanks.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, everybody. I kind of hate to ask a modeling question, but you mentioned sequential RASM improvement in Q3 and Q4, or you know tracking towards that outcome in \u2013 you know, indeed the midpoint of the succinct third quarter guide that you gave today does imply a sequential improvement from the $0.1281 that you achieved in the second quarter. So are you actually guiding to fourth quarter RASM in cents per mile being above that of the third quarter because if that is the actual guide I mean, that's quite healthy and nicely ahead of the usual seasonal change that one expects from Q3 to Q4?","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hi. Hey, Jamie, this is Shane. I don't think we're prepared to give Q4 guidance today. I do think if you just arith \u2013 sort of do the arithmetic of the revenue initiatives and if you look at a stabilized pricing environment as we lap all of the new market activity we had in Q3 and Q4 of last year, it does set us up nicely for the fourth quarter.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well, could I \u2013 could I just? I just want to make sure that I understood your prepared \u2013 I think, it was in the prepared remarks that you mentioned sequential RASM improvement in Q3 and Q4, is that correct? I'm not trying to pin you down, I'm saying it's a guide. I'm just trying to understand if I perhaps misunderstood your commentary as to sequential improvement?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah, I think it's possible that you've misunderstood our succinct commentary.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Our guide was more in the context of year-over-year improvement which is what Andrew talked about in his prepared remarks not the absolute value of TRASM from Q3 to Q4.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Got it. Okay. That's hugely helpful and just as it relates to California, quick follow-up. And you've already given us some really good granularity here, but we're seeing a lot more time channel pricing at your primary well at one of your primary competitors on the West Coast you certainly won't hurt my feelings if you think that that observation is irrelevant, but could you at least opine on whether you do think that it matters? And if it's something that you're seeing as well?","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Jim, I just want to make sure I fully understand the question. West Coast time-based pricing?","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yes.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Time channel pricing, we're seeing a lot more \u2013 well, and I mean, it's no state secret we're seeing a lot more South West fares with very specific time channel rules as part of the fare basis, only available before...","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","...you know 7:30 in the morning or only available on connections, not non-stops after 10:00 PM, that kind of stuff. And I'm just \u2013 I'm not smart enough to say whether or not that matters. I think that it does. I'm just we're \u2013 I'm just curious what the experts feel.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. So I just wanted to get the semantics right and make sure I knew what you're talking about.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","We've used time banded prices for a long time here. I think they are very, very normal revenue management tool in the industry, and I think that in general they make a lot of sense and it's not surprising to me that others would adopts those at this point.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","And when they do it.","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Shane, our basic deal would be to match in that time slot, not \u2013 try not to grow the impact.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. We generally are very competitive on fares. And yeah, we use time banded to be competitive for a long time.","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Okay. Helpful. Thanks, gentlemen.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen Securities.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you for the time. I just have two unrelated questions. The first is, do you guys focus on net promoter score? And have you \u2013 if so, have you seen an improvement year-over-year and since the merger? And my second question completely unrelated to that. You guys were a big part of cargo in the State of Alaska, especially the postal service. And obviously, there's some talk and we should hear in a week or two what the service levels of the USPS may be going forward. Is that something that you would see an opportunity in, if postal service levels declined from six days a week to three or four?","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Helane. It's Ben. Your first question on net promoter score, yes. The answer is yes, we do track net promoter score. We've got a great customer analytics team and we have something called Alaska Listens where we do ask the net promoter score. And what I'll say is we've seen just improved performance on our net promoter score as we're getting through this integration. It's very, very promising. We're actually making some refinements to the question to make sure that it is as pure as a net promoter score question as we can. So, we're seeing \u2013 and then other customer metrics, we're seeing those improve as well so very, very \u2013 we feel very good about that.","Maybe on the second question, some other folks can help me. What I can say is we've got three freight airplanes that we just converted. There are three 700s that are converted and we're seeing a huge increase in revenues on our cargo airplanes as we're deploying them. I think we have some opportunity this U.S. Postal Service recent events I'm not too up to speed on that, unless anybody else is, that our \u2013 I can tell you our current team is extremely motivated and will jump on any opportunity to make sure that we capture as much revenue as possible.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","One thing I might just point out, Helane, in the State of Alaska, mail does work a little bit different. We actually carry USPS mail on a bypass basis. I won't get into the technical vagaries of it, but we carry it on a daily basis on their behalf. And it is a little different setup up there.","Helane Becker - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Helane.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Helane.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, everybody.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Good morning, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, Brandon, I just want to make this totally clear. Does your 2% ASM growth precludes you from keeping CASMex flat to down? It sounds like there's a lot of moving parts, and I respect, there's a budgeting process. But if you could just say yes or no, is that still in play for 2019?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Good morning, Hunter. It's really \u2013 we tried to address this in our prepared remarks. We have an extremely aggressive focus on cost. I will say that. It is difficult with 2% ASM growth to see a path to flat to down CASM, but that does not mean that we're not going to work on it.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's fair. You got it. Thank you for that. And then, I don't know, this is for maybe Shane, what do you know about these people redeeming points, Shane? Are these people with small point balances that are just like flushing 20,000 points, like their last 20,000 points away and they're not going to come back? Or are these Alaska loyalists that are just taking advantage of like a dislocation in some of the offerings and just taking advantage of some maybe temporarily low price points? I just want to make sure that we're not \u2013 you didn't buy a bunch of Virgin customers that are just going to abandon the new airline because their beloved Virgin is now gone and they're just like flushing away their points. You know what I mean?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. Hunter, this is Andrew. I might take this on. I've been expecting this question and take it up to the 50,000-foot level here. At the end of the day, what happened here is that, as you know, we have a very generous loyalty program. The problem was we were just way too generous post PSS. There's a couple of key drivers to that. Firstly, we just weren't set up correctly with our inventory. We were way too open just to say it. Our lowest fare award redemptions were up 40% year-over-year. So we're all about generosity, but we had the inventory misaligned with the demand. The PSS transition happened right in the peak summer booking window. And then, we bought on all of these Airbus that we underestimated how that was going to be. And then, of course, our good partner, American Airlines had full access to our network as well.","So when you combine all of those things together that was the huge spike in demand. It was by our regular loyal members, business as usual, even saw some of it up in the Pacific Northwest because of our inventory challenges. So this was a one-time thing. There's about 150 basis points of drag this quarter, it will be the same next quarter. And we've just made adjustments to bring the generosity back to our standard levels. This was a miss on our part, but it's behind us now and we feel good going forward. So that's what happened with loyalty.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Hunter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Well, hey, thanks for the time here guys. So non-fuel costs are likely up somewhat next year, but you were pretty clear you're expecting margin expansion, so revenue up even more, I guess. To what extent has inter-California impacted RASM at the system level? Is this 5% of the business impacting RASM by, say, 100 basis points, 200 basis points? And I guess I'm just trying to get a little better handle on the source of sequential improvement as we head into the back half of the year and into next.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. I'll take that. I mean we obviously don't comment on specific market performance. Inter-Cal is only 2.5% of our total capacity just to put that into perspective. I think really, to your question, what we are seeing is sequential improvement in these new markets on a couple of levels across the system is volumes and the volume is getting much stronger. And many of these markets too are on regional aircraft and Shane and the team are getting much better and more sophisticated about how we sell both Premium Class and First Class in these areas. So I think bigger picture, really, the story here is the pricing in general in California across the board. And as Shane and we had mentioned in our remarks, we're seeing good positive changes, especially in the close-in booking windows in those fares. So that's really what's going on.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I see. Okay.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Dan.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah, go ahead.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","It's Brandon. Just one other thought. In your lead-in, you had a couple of important points. One is we have margin improvement plan for 2019. That's absolutely correct. The second is as you almost threw up the white flag on costs being up a couple of points or whatever you said, and I don't know that that's fair. We haven't given any guidance yet for 2019 costs and I don't want to just accept that as a given.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you for that clarification. That's helpful. Another question here just, Hawaii becoming a bigger competitive dynamic, that's likely to persist into next year. So as we think about margin expansion, it seems to me there must be some confidence that you can execute on that even with some competitive challenges that are likely to persist. Is that a fair characterization?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","I think specifically, Dan, in relation to Hawaii, what we feel really good about that, and you've seen us made adjustments in the fourth quarter across the Pacific Northwest and California and our frequencies. But more importantly, the changes that we've been talking about, the premium class, the Saver Fares, the change fees and all of these revenue enhancements, Hawaii will be a very strong recipient of these increase in yields and improvement in profitability. So we feel really good about our Hawaii network, the strength of it, and the revenue initiatives we're putting in place as well as the cost reductions, will go directly to the Hawaii franchise.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","And competition is what makes this country and this industry great. But we're \u2013 we have seat assignments in Hawaii, we have premium class, first class, as Andrew mentioned we have fantastic onboard food and beverage service. We think that's going to \u2013 we have about \u2013 our fares are candidly are as low as anybody else's. So we actually think we're nicely set up for Hawaii in 2019 and 2020.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thanks for that color, and I'm just trying to squeeze one last housecleaning, this is quick here. Ben, the \u2013 what's the primary metrics behind the productivity targets and I guess if you're using full-time equivalents, pardon me, for aircraft, where are you at today, what does it look like in 2019?","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","So great question. First, every division has a specific metric, so it depends, I would say for pilots and flight attendants it's we track hard time, so we will set a target for example like 69% hard time for pilots and 74% hard time for flight attendants; for mechanics, it's mechanics to airplane; for customer service agents, it's the number of agents per departures and then it all rolls up as you see it a number that we publish that is the number of equivalent FTEs per...","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Passengers per FTE.","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Passengers per FTE.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay.","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","So what we have is what we do we just get granular with every vision to make sure that productivity is at peak level and then it rolls up to an overall number that you see.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","And Dan, the number \u2013 this is Brandon, the number we really manage to is at the division level like Ben said and it obviously gets way more granular than that on hard time and soft time and that's what we focus on, on daily basis to drive the business.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah, and then it could be like training and what how many people are on company business and union business all those sorts of things.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks so much you guys.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel Nicolaus.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thank you. Just to follow-up on Hunter's question, he's slowly becoming the loyalty program expert here. Andrew, is it fair to say that kind of in a standard environment that you're indifferent from a PRASM standpoint whether you sell a seat with miles or dollars?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","I don't \u2013 where I would say in short, no, we're not indifferent, I think we're trying to balance two very important economic drivers of our business. One is obviously selling revenue tickets and the other one is to continue to grow the loyalty program which is also generating significant economics through both the card and buying passengers. I think the industry right now is basically indifferent. I would say we are not at that place although we are continuing to work on how indifferent we do plan to be as it relates to loyalty going forward. So we think we have the best of both worlds right now.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then when you think about going from 4% to 2% I think you've talked a little bit about this but maybe a little bit more detail would be helpful like where do those two points come out of and is a market like Hawaii where there is clearly going to be a decent amount of capacity next year is that somewhere where you could reduce and fund capacity elsewhere, just how should we think about that? Thank you.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thank you. The easiest way to think about 2019 capacity at 2% it's essentially everything we've announced and started this year continues on to next year. So to the extent we announce any new markets or changes that just means to your point we'll be pulling down other areas of our network and reallocating it. But essentially this is just this year's run rate going forward.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking my question. So Brad I mean I guess if we can do the postmortem here and I guess this kind of coming off of Hunter's question too, but maybe in a different way. You know is it just proving to be more difficult in some of these bigger California markets to be a number two or number three player and you're just not getting the returns or the let's say revenue or recognition you thought you would get from customer base there as you've increased your presence?","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","No, thanks, Brandon, a good question. I don't think that's the case. We \u2013 I'll say having been here a long time now, some of these markets we've worked a long, long time to develop a loyalty position and a market share that we \u2013 that we've developed. And then when you have that position, it's an incredible loyalty and economic driver for your business. So I don't think it would have been right for any of us to sort of expect overnight material shifts in market share where you're holding industry standard RASM or anything like that and that wasn't our expectation. I do think what's happened is, as we bought \u2013 moved into a lot of these markets there has been elevated competition, some of that we brought on new flying ourselves. And we did it at a time with \u2013 when fuel prices were rising a lot and that's one of things we're trying to talk about now. And so I think the combination of us putting new flying in, our competitors putting new flying in, fuel prices coming up, and we're trying to recover higher fares in that environment, it's been tough, and it doesn't \u2013 tough is what we do, you know, as that \u2013 this is the airline business. So I think as we look at this now, we are \u2013 you've seen over the last couple of calls, we've made downward adjustments to our own capacity and we're just continuing to make the most intelligent network decisions that we can make.","But I think, California is a great market place, great business, great economy is there. It's very natural. We've been in California for 40 years. It's very natural for us to have a bigger presence there. We're very optimistic about how we're going to do there over the mid-term. But this is what we're working through right now.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And to the extent that you're willing to share, I mean nothing internally is suggesting that there was a niche brand following the Virgin and you know that's eroding or did erode, that doesn't seem to be the issue?","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","I don't think so.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Okay. Is that the last?","Matt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Bradley D.

Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Investor Relations, Chris Berry.","Chris Berry","Thanks, Sarah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Alaska Air Group's second quarter 2012 earnings call. Today, our CEO, Brad Tilden; and our CFO, Brandon Pedersen, will share their thoughts on our second quarter financial results, our operations and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Several members of our senior management team are also here to help answer your questions.","Our discussion today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings available on our website. We will refer often to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings or unit costs, excluding fuel, and we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a second quarter GAAP profit of $67.5 million. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedged portfolio, we reported an adjusted net income of $110.8 million or $1.53 per share. This compares to a First Call mean estimate of $1.51 per share and to last year's adjusted net income of $89.6 million or $1.22 per share. Additional information about our unit cost expectations, capacity plans, future fuel hedge positions, capital expenditures and other items can be found in our investor update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com. And now I'll turn the call over to Brad.","Bradley D. Tilden","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report a record second quarter adjusted profit of nearly $111 million, and this is our 13th consecutive quarterly profit. Despite ongoing concerns about the macroeconomic environment, demand during the quarter was strong, and that led to a 9.3% or $103 million increase in operating revenues. We, again, posted record load factors, continuing a trend that stretches back to 2009. Against the backdrop of 6% ASM growth, we posted a 2.2% increase in load factor and a 3.7% increase in consolidated PRASM, giving us confidence that we are managing capacity effectively. Our pretax margin also improved from 13% last year to 14.7% this year. The margin increase was due to revenue gains that were sufficient to cover increases in both fuel and nonfuel costs.","With our leadership transition, some of you have asked if there will be changes in the strategic direction of the company. The quick answer is no. We put the 2010 plan together roughly 9 years ago, and it has been an excellent roadmap for the company and has led to much of the success we're enjoying today. So we know the importance of having a clear plan and clear goals that we can all align around. As we move forward, the 2010 plan is the big-picture plan, but underneath this overall plan, there are 5 strategic initiatives that we're focusing on. These are: first, safety and compliance. Nothing is more important. Second, people. We want to better connect with our employees and preserve our small-company feel, even as we grow. Third, over the next several years, our goal is to become the easiest airline to fly with and to become known for a hassle-free customer experience. Fourth is brand. We want to strengthen our brand and make it more attractive to our evolving customer base. And finally, low fares. We want to be known for our low fares, and as we've said before, we can't have low fares without low cost. So we will continue to move toward a cost structure that allows us to compete with the growing number of low-cost carriers.","If we do these things and meet our profit goals, it will make sense to further grow the network. You'll hear more about each of these areas in the quarters and years ahead. Our belief is that successfully executing against these 5 focus areas will help us meet the needs of our 3 stakeholder groups. For customers, we'll run a great airline and provide compelling value. For our employees, we'll be recognized as a great place for people to work. And for shareholders and other capital providers, ALK will be an investment that our owners will be happy to have in their portfolio for the long term because we will provide returns that exceed our cost of capital over the cycle. This is the goal. It's been done for short periods of time, but not on a sustained basis and that's what we're attempting to do.","During the second quarter, we won our fifth consecutive J.D. Power award for highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers. This is wonderful recognition of how our customers feel about us. And while we're celebrating the award, we're also diving into the scores to make sure we find ways to further improve our customer experience. Our exceptional operational reliability, customer-friendly technology and improvements to our onboard experience all contributed to this award. Yet what we always hear about Alaska and what this survey confirms is that our people and their commitment to our customers and communities is what sets us apart. One relatively small example of this is our Portland station employees, who recently spent hundreds, if not thousands, of hours constructing what proved to be the award-winning float in the Portland Rose Festival parade. Again, this is just one example. All around our system, our people are involved, making a positive difference. We realize that every company believes they have the best people. In our case, our belief is validated by our customers.","On the network growth front, we -- during the quarter, we initiated service from Seattle to Philadelphia and from San Diego to Santa Rosa, Monterey and Fresno. We've also announced new service from Seattle to San Antonio and from Portland to Reagan National, both of which will start in the third quarter. And in the fourth quarter, we'll begin flying from San Diego to Orlando, from Portland to Kauai, from Bellingham to Maui and from Anchorage to Kona, with several of these markets having a limited number of frequencies per week.","We have some good news this quarter on the people front as well. Our ramp in stores' agents, represented by the IAM, ratified a 6-year contract by a 91% margin, and they did this before the contract's amendable date. The agreement provides for an initial wage increase of 2.5%, followed by 1.5% annual increases. The contract included productivity improvements and it also offers both Alaska and our employees the certainty that comes with a long-term agreement. We are very pleased we were able to get this contract done and we want to congratulate and thank everyone who sat at the bargaining table during the negotiations. In light of this agreement and the 5-year contract ratified by our technicians last year, we're hopeful that we will be able to achieve long-term contracts with all of our work groups at both Alaska and Horizon to provide fair wages, generous profit-sharing and enhanced productivity.","Operationally, both Alaska and Horizon had another strong quarter. Alaska was #1 in on-time performance among the top 10 airlines in the U.S. for the 12 months ended May 2012, and more impressively, Horizon was #1 among all U.S. airlines for each month of the quarter.","In closing, I'm very proud of our people and the tremendous effort they put forth every day to take extraordinary care of our customers. By continuing to work together like we're doing right now, we will grow stronger and be even better prepared to handle the inevitable opportunities and challenges that come our way. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Thanks, Brad, and hello, everyone. As Chris said, Air Group reported a record adjusted net profit of $110.8 million compared to an $89.6 million profit last year. This result brings our trailing 12-month return on invested capital to 12.3%, nearly a full point higher than the 11.5% at the end of the second quarter of last year.","While I'm certainly not providing earnings guidance, it appears very likely that we'll exceed our 10% after-tax ROIC target again this year. This would be the third year in a row that we've been able to do so. Our growing track record gives me confidence that we're making the right changes to our business that will enable us to reach our goal of an average 10% ROIC across the peaks and valleys of the business cycle.","Adjusted pretax profit improved by nearly $35 million compared to last year. The improvement was driven by $103 million increase in operating revenues, partially offset by a $36 million increase in economic fuel costs and a $37 million increase in adjusted nonfuel operating expenses. As Brad mentioned, our pretax margin increased from 13% in 2011 to 14.7% in 2012, and our operating margin was just over 15%. Notably, this is the first time we've had year-over-year pretax margin expansion since the first quarter of 2011.","Consolidated passenger revenues grew by $97 million or 10.2% on the 3 -- 6.3% increase in capacity and a 3.7% increase in PRASM. Yields were up just under a point during the quarter, with the 2.2 point increase in load factor being the main driver of the PRASM gain. The mainline business performed well this quarter. Mainline PRASM was up by 4.8%, even with a 4.4% increase in stage length. The industry, x Alaska, was up 6% on a slight reduction in capacity and flat stage length. When adjusting for changes in stage length, we think our mainline PRASM compared favorably to the industry.","Unit revenues were strong in Alaska, Hawaii and our Midcon markets. We mentioned last quarter that Alaska long-haul flying had a negative impact on unit revenues because we had too much capacity in that market. We did a much better job matching supply and demand this quarter, leading to a nice bump in load factor. And although the regional business posted a slight decline in unit revenues, putting pressure on system-wide PRASM, we are pleased with the overall revenue performance during the quarter.","As we look to the third quarter, advanced bookings for July are about flat, August is up about 1.5 points and September is up about 1 point. The revenue environment remains relatively stable, in our view, despite the headline risks and the uncertain economic environment.","Turning to costs. Our nonfuel operating expenses, excluding fleet transition charges in 2011, increased by $37 million or 6% on a 6.3% increase in capacity. This resulted in a small decline in our consolidated nonfuel CASM, which was consistent with our latest guidance. You might have noticed in our investor update that our full year nonfuel unit cost guidance is up from previous disclosures. We now believe CASM x will be about flat versus down slightly, which is with our previous guidance. The increase is due to higher projected incentive pay expense, which accounts for the entire $0.001 increase. As a reminder, we have a broad-based performance incentive plan that pays based on how we do compared to financial and operational goals set annually by our board. Because projected full year profitability is shaping up to be quite good and because our people are exceeding goals in safety and customer satisfaction metrics as well, our incentive pay forecast is up significantly. This is a cost increase that we're willing to accept because it benefits all of our major stakeholders: employees; customers; and shareholders, and is an important part of our strategy to align the interests of these groups.","Overall, however, I am disappointed that we're not better able to leverage our planned 6% full year ASM growth to lower unit costs. We know we need to find more ways to keep driving unit costs down, and as we move into the 2013 budget cycle, we'll be making sure our leaders develop plans that are consistent with this objective.","Economic fuel costs were up $36 million or 11% versus last year. The increase reflects a 3.7% increase in our economic price per gallon and a 6.7% increase in consumption. The change in economic fuel cost includes a nearly $29 million year-over-year swing in the impact of our hedges, from a net benefit of $17 million last year to a net cost of $12 million this year.","In the second quarter of last year, we were in the money at $97 per barrel, including premium costs, whereas this year, our breakeven price was $110 per barrel. For the remainder of the year, we have 50% of our planned consumption capped at $100 per barrel at an average premium cost of $10 per barrel. We also maintain short-term swaps on the refining margin, and we are 50% hedged for the third quarter at $31 per barrel.","As a reminder, we're buying call options for WTI crude oil positions that give us 100% of a benefit of falling oil prices, limiting our exposure to the upfront cash we pay for premiums. In the fourth quarter of last year, we moved to purchasing options that are 10% out of money, given the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to take on more risk. This move is helping us reduce our annual spend on premiums by approximately $15 million to $20 million.","Moving to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. We've generated $455 million of operating cash flow in the first half of the year, compared to $370 million last year. Capital spending was about $255 million as we took delivery of 3 Boeing 737-800s and 2 Q400s, resulting in roughly $200 million of free cash flow during the first half of this year. We've used that free cash flow to pay off $165 million of long-term debt, including $80 million of prepayments in the second quarter, improving our debt-to-cap ratio to 58%. We also purchased over 755,000 shares of our common stock for $26 million. As of June 30, we were $23 million into our current $50 million repurchase program.","Looking forward, we're projecting full year gross capital spending to be $470 million. This is a slight reduction from our previous guidance and it reflects our decision to defer 2 900ER aircraft from 2013 to 2014 to better align deliveries with aircraft retirement and our growth plans. At the same time, we also agreed to advance the delivery date of 1 900ER by 1 month to December 2012.","During the quarter, we also finalized the deal to sell and lease back 3 737-700s and exercise options for 3 737-900ERs that will be delivered at roughly the same time the 700s leave the fleet in late 2013 and early 2014. This is a good transaction for us as the economics of replacing a 700 with 124 seats with a 900ER that has 181 seats is compelling. Upgrading to the 900ER is a very efficient, lower-risk way to approach growth and allows us to maintain our position as the leader in the airline industry when it comes to lower carbon emissions and better fuel efficiency on a per-seat basis.","Since the beginning of 2010, our business has generated $1.7 billion of operating cash flow. We've invested in the business by buying 10 737-800s and 4 Q400s free and clear that we're deploying to markets that are performing well, yet we've still managed to produce nearly $900 million of free cash flow. We've reduced our on-balance-sheet debt by over $700 million and returned capital to shareholders by repurchasing more than $150 million of our common stock over that period. In fact, we've purchased approximately $285 million of our stock since our buyback program began in 2007. The improvement in our balance sheet was one of the contributing factors to Standard & Poor's recent decision to change our outlook from stable to positive.","Our free cash flow generation has improved significantly over the past few years, and investors sometimes ask about our capital allocation plans. We like our balanced approach: invest in the business; delever the balance sheet; and provide a return to our shareholders, all of which we're currently doing. I want to close by joining Brad in congratulating our employees for, once again, posting record results and for what they do every day to take care of our customers. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to him to kick off the Q&A.","Bradley D. Tilden","Thanks, Brandon, and at this time, we are ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Hunter Keay of Wolfe Trahan.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Brad, the 5 strategic initiatives, which I think you just recently unveiled within the last 6 months or so, they sound a lot like the strategies that are employed by JetBlue and Southwest, whose products are great, but the stock hasn't moved in 10 years, so -- moved up in 10 years. So what would you say if I asserted that there is absolutely no connection between happy customers and shareholder wealth creation in airlines, and to the contrary, maybe the opposite might be true, broadly speaking?","Bradley D. Tilden","How do we say -- good question. One thing I would say is that look at the experience at Alaska Air Group in the last 4 or 5 years. What these 5 focus areas are really talking about are continuing strategies that when -- and find -- really identifying things that we are good at, the area -- places where we can win and exploiting those. I think there are a lot of what you've seen with the success of the 2010 plan that we're going to do in going forward. Just to recap them, safety is an obvious thing. We have to be safe. Alaska, the people, one, what we're really saying there is that our size is an advantage for us. With a smaller company, we can be closer to each other, we can be closer to companies. We'll execute better. Hassle-free, what we're really saying there is it's not an extravagant, onboard product. What it is, is being the -- it's genuine, caring service it's a easy, hassle-free customer experience. Brand, what we're saying is we've got to find a way to grow the market. And the last one, Hunter, I would think you would like, what we're really saying there is get the revenues and get the fares and the costs in line. Make sure there is a gap between what we're charging our customers and what it costs us to produce the product. That's what's that point's all about. So I think our response has been what we're really talking about is talking about the things where Air Group has some capability today to things that have really helped us over the last few years and producing what, I think, are close to industry-leading margins.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Yes. You -- somehow may have worked. And I guess as I look at the balance sheet, I can't tell from the release, but I think you're net cash right now for the first time in 6 years, at least on the balance sheet, your CASM x fuel is going to be probably at an all-time low for your company this year, even with the recent guidance change. You're doing well operationally. You're going to get maybe another 20-ish percent EBIT margin in 3Q. So what are the things that the board considers when evaluating maybe more exotic cash deployment options? The specific metrics. Or is it softer? Is it more of a softer, qualitative discussion?","Bradley D. Tilden","I think the -- I mean we do regularly at the board meeting look at all sorts of options to deploy cash from repurchasing stock, paying down debts, investing in aircraft, funding pensions and other ideas. I think the best practice for us here is to probably say that if and when we have some news there, we'll announce that news, as we've done for the last 3 or 4 years. But I think to speculate a lot further isn't probably in our interest.","Operator","Your next question comes from Helane Becker of Dahlman Rose.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of smaller questions with respect to mix. Has there -- have you noticed a change in mix in your business or would you still characterize being heavily leisure versus business? Could you maybe talk a little bit abou that?","Andrew Harrison","Helane, it's Andrew. I think what I would characterize that is we're still very heavy leisure travel, and if anything, we're actually continuing to increase that. On the second quarter, we had a 45% increase in our Hawaii capacity alone.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Can you say what that capacity is now? I mean Hawaii, Alaska and then Lower 48?","Andrew Harrison","I think for -- at the Air Group level, for the full year, Hawaii is going to be 20% of our ASMs; Transcon and Midcon are going to be about 19%; and California, which is still a very big portion of our business is going to be a little over 20% as well. But those are the big categories, and then the State of Alaska is about 15% or so.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question with respect to business, have you seen any shift in Mexico whether people are going back there again or are they still avoiding it, especially from the U.S., and going to Hawaii instead?","Andrew Harrison","So 2 parts to that question, I suppose. As far as the beach markets, the Puerto Vallarta and the Cabo, we've been very pleased with those markets. We're not seeing any issues at all on the demand front, so things are stable and good there. Then on the Guadalajara, Mexico city, we've seen some industry capacity changes and we're feeling very good about those markets, and they're performing very well at this time. So in short, we haven't seen anything majorly negative as it relates to Mexico.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Linenberg, Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I got 2 questions here. The first for Andrew. Can you just run through some of the competitive changes in your core markets and some of the things that come to mind are some of the new Virgin service in and out of Portland. But when you look at third quarter, fourth quarter, if you can just run through some of the pluses and minuses?","Andrew Harrison","Yes. Mike, in general, I think the third quarter -- we look at this as sort of a weighted-average capacity changes of other airlines in our market. I will say this summer, it's just marginally up as it relates to the summer capacity. But as we look into the fall, we're, again, continuing to see industry discipline as we've -- the fall is traditionally weaker, so we're actually seeing the competitive landscape somewhat flat. Specifically, as it relates to competitive pressures, there's 2 areas. The first is Canada, which is less than 3% of our network. But we've seen 10% capacity increase from Canada into the West Coast, which overflows out Seattle, so we've had some pricing pressures there. And you've mentioned -- and really it's Portland. I look to -- there's sort of a capacity party going on there, which, I'm not sure why, but the reality is United, Virgin and Spirit have all increased capacity there, and we're dealing with that. But overall, on a network basis, I would say competitive pressures are, other than a few pockets, are fairly stable at this time.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just my second question, and maybe this is more to Brad, the -- some of the reconfiguration going on at Sea-Tac, it looks like you may be getting some additional gates. How does it shift around your space and will we see your facility costs go up there and what's the timing?","Bradley D. Tilden","Mike, this is a good chance for Ben Minicucci, our Chief Operating Officer, to get into the fray.","Benito Minicucci","So we are going to consolidate -- we're in 3 concourses right now. We're going to consolidate at 2. And we're not adding more gates, we're actually going to let go of gates and put the majority of our operation in 1 concourse. And we're going to do 2 things: we're going to improve our customer experience; and actually improve our operational efficiencies tremendously. So we don't expect our costs to go up. With LAT6, for example, with that investment, our costs have actually come down from a cost-per-employment perspective. So we plan to do some investment, but we intend to keep our costs very much under control.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","When is that fully online?","Benito Minicucci","We begin next year with the airline realignment. We expect this project to probably last 4 or 5 years before it's all done.","Operator","Your next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth, Evercore Partners.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just wondered if you could qualify some of the other comments we've heard on the earnings calls. Specifically, with regard to closed-end bookings, are you seeing any change in the tempo on closed-end bookings? And if not, why do you think others might be saying that?","Andrew Harrison","Duane, this is Andrew. I'm not sure I can specifically comment on what the other carriers are facing. I think for us, summer, we're sort of reaching a little bit of a glass ceiling here on load factor. Summer is extremely full. We ran nearly 89% last year in the mainline. We're going to do the same again this summer. The only changes in our booking pattern is last year, where we knew we sold some seats too soon, we've held out a little bit more. So other than that, we're seeing nothing unusual at all other than our own manipulation, where we've learned from some lessons last year in the demand patterns. So they're very stable from where I sit and no major issues.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Duane, this is Brandon. I'll chime in with one of the things Andrew mentioned, really high load factors in the summer. This is one reason why we're so excited about the 900ER coming in. The cost profile of that airplane is going to be great. But for months like July and August, it will allow us to add and accommodate more capacity, too.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And can you give us any qualitative comments on bookings, trends in markets where you're going to be competing with Allegiant to Hawaii?","Andrew Harrison","Duane, I suppose a couple of things. We basically compete with them in Las Vegas from Bellingham, as well as Hawaii and their new announced service. I think what I would say is, is that what we've seen, again, as I've shared on earlier calls, Allegiant has helped open our mind to really where the significant amount of demand in Canada on the lower British Columbia area, where costs are very high out of Vancouver. And so even our Bellingham-Maui flight, I can tell you, we've already booked at 50% in November, when we're launching service. So overall, we found that there's been a good demand for our product, which is actually, in some cases, has higher frequencies than our competitors.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And that 60%, is that an acceptable fare or those discounts relative to the rest of your system?","Andrew Harrison","With -- there's obviously the introductory fare in that, so as we move forward. But from history, our Honolulu, Bellingham as well as our Vegas, we've found them to be performing within our guidance and our standards. So no real concerns.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Baker of JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Brad, one of your targets is being the -- I think you said the easiest airline to fly, embracing technology and what have you. I'm obviously familiar with your track record in this regard, but I was kind of hoping you could add some color on what the ideas might be for incremental improvement going forward. I mean, are these simply going to be aspects that make flying lower hassle or are there some actual revenue or cost opportunities we should think about? In other words, does this appeal to analysts or merely to customers, passengers?","Benito Minicucci","Jamie, Ben Minicucci here. I'm leading that initiative. The initiative has 4 pillars. One is a mobile pillar, and I'm working with Joe in terms of taking advantage of all the mobile technology in the next few years. The second pillar is our airport technology and our airport processes. So what we want to do is get customers from the curb to the gate and to the seat very quickly without -- with the least amount of hassle of getting -- checking bags and getting to TSA, which is our third pillars. We're working with TSA to really optimize that experience with TSA. And the fourth pillar is just looking internally, looking at all our policies and procedures, our boarding process, our deplaning process, anything that takes up a lot of time, that is a customer friction point. So those are basically the four, and we're well on our way.","Bradley D. Tilden","I think if you look at the last -- look at Air Group for the last couple of years. We've had extraordinary improvement in things like on-time performance, which our customers want. But when on-time performance improves, all of a sudden you can schedule all of your resource a little tighter. You can schedule gates tighter, airplanes tighter, your crews tighter. I think of other parts of technology which Alaska has really led. 5, 6 years ago, ticket counters was the big, long line with 20 positions upfront. Now customers can walk right through the ticket counter areas, drop their bag and keep moving. It's extraordinary. I don't have the number top of mind, but it's -- our CSA productivity is something like double what it was 10 years ago. So that's kind of what's underneath all of this, is that there's simply not enough profit in these tickets for the -- to deliver airline services the way they used to be delivered. And so let's fully streamline this, give customers exactly what they want, but I think we will also give analysts exactly what they want as well.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, good. And second, to follow up, I'm not interested in your views on consolidation because you've been very forthright, very clear in the past on that topic, so I don't want to beat a dead horse. My question is simple. Have you received an MDA from American Airlines?","Bradley D. Tilden","Jamie, our General Counsel's in the room. He's shaking his head. So I appreciate the question, but we're not going to respond. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Godyn of Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to kind of reconcile some of the demand commentary we're hearing. Brandon, I think you noted that things look relatively stable, which is kind of a qualified statement. But then, Andrew, you mentioned you're seeing no changes at all. And then on the other hand, your advance book factored guidance is a little bit lower than prior. Is there something going on with yield management that kind of reconciles all this stuff? If you guys could just elaborate a little bit, I think it would be helpful.","Brandon S. Pedersen","John, it's Brandon, I'll start. I guess I'm pleased that you're actually paying attention to what I have to say. Because -- I didn't mean anything specifically by using the qualifier relatively. I think it's fair to say that the demand environment looks good. And I will ask Andrew to elaborate on that, because I think it all does hang together.","Andrew Harrison","And John, maybe as you've seen, our load factor gap for July is basically flat where it was up 2, 3 points a number of months ago. The major driver for that is we have such a significant increase in our Hawaii network. They book a lot further out. But we will end up with the same very, very high load factors this summer as we had last year, and because our network  is changing, we're just selling some of those seats a little earlier than you saw last year. I will say, last year, we had some learnings where we held out in certain markets for the fare at the higher level, and it didn't come. So this year, we said with fuel abating over a little bit, we've decided to sell that a little earlier. But at the end of the day, we'll be about where we were last year as far as loads.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And how much visibility do you have into September?","Andrew Harrison","As far as September goes, we're looking into the eye of the summer demand right now. September is a little ways out for us. But right now I'm not seeing anything significant or concerning as it relates to the demand picture. But again, it will become clearer over the next month. It's still a little hazy right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just wondering on San Diego, it's -- I noticed that the seats kind of coming out of San Diego have increased quite a bit since 2010 and maybe back above the prerecession levels in that market. Are you kind of trying to build a hub there? And I was wondering how the progress is going?","Andrew Harrison","Savi, this is Andrew. We've been in San Diego a long, long time, and what you've seen there is just a continued increase. You've seen Hawaii start, you've seen more Mexico go in, and then more recently, you've seen like a San Diego-Orlando, which is a large leisure market that has today no nonstop service. Additionally, you see regional service increasing. And I wouldn't call it we're building up a hub, but I think what we're doing, as we've shared, is continuing to expand our footprint on the West Coast and in areas that we believe make sense for our brand. I will say just really excitedly that all of our San Diego regional service started right out of the gate in a profit. Literally, I know it's summer, but that was just very encouraging for us.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then a follow-up on demand. If I may ask it slightly differently, is demand looking maybe softer or stronger versus what you saw a couple of months ago?","Andrew Harrison","I think if I was just to reflect on demand as I sit here today, when I spoke to you a quarter ago and as I speak to you today, I've seen no change and I would characterize it as stable and fairly healthy. That's how I would characterize it from -- for our network.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Fintzen of Barclays.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A quick question on the fleet, and I appreciate some of the changes you walked through in the script. But I was curious on the roles of 737-400s play in your mind. I mean you're still going to have 16 of them out in 2014. And how much flexibility -- and I think most of those are leased, how much flexibility in that fleet do you have to sort of use it to adjust the growth profile, should you feel like you need to or should the demand environment necessitate? And I mean is that kind of the flexibility in the fleet or should we think about more sort of deferrals and moving around deliveries like you've done recently?","Brandon S. Pedersen","David, it's Brandon. I'll start with that. I think there's a ton of flexibility in our fleet. And I think you're right, the 400s play a part in that. You're also right in that most of them are leased, but to the extent that we see opportunities that we want to take advantage of to smooth out growth a little bit, we can extend those 400s at what are looking to be pretty attractive rates. We also own several that we could sell if we want to. We own most of our 700s. We could sell those if we wanted to have some flexibility on that side. But we see the 400s staying around here for several more years and they do offer flexibility for us to adjust capacity up and down.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one little one. Can you disclose what the bad fees were in the quarter?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Sure. Joe Sprague has those numbers handy at his fingertips.","Joseph A. Sprague","David, Joe Sprague from Marketing. Year-to-date, we have generated 60 -- $76 million off of bag fees. That's down about $4 million from the same period last year. In line with our expectations, I think we're continuing to see some changes in customer behavior when it comes to checking baggage, both carrying more on and then we have also more elite customers that are not charged for bag fee, both from ourselves and our Alliance partners as well. So we're addressing that in other areas of ancillary activity, but thankfully, it's trending about where we expected at this point in the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glenn Engel, Bank of America.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, you mentioned Horizon, the RASM slightly down. What's holding Horizon's back relative to -- Horizon back relative to Alaska?","Andrew Harrison","Glenn, Horizon unit revenues is a little bit complicated only because you may recall in Q2 of last year, we basically did a full fleet transition. So horizon got out of the CRJs, went down to its 48 aircraft. We actually shrunk the network, shrunk the stage length and also with the things going on. So as you look at the unit revenue performance, we had 19% or 15% increase last year. Going forward, it won't be until the fourth quarter that all normalizes. What I will say about the regional business is that the revenues we generated this quarter earned us the same strong profitability as we earned last quarter and I have no concerns at this time, other than some competitive pressures in Canada on the regional network.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Second question for Brandon. The incentive pay, what has the number gone from what to what, and is that mainly the biggest increases that's thrown into the third quarter or is it spread out over the 2?","Brandon S. Pedersen","The increase is spread out over the 2. We took a little bit of that in the second quarter and we'll see a lot come through in the third and the fourth. I think there's a chance that we might see incentive pay at roughly $90 million this year, if we continue to track like we're tracking. Just to give you some historical context on that, last year, we were at $72 million and the year before that, we were at $92 million. So these are not unprecedented levels, certainly, and it's actually a great thing because it reflects the fact that we're exceeding goals in lots of different areas, and our employees should feel really good about that.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And finally, the excise tax gave you a benefit last year. Can you quantify that for us?","Andrew Harrison","This is Andrew. I don't quite recall. I think internally, as you know, we didn't charge that. The revenue impact of that was basically spread out. Those bookings were spread out up to 330 days. What we believe it gave was more of a brand low-fare presence versus major incremental decrements in revenues. In short, I don't think it was material. So...","Bradley D. Tilden","Andrew, I remember there was an analysis done to say did we make up with volume what we lost in not raising the fare to cover the tax. I remember it was positive to the tune of a few million bucks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Crissey with UBS.","Kevin Crissey - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Brandon, I think you said that you were somewhat disappointed overall in kind of flattish cost with the amount of capacity growth that you've had. If that's the case, what specifically can you do as you look forward, what areas or opportunities for some cost reduction by line?","Brandon S. Pedersen","I am disappointed and I'm not -- it's a big-picture disappointment. It's disappointed with the fact that we're going to be roughly flattish for the year on 6% growth, and I would love for this company to get to a point where we can have 6% growth and leverage that into 2% unit cost reduction, for example. And unit cost reductions are really hard. It's probably fair to say that all the easy stuff has been done, but we're not without additional opportunities going forward. I mentioned the 900ER. I think that's a really powerful thing that we can have to reduce costs going forward. I think there's lots of good stuff happening on the Alaska side and the Horizon side, and I'll ask Ben and Glenn to chime in on that. That will continue to make incremental improvement in unit costs. We know we need lower cost to be successful long term, but it's a slog. I will tell you that. Ben, Glenn?","Benito Minicucci","Kevin, Ben here. So on the operations side, I can tell you, we have CASM readily in our sites. And of course, 3 levers for us: one is on the labor productivity; aircraft utilization; real estate and of course, the 737-900ER is going to have a huge benefit. But quickly, productivity is -- we've worked on it for the last 3 years. We've made significant gains. I'll just give you an example. Pilot hard time went from 62% to 66%, a 4-point gain, which is about $20 million of cost reduction, and of course, we see more of that in the future. Aircraft utilization's up an hour a day over the last 3 years. And real estate, reducing our footprint, going to lower cost airports, improving gate utilization. Just moved from Miami to Fort Lauderdale, took $1 million out of our cost bucket. But those are things I get on the operation side. We know we have a big driver on CASM, and my team, and I'm really grateful for our employees. All of it what Brad said. Because we run such a great operation, we're able to tighten things up and we're very laser-like in our focus in making sure we put the emphasis in the right places.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Glenn wanted to add his thoughts on that too.","Glenn S. Johnson","I just thought I might reflect on Horizon's progress here as well. Back in 2001, we had an $0.185 CASM x at the Horizon level, and we're down to $0.125 now. A good portion of that has come from the business transformation plan, the simplification to a single-fleet type and a number of other things that we've talked about over the last several quarters. Looking forward, we're still very focused on our pilot productivity and cost efficiency. And in particular there, we're moving to flight attendant and pilot basis from 2, which we will -- we'll be able to bring down our cost substantially in terms of hotel costs, improving hard time and reducing per diem expense. And on the maintenance side, we've put a lot of investment into improving the reliability of the Q400. Now it's time to start realizing the benefit of that in terms of improved cost efficiency on the maintenance side.","Bradley D. Tilden","And then big picture, you might be interested to know the thing that we've been talking about internally, what we call ROIC line of sight. And basically what that is, is a project where we're saying, let's know with certainty what the invested capital base is going to be over the next couple of years. Let's make reasonable revenue assumption and then we'll have a cost plan that's very connected to that so we can ensure that we're delivering on our ROIC commitments. And so it's all about knowing where the -- knowing where we're going, having a reasonable expectation of revenue and then getting the operating folks really connected on the cost side to make sure that, that happens.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve O'Hara of Sidoti.","Stephen O'Hara - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Could you just talk about in terms of Hawaii, I mean you said it's going to be about 20% of your ASM this year, I think. I mean is this something that we should expect to grow kind of at the same rate as your overall capacity going forward or do you still expect some sort of accelerated growth?","Andrew Harrison","Steve, this is Andrew. Well, actually, on the Hawaii side, it was well over 50% and it's been coming down. In short, you should definitely not expect to see Hawaii continue to grow relative to the rate that we've been growing. I think the opportunity there is becoming largely fulfilled. As I've said, we are very committed to supply the seats to demand. That's not to say there's not some more opportunity, but I think over -- as we look over the next few years, we're going to be continuing to look for opportunities, but the Hawaii growth will start to abate.","Bradley D. Tilden","Steve, I'm sure you remember, March of 2008, both Aloha and ATA filed for bankruptcy, and unlike other bankruptcies, they quit flying almost overnight within a couple of weeks. And that 20% of the Hawaii market was gone immediately, and that's really the hole that Alaska has come in and filled. And as Andrew said, there still are opportunities in Hawaii, but the hole has largely been filled at this point.","Stephen O'Hara - Sidoti & Company, LLC","And then [Technical Difficulty] and in terms of your ancillary revenue per passenger, can you tell us where it is now, where it's kind of tracked the last year. And it seems like some of the other airlines are maybe -- they have higher fees than you guys do and it seems like maybe there's some quick gains to be made there, if you guys kind of match with the -- a lot of the industry does.","Joseph A. Sprague","Steve, this is Joe from Marketing. On a per passenger basis, we're at about $11.60 today. That is trending down from a little over $12 a year ago for the same period. Yes, we mentioned the bag fees already. We have actually seen some positive gains in ancillary revenue with our buy onboard food and beverage program, where we've made some nice enhancements recently and also with our hotel sales, our direct hotel sales for hotels and packages that we sell to customers primarily at alaskaair.com. And we think there is some more that we can do there. We have some guiding principles that we apply to ancillary fees, and one of our primary principles there is to make certain that what we're charging extra fees for provide a major value to our customers, and heck, even with our bag fees, we feel we achieved that because we still have the industry's only baggage service guarantee. And those other areas that I mentioned, whether it's food and beverage, hotel, et cetera, certainly check that box as well from a value standpoint. So as we think about fees or other types of fees we might charge, we do apply that filter, and I think that's what we're going to stick with going forward.","Stephen O'Hara - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And anything in terms of being able to unlock additional -- do you see close and low-hanging fruit in terms of unlocking additional ancillary opportunities?","Joseph A. Sprague","I guess the one trend that we have seen been a little bit encouraging here this year is the hotel sales. We sell both a la carte hotel at alaskaair.com and then prepackaged sales. As we've grown our presence in Hawaii, obviously, a big leisure destination and most folks going over there on vacation has been a nice opportunity for us. And we have seen significant growth year-over-year in terms of our Hawaii hotel activity. And so there's more we can do. In fact, there's a lot more we can do in that area. We're looking at some further enhancements for our website that would enable that, and so, I think that's one thing that we're focused on.","Stephen O'Hara - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. I guess -- and then just quickly, in terms of your -- the way you package hotels and sell them, I mean is it similar to Allegiant's model of the way they do it, which I'm sure you're familiar with?","Joseph A. Sprague","Yes, it's a -- we have a couple of different models that we deploy. One is where we offer a package deal. We get rates from hotels and other ground vendors at our destination, package them with the air and sell one package price. And then we also have sort of an a la carte option that we offer at alaskaair.com, where folks can buy hotel and car rental for any destination in our system on just an ad hoc basis. And I think our opportunity going forward is to create a better customer experience in terms of how they purchase those products. We don't currently hold any hotel inventory, so there's no risk there, but that's our current hotel set-up.","Bradley D. Tilden","This is Brad. I might just add to that, we -- I don't think it's a near-term opportunity, but we do kind of fundamentally believe that Alaska is a trusted source, and over time, 20% of our revenue dollars are people going to Hawaii, and over time, we should be able to grow that business. We should be able to put a lot of hotel and a lot of car volume through alaskaair.com. I don't think it's going to help us in the next -- it's not going to materially change our earnings in the next quarter or 2, but over the next several years, that's a big business opportunity for us that we should be able to realize that benefit.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Dan McKenzie of Rodman & Renshaw Securities.","Daniel McKenzie - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division","I guess going -- coming back to the ancillary revenue question, perhaps from a different angle here. How are you thinking about the puts and takes of unbundling the product a little further? And I guess from an Alaska perspective, does it drive demand and revenues or given how you've established your brand, would it -- is the sense that it might dilute the brand and revenues?","Joseph A. Sprague","I guess -- this is Joe again. I would say, Dan, that we're watching the industry trends very closely. We look at results from a lot of the key industry surveys, the most recent of which, of course, is the in-depth J.D. Power survey that came out. What is obvious is that customers continue to have a strong distaste for fees that don't bring value, that don't represent some measurable enhancement in the service. And so that is right now a guide for us as we think about different fees that we might charge or this notion of further unbundling of the product. So our model where we do charge some fees, we try and track them into something that brings value to the customer. That's worked well for us, and we think there are, as Brad mentioned, on the hotel side, some additional opportunity to grow some of those specific areas. But I think a further unbundling has some risks associated with it from a customer acceptance standpoint. And as we try and grow our brand, grow our presence in some new markets and help to get Alaska better known, I think the position that we have right now with fees is where we want to stick.","Daniel McKenzie - Rodman & Renshaw, LLC, Research Division","Understood. And I guess given the focus on unit costs, as you look ahead, does that rule out for you folks accounting plus longer term?","Bradley D. Tilden","No, I don't think it does rule that out. It's -- I think this whole unbundling question and products like that, I think the right answer for us is to be -- we need to be students of the industry, we need to be thinking about this stuff and learning. So if economy plus was something that we believe that there was a demand for with our customers and that it was profit positive, that's something we should look at. Not trying to hint that we are, but I just -- I wouldn't say you should rule out ideas like that.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

It's good to be back with you all.","In today's prepared remarks, you will hear updates from our leaders Brad Tilden, Ben Minicucci, Andrew Harrison, and Brandon Pedersen. Several other members of our management team are also here to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call.","This afternoon, Alaska Air Group reported second quarter GAAP net income of $262 million. Excluding merger-related costs, mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $270 million and adjusted earnings per share of $2.17, ahead of the first call consensus. These results compare to adjusted net income of $206 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.66 in the second quarter of 2018.","Our adjusted pretax margin expanded 300 basis points and our earnings per share grew 31%.

The vast majority of the integration work is now done and we're beginning to realize the benefits from our significantly expanded network and the synergies for bringing the two airlines together. We've integrated our work groups, our reservation system and our back office functions faster than any other major airline integration.","And with our relentless focus on low fares and low costs, best-in-class customer service, the industry's most generous mileage plan, a fuel-efficient fleet, a well loved brand, and a fortressed balance sheet, we are well set up to move toward our targeted annual growth and our targeted pretax margin of 13% to 15% over the business cycle.","We made great progress executing our plan this quarter with a 300-basis point improvement in our margin and we're implementing initiatives that we shared with you at our Investor Day last November to drive further margin expansion in the quarters and years ahead.","As you know, we as a leadership team are fully committed to producing the right margin and returns for our owners, given the $8 billion of capital that you've invested so that we can invest in our growth and provide the right benefits for all of the people who depend on us.","Our long-term formula of focusing on high productivity, high asset utilization, and low overhead is working. I want to thank our operating division leaders for their cost performance relative to plan so far this year. In fact, given solid cost savings from plan, our team was able to maintain our full-year cost guidance even after adding back the cost of new labor deals.","And on that topic, we were really proud to announce two new labor deals this quarter. First, a two-year extension with our aircraft technicians which allows all of our Alaska mechanics to work on all of our mainline aircraft. And this is an agreement which has been both negotiated and ratified.","And second, a five-year extension with the 5,200 employees, represented by the IAM, which is being voted upon as we speak. We're pleased to come to these agreements with the finest employees in the business and we're hopeful that the agreement with our IAM represented folks ratifies in the coming weeks.","On the revenue side, I thought we also had a good result this quarter. I want to thank our teams in revenue management, e-commerce and marketing who had the best improvement in unit revenue that we've seen in the past 30 quarters.","We're currently in the middle of the busy summer travel season, and our people are running an excellent operation and taking great care of our guests. Genuine and caring service is what makes Alaska different and we're also proud of our 22,000 folks at Alaska and Horizon for earning their 12th consecutive JD Power Award, along with other recognition we've received from the American Customer Satisfaction Index, Cardenas, Travel & Leisure, WalletHub and many more. It's clear that our folks are doing a terrific job.","The JD Power Award is especially gratifying this year as we passed the 800 point mark for the first time in our history. And as it was the final award in the traditional network category, carrier category as the categories have changed going forward.","Our results for the first half of the year make us optimistic about the rest of 2019 and beyond. As you all know, we're running our business so that this will be a great place for our people to work, a great place for our customers to fly, and very importantly, a great place for our owners to invest. We've got more work to do to execute our plan and we are fully focused on getting that work done.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ben.","Ben Minicucci","Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone.","In the second quarter, total revenues grew 6.1% to $2.3 billion and a 1% increase in capacity as unit revenues increased 5.2%, well ahead of our initial guide of 3.5%. Our pretax margin was 15.8%, 300 basis points better than prior year and our adjusted earnings per share improved 31%.","As Brad mentioned, we still have plenty of work ahead of us, but the momentum is encouraging. For example, the recently ratified transition agreement and integrated seniority list with our technicians brings our Boeing and Airbus mechanics together and provides a two-year extension giving our technicians in the Company more certainty through 2023. The agreement recognizes the high caliber of our maintenance team with pay increases, signing bonus, and enhance productivity.","This integrated agreement is a significant milestone at Alaska, as we now have joint agreements and integrated seniority list with all of our work groups, and less than three years from the date we acquired Virgin America.","It is a huge accomplishment and allows us to come together as one team, continue to build on our a strong culture and fully leverage the synergies we planned from the acquisition.","I also want to thank our 5,200 IAM represented employees for their absolute professionalism over the past several months, as we've finalized the recently announced tentative agreement for a new five-year collective bargaining agreement. With our last deal signed over five years ago, this group was the furthest out of market amongst all of our labor groups and represents about 25% of our employees.","We won't know the results of the vote for a few more weeks but I'm excited to get these well deserved raises and improvements to our folks who represent Alaska so well and deliver outstanding guest service day in and day out.","These two agreements will increase our wages and benefit costs by approximately $50 million annually, and about $48 million this year, including one-time signing bonuses and other costs of approximately $24 million.","The impact of these new agreements is included in our cost guidance today. We are pleased to come to these agreements and we want to thank the IAM and AMFA for their continued partnership as we work together to provide great wages and benefits for our people and set the stage for a successful financial future.","Our focus over the next few years is on implementing the initiatives on our road map to build brand strength, improve our product and guest experience and to strengthen our financial muscle as we strive toward a best-in-class investment for long-term owners.","Looking back on the second quarter, here are some of our biggest accomplishments. First, as Brad mentioned, our employees were awarded with our 12th consecutive JD Power Award, a true testament to the exceptionalism of our people. I couldn't be more proud of the hard work they put in every day to take care of our guests and run a great operation.","Second, we are now realizing the full run rate of the $330 million of revenue initiatives and synergies we launched over the last several months. This includes the increased benefit from the cross-fleeting of our higher gauge lower unit cost Boeing aircraft into the most capacity constrained markets with overflow demand. We should see the biggest impact from these changes during the peak summer travel season in Q3.","Third, we completed the painting on all of our Airbus aircraft and we are 25% through the interior renovations, which will provide more premium seating and increased revenue per aircraft.","Fourth, after a rough operational start to the year, due to the Pacific Northwest storms, we have claimed our way back to first place year-to-date for on-time departures and second-place in DOT on-time arrivals and I'd be happy to address the nuance of these two measures in Q&A. For the second quarter, we were first among the top carriers in both of these categories.","And on the regional side, Horizon is topping the leader board when it comes to operational performance, number one in the regional industry year-to-date by a wide margin. I want to give a shout out to the entire team at Horizon for a complete turnaround in their performance over the past couple of years.","Each of these along with the everyday accomplishments of our teams across the Company is pushing us to be better tomorrow than we are today. We talk a lot of run here about turning the dial, a little each day to make incremental improvements. We are always pushing ourselves to be better. So as we continue to turn the dial and with the win now at our back, I'm confident in our team's ability to outperform.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Andrew for his commercial updates.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks Ben. And good afternoon, everyone.","My comments this afternoon will focus on the second quarter revenue performance, guest-facing initiatives and revenue guidance for the third quarter. The 5.2% improvement in unit revenues was a welcome result of what was a volatile revenue environment in the first quarter and represents our best unit revenue improvement over the past seven years and our best absolute Q2 RASM in the past three years.","Industry pricing stabilized for the most part as we ended the second quarter, which included the dissipation of low close-in fares. As we ended this year, we had a goal of outperforming industry RASM by approximately 200 basis points.","We beat industry RASM by approximately 190 basis points this quarter. Ex-MAX related unit revenue outliers for some carriers, our revenue initiatives and synergies delivered on that goal. Breaking Q2 down further, I'd like to provide a bit more detail on the year-over-year unit revenue increase. First, in terms of challenges. Although not as impactful as the first quarter, we continue to see softness in Hawaii pricing due to the significant year-over-year growth in overlapping weighted competitive capacity of 6% to 7%.","We also saw increased industry capacity from the Lower 48 into the State of Alaska putting some pressure on our long-haul Alaska yields. This competitive capacity continues through the peak summer period. These two regions represent about 22% of our system, with unit revenues negatively impacted by about 50 basis points, which is less than what we had originally guided to.","Turning to the positive, our strong unit revenue performance was driven by the following key areas. First, our synergies and initiatives continue to ramp and they reached their full run rate during this quarter.","These initiatives improved our Q2 RASM by 350 basis points, which we guided to on our first quarter call with Saver fares the largest contributor to this improvement. We continue to feel confident in the $330 million of combined 2019 initiatives and synergies we guided to at Investor Day last November.","Second, we had tailwinds of about 100 basis points from the Easter shift and another 100 basis points from changes in our award redemption structure that had negatively impacted RASM in Q2 last year after our reservation system cut-over when redemptions got away from us.","Third, underlying pricing stabilized and steadily improved through the quarter. Nine of our 11 operating regions representing 88% of our capacity experienced positive year-over-year unit revenues including California transcon markets that were significantly impacted by pricing actions in Q1.","A quick note on transcon markets. I want to thank all of our operational and commercial teams that have rallied around improving our performance in this region. We've made several changes including more focused marketing, cross-fleeting and a concerted effort to improve both cancel rights and on-time performance.","Most importantly, our station and in-flight crews have been focused on delivering consistently great guest service, all to help improve the financial performance and guest experience of these important routes and it's working. Although we have a ways to go, we did experience significant improvement in RASM and double-digit increases in California transcon margins year-over-year and we see continued momentum as we head into Q3.","And lastly, we continue to see strength in our loyalty revenues, which increased 5.7% on flat passengers. The percentage of our flyers during the quarter that were Mileage Plan members and credit cardholders improved 2.7 points and 1.2 points respectively, which is very encouraging. As we mentioned in previous calls, the commercial team is focused on a number of network and product enhancements this year that our guests have embraced.","First, our Alaska Global Partners network is expanding again with our new partnership with EL AL with new direct flights out of San Francisco to Tel Aviv. This is in addition to the direct service to Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore and Dublin and have all been added or announced from Seattle by our partners. With our 17 global partners, our Mileage Plan members can earn and redeem miles to more than 900 destinations worldwide.","Second, as Ben mentioned, we are installing new cabin interiors on our Airbus and 737-700 aircraft that both align and improve the guest experience. We've completed 25 so far. Each Airbus renovation increases total seat count and builds in a greater mix of First and Premium Class seats. These are beautiful aircraft and our guest reaction has been extremely positive.","Third, we have now completed satellite Wi-Fi installation on 44 of our mainline aircraft and the feedback from our guess has just been fantastic. This, along with our in-flight entertainment boasting the most movies in the sky, provides our guests with a top-notch in-flight experience. In fact, our entire regional jet fleet is also equipped with Wi-Fi and on-board entertainment.","And finally, two weeks ago, we opened Phase 1 of a stunning new wing of the North Satellite terminal here in Seattle featuring our new 16,000 square foot flagship lounge for our guests. We've also started construction on a rooftop lounge in San Francisco that we expect to open next year.","So looking to Q3, our capacity growth picks up modestly to approximately 3% and our Q3 RASM guidance our range is 2% to 5% reflecting the benefit of our many revenue initiatives and merger synergies, our expectation of stable pricing through the peak summer season, offset by continued pressures we are seeing in Hawaii and long-haul Alaska flying that I mentioned earlier. We are designing our product, network and revenue management processes to enable growth with the financial objective to achieve our 13% to 15% long-term pretax margin goals.","In fact, we recently announced that we are implementing a new state-of-the-art Amadeus Revenue Management system, which will be fully deployed by next year - by the middle of next year and will result in better revenue performance in our 2020 and beyond. With the structural changes we've made to our revenue model, we continue to feel confident in our 2019 objective to outperform industry RASM and look forward to building on this solid platform for used accounts.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks Andrew, and good afternoon, everybody.","Our second quarter adjusted net profit of $270 million and earnings per share of $2.17 were both 31% better than the second quarter of 2018. This marks our second consecutive year-over-year improvement in quarterly margins and is the largest year-over-year margin increase since Q2 of 2016. It's evidence that our plan to improve returns is working.","Andrew touched on the revenue performance. So I'll touch on cost performance for Q2 and the outlook for the rest of 2019. We set up this year with an aggressive plan to keep unit cost growth to between 2% and 2.5% on a roughly 2% increase in capacity, no small task given the cost pressures we faced and before the impact of any new labor deals.","Teams across the Company have risen to the occasion and managed costs in the first half of the year in such a way that we've been able to maintain full-year cost guidance that falls at the low end of our initial range even after absorbing the impact of the AMFA and IAM deals that Ben talked about.","These agreements will add approximately $50 million annually, with approximately $48 million impacting this year, including $24 million in the back half of this year base wages and $24 million in signing bonuses that we expect to pay in Q3. For the full year, we now expect non-fuel unit cost to grow by 2.2% all in.","Looking at the quarter, unit cost ex-fuel rose by 2.3%, much better than our initial guidance of plus 5%, much of the beat is solid execution, although some of the outperformance as a result of certain costs shifting to the back half of 2019.","Pilot training costs are a great example, as cross bidding between mainline fleet types is now happening, but a little later than expected, this will put pressure on pilot productivity shifting up to $15 million of training cost into Q3 and Q4, from the first half of the year.","Nevertheless, we continue to see encouraging improvements in productivity and our ability to control overhead costs. Let me provide a few examples. First, Horizon's overall productivity measured by passengers per FTE is up 3.3% this quarter and unit cost ex-fuel are down 16% on 20% capacity growth.","Productivity in the Flight Ops Division is a particularly bright spot as training costs have declined significantly and hard time has improved, especially on the E175. I want to congratulate the Horizon team on these fantastic results.","Second, as we mentioned on our last call, our supply chain team has been working a plan to lower prices we pay to our vendor partners. The results have been outstanding. We expect to save more than $30 million this year positively impacting costs across many divisions.","A third example relates to flight attendant premium pay. During the transition, we had a heavy reliance on premium pay to make sure our flights were all covered. Today, our in-flight team is having to use much less of it because of a much more normalized operation and better processes in the department.","And finally, overhead is down by more than $15 million or about 5% so far this year. Over the last year, we've made changes to the size of our management staff not only to save payroll costs but more importantly to improve our speed and agility and reduce the number of layers between our leaders and both our customers and our frontline employees. These changes are important as we seek to more positively and tightly manage our Company towards the future that we are seeking.","Looking to Q3, we expect CASM to be up approximately 5% on a 3% increase in capacity, which given our full year guidance would imply a 1.2% decline in unit costs in the fourth quarter. The third quarter increase reflects the cost shifts I mentioned, timing of expected variable pay accruals and the impact of the new labor agreements, including our expectation that we'll pay as I said earlier $24 million in one captive time cost during the quarter.","July marks the beginning of our annual planning process. As we think about 2020, we're mindful of our need to continue to aggressively manage our unit costs in a way that maintains or expands our competitive cost mode versus the legacy carriers. Doing so ensures that we can offer low fares, grow, and achieve our 13% to 15% long-term margin target.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. Total cash flow from operations for the first six months of the year was nearly $1.1 billion ex-merger related costs, while net CapEx was $330 million. This resulted in $735 million of free cash flow again ex-integration costs which was nearly $400 million higher than the first six months of 2018.","At consensus, full-year operating cash flow would be about $1.5 billion and free cash flow would be about $775 million assuming CapEx of $725 million this year. That's more than 3 times the amount we produced in 2018, the result of the direct outcome of our decision in early 2018 to reduce capital spending in order to improve free cash flow.","We've produced free cash flow now for nine years in a row and positive operating cash flow for more than 30 consecutive years. Maintaining this track record of positive free cash flow is an important part of our capital allocation strategy.","A fortressed balance sheet was also a hallmark for this Company - of this Company for many years and we're quickly back to that - moving quickly back to that position. We've repaid $280 million in debt so far this year, including some repayments that were made in June that will offset with some new borrowings in the third quarter as part of our broader effort to take advantage of the low rate environment, lower our borrowing costs, and move to more fixed rate debt, given the tight spreads and inverted yield curve.","I want to give a shout out to our treasury team for the work they've been doing and thank our banking partners who have adjusted rates downward. We're on pace to reduce our debt balance by about $350 million in 2019 and we've already paid off $1.2 billion of the $2 billion we borrowed for the merger. With leases, our quarter-end adjusted debt-to-cap stood at 45% and we're on track to end the year at about 42% and reach our 40% goal sometime in 2020.","We have 100 unencumbered Boeing NGs and Embraer E175s and $400 million of undrawn lines of credit. We have returned $110 million to our owners via the dividend and share repurchases, we set a plan to return $220 million to shareholders this year and will hit it, which is a nice way to close.","You've heard today, a number of examples of where we set a plan and we're executing on it. The results are encouraging. We're delivering industry-leading operational performance and our customer service is award winning.","On the financial side, we have revenue and cost momentum and our balance sheet is strong and if we continue to execute our plan we'll be in the top quartile in the industry for profit margins, balance sheet strength, and free cash flow generation.","And with that, let's go to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Savi Syth","A bit of an unfair question because you just look to be delivering a really good 2019 on the cost side, but what have you done for me lately, just as we think about 2020, I wonder if you can walk through some of the headwinds and tailwinds that you're seeing in 2019 and how they progress through 2020?","Brandon Pedersen","Savi, it's Brandon. I'll start and then maybe Shane can jump in. That's a super important question as we start to think about the 2020 plan. As I mentioned, we're already waiting into that process. We recognize that low costs are a super important competitive advantage that we've had for a long time and will continue to be an important competitive advantage as we go forward.","And it's going to be a big part of us getting to our 13% to 15% margin goal. A lot of the initiatives that we have in place will provide benefit into 2020, we walked through a bunch of that at Investor Day, I think we've got a lot of momentum as I said on that stuff. Shane, you want to?","Shane Tackett","I might only add something. I'll be a little generic. I think the biggest sort of specific challenge we have going forward is just all these lease returns. There's a lot of complexity that goes along with that. However, there is a lot of opportunity to continue to save cost out of the operation and out of the Company.","There's tons of stuff we can do on productivity, utilization all of those things we talked about at Investor Day, we really haven't fully tapped yet. I would say this year is really more about getting the muscle to manage costs back and in the next couple of years, it's starting to manage those down more aggressively.","Savi Syth","And then on the network side. This unit revenue guide is really good. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about as you understand the network changes and how that's affecting your seasonality - if we should know - now how we should think about if those kind of you're going to have a peak year summers here and 1Q being kind of a much weaker, how we should think about kind of the network and how that affects the quarters?","Andrew Harrison","Savi, it's Andrew. I think this comes back to opportunity and when we acquired Virgin America it actually made us more peakey, now Q1 and Q4 were deeper problems in Q2 and Q3 were stronger. So what you'll see is sort of the traditional pattern, Q2 and Q3 very solid, Q1 being the worst, and I think as we move forward as we look at our network for 2020, we are working hard on how we make Q1 much more balanced and much stronger going forward.","Savi Syth","And so not necessarily in place for 1Q '20 but just going forward, is that fair?","Andrew Harrison","There's already changes being implemented in the first quarter and we're continuing to finalize those. So we are in the process.","Operator","The next question will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","You spoke enthusiastically about loyalty in the quarter. I assume that was a consolidated observation, why wouldn't it have been. Would you be willing to discuss loyalty returns - loyalty returns, excuse me, in the Seattle market specifically. I'm obviously curious if you're losing any share there as your primary competitor pushes its own loyalty scheme. I've got to imagine California is what's really driving aggregate loyalty improvement, but I'm curious if Seattle is declining?","Andrew Harrison","This is Andrew. Thanks for your question. Although we don't normally talk on specifics, what I can tell you without absolute question is that the Pacific Northwest loyalty continues full steam ahead. Certainly we have a lower base in California and the percentage-wise increases are obviously larger there, but actually all of the things that have been going on has just only pushed us to work harder and stronger here in the Pacific Northwest. And we continue to see solid growth in Mileage Plan members and credit cards and revenues in the Pacific Northwest.","Jamie Baker","Excellent. Second question, I know there have been several industry attempts to raise Hawaii fares as of late, as near as I could tell, they have not succeeded. Is that the correct interpretation? Or did we get some fare increases during the quarter? I'm just curious if there is any cause for pricing optimism, given that you're still calling that out - that market out as challenged as a RASM headwind in the quarter?","Andrew Harrison","Yes, I think for - on the Hawaii side, there has been marginal attempts at pushing things up a little bit. There has been nothing major at all. I think what really we're fighting here is significant seat increases year-over-year in this marketplace. And so, but we are filling the airplanes although you know at cheaper fares.","But again, that's one of the assets that we have here with First Class, Premium Class and new Saver Fare product, all of these things are working to help, in some cases, overcome some of the softness in the fares.","Operator","The next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Given your informal outlook Brandon for north of 6 bucks and free cash flow this year, what would you need to see to get more aggressive again on the buyback?","Brandon Pedersen","You just did the math based on the numbers I used in the script?","Duane Pfennigwerth","Yes, sir.","Brandon Pedersen","Here's what I would say is we've been really focused on what we've called re-deleveraging the balance sheet, as I said in my prepared remarks, a fortressed balance sheet has really been a hallmark of this company for a long time. Our balance sheet is super, super strong. I think right now we're really going to keep deploying capital to getting the balance sheet to exactly where we want it, and then think about broader return to shareholders once we get there.","Duane Pfennigwerth","You've been very clear and consistent on that. And then just for my follow-up piqued my interest with the Amadeus RM system upgrade middle of next year. What specific capabilities do you think this will provide for you? And is there any sort of transition risk around that as you rotate over to that system? Thanks.","Andrew Harrison","This is Andrew. That's a great question. We always worry about transition risk. We're working off honestly 20-year-old technology and we've had to design and build a lot of technical reports to manage around that. So this will be next generation state of the art. It will also allow us to do O&D pricing, which today we just don't have any capabilities for and it's also going to be allow our analysts and our teams to be much more focused on the macro matters, and the system will take off a lot of the heavy lifting there doing at the individual analyst level, so we can get better results.","So we'll talk to you more about that as we move into 2020, it's an initiative we have real revenues tied to that. We're not ready to share that yet. And then on the revenue risk is always risk, but the team has a fantastic plan as they are going to start to layer in markets independent from the system, so a little bit of an overlap, if you will. And so we're going to do this in a measured cautious manner, so that we don't expose ourselves to any real significant revenue risk.","Brandon Pedersen","We're not going to go to true or O&D pricing out of the gate, we'll stick with - change vendors but go to segment pricing and then in time, we'll move to a --","Andrew Harrison","O&D will be later on when we are ready to pull the trigger on that and we'll start with certain regions and will turn those on, in the new system and then we'll just continue to roll them out.","Operator","The next question is from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Catherine O'Brien","So just a couple of questions on your cost outlook here. First, I wanted to clarify, does your CASM outlook include the signing bonus from your recent contract gratification, meaning you're not as seen as special item some of your peers do?","Brandon Pedersen","Cathy, it's Brandon. Yes, our cost guidance includes the signing bonus.","Catherine O'Brien","So - there are my math. The new rates and the signing bonus are about 90 basis point headwind here to your CASM outlook for the year. So I mean and in your new CASM outlook including that is only 10 basis points better than what you were previously forecasting.","So I guess what's driving that improvement, I think my math that leaves most of that made up in the June quarter. I know you guys talked about a few things that are trending better than expected. But in the back half, is there an opportunity to see some of that cost strength continue and maybe even trend down, despite the new deal?","Shane Tackett","Cathy, it's Shane. Thanks for the question. I'll sort of reiterate what you said and what we said on the prepared remarks. The team did a fantastic job managing costs in Q1 and Q2. I think we may have even surprised ourselves a little bit how well we managed them.","And I think that if we continue to do that, there is opportunity in the back half of the year. There are some costs that we know are shifting, Brandon mentioned those, some of the pilot training costs and a few other areas, but we're still seeing real strength on managing overhead, managing productivity, managing selling expenses, as an example, in the quarter, revenues were up 6%, selling expenses were down 3% which is just a really wonderful result.","Usually those correlate together and go up at the same rate. So we're finding areas to marginally improve the Company all over the place and we'll continue to mind that in the second half.","Catherine O'Brien","It really impressive because, at least, on my math fully offset just by the June quarter better performance there, the new deal. And then maybe one for Andrew. We keep hearing about how Saver fares is trending better than expected, but I don't think we've officially gotten a raise that $100 million annual target. Any comments still waiting for more testing there or should we be expecting [indiscernible] there at some point?","Andrew Harrison","Katie, I would not hold your breath because we don't plan on giving out specifics and updating that other than to tell you that the 330 that we shared, we feel very solid about. Saver fares has actually performed better than we had thought, some others a little bit less though, but we're just going to stick to the high level numbers versus go into all the details, but it's doing very, very well for us.","Operator","The next question will come from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Andrew, a couple of straightforward questions for you. As far as the MAX, what sort of benefit or impact are you seeing there, whether it's in your third quarter guide or your second quarter guide? And then your latest read on competitive capacity and how that's trending? And then finally, any color on development markets and maturity there and whether or not there is much more opportunity ahead of you?","Andrew Harrison","Yes, thanks. The best way for me to talk about the MAX is just to really look at the industry seats and what we're dealing with and as is very public knowledge we saw a number of closer in pull downs by carriers to accommodate the MAX. So we've sort of been a recipient of that. If you look forward though, our competitive capacity on a weighted basis is actually down 0.7% in the third quarter.","And again I think that's in no small part to the industry capacity coming down, which I think brings good things for everybody when capacity discipline is carried out that way. The other thing I would tell you is that on the new markets in the maturity, we still have, we've seen really good improvement. Some were on average I think up to about 85% of normalized yield and they continue to improve and a little bit some of the California markets especially so. So there is still upside for us as we continue to mature these markets.","Catherine O'Brien","Can you quantify maybe that last one. I mean, how much you've seen so far or how much more there is to go?","Brad Tilden","As it relates to the guide no, what I think, what we continue to want to see in our developing markets, which were much smaller percentage of our network now, but we still want to see high single to double-digit unit in our revenue increases in those markets, but I don't have a dollar figure our RASM number to quantify that for you.","Operator","The next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","So, I had two questions. My first question is related to what field and what are you doing there and will you not be serving that market anymore? Is that the way to think about it?","Andrew Harrison","Helane, this is Andrew. No, we are absolutely serving Love Field. I think what's got little confusing on all of that, is that, we have as you know there's a lawsuit going on. I'll let Kyle touch on that in the second, but we have to gauge there, there is a lawsuit going on and we have 13 flights a day.","What we've done is, there is uncertainty around how that lawsuits going to end up on what's happening. So, we had scheduled more flights. So, what we're doing is holding to our 13 flights a day. What we're doing is concentrating now on full markets, which is Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. And that's sort of what we are going to be flying here for the foreseeable future. Then Kyle, did you want to comment?","Kyle Levine","Sure, hi Helane. Yeah, the litigation really just applauds on, it scheduled to go to trial in September, we'll see if that sticks or not. In the meantime the judge has been very active and keeping up settlement discussions among the carriers and the city and I'm afraid to say there so far not been much progress there although people are talking.","Helane Becker","Okay, and then my second question was on transcon. So I think in the first quarter that was a kind of a problem and I didn't hear you mentioned whether that was improved in the second quarter and how that looks for the summer?","Kyle Levine","Thanks Helane. Yeah, it was, it was a real problem in the first quarter and in the prepared remarks and just what we've been sharing as we are very, very encouraged with what's happened there. We have significant unit revenue increases in those during the second quarter was pricing stabilized that's continued into the third and we have seen double-digit margin increases in those transcon routes and in part, notable part that our employees of really rallied around those markets, around the guest service both in the aircraft, on the ground, we're making sure the satellite flights get on there, SoC has done a magnificent job getting the 99.5% completion rate, so we are just all in focusing on the guest experience and it's making a difference.","Helane Becker","Okay. And then, could I just follow that up with one MAX question. Would you consider keeping A320s to backfill the MAX?","Brandon Pedersen","Helane, this is Brandon. I'll take that one. You know, we have three A319 plus 320 airplanes that are due to be return between now and the end of 2020 and we're going to stick with that for the time being. Those are already in process to one degree or another.","We do have MAX is coming in next year, our MAX exposure was pretty darn small, we were supposed to get three in the last few months of this year. It's perhaps one now. Those two that we are not going to get this year, will probably come if things play out like we're hearing they might play out in the first quarter. So, the capacity issue for us isn't nearly as acute as it is for some other MAX operators.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Michael Linenberg","Yes. Hey, Andrew, you called out the improvement in pricing indicated it's stabilized and improved through the quarter, could you just give us maybe some additional color to show how things trended and then is that continuing, that trajectory continuing into the third quarter?","Andrew Harrison","Yes, I think really around the pricing environment, I would say it's - our biggest problem is obviously close in fares and business fares, we're very, very low during the first quarter. So those are substantially going away in a stabilized.","The fare environment I would say in a number of areas are still sort of down a little bit year-over-year, but stable and again, the way we've overcome that of course is with all these new revenue initiatives and a lot of the changes we're making to the business.","So, for me personally, the way I would describe the fair environment for Alaska is one of stability and we are working with that and we're not seeing any real changes in demand and demand continue is actually to be quite robust.","Michael Linenberg","And then just the second question. And Andrew, this is to you as well. I realize it's early with the Paine Field operation, but how has the start-up been and when you look at the clientele, are these passengers who formerly flew out of Seattle, are they, are they new customers, may be coming from other carriers, what can you make of the Paine Field start-up, just curious about how it's going.","Andrew Harrison","I don't remember about, starting, you know, what we did in Pain with eight new markets and starting off with 18 frequencies has been quite amazing, other than Portland and Seattle, we probably got a little too much, excuse me, Paine port and we got to probably a little too much capacity there.","But on the whole, all of these markets are well into our average load factors now and the yield is working its way up. And I think we couldn't be more impressed and excited with how the startup of that operation only after three months has gone.","I will say that we probably seen a lot of our non-frequent flyers actually are flying at a Paine Field on, my initial got would be a lot of the loyal customers will and they are, some habits are hard to break. But what's really exciting is we're seeing a lot of non-core loyalty members taking advantage of the close location of Paine Field and demand has been very, very good.","Operator","The next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Brandon, you sound very excited today by the way, I just want to mentioned that, and appreciate you guys not pulling out the signing bonuses special item that's really good stuff, it's noticed. I do have a question for you on selling expenses. I know this is Shane or Brandon. How is it down so much? I know that some of that's accounting reclassification but even if you take that away adjusted. It's still down by tens of millions of dollars over the last couple of years. Is this something you like renegotiated with Virgin? What are you doing to get that down? How much more is there to go? Thanks.","Shane Tackett","Hunter, this is Shane, yeah, you pretty much noted, we did get an opportunity to renegotiate a lot of deals that Virgin had that got closer. Our rates and a lot of those cases we are able to actually bring our rates down at the same time, so that stuff that has taken place over the last year or two, it includes not only the cost of distributing tickets like through travel agencies and GSSs and medic partners but also our core passenger service system. We basically renegotiated all of those in the last three years are really attractive rates of the Company.","Hunter Keay","So there is such a thing as a merger synergy then?","Shane Tackett","There you go.","Hunter Keay","Okay, good. And this is a little bit more of a high-level question, but I know if you've noticed, but the market to Hawaii has changed a lot over the last 10 years and there's a lot more sort of long-haul narrowbody fine with neo's and for time MAX is where, there's more outer Island destinations being served from smaller communities that was not previously really able to do without these neotechnology and MAX technology.","I feel we're starting to see that a little bit in Alaska. You mentioned some overflow of Seattle, you're seeing American put for example a 321 neo at a Phoenix into in the Anchorage, are you prepared for this? How are you thinking about over fly being a permanent issue as more Airlines get the neo's, and are you prepared to sort of cannibalize your own connecting traffic with the MAX\u2019s if you need to do that sort of like Hawaiian is doing with their neo's.","Andrew Harrison","Yes, I do Hunter, it's actually, you're observation is spot on. I think the way that we look at it is, the opportunity for others is the same equal opportunity for us. I mean we fly all of those East Coast destinations from Seattle. We have a strong, obviously network actually in the state of Alaska including strong feed. We fly into Chicago. So I think a couple of things. I think there could be opportunity for us going forward, given the aircraft type to do some of that our self.","There will be occasions where there is true over fly and traffic that we might have challenges getting, but at the end of the day, we have a very, very strong network up there, a very, very strong loyalty proposition, and we will continue to fly where Alaskans need to go on a non-stop basis and as we go forward.","Brad Tilden","Yeah, Hunter, something like two out of three Alaskans are members of our Mileage Plan. And I would agree with Andrew, if there is a desire for more longer distance flying into Alaska hubs, we should be competing for that.","The other thing I'd just note is just the relationship between the economies in the State of Alaska and in Seattle in particular is extraordinarily close, whether it's government, or fishing, or timber, or whatever, tourism whatever industry we might be talking about, a lot of those business connections are here.","If someone doesn't want to go to Houston for oil or something like that, that's a customer that we are going to have to compete for if they're doing mortgages since flight. But I think a lot of it actually is Seattle business.","Andrew Harrison","And a lot of it's just really just been in the peak summer season as well.","Brad Tilden","That's exactly right.","Operator","The next question is from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi","Andrew, just on RASM performance in 2Q, up about 5%, 3.5 points or so from the initiatives. So 1% increase in capacity led to maybe a 0.5 increase in core PRASM if you want to call it that, like why is that a good result? Why isn't there more traction in PRASM given your kind of modest capacity growth?","Andrew Harrison","I mean, the way the simplistic way I look at this is, firstly, what we've committed to, is number one, we want to grow unit revenues in line with the industry and the industry also has initiatives and revenue initiatives in there and if you look at our revenue and synergies that's about 400 basis points. So what we're really saying is we're going to grow at the right, the industry is that includes their initiatives, plus another 200 basis points on top of that.","So that's how we are thinking. We think that's a very strong result. I'll also, I think our stage length increased by about 1.5% during the second quarter, which also puts downward pressure on unit revenues and we're also seeing significant increase in stage length, even in the regional business as well as their mix gets more, a little bit long haul.","So overall, and then the last thing I'll just point to is our margin. We have close to a 16% margin for the second quarter and we have powder left in both our cost and revenues. So overall, what you're seeing is a track that we're headed to a 13% to 15% margins and so you're right, it can be better and it will be better as we continue to move this thing forward.","Joseph DeNardi","And then, Andrew, I guess I was a little bit surprised given how important revenue generation is doing airline business that you're using 20-year-old technology. I would have thought that that his upgraded a little bit more frequently, so why is that? And what is the revenue opportunity from that?","Andrew Harrison","So again, we have a system. And again, it's just all priorities. And I think when we acquired Virgin America, much of what we're looking here massive step change in the size and complexity of our business. So we definitely it's time for a new system. We will be sharing with you as part of our outlook for 2020 what our revenue initiatives will be, including the revenues there. So we're not prepared to speak to those today.","Joseph DeNardi","Yes. And is it material?","Andrew Harrison","Yes, yes it is.","Joseph DeNardi","Thank you.","Brad Tilden","Its revenue management, leadership, analyst and we have the top-notch commercial analytics team that that makes up maybe a little bit for us upgrading the systems.","Brandon Pedersen","And it's all it's with the vendor where we\u2019ve now, it's not like to have an updated software, but it's a new platform that we are moving to. Good. I think Kevin Crissey might be next.","Operator","Kevin Crissey with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Kevin Crissey","Yes, thank you very much. And I just continue on with the Amadeus quickly, why choose Amadeus is my understanding is it the best aspect of that is the international component, does that suggest maybe a more of an international focus going forward or was there some other reason for that vendor selection? Thank you.","Andrew Harrison","Without going into details. We did a very starrer RFP looking at all the vendors and it came down to cost, it came down to capabilities, it came down to what our RM Team needed and wanted for our network today and our future network. So that's, that was the decision.","Brad Tilden","But to be clear, I don't think new international service. I don't think that was a big driver.","Andrew Harrison","Not long haul service, no.","Operator","The next question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Matt Wisniewski","This is actually Matt Wisniewski on for Brandon. So I know it's early for 2020. But as growth starts to ramp in next year, I mean, turn to a return to growth. I'm wondering if you could share any kind of attributes on what are the priorities for growth are and what, how we should be looking at that. And then as a secondary in the context of the 4% to 6% growth how much flexibility would there potentially be in that, specifically in the context of the margin targets? Thanks.","Brad Tilden","Matt, it's Brad I might jump in here. I think the first priority, we've got just in the incredible economic engine in the Pacific Northwest. So the first priority would be feeding that engine and doing everything we need to do to sort of defend and grow markets out of the state of Washington, in the state of Alaska, the state of Oregon.","I think the second priority we've got some important new geography in the State of California and San Francisco and LAX, in particular, I think it would be doing the flying that we need to do in those markets to provide just the important base utility for business travelers and others in those markets.","And I think after that. I think there are. And Andrew sort of hinted at this. There's opportunities for us to do a better job of connecting the different parts of our network in strategic ways. And so I think that would be the third priority.","Finally, we've always got an opportunity to make sure when we have multiple frequencies in a city pair to make sure those flights are well timed to make sure that we're flying back and forth from the West Coast to the middle of the country that are times are friendly to West Coast customers. So, those are in my own mind, those are sort of that would be sort of a top to bottom sort of priority about how we would think about future growth. Sounds like Matt might be off the line.","Matt Wisniewski","No, thank you. I appreciate it. That's really helpful.","Operator","The final question is from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Dan McKenzie","And not many as question as well, presumably that gives you more merchandizing capability versus what you have today. Is that a fair characterization?","Shane Tackett","Dan, it's Shane. I'll just take this, because I have them to be the person who installed the merchandising system. We actually have one. We use fare today. Amadeus has a really good one as well. We're super happy with our partnership with Fair Logics as well, but if there was an opportunity to move to Amadeus. We could do that, but we've got a really good robust merchandising platform today.","Dan McKenzie","The other sort of technical question here with respect to the increased premium seats coming from the reseat, the Airbus, can you revenue manage these seats real time as they come online or is there some conservatism on that until you reach a critical mass, either in terms of aircraft or as you think about the plaintiffs?","Shane Tackett","Dan, this Shane again, I launched PC. So I guess, I'll take this one too. The only real conservatism is making sure that if we sell the seat the PC seat shows up. As you know, we don't really assign a specific shell to a market until we're closer in. So trying to sell a seat six months ahead of when we actually assign the aircraft that's always, that's the calculus, we try to go through. So there is a little bit of a ramp up period as these come online, but it doesn't take that long for us to be able to, to pre-sell through the entire window.","Dan McKenzie","So on a new aircraft comes on these premium seats maybe don't sell at a premium for like the first month or how would you characterize the delay?","Shane Tackett","Yes, the way we do it, just not to get too technical , but we have like 20 planes coming then we might sell 10 planes worth for about a quarter and then the next quarter we'd sell 15 planes worth next quarter we sell 20 planes worth so might take two or three quarters to burn in.","Dan McKenzie","And then one final question here, I wonder if you could talk about the Airbnb restrictions that were recently passed in Hawaii. How are you thinking that might or might not impact travel to or demand to Hawaii?","Shane Tackett","Yes, I think you know we like everyone are watching that, I think, my understanding is about 5,000 units of inventory coming offline for a Hawaii only. It may result in people flying to the other islands for a better availability and costs and we flight all of those four islands. But again, that's something we'll be watching over time. Our bigger focus obviously is how many seats going into Hawaii, because at the end of the day, Hawaii is about supply and demand.","Brad Tilden","Okay. I think we're not going to hear from the operator again. Thanks everybody for tuning in today for our second quarter call. We look forward to speaking with you all again in 90 days time. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference call. This call will be available for future playback at alaskaair.com.

My name is Michele, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group Fourth Quarter and Full year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the call over Alaska Air Group\u2019s Managing Director of Investor Relation, Lavanya Sareen. Please go ahead.","Lavanya Sareen","Thanks, Michele. Hi good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for Alaska Air Group\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings call. Before we get into the results for our fourth quarter, we hope we have got a chance to see the results of the spectacular fourth quarter turnaround by our other CFO, our Chief Football Officer, Russell Wilson. Our entire team at Alaska congratulates the NFC champion Seattle Seahawk on their win last Sunday and we wish them all the luck for the Super Bowl next week.","For the earnings call today our CEO Brad Tilden; our other CFO Brandon Pedersen; and our Senior VP of Planning & Revenue Management, Andrew Harrison will provide highlights from the fourth quarter and our outlook for the first quarter and full year 2015. Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your question.","Our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a fourth quarter GAAP net profit of $148 million. Excluding mark-to-market fuel hedge gains of $6 million and a $30 million benefit related to certain post requirement benefit plans and a one-time gain associated with a legal settlement, Air Group reported a record adjusted net profit of $125 million or $0.94 per diluted share. This result compares to first call consensus of $0.93 per share and exceeds last year's adjusted net income of $77 million or $0.55 per diluted share.","For the full year, Air Group reported a record adjusted net profit of $571 million compared to $383 million in 2013. Adjusted earnings per share grew by 55% from $2.17 per share in 2013 to $4.18 per share.","Additional information about cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging, capital expenditures and other items can be found in our investor update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Brad.","Brad Tilden","Thanks, Lavanya, and good morning, everyone. We are very happy to be talking with you again. We had a record year on almost every front even as we approached the end of the second year with much more competition in Seattle. We got a fabulous group of folks here, folks that look at the outside world realistically and then get to work putting together plans that will work, and then we relentlessly focused on executing those plans. I could not be more proud of all of the people of Alaska and horizon together with the leadership team who have risen to the occasion and produced some outstanding results.","Looking at the numbers, our pretax profit for the quarter was $206 million and that was 67% higher than 2013. It helped us post record full-year pretax profits of $922 million, up 50% from 2013. We had a 17.2% pretax margin which is almost 480 basis points higher than 2013. And our ROIC for the trailing 12 months is 18.6%, an improvement of 500 basis points. Importantly, that improvement was driven by great earnings but also by reductions we made in the invested capital base through share repurchases. Even excluding the tailwind from lower fuel costs, our full year margins expanded by 300 basis points.","One of the distinguishing characteristics of high quality companies is the durability of their profits. 2014 was our fifth consecutive year of profitability in every quarter and our second year profitability in every single month. In fact, in 2014, our monthly profit, when compared to the same month in 2013, was higher in every single month. These results affirm that we have built a business that performs when challenged and that works well throughout the cycle.","Our cash flow from operations was over $1 billion, which has enabled us to reinvest in the business and return cash to shareholders. Brandon will talk more in a moment about our financial engine and about how growth in profit is enabling us to improve our balance sheet and our competitive position.","As you know, given our belief in the sustainability of our results we declared our first dividend in 21 years in July, 2013 and we increased it by 25% just six months later. Today, we are very pleased to announce that we are raising our dividend by 60% from $0.125 per share to $0.20 per share, and that's per quarter. With today's announcement we\u2019ve doubled our dividend in the 18 months since we announced it and with today's announcement our dividend yield is 1.2% and our dividend payout ratio is 18%.","If we step back and look at our results over a longer period of time, say five years, we see that we've have grown ASMs by an average of almost 8% per year. We\u2019ve grown revenues by almost 11% per year. We\u2019ve actually shrunk unit cost by 1.7% per year. And finally, we\u2019ve growth both net income and cash flow from operations by $150 million per year.","From a financial perspective, this machine is working well, and at this point, we are singularly focused on driving this performance higher.","As I said at the outset, these financial results were driven by the development of good plans and, more importantly, by great execution of those plans. As we do every year, we put out a call to action to our folks at the beginning of 2014 and I\u2019d like to report out on how our team did against those objectives","Operationally, ALK leads the industry in reliability. Alaska was named the top U.S. airline by Wall Street Journal's annual score card of airline service for the second year in a row. This is a quantitative analysis which is based on data collected from the DOT and other sources. 86% of our flights this year arrived on time and we expect this to result in Alaska being the number one carrier in 2014 is ranked by flightsdesk.com for the fifth year in a row.","Our completion factor of 99.5% was also the highest among the seven largest domestic carriers. From a customer perspective, we reached an internal customer satisfaction record in 2014. Our 84% blended satisfaction score is the best score we've received since we began collecting this data in 2007.","As you know, this internal data has been validated by J.D. Power & Associates which ranked Alaska as the leading U.S. airline for the seventh year in a row and by their first ever survey of frequent flier plans in 2014 which rated us number one.","From an employee perspective, I think we're doing reasonably well also. I think these results demonstrate that our folks are flat delivering every day. We've got a great group of folks and our employee survey shows that employee engagement is at an all time high. We spend a lot of time with our people listening to them and talking with them about where the industry is headed and where Alaska is going; and I think that\u2019s paying off.","On the labor front, our flight attendants approved a new five-year contract in December. With the flight attendants the deal done, the weighted average duration of our agreements covering represented employees is almost four years; its three years and nine months to be exact. And we believe that compares very favorably to the rest of the industry. I want to thank our flight attendants for not losing focus on our customers during a long and difficult negotiation.","Another reason Alaska is performing well is that we have great alignment with our employees. When the company does well our employees do well and every one of our employees participates in the same gain sharing plan. Our programs, which we call PBP, pay close to the maximum for the fifth consecutive year. This is also the fifth consecutive year where our employees will get a full month salary and performance bonuses. Brandon will talk more about this in a bit; for me, I'd just like to say that this alignment between shareholders and employees is powerful and I also want to say that I'm proud of our employees for working hard and earning these pay outs.","As we sit here today, we're very excited about the future. Airlines are managing capacity to match demand and management teams across the industry are running airlines to create a better experience for customers, better jobs and more job security for our employees and, most importantly, real value for our shareholders. And lower fuel prices provide real opportunity in the near-term for owners.","For Alaska these great results have come amidst unprecedented competition in our markets and the folks throughout our company are rising to the occasion to make us a great airline every day for our customers. We think of this customer experience together with our low fares and low cost as a competitive advantage or as an economic moat to borrow a term from Warren Buffett.","We have a whole host of initiatives that we're focusing on in 2015 to further widen this moat and they range from working with our employees to further enhance our onboard service, to investing in our onboard product and experience, to further improving our mobile and other customer facing technologies to maintain our leadership position.","We're excited about the future and our entire team of 13,000 people is completely focused on achieving our plan so that we can continue to deliver strong results in the years to come.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our 2014 passenger revenue grew by 7.3% on 7.1% growth in capacity, resulting in a PRASM increase of 0.2%. Very strong performance considering competitive capacity grew 7% in our markets. Our total RASM outpaced PRASM and grew 0.9% as a result of ancillary revenue initiatives that we launched in 2014.","Looking at the fourth quarter, our revenue was up 8% on a capacity increase of 10.6%. PRASM was down 2.4% as a result of the 8% increase in competitive capacity and a 1.1% increase in system trip length. That said, underlying demand continues to be robust and we continue to work on improving the strength and profitability of our network in a numbers of ways.","First, we have the best schedule utility for customers in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest and our launch of 16 new markets over the last year brings our total North America destinations served from Seattle to 79 versus our closest competitor at 26. Our Seattle market share of 55% is four times our nearest competitor and ensures that we will continue to provide the greatest network utility for our customers.","Secondly, our growth has been incredibly efficient and margin accretive. An important element of this has been our fleet retrofit program which has helped lower unit costs without compromising passenger comfort. As of the end of December, we've completed the retro seat fit on all our 737-800 and 737-900 aircraft. These improvements combined with the delivery of 10 more 737-900ERs accounted for 50% of the capacity growth in 2014.","In addition, the seat retrofit program should provide an incremental benefit of about $25 million in 2015 or a total run rate benefit of approximately $50 million per year.","Third, as I shared at our investor day last month, the industry is moved to revenue based loyalty program and presents us with a unique opportunity to increase our membership base while evaluating the right structure for Alaska in the long run.","Active Mileage Plan members are up over 11.4% this year, the largest increase we have ever seen, on a 6.8% increase in passengers. In fact, the growth rate is almost double what we have observed on average over the last five years, but perhaps even more impressive is our elite members on average flew 6% more segments on Alaska versus last year. The growing loyalty member base and fierce loyalty of our customers gives us confidence that we will continue to be successful in our core markets.","Finally, while fuels has been a nice tailwind in the fourth quarter several of you have asked us if we are pricing to account for the lower fuel prices, and the answer is no. When pricing tickets we look at the supply and demand in each of our markets and adjust prices to balance the two. Approximately 90% of our flying is in the United States domestic market and the U.S. economy continues to be strong.","Looking ahead, Alaska's first quarter capacity is expected to be up 11% approximately 4 points of which is driven by efficient up gauging. Our full year growth expectation for 2015 is 8% and that's in line with previous guidance. Other airline capacity in the first quarter of '15 is expected to be up 15%, that's a 2 point reduction from three months ago and a 7 point reduction from published schedules six months ago.","While the demand environment is robust there are some factors that will pressure unit revenues in Q1 especially January; I would like to point those out. Firstly, the first quarter of last year was our lowest capacity growth quarter, up about 4.5% wherein 2015 it will be our highest capacity growth quarter as we sit here today up 11%. Second, our comps are top. We had a 3.5% increase in PRASM last January, that was the highest of the year helped by a significant amount of revenue we generated carrying traffic for other airlines that had high storm cancellations. For the first quarter last year that was about a point of PRASM or $9 million most of which was in January.","And finally, we have a special promotion going on right now where the first bag is free for members of our Mileage Plan through the month of January. New customer acquisition has far exceeded our expectation that the foregone bag revenue equate to nearly a point of RASM for the quarter.","As I look at 2015, underlying demand is strong, competitive capacity while high has moderated versus previous expectation, initiatives developed are working well, members in our loyalty program are growing at unprecedented rate and, in general, new markets are exceeding our expectations. This gives us confidence that we are entering 2015 on a strong footing.","At our Investor Day, we shared some of the revenue initiatives we are undertaking to ensure we continue to perform well in 2015 and beyond. I wanted to give you some additional details on a few fronts.","As you might recall, we added a discounted booking class to our first class fares and rolled that out to approximately 50% of our market by year end. This increased our paid first class traffic by 7 points in the fourth quarter and we are rolling this out to the remaining 50% of our system by the end of March. First class PRASM in Q4 was up approximately 1% or 3 points above system PRASM performance.","Second, we will launch the preferred seating product in the second quarter which allows customers to book an exit row or bulkhead seat for as little as $15 to $50 one way depending on the stage length of the flight. We bundled this with a free drink and priority boarding to make this a compelling offer to our customers. Initially, we expected to at around $15 million in revenue and margin on an annualized basis but we anticipate growing these revenues over time.","Third, we are upgrading our revenue management system in the first quarter. While the underlying pricing algorithms are the same, the system will be able to optimize flights based on demand more regularly which will help us optimize revenue. The upgrade will also help automate certain processes that are manual today in the system. A primary example of this is P fares I just talked about.","And finally, and personally for me, very pleased to announce that John Kirby has joined Alaska as our Vice President of Capacity Planning overseeing Alaska Air Group's network and scheduling functions. John will richly add to our team with over three decades of experiencing working at carriers of all sizes.","We are confident that the 16 new markets we launched in 2014 combined with the 2014 initiatives and the additional projects we are rolling out in 2015 will help us continue to deliver strong results this year.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Air Group's adjusted net profit for the fourth quarter improved by 67% and, because of the reduction in shares outstanding, earnings per share improved by 71%. Full year profit grew by 50% and, as Brad said, after tax ROIC came in at 18.6%, 500 basis points higher than in 2013.","Our $206 million fourth quarter pretax profit was $83 million higher than last year. Revenues grew by almost $100 million and non-fuel expenses grew by $60 million but those increases were offset by a $42 million reduction in price of fuel. I know the collapse of fuel prices is front and center in investors\u2019 minds right now, but I don\u2019t want that to overshadow the excellent cost performance we achieved both in the fourth quarter and in the full year.","CASM ex-fuel for the quarter declined by 2.4% on a 10.6% ASM growth. Even with the reduction, there were a couple of noteworthy items that negatively impact the quarter; first, Q4 includes the impact of the new agreement with Alaska\u2019s flight attendants. The signing bonus and new rates accounted for about $9 million of additional cost. And as you might recall, last year in Q4, we recorded a final favorable true-up to Port of Seattle lease costs making Q4 this year a very tough comp and explaining much of the 31% increase in landing fees and rents on the P&L.","For the full year, we lowered non-fuel unit cost by 1.3% making this the fifth year in a row of non-fuel unit cost reduction and the 12th year out of the last 13 for the main line operation. The reduction widens our cost gap versus larger rival network carriers which is on average about 20% to 25% and which continues to be source of important competitive advantage. We saw excellent cost control in most areas all year and productivity continues to be a great story. Across Air Group we increased passengers for FDE by another 2%.","We are proud to report that incentive pay increased by 10%. Our people earned a new record $116 million. About $14 million of that was earned under the operational performance rewards program for meeting monthly on time and customer satisfaction target; the other $102 million was earned through our PBP program. PBP is not a traditional profit sharing plan but rather has annual goals set by our board in four categories: safety, customer satisfaction, and non-fuel unit costs, which each may get 10% of the total, and an Air Group profit goal which may accept the remaining 70%. Employees at Alaska exceeded all of these goals and are receiving the maximum pay-out of 10% of base wages. Horizon employees missed the cost goal but hit the maximum pay-outs for the other measures. As Brad said, PBP pay-outs will approximate a month pay for nearly everyone. We will be paying PBP on Monday, almost a month earlier than normal thanks to the great efforts by our payroll and HR teams.","Turning the page to 2015, we expect non-fuel CASM to be out flat. At Investor Day, we told you that the expected non-fuel CASM -- we expected non-fuel CASM to decline about half a point. In absolute terms, we ended with a budget that was very, very close to what we thought at the time. However, because we finished 2014 with better cost than we were expecting then the comp is simply tougher.","Let me walk you through some of the larger cost drivers. First, a new flight attendant contact is expected to add about $25 million of structural expense in 2015, up about 19%, but adds about $15 million of incremental expense in 2015 after considering the signing bonus and additional wages already booked into Q4. The new contract does, however, include some important productivity enhancements.","Second, pension expense is expected to increase about $20 million or 150% driven by lower discount rates and higher life expectancy assumptions. Even with the discount rate and required assumption changes our pensions remain 93% funded with no required contributions.","Third, depreciation will be at 14% because of the significant investments we're making in the fleet. We took delivery of 10 Boeing 737-900ERs in 2014 and will get another 11 of those highly efficient aircraft in 2015. The 900ERs have 37 more seats than the 737-400 but burn about the same amount of fuel. They are more reliable and customers like them better. We will also take another Q400 earlier in the year.","Fourth, maintenance expense will increase about 12%, split about 60-40 between Alaska and Horizon. Much of our Q400 fleet is entering an engine overhaul cycle. And finally, as Brad mentioned, we're investing in things that customers will notice such as new in-flight entertainment and improved food offerings. The customer service workshops for more than 8,000 of our customers facing employees will cost us about $10 million but this will be money very well spent much like the flight path training that we had a few years ago was.","Now, fuel. The dramatic retreat in oil prices should translate into higher profitability and cash flows for all airlines. Having said that, and even at these oil prices we're really focused on fuel efficiency in order to increase our all out competitive advantage on the cost side. In 2014, our fuel efficiency on an ASM per gallon basis improved by another 2.1% bringing our fuel efficiency improvement for over the last 10 years to 22%. We have now installed splits scimitar winglets on 48 aircrafts with more to go and look forward to phasing out to remaining 27 737-400 aircraft and replacing them with efficient 900ERs by the end of 2017.","The recent collapse in oil prices has put fuel hedging policies in the spotlight. Alaska's program is simple and straightforward. We buy call options that act as an insurance policy against sudden spikes and allow us to fully participate in fuel price declines with no risk of collateral calls.","Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Operating cash flow topped $1 billion in 2014 for the first time ever. Free cash flow was $344 million. Alaska's debt balance declined to $800 million as scheduled principal payments more than offset new financing. We ended the year with $1.2 billion in cash and a $260 million net cash position even after factoring in our operating leases.","We own 77% of our fleets, including 76 airplanes that are owned free and clear, that are mostly high value NGs. And we expect this to increase as we replace the 737-400s with new 900ERs.","Alaska's strong balance sheet compares favorably to other high quality industrials in the S&P 500. The credit rating agency say Alaska is only one of two investment grade airlines in the U.S. and only one of five worldwide. Access to high grade credit markets is another way Alaska differentiate itself and as a competitive advantage. This will give us more options when and if we want to go to the debt market and we\u2019ll be able to do at a lower cost.","We invest $667 million into the business in 2014 bringing the total since the beginning of 2009 to nearly $2.8 billion. We are generating very strong returns on that investment and have created substantial value for our owners at these returns levels and even without the benefit of low fuel prices which may very well be short lived, Air Group like any other high quality industrial earning 10 percentage points above whack should be investing more into the business and we are doing so. We are currently projecting CapEx for 2015 to be between $650 million and $700 million.","Brad noted that we repurchased 7.3 million shares of our common stock for $348 million which equates to about 5% of the shares that were outstanding as of the beginning of the year. We also paid $68 million in dividends bringing the total returns to shareholders to $416 million in 2014. This exceeded our cumulative total returns in the proceeding five years. Dating back to 2007, our share repurchase programs have allowed us to buyback 30% of our shares before dilution and 18% after. As we said at Investor Day, we expect to return more cash to shareholders in 2015 than we did in 2014.","2014 was a very good year for Air Group. Alaska has real and durable competitive advantages that will help us sustain these returns going forward. We're safe; we run an excellent operation. We offer award winning service, have really loyal customers, a great network, low costs, a modern fuel efficient fleet, a strong balance sheet and engaged employees. I want to join Brad and thank them all for everything they did to produce these terrific results.","And with that, we'd like to open it up to questions that you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Savi Syth-Raymond James","Just kind of curious on that, I appreciate all the color you gave on the unit revenue side, just -- in December, I was wondering, how much of the timing shift Thanksgiving kind of hurt your December unit revenue?","Andrew Harrison","Hi Savi, this is Andrew. I don\u2019t have an exact numbers, but I think I'd put it around a point or so of that shift, and again December was a very high capacity growth month at around 12 plus percent versus November.","Savi Syth-Raymond James","Got it. It makes sense. And then the mileage plan, how long does that go through?","Andrew Harrison","That actually ends for folks actually flying on an airplane January 31 at midnight. So for the full month of January folks who physically fly on our airplanes who are mileage plan members will get a free bag.","Savi Syth-Raymond James","All right, great. And then if I may just one last on the CapEx side, and I understand the fleet CapEx, just wondering what the CapEx increases on the non-aircraft side and what those investments are?","Brandon Pedersen","Hi, Savi its Brandon. You caught me off guard on that one. The -- let me come back on the line and get you that answer.","Savi Syth-Raymond James","All right, sounds good. All right thanks.","Brandon Pedersen","Yes, thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from Hunter Keay. Your line is open.","Brandon Pedersen","Hunter, are you there?","Operator","I'm sorry; he has jumped out of the queue. So we'll move on to your next question, Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Michael Linenberg-Deutsche Bank","Just two questions here, Brandon, historically, I've liked how you have positioned yourself and how you hedge well and I'm just thinking with the curve having gone from backwardation in to a fairly steep contango. I think if I look at over the next year, it seems like prices are like to $8 to $10 above where they are now. That combined with the increase in volatility it would suggest that the call options are probably a bit pricier. Does that change or slowdown the pace at which you have been building your positions, or is it just systematic? Do you just keep adding or you've been more sensitive on some of the structural changes to the curve?","Brandon Pedersen","Hey Mike, it\u2019s Brandon, good morning. I'm going to let Mark Eliasen take that one.","Mark Eliasen","We are very systematic in it. We did take the approach that its insurance and when insurance rates go up slightly you continue to buy insurance. So that\u2019s what we do.","Michael Linenberg-Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. And then just my second question and just to Andrew, Andrew, just the stats on Mileage Plus I thought that was very interesting and the fact that employments[ph] were up I don\u2019t know about almost 7%, 6.8% your Mileage Plus members I think you said up about 11%, what when you look at the -- where you're getting the new Mileage Plus members from, I mean is some of this coming from markets outside the Seattle? So for example Salt Lake that was a market where may be you had three or four flights a day and may be for sometime your penetration was low, but once you moved to say 14 or 15 daily frequencies and the same with San Diego, you get to tipping point or all of a sudden it does make sense for that local passenger to move into the program, or are some of these customers coming from may be some of your partner airlines where their programs have changed and they're playing this arbitrage how might -- which program or which carrier is going to give me better, is going to get me more miles for what I'm purchasing?","Andrew Harrison","Right, Michael, that\u2019s a lot of questions in there, let me try and hit because I think it\u2019s very pertinent. So our mileage plan royalty program just on the growth side, I think what's most encouraging for us is that it\u2019s across the board. So we obviously have our largest basis in the Pacific Northwest and in California and we've seen good healthy growth in those areas.","And then on the small areas whether it\u2019s sort of the Salt Lake City or some of these other key focus points the growth has been off the charts obviously on smaller basis. And so we've been very encouraged but this is across the system.","An important thing and maybe some lessons learned here, we've been far more proactive about investing in our program, advertising our program, getting out there with our program than we have before and we've seen big significant changes there. And then lastly I think here is the question and its early days at on the industries change to an accrual -- revenue based accrual process.","And as we shared on Investor Day, a huge amount of our customers will be better off in our program and but more importantly as you know our program, we have a big portfolio both global and domestic carriers and we think we bring a great proposition to the table. So all of those things combined we feel like we've got good momentum here that will continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Hunter Keay-Wolfe Research","So I\u2019ve a couple of questions maybe for Andrew about your State of Alaska business. Can you do your best and let us know so what percentage of revenues are tied -- that you can tie directly to the oil market, whether that\u2019s corporate or oil town that you serve, non-oil clients that you serve, anything like that?","And also, Andrew, let us know what your point of sale mix is with business up to Alaska? For example, you have people buying tickets, flying up to Alaska take a cruise back down so that might not be even packed from low oil prices. Help us understand what\u2019s going on with that market.","Andrew Harrison","I think and maybe Joe might add here a little bit but I think -- I don\u2019t want to give specifics on some of the items you\u2019ve requested. So what I would tell you is that the State of Alaska we\u2019ve seen the resilience over the years from booms and busts and it just had a steady as she goes, marginal increase year after year. We have a very big mix. So in summer times, its huge amounts of volumes in traffic for vacations, coming up through our network and up to the State of Alaska. To your point, there\u2019s huge oil and commercial business, and as you know, Hunter, we are highways and the byways for the State of Alaska and so a lot of that is just static that continues day in and day out. So overall the State of Alaska we feel is way less volatile than probably other parts of our network.","Joe, did you just have anything to add there?","Joe Sprague","Hunter, Joe here. The only thing I would add is in terms of oil towns in the State of Alaska really Anchorage is the big oil town. The production activity happens up on the North Slope. We fly up there to Prudhoe Bay. Actually there\u2019s a fair bit of winter time traffic that\u2019s counter seasonal because they do all the exploration work on the North Slope during the winter time, and I think the oil companies despite the low oil prices right now lot of those projects are to produce oil for 2, 3, 10 years from now. So they\u2019re continuing to explore and do their activities and we see the benefit of that in the winter time.","Hunter Keay-Wolfe Research","Okay, thank you guys. And Brandon, given the amount of really incredible multiple compression we\u2019ve seen with Alaska\u2019s stock over the last couple of months as oil has collapsed, you guys have still only bought back about $2 million of shares per day. Why would you not really, really ramp up the buyback materially here given the fact that the market is really not giving you guys any credit or really any airlines for that matter for the decline of fuel prices? Do you have the type of flexibility that you need within the structure of your buyback to do something like that?","Brandon Pedersen","Yes, absolutely. And by the way, good morning; we have a ton of flexibility and I think you can see that if you look at our track record over 2014 where we bought back I don\u2019t know rough order of magnitude $350 million of stock over the course of the year with probably two-thirds of that occurring in the back half. We can do that in 2015 as well. One of the things that we have always liked is kind of steady issue goes approach, we love the benefits of dollar cost averaging. I\u2019ll say if I go into the market and by $50 million this week, next week fuel will be $40. And so we just really like -- I think we will really like ratable execution and we stand by our commitment of return more capital to shareholders than we did in 2014 and we\u2019ll do that as the year progresses.","Operator","And your next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Helane Becker-Cowen and Company","Thanks very much. Hi guys, thanks for the time. I just had a couple of questions. The first one is with respect to your business to Hawaii. You didn\u2019t talk about that this time and I would have thought you would have given us an update on that business.","Andrew Harrison","Hi, Helane, it\u2019s Andrew. High level, we\u2019ve as you know been rapidly growing in Hawaii. We\u2019re about 8% in capacity for the quarter; again the overall business in region is doing well. I think for us the most exciting part there is as we get these new 900ERs we are able to increment capacity there in a nice way. So again just like many of our other regions we haven\u2019t seen any material change in the environment there.","Helane Becker-Cowen and Company","Okay. And then can I just ask an Alaska related question. I think every year when the folks who live in Alaska get their dividend checks you usually due a fair promotion program and without commenting necessarily on pricing this year those dividend checks maybe lower than they have been in past years. Would you still consider a similar promotion?","Joe Sprague","Helane, its Joe again. Just the way that the Alaska residents Permanent Fund Dividend program where its actually less tied to the oil prices and more tied to just what the overall markets are doing because it\u2019s a dividend off of their sort of their permanent fund, their sovereign wealth fund. So it actually doesn\u2019t track exactly what oil prices are doing and the checks even in low years have been pretty healthy, healthy enough tapping into them with all different businesses and services up there tend to permanent fund sales of some sort to tap into that inflow of cash to the state each fall.","Brandon Pedersen","And we\u2019ve had that -- just in \u201914, Helane, we had that in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ll look at again in 2015.","Helane Becker Cowen and Company","Thank you. Can I just ask one quick capacity question for the Super Bowl. I think I saw you guys are adding flights from Seattle to Phoenix for that weekend, so I guess that Feb what end of January beginning our February kind of thing. So does that skew your capacity growth number for this month and next month and all?","Andrew Harrison","Helane, Andrew. No, its -- that\u2019s only a couple of three flights and it\u2019s completely immaterial to our capacity.","Helane Becker Cowen and Company","Great. Okay thanks very much, very helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamie Baker-JPMorgan","Hey, good morning, everybody. I was going to suggest you charged $50 not to sit in the ball cat I guess that\u2019s why I don\u2019t work at an airline. Maybe I need the room for that mutant [indiscernible] you showed at Investor Day. Back in early 2013 Delta started seeking somewhat aggressively about its desire to be added we had S&P 500 and obviously there is only so much a company you can actually do but clearly when they were out at that autumn it was to shareholders benefit. You meet the eligibility requirements. Is this something that you spend anytime thinking about or having any sway over?","Brandon Pedersen","Jamie, it\u2019s Brandon, good morning. Let me ask Mark to answer that question.","Mark Eliasen","Hey, good morning, Jamie. To answer your question we do think about being in indexes and as you know we are in the S&P 400 right now which is --","Jamie Baker-JPMorgan","Right.","Mark Eliasen","We are one of the larger companies in the mid-cap index. So we\u2019re promoting the case that should graduate and move up to the large cap. As you say we\u2019ve been for some time and it would makes sense for us to be there; our performance certainly has been good. So we\u2019re keeping an eye on that we know we\u2019re eligible and there isn\u2019t a lot of lobbying you can do for that but I think just continuing to perform well and make sure that the committee understands that we a quality candidate.","Brad Tilden","It is a goal of ours, so Jamie, just to be really clear about that.","Jamie Baker-JPMorgan","Got it, got it. And second, with all the talk about the Frequent Flyer program this morning both Southwest and United made some smallest changes in their accounting policies; Southwest as it relates to spoilage, partner sales and United I think it was timing of revenue recognition. I\u2019m not sure you had time to even digest these changes. I\u2019m just kind of wondering how your Frequent Flyer accounting might flush out relative to whatever the industry norm is right now, they are more conservative less conservative in line, any thoughts there?","Brad Tilden","Jamie this is Bradford. From an accounting standpoint there are really no changes unless you change your program right and so for our accounting its there is a mix in the industry on how mileage planner how frequent flyer programs are accounted for but we don\u2019t anticipate any changes unless we makes changes to the program itself and then you have to consider certain accounting implications of that but, yes, there is nothing on the horizon right now.","Jamie Baker-JPMorgan","Okay that\u2019s fair.","Brandon Pedersen","Jamie, Brandon, I wanted to follow-up on that. I've always viewed ours as relatively conservative, if you look at our liability a new size adjusted to what other airlines have as liabilities, I've always viewed ours as being relatively conservative on that perspective we're using that measure.","Jamie Baker-JPMorgan","Perfect, I appreciate, it\u2019s not a big issues but its one that\u2019s just all of a sudden kind of topical, so I appreciate the color. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Duane Pfennigwerth-Evercore ISI","Just a quick one here. With fuel at these levels, how do you think your relative hedge advantage impacts the competitive environment in Seattle if at all?","Brandon Pedersen","Duane, its Brandon. I think Mark spent some time talking about what our hedging policy is and to the extent that there is an advantage, I don\u2019t think we're looking at that as something that influences the fare environment necessarily. I think Andrew articulated our perspective on that. We set fares equal, match supply and demand to the extent that we have a favorable hedge position or an insurance position that allows us to have fuel prices that looks a lot like the spot price that\u2019s going to benefit the bottom line. But I don\u2019t think it impacts the pricing environment in Seattle.","Duane Pfennigwerth-Evercore ISI","Maybe not for you but may be for others. Any estimate for the value of that unencumbered fleet which you reminded us of the 79NGs?","Brandon Pedersen","None that we're going to share today, but I think you can do the math. One of the things we try to do in the prepared remarks is to help you with that by just giving the numbers of unencumbered aircraft and then also alluding to the fact that the vast majority of those airplanes are really high value, high marketability NGs that are pretty darn new. So whatever you want to estimate the value of a 737-900ER you can do the math from there.","Duane Pfennigwerth-Evercore ISI","Okay, great. And then just could you remind us on the E175s when those are coming on this year and from a network perspective, what capability did those give you either into Seattle or market types that you haven't historically had? And thanks for taking the question.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks, Duane, its Andrew. The first three arrived this summer June that will be on mid-continent routes, these aircrafts will be very valuable assets to our tool chest for a couple of reasons. They're going to have sort of the first class product because we're going to fly them at the longer trips; they're going to be really powerful on the longer thin routes out of Seattle. And then the preferred seating products we talked about this aircraft will also have seats where we'll be selling it on that and then we have another four coming after that sort of late in '15 and in early into '16.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is open.","Joe DeNardi-Stifel","Andrew, I think it looks like this is the first time in a couple of quarters that TRASM is more or less inline with RASM, and it sounds like that will probably continue into first quarter given the free bag in January. I'm just wondering as the preferred seating comes online in second quarter, is the hope that the TRASM starts to outpace RASM?","Andrew Harrison","Joe, yes, what you're seeing is really the animalization of the bag and change fees we've made over a year ago basically completely come down to net out. So to your point, the next major driver here would be the preferred seating which would probably start to roll out in the second quarter. Off the top of my head, I can\u2019t tell you what the differential drive will be, but the hope is that our RASM will be a tide higher than our TRASM.","Joe DeNardi-Stifel","Okay, and then --","Brandon Pedersen","Joe, its Brandon. One thought on that; its not huge umbers in the grand scheme of things but maybe important to the modeling is our TRASM includes the results of our cargo business and cargo is about $100 million that\u2019s probably a 2% or 3% growth business. So growing much less than ASMs although certainly a factor or a part of that TRASM calculation. So just be aware of that.","Joe DeNardi-Stifel","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, Andrew, you also mentioned that the competitive capacity outlook has moderated a little bit. Can you quantify that just over the next couple of quarters?","Andrew Harrison","Yes, so if you look at, see here my little sheet, so if you look at the first quarter competitive capacity from other airlines is up 15 points current schedules and the second quarter is 12 and then the third quarter is 12. So that\u2019s what we see today. Again as noted on the call, we've seen these come down as we get closer to the launch date and we see a lot of carriers has been jet on cold taking a look at supply and demand and we've seen carriers adjust their capacity given some of the changes going on in Seattle.","Joe DeNardi-Stifel","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan McKenzie from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Dan McKenzie-Buckingham Research","Well, hey, guys, I appreciate the commentary on the elite passengers. And I guess looking ahead, what are your business travelers saying about their plans or business travel spend in 2015? And in particular, should we expect the spend to grow in line with your growth and capacity or would it likely lag?","Joe Sprague","Thanks, Dan, for the question, this is Joe again. Actually the Seattle market with the growth that we have here is helpful in that regard because we are adding, as Andrew said, a lot of new flying to key various destinations for some key business destinations and really strengthening our Seattle network where we have, as you know, a ton of key corporate customers. So I think on sort of the managed corporate travel business it was up mostly in the fourth quarter and we would expect at the beginning of the year here and those businesses have fresh travel budgets that that growth would continue, and so we are looking for that to be reasonably strong as we move into 2015.","Dan McKenzie-Buckingham Research","Okay. Then can you just remind us what percent of the revenues are tied to this aspect of the business?","Joe Sprague","We can get you that. For us it's a relatively small amount because of the heavy amount of leisure destinations and just general leisure traffic that we have.","Brad Tilden","Dan, this is Bradford. Managed business travelers not that -- especially if you accomplished other airlines not that greater percentage of the pie; if you look at business travel we think its 30% to 35% of total revenue.","Dan McKenzie-Buckingham Research","Understood. Okay and then just one other final question here. Brandon, debt financing obviously is pretty key for you guys and if I am not mistaken a higher debt level would lower your cost of capital. I am just wondering if you can just give us what are the puts and takes at this point from your perspective on using debt financing to perhaps leverage of the return of capital to the shareholders.","Brandon Pedersen","Hi Dan, it's Brandon, maybe I will take a stab at that and Mark can jump in with any additional thoughts that he has. Totally get the math on using debt increased leverage and returns to equity holders and we are obviously very aware of where the rates are today and raising debt would be very attractive for us. On the other hand, you need to have a need for the money and I think if you look at the history of our company over the last couple of years we have been really trying hard now for a couple of years to position ourselves as a high quality industrial and we do a lot of things to emulate high quality industrials including where we set our capitalization level and the mix between debt and equity. So that's probably the primary driver of where we are in terms of the leverage level and to the extent we need to use debt to go and manage the capital structure we will do so, but I think it's a complicated question and we are thinking about a lot of different ways.","Dan McKenzie-Buckingham Research","Okay. Thanks very much.","Mark Eliasen","Hey, Dan, this is Mark. I was just going to add on to that that we could borrow today at under 3% and we are aware of that. We can borrow on unsecured -- on an unsecured basis. Those are very attractive to us but we have enough free cash flow right now to fund most of our return to shareholder just out of free cash flow. So as Brandon said, we will balance that out, we are aware, we do have a lot of options given our strong results and our strong balance sheet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glenn Engel from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Glenn Engel-Bank ofAmerica\/Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. The question I have one on the competitive capacity numbers you gave, does that exclude what Alaska is adding itself and is that the big change in '15? Is that Alaska's adding a lot of competitive capacity on top of what everybody else is doing too?","Brandon Pedersen","Glenn, actually the numbers are sort of similar. So as I said, for the quarter, it was up 15 points. The industry which will include Alaska and the competitor is up 14. So basically, just looking at other airlines capacity increases and then if you add out they are all within a point of each other. So they are very much interchangeable.","Glenn Engel-Bank ofAmerica\/Merrill Lynch","And on aircraft utilization, if I look at the numbers, 2014 was actually slightly down year-over-year. Why was that and would we expect to see that number rise again?","Ben Minicucci","Glenn, Ben Minicucci here. We had several modifications ongoing, the major one was the seat conversion program where we had a [indiscernible] of seats going in. So we had a couple of lines of modification going. That program is complete so that\u2019s why you see the boost in utilization in 2015.","Glenn Engel-Bank ofAmerica\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Brad Tilden","Glenn, this is Brad. There is a guy here who told me you and I haven't had a chance to chat but they have told me that you have been promoted and we may not get to chat with you in the future. Just wanted to wish you well and thank you for your coverage of Alaska over the years.","Glenn Engel-Bank ofAmerica\/Merrill Lynch","Thank you, you guys have always been first class.","Operator","You next question comes from Darryl Genovesi from UBS. Your line is open.","Darryl Genovesi-UBS","Good morning guys. Not to beat a dead horse on the balance sheet but fully understanding that you are comping yourself up against other high quality industrials but I think the way the market will likely measure your leverage will be on some sort of interest coverage ratio basis or a probably that adjusted net debt to EBITDA basis and given the earnings trajectory that you guys are on with lower fuel and the operational improvements that you have made those metrics do certainly look much more conservative. And then with regard to the use of your cash, as Hunter brought up, your stock is relatively cheap. So just wondering if may be your framework is changing I know historically you have sort of articulated your balance sheet goes to us with reference to a debt to capital ratio but just wondering if may be that view is evolving a little bit.","Brandon Pedersen","Darryl, it's Brandon. Thanks for that I would say the question is absolutely not beating a dead horse. Our balance sheet is very alive and it serves us very well. I totally get your question. And we think about that stuff all the time; we talk with our board about that. I think as to the extent that we're going to evolve our approach to that it would be over matter of quarters or even years. We've had a fuel environment that looks like it does now for I think three months and I don't think you would see Alaska pivot from a very purposeful strategy of capital allocation based on three months fuel decline and the rosier cash flow outlook that that produces but rather look and see what happens over a longer period of time and adjust accordingly. But I can assure you that we talk about this stuff all the time both internally and with our board.","Darryl Genovesi-UBS","Okay. Thanks for that. And then, I guess over the last couple of years you\u2019ve really prided yourselves on having a pension fund that's full funded. With the move down in rates during 2014, is the plan still full funded on a GAAP basis and to the extent its not, should we expect a ramp up in the contribution that you guys would make to get it to be full funded on a GAAP basis?","Mark Eliasen","Hey, Darrell, this is Mark. What drove our pension funding to drop from a $104 down to about $94 was just the decline in long-term interest rate. So our investments are performing very well there. So we're comfortable. Pensions are of course they're very, very long-term assets and liability, so we're comfortable kind of letting that ride. Substantially, we are fully funded. If you look at it, it will bounce around a little bit but we are substantially fully funded. We do not anticipate making a huge contribution to that, to pensions, nor do we need to.","Darryl Genovesi-UBS","Okay. Thank you.","Lavanya Sareen","Michele, we have time for more question.","Operator","Okay. So your finally question then will come from Dave Fintzen from Barclays. Your line is open.","David Fintzen-Barclays","Hey. Good morning everyone. Thanks for the time. Quick one, quickly for Brandon. In the full-year CASM guide how much of a -- or if any PBP details, how you're managing that, is it assumed in there?","Brandon Pedersen","Yes. That's a tough one every year and it does periodically result in adjustments to CASM along the way as we progress through the year. We paid max payout this year and we would not expect to do that necessarily every year, so we budgeted something a little bit less than that.","David Fintzen-Barclays","Okay.","Brandon Pedersen","Than what we did in 2016.","David Fintzen-Barclays","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. And just taking a step back and you guys have done a smaller airline with every high returns, high returns relatives that you\u2019ve grown now your returns are only going higher presumably with lower fuel. How are you going to kind of look at low fuel in terms of your growth going forward obviously knowing oil [indiscernible]?","Brandon Pedersen","Yes. It's Brandon again. The thought I would say on that is that we are in a very low fuel environment. And as I said in the prepared marks that's going to result in an improved profitability cash flow. But we're really not considering that in how we think about planning the long-term growth of the business. As I look across the last seven years or so, I -- just on raw fuel price basis, I've seen everything from a $85 which we guided today up to $331. The simple average for the last seven years is $298, $290 a gallon and that's where our head is from a planning standpoint, big picture of planning standpoint. Our planning mindset is lets' put airplane to capital where we can produce returns for our owners.","David Fintzen-Barclays","Okay. Thanks for that. That's very helpful. I appreciate that.","Brandon Pedersen ","Thanks. Hey one other mop up. Just before I lose everybody I want to come back to Savi and her question about non-aircraft CapEx. Savi, I would encourage you to buy a lottery ticket today because I have a one inch book with about 50,000 numbers all except that one.","It is a variety of things they're driving that increase, some of it is left over spending that we didn't quite get to in 2014, some relates to the big IT capital projects that we have in place and that we've spoken to you about over the last couple of years and some of that relates to refresh that we're doing at many of our airports to try to make the Alaska presentation at a lot of our airports or most of our airports very, very consistent to improve the customer experience.","Brad Tilden","All right. And with that, thanks everybody. We appreciate your interest in us and we look forward to chatting with you next quarter. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference call.

Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Investor Relations, Lavanya Sareen.","Lavanya Sareen - Managing Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Alaska Air Group's second quarter 2015 earnings call.","Our CEO, Brad Tilden; our CFO, Brandon Pedersen; Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Harrison; and Chief Operating Officer, Ben Minicucci, will provide highlights from the second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.","Our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a record quarterly adjusted profit of $230 million or $1.76 per diluted share. This result compares to the First Call consensus of $1.73 per share and exceeds last year's adjusted net income of $157 million or $1.13 per diluted share. Additional information about cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging, capital expenditures, and other items can be found in our investor update included in our Form 8-K filed this morning, and is available on our website at alaskaair.com,","And now, I'll turn the call over to Brad.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, Lavanya. And good morning, everyone. As Lavanya mentioned, we reported a net profit of $230 million for the second quarter, which is 46% higher than 12 months ago. This is our 25th consecutive quarter of profitability and is the highest quarterly profit in our history. The 46% growth in our net profit coupled with the repurchase of 9.5 million shares over the last 12 months drove our earnings per share up by 56% to $1.76 per share.","As we pause to take a look at how we're doing midyear and two-and-a-half years into the biggest competitive incursion we've seen in a while, I'm happy to share that we are thriving. Our operation is firing on all cylinders, our leaders are focused on execution, and we are generating returns that far exceed our cost of capital. But before I talk about the returns, I want to spend a few minutes on the underlying drivers of our results.","I'll start with safety. Our number one priority is to operate safely. And we think that doing so benefits our overall operation because to be safe, we have to all understand our jobs and we have to have the tools and training to do them well. And this focus on doing things right has benefits that extend throughout our airline. Our commitment to operating safely was recently validated by our maintenance team, earning the FAA's AMT Diamond Award for maintenance training and excellence. This is the 14th consecutive Diamond Award for Alaska Airlines. Horizon Air has also won the award 14 times.","Turning to our operation, we continued to operate well despite some headwinds. As you know, we're growing significantly to strengthen and fortify our franchise in Seattle. And we crossed the 1,000-flight-per-day threshold on July 2. The increased flying coupled with runway closures in Seattle, LA, and Juneau created a challenging operational environment this spring and summer. But our people moved quickly.","Our system ops team adjusted block and ground times and implemented a dual-taxiway in our Seattle hub, which allows us to taxi two planes side by side in opposite directions. And our operations team executed the plan really well. 88.2% of our flights arrived on time, and we cancelled only one-half of 1% of our flights. We expect that both of these statistics will lead the seven largest domestic airlines, many of whom are running their own great operations. Our people are delivering on our promise of a safe, reliable, and on-time operation. And Ben, Dave and I and the rest of the leadership team could not be more proud of them.","On the customer service front, our internal customer satisfaction score for the quarter tied our score from the first quarter of 2015, which was the highest score we've seen since we began tracking this data in 2007. As you know, we also won our eighth consecutive J.D. Power Award for customer service during the quarter.","We're pleased that the enhancements to our product and service are resonating with customers, but we have more work to do. The on-board experience is an area where we've made a lot of changes and we have more plan. For example, we've introduced a new Inflight Entertainment system, we've improved the meals in both cabins, and we've given our flight attendants mobile devices, which facilitate greater personalization in their interaction with customers. In May, we introduced preferred seating, which gives passengers additional legroom, early boarding, and a free drink. We're very interested in seeing how this product is received, as it could lead to more opportunity down the road.","With respect to our schedule, earlier this month, we launched new service from Seattle to both Milwaukee and Oklahoma City, and from Portland to St. Louis, with all of these being served with a new aircraft type, the Embraer E175. The early returns on these markets are very good. We're looking forward to new service this fall to JFK, Raleigh, Charleston, Nashville, and Costa Rica.","And finally, recognizing that the customer preference and financial success that we have today is due in part to our superior service, we're doubling down on service through a new series of workshops for our customer-facing employees. Ben is going to tell you a bit more about these in a moment. We expect that each of these changes is going to improve the experience for our customers and help us increase the preference they have for Alaska.","Moving to financials, I felt that we had good performance this quarter. Our pre-tax margin of 25.7% is 740 basis points higher than last year. This is our best quarterly performance ever, and we expect our margin performance to be near the top of the industry and to exceed the S&P 500 companies on average. Of course, a lot of the improvement is due to lower fuel prices, but we also had relatively strong revenue performance and strong cost performance. The fact that we were able to take the majority of the lower fuel prices to the bottom line is a testament to the focus and diligence of our leadership team.","Our ROIC of 22% over the last 12 months far exceeds our cost of capital and speaks to a business that has created tremendous value for its owners. And to give you a sense for how things are moving, our pre-tax income for the first six months of 2015 was $610 million, which is about equal to what we earned for all of 2013. More broadly, we expect this to be a record quarter for the industry and an indication that the industry is healthy and focused on earning returns that exceeds its cost of capital.","While fuel is low and economy is generally strong, we believe that this is still a cyclical business. Being flexible is important for producing strong results throughout the cycle. Alaska is the only U.S. airline that has net interest income and this, combined with the 80 aircraft that we own free and clear, gives us great flexibility should we see fluctuations in fuel prices or a downturn in the economy. This increased flexibility has allowed us to be profitable through the worst recession since The Great Depression and to perform strongly in the midst of unprecedented competition.","But most importantly, our people have proven themselves to be resourceful and resilient. We have said for some time now that competition should make us better. But as I see these results, talk with our customers, and see our employees out in the operation, I'm convinced that we are a better and stronger company today than we were three years ago, and our leadership team is heads down and focused on the future. Focused on executing our plan to keep Alaska strong and prosperous over the long run and creating value for our employees, our customers, our communities, and very importantly our shareholders.","The program for customer-facing employees, which I mentioned earlier, is one step in that direction and I want to turn the call over now to Ben to provide some detail on this.","Benito Minicucci - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, Operations, Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Thanks, Brad. And good morning, everyone. At Alaska, we know that a low-cost structure is fundamental to our long-term financial success. And we also believe that our success has been fueled by our rich history and culture of customer service that has been a cornerstone of our sustainability. This year, despite winning an eighth J.D. Power Award, we challenged ourselves to up our game in the area of customer service.","We created what we call the Beyond Service workshop that all 8,000 customer-facing employees and their leadership teams will attend throughout 2015. This experience conducted over one-and-a-half days is being held in a really unique venue in South Seattle that's designed to celebrate our rich history and roots of customer service DNA, educate our employees on the competitive landscape, share the essence of our brand with them, and present our service framework built on safety, caring, delivery, and presentation.","This framework is designed to engage, empower and align everyone at Air Group in an effort to create a consistent approach to service that results in exceptional customer experience. The workshop is very intimate, hands-on, and two-way dialogue facilitated primarily by frontline employees like flight attendants, customer service agents, and reservation agents. They review real-life examples on how to deliver exemplary service in various and sometimes challenging scenarios. The big takeaway learnings are empowerment, knowing when to make exceptions to policies, and enhancing the trust between management and frontline employees. This investment in our people will help us create additional separation from our competitors and confirm our place on the list of best-in-class service providers.","We believe that Beyond Service, when combined with our operational excellence, creates a compelling proposition for our customers and strengthens our brand preference.","And now, over to Andrew.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer","Thanks, Ben. And good morning, everybody. Our second quarter passenger revenue increased $57 million or 4.9% on 10.7% capacity growth. Our second quarter PRASM was down 5.3% as a result of the 13% increase in capacity in our markets. But notwithstanding this, our PRASM gap to the industry narrowed by 300 basis points to 2.1%. In fact, our June PRASM was 2.1% better than the industry despite our capacity growth of 7.2%.","As you know, we are growing. And as we grow, we are focused on diversifying our revenue streams and growing our customer base. I want to take a few moments to provide you with some details under each of these areas. I'll start off with diversifying revenue streams. First, we launched 18 new markets since the beginning of Q2 of 2014. Almost 70% of these markets are profitable within their first year of operation. And additionally, half of these markets would be profitable if fuel were $3 a gallon. We expect all new markets to continue to improve as they mature.","Secondly, we'll be relaunching 18 new markets in the second half of 2015. All of this growth is undergirded by tremendous customer loyalty, continued cost discipline, and matching the right aircraft to the right market. For example, we are very pleased to introduce new Embraer 175s to the fleet earlier this month. This will be a great airplane for us and allow us to serve long thin markets profitably. By late 2016, we'll have over 15 E175s in the network, all of which will be operated by our CPA partner, SkyWest.","Third, we introduced a new revenue stream through the preferred seating this quarter and we are very encouraged to see the highest uptake was on actual shorter stage lengths, which have the highest passenger volumes. We will continue to make revenue-enhancing adjustments to this program over time as we learn more about customer behavior and preference.","And lastly, we've been very pleased with our first class revenue performance. Upgrade sales at the gate increased 17%, and our P class or discounted first class fares helped boost our paid first class load factor by 1.6 points to 35%. In Q2, our paid first class PRASM was down only 0.5%, significantly better than our system PRASM performance.","Moving to the second theme, growing our customer base. We continue to focus on customers with our industry-leading on-time performance, improvements to our on-board product, and ever-expanding network. Our customers are rewarding our efforts with greater loyalty. Our loyalty program generated $175 million in cash for Q2. That's an increase of 13%. Our active Mileage Plan members were up 15%, and we grew our card program by 10.5%. Both programs continue to outpace our passenger growth.","Our customers increasingly book with us through alaskaair.com, which is both our lowest cost and highest engagement channel. So far this year, sales through alaskaair.com are up 3.6 points to 59.1%, and both web and mobile check-in are up five points each. When speaking of customer loyalty, partnerships are key. And yesterday, we announced a new Mileage Plan partnership with Hainan Airways. Hainan offers a premium experience and flies non-stop to Beijing and Shanghai from Seattle and nearly 70 destinations throughout China.","Alaska's network provides powerful feed to our international partners, allowing them to grow and in turn open up more options for our customers. For example, our feed just to Emirates has doubled in the last two years to 200 passengers a day, allowing Emirates to add a second frequency in Seattle. In fact, since their second frequency add, daily passengers jumped to 275 during July with a peak day of 410 connecting passengers. Hainan and Icelandair both carriers we work with as either a partner or through interline have also increased their international capacity in Seattle, ensuring that our customers have better options for their international travel needs. Creating greater customer affinity and diversifying our revenue base will help us to become successful in the long term.","Our Seattle market share for the last 12 months ended December 31, 2015, given current booking schedules of 51% is unchanged from 12 months ending December 2012. Proof that the changes we have made to our network are working well in the midst of increased competition. As we shift our focus to the back half of the year, Alaska's capacity will be up 7.9% in Q3 and 11.4% in Q4. Stage, gauge and new markets will contribute three points to the third quarter and eight points in the fourth quarter. The remainder is growth in our strong core markets to help us increase our utility. We freed up five aircrafts in the fourth quarter by reducing day of week and frequency flying in markets where supply and demand were not aligned. We'll use these assets to accelerate the launch of new markets.","As we move into Q3, we do have a few things to be mindful of. First, weighted capacity in our Hawaii and Alaska markets is expected to be up 10% and 17% respectively. Yield pressure in Q2 was most acute in these two regions and will continue into Q3. And second, while the rate of competitive capacity increase is trending down, it remains high at 12 points of growth in Q3 and eight points of growth in Q4, driven by new competitive adds to markets such as Pasco, Missoula, Kona, and Orlando.","In summary, we're growing and diversifying revenues and at the same time generating increased customer loyalty, which includes strong growth in our credit card program. We have confidence in the resilience of our business model and we expect our positive momentum to continue.","And with that, I'll turn this over to Brandon.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Hey, thanks, Andrew. And good morning, everybody. As Brad said, Air Group's adjusted net profit improved by 46% and earnings per share improved by 56%. On an adjusted pre-tax basis, we earned $370 million, nearly $120 million more than last year's second quarter. Most of the profit increase was because of more lower fuel prices. Still, revenues grew by $62 million, outpacing the $52 million increase in non-fuel costs.","We had an exceptional non-fuel cost performance this quarter with CASMex down 3.5% on the 10.5% increase in capacity. We benefited from a large credit from one of our maintenance providers that accounted for much of the decline in CASMex from our early Q2 guidance. But even without that, costs would have come down nicely. As my good friend, our COO, Ben Minicucci, likes to say, good cost performance isn't a finance thing, it's because of the great things happening out in the business. And I couldn't agree more. In that vein, I'd like to share an example with you.","In the last contract with our flight attendants, we introduced a new concept we called a productivity premium, which allows our flight attendants to earn up to $2,500 a year for exceeding their monthly line average each quarter. This new provision has played an important role in our sick time declining by about 10% year-over-year. That's a great outcome and kudos to our flight attendants and in-flight leadership for making it work. Looking forward, we expect ex-fuel costs to be up about 5.5% in the third quarter and down about 2.5% in the fourth.","Let me quickly touch on the drivers of the Q3 increase. First, we've got tough comps in the wages and benefits line because we recorded several favorable benefits adjustments last year. We also got a bit ahead of ourselves with hiring this spring, and it impacted our productivity numbers in the second quarter and it will have an impact on Q3 as well. We're working to fix that now so that we're in better shape going into the fall shoulder season. Second, we're expecting maintenance to jump to its highest level of the year. Last year's numbers also included a favorable settlement with a maintenance vendor. And finally, Q3 has the least capacity growth of any quarter this year, so we don't get as much leverage in the denominator.","We're still planning for a unit cost decline of about 0.5% for the full year, consistent with our earlier guidance, and our longstanding track record of unit cost reduction. Even though we had an outstanding second quarter, we're now expecting higher incentive pay, reflecting our great performance against safety, cost, customer, and profit targets, which is actually a good thing, continued investments in improving our on-board food and beverage product for our customers, and much higher property tax expenses in the second half of the year.","Quickly touching on fuel, our economic fuel cost per gallon was $2.12, down 34%. But more importantly, our fuel burn on an ASM per gallon basis improved by another 1.9% or 2.6% so far this year. Cash flow from operations in the first half of the year was $890 million. On-balance sheet debt is now $745 million, and even when factoring leases, our investment-grade balance sheet has no net debt. I believe we're the only carrier to have net interest income on our P&L. This creates an important cost advantage that drives more profit to the bottom line.","Trailing 12-month after-tax ROIC stands at 22%, almost 600 basis points higher than last year and more than twice our cost of capital. As a result, we're continuing to make smart investments in our business, whether it'd be in new fuel-efficient airplanes, scimitar winglets to improve fuel efficiency, or mobile devices for employees so that they can better serve customers.","We'll take delivery of 11 737-900ERs this year, 19 next year and 12 900ERs and our first MAX in 2017. The vast majority of these airplanes will replace the 27 737-400s we're retiring over the next two years. The result is that Mainline fleet will grow by 10 units this year and six units total over the next two years. These new airplanes will help us further increase our cost advantage over the higher-cost network carriers. We project full-year CapEx to be approximately $750 million, consistent with prior guidance, which would result in us generating about $500 million of free cash flow using consensus estimates.","This quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $160 million, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $262 million or the equivalent of about 3% of the total shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. We've now repurchased more than $1 billion of our stocks since 2007. That translates to about one-third of the outstanding shares. Our current $650 million authorization will be completed later this year, and we'll update you on our plans for the next share repurchase authorization once we've met with our board later this summer.","In mid-2013, Alaska initiated a dividend and has paid out $148 million in quarterly dividends in less than two years. Our stock continues to have the highest dividend yield in the airline industry. We're generating strong cash flows that are more diverse than ever. Our investment-grade balance sheet derisks the cash flows to our owners. Our costs continue to come down. We have no net debt. We're buying back a lot of stock, and we're paying a meaningful dividend. This is a high-quality industrial business. And more importantly, our people are taking great care of our customers and running a safe and reliable operation, both things they need to do for us to succeed long term. I want to thank our nearly 15,000 employees for their efforts and congratulate them once again for a record quarter.","And with that, we'll open it up to questions that you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Just would like to talk a little bit more on the comments about the new market openings and the comment where you opened 18 over the last two or three years, and you're opening 18 in the second half this year. I was just wondering if that then bodes for greater pressure in unit revenues in the second half. And also, as you think about 2016, is this taking advantage of lower fuel this year and, moving forward, some of the markets you would have opened, or should we expect kind of similar new market additions in 2016?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer","Hi, Savi. This is Andrew.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer","Just a small correction. The 18 new markets have all been started since the second quarter of 2014, and the additional 18 over the rest of this year. These are not in any way in response to current levels of fuel at all. In fact, if you look at the new markets, 45% of them are actually to destinations that have no year-round, nonstop service today. And as we've shared earlier on the call, these markets are all just expansion and diversification of our revenue streams. As it relates to unit revenue, I don't have the number off the top of my head, but what I will tell you is many of these are mid-continent and transcon longer-stage length markets that we launched.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","And then, Savi, it's Brad. I was looking at these numbers a couple of days ago. Of those 18 markets, eight of them are markets you know about. It's Charleston, Raleigh, Nashville, Costa Rica, Milwaukee, Oklahoma City. And then there's a bunch in there like Boise-Reno, L.A.-Monterey, Eugene-San Jose, there's some smaller markets in there. So it's not 18 midcon or transcon routes that are being added, just to make sure you have the correct understanding of what's going on.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on another comment about the \u2013 being mindful about the third quarter and exposure to Hawaii. And I believe it was the last guy. Could you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in those markets?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer","Yes, Savi. Just in general, if you look at \u2013 we've talked about our industry ASM, both in Hawaii and Alaska, and especially as we move into the peak summer period, we're seeing higher-than-average industry increases in ASMs in those markets. The good news, though, is we still run good load factors and given our outstanding network. I think we have a number of options, whether it's connecting passengers, management of peak flights to continue to improve the performance of these regions.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. That was helpful. Thanks.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, Savi.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julie A. Yates-Stewart - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Good morning, Julie.","Julie A. Yates-Stewart - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I know it's still early, and you're still finalizing your plans for next year, but any preliminary indication on how you're thinking about capacity and growth opportunities next year, especially if fuel remain sub $60 a barrel?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer","Hi, Julie. It's Andrew. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we took a really good look at the fourth quarter and, as I shared, we took five lines of flying out and reallocated those. While we were doing that, we were also looking at our 2016 capacity. And what I can share at this preliminary time is that where we see things today, our growth next year will be lower than our growth this year, and somewhere in the high single-digits. That's all I can share right now.","Julie A. Yates-Stewart - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. And then another question, the rest of your peers saw a pretty dramatic change in the yield environment midway through Q2, and you guys obviously have less exposure in the most affected areas and are actually performing more in line with the A4A average than you have in the past for some time. So would you say you saw any material change in the yield environment in the quarter? Or is it more status quo for you guys with the exception of Hawaii? I'm just trying to think about that in the context of directionally how PRASM year-over-year changes in the second half of the year.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer","Yeah. I think as we \u2013 if I just look back over the last six months, our yield decline have been fairly consistent, give or take a point. Same with our loads. So we haven't really seen a huge underlying change in the pattern. The only real driver for us I think is as we either launch new markets or industry capacity changes a little bit, but the fundamentals of our business, we haven't seen any really shifting.","Julie A. Yates-Stewart - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then any comment on just how we should think about PRASM change trending in the second half of the year as comps ease and competitive capacity growth slows?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer","We don't really provide any type of guidance like that. So I won't be commenting on that, but thanks for the question.","Julie A. Yates-Stewart - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, Julie.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning, guys.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning, Hunter.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Hi, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","So, Brad, did you feel like Alaska has the best opportunity in the industry, at least among airlines that you feel like you're comparable to, so likely excluding some of the ULCCs. Would you say you have the best opportunity in the industry to sustain these margins or at least a level very close to these margins over the next two years to three years in the event that the fuel prices rise, given the huge pill you guys just swallowed from competitive capacity growth that was unique to you and given the line of sight that you have on your non-fuel costs?","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Hunter, thanks for the question. I might not bite on the industry part of it. But what I would say is that we're feeling really, really good. These markets that we just launched in the Milwaukee and Oklahoma City, Portland, St. Louis, we're going to do Portland to Austin, they look like they're going to have fantastic returns. We're super excited about moving into Raleigh and Charleston and Nashville, Costa Rica, there's a lot of excitement.","When we look at things, and we're sort of following all of the concern about PRASM and all that, when we look at this, we're deploying capacity that's producing great results, great profits for our business. So we're excited about doing that. And I don't know. As I look at us against the industry, what I would say is that we do have great operational performance. We've got a very good competitive position with respect to our cost structure, which gives us the ability to offer low fares.","And you hear us talking a little bit more about service. The reason this company is still here today and independent is because we give our customers great service and we're trying to let our employees know that we know that, and we value them, and we value what they're doing for our customers. So without saying too much about the other guys, what I would say is we feel very good about the growth that Alaska's putting into the marketplace and it's great in this environment that we're sort of expanding our capital base and are expanding our revenue base and doing that in a way that's helping the owners of the business.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, Brad. Thanks. And...","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Brandon, a 5% \u2013 the cash deployment obviously is great, on many levels, on an absolute level. A 5% capital deployment yield is not that compelling with record margins and peak margins, if you want to call it that. So, I guess, can you help me understand the value proposition of continuing to buy planes with cash? I mean, I think you said you had, what, 80 of them already you own free and clear. So with interest rates at these levels, again, with the caveat that the buyback is already very robust, why aren't you borrowing more money and buying back more stock at this point?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Hi, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","That fits squarely into the what have you done for me lately category. I actually don't feel bad about where our balance sheet is. We have kind of a fortress balance sheet going right now. We're proud of the fact that we've been able to finance all our CapEx with operating cash flow and that there's still a whole bunch of money left over for us to return to our shareholders. We've always said that we would use that to manage the capital structure and we originally thought we would probably do that in 2015. But cash flow has been really strong, and so I think that we'll probably end up not doing that in 2015, but perhaps early in 2016. But that doesn't mean that we're not really focused on making sure that our capital structure sits in the right place and that we're doing the right things for our owners in terms of capital return.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","All right, Brandon. Thank you a lot.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, Hunter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.","Joseph W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Good morning.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Morning.","Joseph W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Brad, I think on the last call you talked about kind of maybe revisiting the fourth quarter capacity outlook, and sounds like Andrew did that to some extent and redeployed some of that capacity. So, I guess, why was that decision made? And what makes you feel comfortable that kind of coming in at the higher end of the guidance is the right way to do it?","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. Thanks, Joe. Yeah. So let's just talk about that a little bit more. I think what we would say is that we totally agree with the sort of the premise of your question, which is that understanding the natural demand and getting the capacity right is the best thing you can do to sort of ensure that you have profitable returns on your investment. So we went through our fourth quarter schedule, and we did day of week cuts, we did time of day cuts, and we actually produced five \u2013 we reduced our flying by five airplanes, which on a base of 140 is a lot.","And then the question is what \u2013 and that will help all of the returns and all of those, whatever, 250 city pairs or whatever it is. And then we took those five airplanes and said what's the best thing to do with them. Is the best thing to park them and sort of let them sit idle or is the best thing to deploy them in new markets where we can deploy them and produce returns that exceed our cost of capital. So, I guess, what we're saying, Joe, is we do agree with the premise of the question, and I think you're going to see some of the economic benefit come through with that, but we did redeploy the airplanes.","Having said all of that, I will also tell you that as we think about our 2016 growth, our mindset has moved a little bit in the last couple of months. As we look at everything that we're looking at, we were thinking of something a little more robust a couple of months ago and we're actually bringing that number down. We haven't actually shared that number with the Street yet, but our mindset has come down by two percentage points or three percentage points from where it would have been, let's just say 60 days ago or something like that.","Joseph W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. I guess, kind of following onto that, I mean, should we assume that if your ROIC continues to exceed your cost of capital the way it is, that you're going to exercise all of your CapEx options and that number's going to continue to go up and your capacity run-rate is going to be higher than the historical average?","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. I think \u2013 I'm not sure \u2013 I might need to think about your question a little bit more. But I do think that we are going to try to do the right thing. I think the company has been a leader in this area. We're going to do the right thing for the owners of this business. If the right thing is to take new capital and deploy it in places that we've got a tremendous economic engine here and it's sort of rooted in Seattle. If the right place is to grow Seattle and invest in Seattle, I think you will see us do that. But we will also \u2013 I don't know, as I just said in my earlier response, we do understand that getting capacity right is a big part of having the right returns on an investment and we will \u2013 I think this company has been quite good at that and I think you should expect us to continue to be focused on it.","Joseph W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then if I could just slip in a last one for Andrew. American getting to a single res system later this year, can you quantify what benefit you might realize from that based on some discussions you're having with them about new opportunities once they get that?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer","Yeah, Joe. Actually, I'm going to provide more information later on through the quarter on this. What I will tell you is, to your point, a single res system opens up significant ability for our customers to have a massively expanded network from which to accrue and redeem miles on. We continue to see double-digit growth in our relationship with sharing passengers with American. And again, as this unfolds and we get better visibility, we'll definitely share more with you on this topic.","Joseph W. DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen. Your line is open.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Thanks for the time. I have two questions \u2013 or three questions. One is, Seattle I think is one of the fastest growing cities in the country, and maybe the fastest. And as you think about all these passengers who are traveling through your airport, what type of investment should we think about that you have to make in airport infrastructure to handle the growth?","Benito Minicucci - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, Operations, Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Helane, it's Ben. It's a great question, Helane. I'm going to say about a year ago, we did see some issues processing passengers. I'll tell you what we did, at the ticket counter area, we almost doubled our size in taking more ticket counter space. So where it was very congested, now it flows fairly easily. I can tell you on the gates, we optimized how we use our gate to get quicker turns on our gates to make sure we could deal with increased capacity. We're also using gates across the whole airport, so from the south end to the north end.","And third, we're investing in technology. I think we're working on technology where customers can quickly get into the gate \u2013 get from the curb to the gate in under 60 minutes. And I think that's one thing there. And then the biggest one is an investment in our North Satellite which is about a $400 million investment that will add approximately eight gates over the next two years to four years.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","You said curb to gate in less than 60 minutes. Isn't that a long time, though?","Benito Minicucci - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, Operations, Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Well. Sorry. One of the things we were looking at was how you drop your bags. So, for example, if you show up at the curb, you can get through the ticket counter in under 60 seconds. Thank you for correcting me. (39:10)","Helane R. Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, all right. I was prepared to be scared. And then I think, Brad, you said there was a board meeting coming up this summer. Is that when we would hear you think about reauthorizing or increasing the share repurchase program? I mean, we think you only have about $120 million left, based on your information today. So why wouldn't you have increased it?","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","That would be a good time for us to talk with the board about a question like that. In the board meetings in early August, 3rd, 4th, 5th of August, something like that.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. All right. Well, thanks. Those were all my questions.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, Helane.","Benito Minicucci - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, Operations, Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Thanks, Helane.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, team. Sort of continuing on that last point, I don't want to take anything away from your second quarter. You were absolutely correct to point out the strength in margins, the degree to which ROIC exceeded that of last year, best quarter in the your history, and so forth. No argument. No pushback on any of that.","But what is lacking in the release today is how these results might be impacting your behavior going forward. I mean, ordinarily, I also would have expected perhaps an upward revision to your ROIC target or maybe another added layer to the buyback or a boosted dividend. And I don't want to read too much into this, but why the conservatism in light of such strong results? Is it merely that you just haven't met with the board yet? Or are you keeping your powder deliberately dry for something else? And, of course, that will lead us to speculate on what that might be.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Jamie, it's Brandon. Maybe I'll take that and Brad can clean up the mess that I make. I don't think you should read anything into our lack of a big bang of any sort. We're really proud of our second quarter results. We think we're doing the right thing for the business not just in the short-term and the long term. And you know Alaska, we have sort of a methodical way of doing things. We think about longer term, things like the longer-term track record of dividend increases that we want to show you years from now. We think about the timing of board meetings for authorization of share repurchase program. But I don't think you should necessarily read anything into the fact that we had a great quarter, but we didn't take some big bold action. I think those things will come with time and we'll continue our track record of doing the right things for our customers and our owners and our shareholders.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","And Jamie, just to put a little bit of punch on that. I think in time you will see a new \u2013 and I shouldn't speak for the board, but you know our history with share repurchases, and I think it would be totally appropriate to assume that that continues. We do want to increase the dividend regularly. I think you should expect to see that occur. And we have been talking about this ROIC goal, and what \u2013 we've been talking about that a little bit in the last few days, I think as we sort of put the finishing touches on our 2016 plan, that might be a time for us to come out with some new thinking on that. But I'll tell you that we sort of do \u2013 we have done a lot of looking not just at airlines but at high-quality industrial companies. And we're sort of getting ourselves schooled up on what are they generally earning in terms of returns \u2013 in terms of what's the gap in terms of ROICs above their cost of capital and getting ourselves smarter about that. And I think you'll see something from us there as well.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","It's a high-grade analysis to be conducting, I'm sure. Okay. Thanks very much for that color. That was excellent. I appreciate it.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Hey. Thanks.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Hi, Duane.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Good morning, Duane.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Just following up to Helane's question a little bit on Seattle and the capacity utilization of that airport today. As it relates to Alaska and also competitors that are trying to grow there, can you talk about how much excess capacity there is in that airport at sort of peak times of the day?","Benito Minicucci - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, Operations, Alaska Airlines, Inc.","No \u2013 Duane, it's Ben. Peak times of the day, there is no capacity. I can tell you that. There are capacity in the shoulders and as we talked to the port here, long term in the next two years to five years, six years when these capital projects get built for bigger gates, there are going to be constraints even at the peak time of day. So peak time of days this airport is full, unless you do some other type of thing. But I would say that that's the quick answer. We're full at the peak, there's some capacity in the shoulders.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Thanks for that. And then, Brandon, just a quick one for you. How do you expect us to believe your cost guidance for the third quarter?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Duane, I expect you to believe our cost guidance because that's what we've put in our investor update, and we try our best to forecast our costs for the quarter and for the year. And what I will tell you is things come earlier sometimes than we expect, and things come later sometimes than we expect. And our costs \u2013 we adjust our cost guidance through the quarter. And as you saw this quarter, our actual cost result was right in the range of our last investor update.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks very much.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, Duane.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Thanks, Duane.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Your line is open.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Hi, Darryl.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Brandon, I was going to ask you about the CASM guidance for the third quarter as well. I think Duane kind of took care of it. But, I mean, just thinking about how the guidance has changed for the full year relative to the guidance that you provided us with Q1 results back in April, I heard the list of items that you kind of rattled off. It seem to me that maybe the maintenance credit was perhaps the only one that you wouldn't have seen coming. So just wondering with the level of \u2013 with the magnitude of the beat and the Q2 cost trajectory, why wouldn't the full year move?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Darryl, it's Brandon. Thanks for the questions. Just to give you a little bit of context, there was a big maintenance credit in the quarter and that was worth about 2% of the 3.5% reduction in unit costs and then just good cost performance in the last month and just normal closing stuff was about the other 1.5% of that. Our actual cost result was at the low end of the range that we provided. So we were within the range.","You're right. In my prepared remarks, I did try to give context to the Q3 increase in cost. And what I will say is there's things that \u2013 as I said to Duane, there are things that result and just timing things landing in one quarter or another, and in this quarter we've got things that make a really hard comp and so we're up 5.5%.","Notwithstanding that, we still think that we're down 0.5% for the year. Your question might be how come we're not leveraging more of that cost savings in Q2 into the back half. It's an excellent question. We would like to do more. We're super focused on cost reductions, but there are some things like incentive pay that is higher than we expect, property taxes that were much higher than we expected, and continued investments into the on-board product that's going to eat up some of that goodness that we saw in the second quarter.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then I also just want to ask you quickly on the fuel efficiency of the fleet. I think you said it's up 2.6%, 2.6% better over the course of the last two quarters. I think you were kind of 2.5% better on average in 2014 compared to 2013 as well. Should we essentially assume that you're on kind of a 200 basis points, 250 basis points a year sort of improvement trajectory until you're done retiring all the classics?","Mark G. Eliasen - Treasurer & Vice President-Finance","Hey, Daryl. It's Mark Eliasen. I'll just say that we're focused on fuel efficiency in all aspects of our business. We do think that getting the classics out of there, as you know we have 27 of them, they burn the same amount of fuel as a 900ER, yet carry 25% fewer passengers. So as we get those 27 out of the fleet over the next year-and-a half, that will improve our fuel efficiency. I can't give you the exact number as far as how many bps that will improve it. But that, along with many other things we're doing, you should see our fuel efficiency continue to rise.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Right.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. We could run those numbers, but there's a bunch of retirements. What is it, Mark? 27 737-400 retirements in 2016 and 2017?","Mark G. Eliasen - Treasurer & Vice President-Finance","Yeah. In the next year-and-a-half.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","It should pop pretty substantially when that occurs.","Mark G. Eliasen - Treasurer & Vice President-Finance","Yeah. And our winglet program, we're putting winglets \u2013 the split winglets on our NG fleet, so that will help as well. And then, of course, when we get the MAX in 2017, that's going to be another improvement. So we see continued fuel efficiency improvements throughout as long as we can see.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah.","Mark G. Eliasen - Treasurer & Vice President-Finance","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Fintzen from Barclays. Your line is open.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone. First question really for Andrew. If my memory serves, going back to the Investor Day, you had started to talk about kind of filling out the Seattle markets that you hadn't touched historically. Obviously, you've been doing that this year. Can you just help us think through 2016? I mean, are you largely through that process, or are there sort of another wave of markets that you think could keep you busy in Seattle and maybe then into Portland for a while?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer","Yeah. Good morning. I think while we don't talk about future markets, I have shared in my prepared remarks, we've got the Embraer 175 coming on-board, which \u2013 this aircraft actually allows us to unlock cities that we really can't fly on the Q4s and the mainline jets profitably. So I think you're going to continue to see us continue to work those types of markets.","And as such as new markets, I didn't get a chance to mention but like, as Brad mentioned on competition, just looking at the second quarter, about 8.5% of our capacity was driven by first-class ASM. But our revenues contribution by that was over 14%. And so we continue to look at our cabins and our classes of service. And I still believe there's big opportunity to continue to invest in our product in the first class and increase that.","But overall, in the Pacific Northwest, as we continue to manage our costs, as we continue to look at our network and grow our network and grow our connections as well as our international connections, we continue to see opportunity to grow in the Pacific Northwest.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And just to sort of mix a little bit of what you said in terms of improve the product with some of the cost comments, I mean, should we think of that product improvement as sort of when we get a sustained beat in a quarter, not to get too carried away with it over \u2013 for some period? Because it will just accelerate some of those investments in on-board product? I mean, is that the way we should translate that comment into cost going forward?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer","No. I don't think so. I think when you look at, like Brandon shared, around like for instance, food and beverage. But as traditional here, when we launch new products, we have a lot of process, boarded to consumed ratios of foods. We have a lot of opportunity, even though we're adding cost to our aircraft through investments on on-board products to actually continue to get more efficient and productivity. And I think Ben's become \u2013 and his team have become just amazing folks of getting capacity out of our core operations. And so, as we invest in our product, we're going to get better about getting efficiency and productivity out of that as well. So, personally, I think you shouldn't expect to see that continued cost increase overall.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Hey, David, it's Brandon. One other thought there. We talk a lot about the drivers of the cost increases and we get into things like food and beverage. A lot of our on-board product is buy-on-board and we're seeing nice growth in buy-on-board sales. The customers really \u2013 there is a good uptake of that product and that's pretty small in the context of the revenue line, but it is an offset to the cost that we talk about down below.","David Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate all that color. Thanks.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Salazaar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, it's Mike Linenberg. If I could just jump in, in front of Rich, if that's okay. Good morning, everyone.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Hey, Mike.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Good morning.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Two questions here. Andrew, if I could just go back to what you had mentioned earlier about the connection with Emirates. You said that previously it was 200 passengers a day between you and them, and that with the second flight that that had moved to 270 passengers. How much of that is stimulative or is that just all shift \u2013 share shift?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer","I don't know the exact answer to that question. But what I'll tell you is that and you even take out Hainan, for instance, where the marketing machine has been set on idle and has done nothing, we're already seeing significant increases in connecting traffic there. And we haven't even begun to market this new relationship. So I can't speak to where it's coming, where it's going as far as stimulation or share shift. All I know is that there is good demand for these connections and we're going to continue to grow.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And when you mentioned the marketing machine on idle, that's because, as I recall correctly, I don't think you have a codeshare with Emirates. Is that right, or do you have one?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer","So I think with the Hainan, but even as we think about our international partners and we talk about how we can market better together in the marketplace, we just \u2013 we have not done a good job at leveraging our international carriers and working together to become more of a joint force in the marketplace, and you're going to see more of that. And I think there's going to be good things in store.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Just to be clear, you don't have a codeshare with them, with Emirates, that's right?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer","Correct.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just secondly, on some of these new markets out of Los Angeles, like Costa Rica, I think Baltimore is another one. Correct me if I'm wrong on that, but they have lower yield. Are these markets going to receive the support of American marketing from day one? Or are you going to have the American codeshare on them or is that a longer-term opportunity?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer","You know what, I can't really comment on future code and no code. But I think what a fair statement of facts are is that both American and Alaska are very excited about our partnership. We are working together where we can, and Los Angeles is a natural partnership ground for us there. And I think as we launch any new market, we think about our customer base, our alliances and partnerships and how can we work together.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And so they're already being marketed though, right? You've already loaded the flights to Costa Rica and Baltimore?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer","Correct.","Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay, great. Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Bradley D.

McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the time here. A couple questions. Where is the analysis leading you on a more expanded preferred seating product? So call it five or six rows with more legroom versus what's offered today. How are you balancing the pros and cons of that investment with what your codeshare partners are already doing?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer","Dan, as Brad alluded in his prepared remarks, we're finding some very interesting results just with our preferred seating and the behaviors. And as we've mentioned before, we continue to look at our on-board product in maximizing revenue for each shift that we fly and looking at the loyalty program. So all I can say is that we continue to look at how this plays out for us. And we don't have anything to report other than that.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Very good. And, I guess, just following up on Mike's question, there's obviously a lot of moving pieces with respect to revenue from codeshare partners. But where are we today exactly? So what is the total revenue from codeshare partners, and does that reflect a decline or an increase from a year ago? And how do we think about that revenue \u2013 that piece of the revenue puzzle looking ahead?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer","I mean, I think \u2013 I mean, if you just look at Q2, really big picture including interline, codes, partners, everybody, I think it's about 15% comes from those other carriers. And as we've shared previously income buckets, Delta is down over 40% in the second quarter, but we also have good increases on our own metal and our partner's metal. So it's shifting around. But overall, it's still fairly stable as the big picture pie goes, as it relates to connectivity.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Good job, Andrew. If I can just squeeze one final one here. Bill Gates had a nice interview this quarter on biofuels. And if you believe him, probably will be a huge payday some day. You guys are one of the first to stick your toes in the water here years ago. And I realize the investment is tiny and notwithstanding where oil is today, is this something you guys are still pursuing? And if so, when could the investment realistically drive some kind of a return?","Joseph A. Sprague - Vice President-Marketing, Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Hey, Dan. This is Joe Sprague. Biofuels is absolutely something we're still interested in. In fact, we're hoping to do yet another demonstration flight later this year with a new type of biofuels. As you pointed out, we were the first airline in the country to fly a series of biofuels flights when we did so a couple of years ago. Notwithstanding the lower fuel prices today, we do believe that this is an important part of our fuel supply going forward, both for fuel efficiency, fuel cost reasons, but also just for really positive environmental reasons.","And, in fact, that the airline industry is going to have some sort of standard that they're going to have to adhere to coming down from ICAO in the years ahead, and we think biofuels is going to have to be a part of that solution. So our intent is to absolutely continue to be a leader in this area. A challenge is the lack of production facilities for biofuels, and that's starting to be addressed a little bit around the country. But we're tracking that very closely and working with our good partners at Boeing and elsewhere to make certain that we are in a position that we can optimize that when more fuel supply comes online.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Very good. Thanks, guys.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Revenue Officer","Thanks, Dan.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you.","Lavanya Sareen - Managing Director-Investor Relations","We have time for one more question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Hi, Rajeev.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Hi, Rajeev.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just a question on the cost side. I get there is a fair amount of moving parts this year, but can you just talk going forward maybe what some of the biggest risks are for you in terms of continuing to keep CASMex at sort of a flat to down level?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Rajeev, good morning. It's Brandon. Thinking into the future, we said a couple of times tonight or this morning that our bias is to continue to work toward driving costs down to make us look more like a low cost carrier and expand the gap that we have over the legacy carriers.","In terms of risk, you never know. One thing we do have is nice visibility to our labor costs over the next few years. I think we've talked about the increase in fuel or the increase in our fuel competitiveness, but as we think about fuel CASM coming down. Other than that, it's all about investments that we have and we choose to make. Who knows what's going to happen to pension. That's always one that seems to come out and bite us somehow. But I don't know. It's a good question. I don't have anything specific to offer in terms of risks, because I think we do have pretty good visibility over the next couple of years.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great.

My name is Thea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group's Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at alaskaair.com [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Director of Investor Relations, Emily Halverson.","Emily Halverson","Thank you, Thea. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2019 earnings call. I started to get to know many of you. But for those who I haven't yet met, I've been with Alaska for four years in the accounting world, and I'm looking forward to working with each of you in my new role.","In today's prepared remarks, you'll hear updates from our leaders Brad Tilden, Andrew Harrison, Brandon Pederson and Ben Minicucci. Several other members of our management team are also on hand to answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call.","This afternoon, Alaska Air Group reported third quarter GAAP net income of $322 million. Excluding merger related costs and mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments Air Group reported adjusted net income of $326 million and adjusted earnings per share of $2.63, ahead of first call consensus. These results compare to adjusted net income of $237 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.91 in the third quarter of 2018.","Our third quarter adjusted pre-tax margin expanded 360 basis points to 17.6%. As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements on our expected future performance, which may differ materially from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. And as usual, we've provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings really filed today.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Brad for his opening remarks.","Brad Tilden","Thanks very much, Emily, and good afternoon, everybody. Before I get into this quarter's results, I want to take just a moment to acknowledge the recent incident at one of our Co-Chair partners in the state of Alaska, PenAir.","One of their Saab 2000 aircraft overran the runway in Dutch Harbor one week ago today, and this tragically resulted in one passenger fatality and one guest being in critical condition for one day. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the guests who are on board, to their families and loved ones, and to our partners at PenAir. This is a somber reminder to me and to the rest of our leadership team of the grave responsibility that we shoulder and of continued need for us to underscore the importance of safety with our people and our partners at every opportunity and to backup this understanding with our actions every day.","Now moving to our third quarter results. I want to congratulate the fantastic folks at Alaska, Horizon and McGee for delivering the industry's best customer service and operational performance, which together drove our strong results. Our revenue was up 8% for the quarter on 3.4% more capacity. And Horizon had a terrific quarter as they grew capacity by 24%, while reducing non-fuel cost by 1.5 points, as they absorb all 30 of their new E175 aircrafts that have been delivered over the past three years.","The team at Horizon led by Gary Beck has increased productivity for the fifth quarter in a row, and has met our goal for guest satisfaction in all but one month this year. Additionally, our commercial team has been working very hard and they produced industry-leading unit revenue growth of 4.5% on solid demand as evidenced by our highest quarterly load factor in the last five years. It is fantastic work like this that expanded our pre-tax margin by 360 basis points to 17.6% our best results in two years.","If we look at our results on an absolute basis, our adjusted net income for the last 12 month was $709 million, and that's up nearly 30% from the prior 12 months. We converted that net income to $1.6 billion of operating cash flow. And with our effort in the last couple of years to adjust capital spending, our free cash flow was very strong at $695 million. In other words, we're converting 98% of our net income to free cash flow.","Our company is producing good earnings and converting those earnings into solid free cash flow. We view free cash flow conversion as one of the critical measures of how we drive value for our shareholders. While it won't be the case in the next couple of years, in the last two years, we've been using our free cash flow to pay down acquisition debt and also to return cash to shareholders through our dividend and share purchases.","On debt reduction, by year-end we will have repaid $1.5 billion or 75% of the $2 billion we borrowed to buy Virgin America. And at 42%, we are quickly approaching our long term adjusted debt to cap goal of 40%. Strengthening our fortress balance sheet positions us to be flexible and opportunistic, and to make the best strategic and capital allocation decisions in the future.","We carried a record number of guests this past summer. Our team's full focus has returned to running a great airline, and it is showing. I'd like to share two recent achievements. First, our people were once again recognized as the best U.S. airline by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler in its Annual Readers' Choice Awards. This is the second year in a row that we won this award, and we're continuing an 11-year run that Virgin America had before us. We can't thank our boys enough for their skill and dedication in serving our guests.","And second, three important labor deals, which represent over 6,000 of our people were ratified this quarter. We're proud to get these deals done for our folks. And Ben will tell you more about them in just a moment. If you've done the math on our recent guidance, you've likely estimated that our 2019 margins will be somewhere around 11% to 12%, up from just below 9% last year. We're encouraged by our progress, but we do not believe we're at the destination.","On the subject of ROIC, we expect to end 2019 in the range of 12% to 13%, which is up significantly from 9.4% last year. As we look beyond 2019, we're developing plans that will put us into our stated pre-tax margin range of 13% to 15% over the business cycle.","Andrew and Brandon will now share more detail about the quarter, and then Ben will round it out with some discussion on our five year strategic plan. The plan addresses our products and loyalty strategy, our revenue initiatives, our cost structure, our network structure, a vision for our fleet and more. We're challenging ourselves to create specific blueprints so that we can deliver in critical areas and thereby honor our commitments to all of the people who are depending on us. We're excited about the plan and we look forward to sharing components of it with you in the quarters ahead.","With that, I'll turn this over to Andrew.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. My comments this afternoon will focus on third quarter revenue performance, progress on guest pricing initiatives and revenue guidance for the fourth quarter. Our 4.5% improvement in unit revenues is 260 basis points better than the industry, and highlights the effectiveness of our revenue initiatives and the work we are doing to harness merger synergies. Our third quarter result was our best absolute RASM in the past three years, and as Brad mentioned, our load factor was the highest we've seen in five years.","Demand was healthy across our network during the quarter. This was demonstrated by 1 point improvement in load factor and 3.5 percentage point improvement in yield. Hawaii, which has been experiencing elevated industry capacity and soft pricing performed well. Notwithstanding the fact that industry capacity and our own capacity were both up nearly 7% we still produced a modest unit revenue increase.","We've continued the strong momentum that we started in Q2 in our transcon markets out of California and New York. Earlier this year, these regions were under a lot of yield pressure. Teams across the organization came together to diagnose the problems, develop a plan and execute the plan. Through cross fleeting, the addition of satellite Wi-Fi, dialing in the schedule and cash structure and a committed focus to improving the guest experience, we achieved meaningful RASM and margin improvement. Our value proposition hinges on offering low fares, while providing award winning service, generous rewards and premium product, and our people are delivering on this.","Our revenue improvement is a direct result of our initiatives and synergies. At Investor Day, we shared a roadmap we view laid out our intention to deliver $330 million in incremental 2019 revenues. Unlike in the first and second quarter, our initiatives delivered their full annual run rate this quarter. Three quarters into the year, we are confident that we'll deliver on the $330 million. I'm going to share more on go-forward initiatives and synergies in a moment.","We also continue to see double-digit percentage growth in our loyalty revenues, which as a reminder, comprise award redemptions and credit card commissions. A large driver of this result was the 8% increase in redemption revenue on our metal, evidence of our generous availability for award travel.","We continue to see growth in both mileage plan members and credit card holders, and are particularly encouraged to see that nearly one-third of our year-to-date growth in credit card holders are guests living in California. Nearly half of all of our guests are members of our loyalty program, which has consistently been recognized as the best in the industry, another bright spot with the improvement in the styles of our premium cabin products.","First Class revenue was up 16% on 10.5% more seats. Premium Class revenue was up 13% on 12% more seats. Our network has shifted over the years to where nearly 50% of our capacity is at trip length of five hours or longer. This drive strong demand for our premium products, and we're very pleased with these results. As we build out our Airbus interiors to add more premium seating, we expect premium revenue growth will continue to outpace system wide revenue increases.","Besides premium seating, we've made significant investments over the past few years in our product, while building our hubs and focus cities on the West Coast. These improvements include satellite Wi-Fi, new interiors on Airbus aircraft and investment in our lounges. This quarter, we expanded our lounge capacity nearly 60% when we opened our 15,000 square foot lounge in SeaTac's North terminal. Guest satisfaction scores at the new lounge are 15 points higher than the system average and day pass sales have doubled.","We've also seen record breaking trends in lounge membership growth. In the first month after opening, new member enrollments were quadruple our program average. We're applying our learnings from the North Satellite lounge to our new San Francisco lounge set to open in early 2020. And as you know, our lounge members are mostly elite and high frequency travelers. So these facilities are very important to us.","Before I move to guidance, I'd like to highlight that we made network adjustments that we announced during the third quarter, which are aimed at creating more desirable connections for our guests between our hubs and focus cities in California and our focus cities in the Northwest. These include flights from California to Spokane, Redmond Missoula, Boise and Anchorage.","As we grow capacity at a lower rate than we have historically, our focus is on careful reallocation of capacity given the seasonality in our network, as well as growing market share and our strategically important markets on the West Coast. Initial signs are encouraging as we are already seeing positive results in demand and margin generation from these types of changes.","Looking to Q4. Our capacity will grow moderately at approximately 4%. Our Q4 RASM guidance range is up 1% to 4% on much harder comps from Q4 of 2018. This guidance reflects our optimism in our revenue initiatives, as well as the continuation of demand and pricing trends we are currently seeing","Many of you ask regularly about how we're doing on revenue synergies, which we laid out at our Investor Day in November of 2018. As we shared with you at that time, our total expected merger synergies were $300 million, $240 million of which are revenue synergies. We realized $65 million of these through 2018. And as mentioned earlier, we're on pace to realize the full $130 million that we expect this year. All of that cost synergies have effectively been realized to-date, leaving $105 million of revenue synergies that we still need to achieve. Approximately $60 million of this is slated for 2020 and $45 million in 2021.","So we'd like to sort of tie off these historical synergies and commitments, and establish for the record that our remaining commitments heading into 2020 is for $60 million in revenue synergies and the annualization of our 2019 revenue initiatives, which will be approximately $65 million. So in total, that's $125 million in 2020 or about 1.5 of RASM. We will be adding our 2020 revenue initiatives to this commitment and we'll share these with you on our call in January. Continued delivery of revenue growth is my team's top priority, and we're optimistic about what we can bring in 2020.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks, Andrew, and good afternoon, everybody. We're pleased to report 38% improvement in both adjusted net income and earnings per share, as well as our third consecutive quarter of margin improvement. As others have highlighted, our 17.6% pretax margin reflects that 360 basis point expansion year-over-year, and was a direct result of the initiatives we laid out at Investor Day last year.","With our Q3 results and our Q4 guidance issued today, we're on pace to have a full-year pre-tax margin of between 11% and 12%, which would be up 200 basis points to 300 basis points from last year and meaningful progress on our path to 13% to 15% margins. Since Andrew touched on the revenues, I'll focus on the cost performance for Q3 and the outlook for the remainder of the year.","Our unit costs increased 3.4% on a similar increase in capacity and the result was about 150 basis points better than our initial guidance in July. It bears mentioning that the quarter included $24 million in signing bonuses associated with the ratification of new deals with Alaska's AMFA and IAM represented employees. Without the signing bonus, our CASM would have been up less than 2%.","We saw excellent cost performance for most of our operating divisions, although some cost did shift out to Q4 and even a little bit into Q1 of next year. Pilot cross-training is an example. We've talked many times about our dual-pronged strategy to manage costs, those being high productivity and low overhead. Productivity was strong during the quarter, Aggregate Air Group productivity which we measure using which we measure using guests per FTE came in better than planned, and improved nearly 2 points from prior year.","Year-to-date, productivity for our airports team and our guests contact team deserves special mention as both have exceeded productivity targets for both plan and prior year -- and over prior year. On the overhead side, there's another good story here too, overhead is tracking nearly 3% or $16 million under prior year for the first nine months of 2019.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect CASMex to be up slightly on just less than 4% increase in capacity. This would be the best quarterly unit cost performance, since the fourth quarter of 2016. We're benefiting from higher growth, offset by some of the timing shifts we've been talking about over the last couple of quarters and higher rate wage rates, following ratification of the new contracts.","The modest increase in Q4 cost will bring the full year result to 2.2% CASM, ex-growth on a -- excuse me, 2.1% capacity growth. Normally, we would celebrate unit cost declines, not increases. But given the step change increase in labor costs we've had this year, and the very low growth relative to our recent history, we're pleased with the results and it demonstrates what we can achieve with a back to basics approach, to cost execution, with a sharp focus on productivity and operating our business with a low overhead mindset. As you've heard, our teams are working diligently on our 2020 plan, including our cost plan. We recognize that low costs widen the competitive moat we have versus higher cost legacy carriers, and are critical for us to eventually return to the higher growth levels that we've historically enjoyed.","While we don't plan to share guidance with you today, I can share some higher level context for the cost challenges, and opportunities, we face in 2020. First, notable headwinds include, first, a higher number of scheduled engine and airframe events in 2020. Second, we'll begin to see the cost impact of Airbus lease returns. Although, we only have one return scheduled for 2020, we have nine return scheduled for 2021 and we began accruing for these lease return costs 12-months in advance, and third increased airport costs.","Offsetting those headwinds however, we see the following opportunities. First, higher ASM growth over which to spread our fixed costs, we'll grow between 3% to 4% next year with that growth nearly all coming from lower unit cost mainline growth as Horizon has now taken all of their E175s deliveries. Second, further productivity gains.","Third continued simplification of our overhead structure, including changes that will allow us to be more agile and more quick with our decision-making. And fourth annualization of many of the benefits of our supplier cost reduction initiatives, which generated more than $35 million in savings in 2019. Our planning mindset is one of aggressive cost management and progress toward our 13% to 15% pretax margin goal, and I look forward to sharing more detail with you on our year-end call in January.","Turning to the balance sheet; we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. Total cash flow from operations for the first nine months of the year was nearly $1.5 billion, excluding merger related costs and the pension contribution, while net CapEx was $525 million. This resulted in approximately $950 million of free cash flow, which marked a nearly $460 million improvement upon last year's results.","At full-year consensus, free cash flow yield is almost 11%. Free cash flow conversion over the first nine months of the year was exceptional, but we're benefiting from very low cash taxes combined with a low capex year. Our number one capital allocation priority for the year has been deleveraging our balance sheet. As Brad said, we closed the quarter with a debt to cap ratio of 42% and a trailing 12 month net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1. By year-end, debt to cap will be at 41% and as you've already heard, we'll have paid off 75% of the merger related debt.","Our treasury team has done a phenomenal job this year not only working to re-deleverage the balance sheet, but has also taken advantage of the historically low interest rates to refinance and or restructure our debt to low fixed rates. At the end of the third quarter, our weighted average interest rate is at 3.2% with over 75% of our portfolio now fixed at historically low interest rates.","Rounding out our fortress balance sheet, our 104 unencumbered mainline an E175 aircraft and $400 million of undrawn lines of credit. Our strong performance this year has also allowed us to make some positive changes to our capital allocation plan for the year. First, we elected to make a voluntary pension contribution of $65 million to our defined benefit pension plans, which are about 80% funded in the aggregate. And second, we increased our planned full year share repurchase from $50 million to $75 million, given our strong cash flow.","During the quarter, we bought back $28 million of our shares including $10 million over a two-day period at a volume weighted average price of around $58 per share. With the dividend, which we have increased six-times since we initiated it in 2013, we expect to return $248 million to our shareholders this year, or more than 25% of our free cash flow.","Coming back to our five-year plan, our fortress balance sheet positions us to substantially increase returns to our owners and or place an aircraft order that would fund growth, and allow us to retire smaller, less efficient aircraft which would improve both our ability to generate additional revenue and lower unit costs. As we finish up our long-term fleet steady, we're also developing an order strategy that allows us to best leverage our market position and structure delivery timing that preserves our ability to generate free cash flow. And now I'll turn the call over to Ben.","Ben Minicucci","Thanks Brian, and good afternoon everyone. As the financial results highlight, it has been a productive summer here at Alaska. With the bulk of the work of the integration largely behind us, we are focused on realizing synergies and initiatives and improving our cost profile. A large part of that is providing visibility into our future labor costs.","And as Brad mentioned there were three new labor deals ratified during the quarter; one with our aircraft technicians, another customer service agents and reservation agents and clerical workers and a third with our ramp, cargo and stores agents. We are thrilled to have these labor agreements in place to recognize who we believe to be the best employees in the industry, while also securing long-term contracts that provide line of sight for the company over the next several years.","In the case of our aircraft technicians, they have now begun cross-training on both fleet types, which we expect to be completed by the first quarter of 2020, further enhancing productivity and operational reliability. In addition to our industry-leading financial results, our frontline teams are delivering outstanding operational reliability, and award winning service to our guests.","As you know, we track these metrics religiously internally, but just as importantly, it is validated by external sources too. To add to the recent recognition by Cond\u00e9 Nast as the best US airline, Alaska was also just recognized as America's Best Customer Service and Airlines by Newsweek, Best Airline Rewards Program by U.S. News & World Report, the top rated airline and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and ranked by Forbes Magazine as one of the top 100 Best Companies to Work For in the world.","These awards are significant, not only because we'd love to see our people recognized, but because they highlight that staying focused on our core competitive advantages resonates with guests and really does make a difference to the bottom line, even while executing a complex merger. We are creating a future that continues to build on these core principles, which drive preference for our product and operational reliability. They include low fares, and low costs, best-in-class customer service, the industry's most generous mileage plan, a fuel-efficient fleet, a well loved brand and a fortress balance sheet.","As we've navigated the integration over the past three years, we've admittedly put certain longer-term strategic planning efforts on pause. We believe it was the right thing to do to ensure we completed the integration on an aggressive timeline that exceeded expectations and allowed for a singular focus on returning to the well oiled machine that Alaska is known to be.","This past summer, our senior leadership team has been focused on building out our five-year strategic plan that addresses where we want to take our network, our fleet, brand, loyalty program and financial performance. While we aren't yet ready to share the specifics I'm pleased with how the plan is taking shape. There is still work to do, as we refine the strategy that has helped shape our past success while we develop new strategies to build an even stronger Alaska for the future, centered around sustainable growth, our people and a strong business model. We have a lot of work left to do. But the improvements, we've seen this year and the momentum we are building with our network, our product, our people and our financial results give us a ton of confidence in the future success of our company. And with that, we'll open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Catherine O'Brien","Maybe one for Andrew first. So, you called out the $125 million in Alaska specific revenue initiatives you've got next year, does that include any future initiatives? I'm pretty sure it has the annualization of this year and then continuation of some of the merger revenue synergies. Think you guys have a new M&A system coming online next year, should that drive any initial -- any incremental benefit or is that a right contemplating the number. Thank you.","Andrew Harrison","Yes, that's right Katie. What I shared was the carryover synergies and initiatives from 2019 is going to be about 1.5 points unit revenue. In January on our call, we will share with you the incremental revenues we expect from our initiatives for 2020. So, we'll do that in three months time.","Catherine O'Brien","And then maybe two quick ones on costs, so great cost performance again in the third quarter, guessing that we should assume that since you maintain the full-year cost outlook was that mostly timing or something else going on there? And then maybe just on the lease returns next year, are there any maintenance reserves that you're going to put those against here on the cash side? Thanks a lot.","Brandon Pedersen","Hi Katie, it's Brandon. Maybe, I'll take those. On the cost, we were really pleased with our third quarter cost performance as well, you're right. We maintained the full-year cost or the cost number at the same level. So we did see some of those costs that we've been talking about shifting out of Q2 and Q3 into Q4. That explains the vast majority of it. ASMs are down slightly. Yes, that's basically it.","On the second question maintenance reserves, yes, that's a really complicated area. Of course, there will be offsets associated with how we treat the maintenance reserves as we settle all these lease return obligations up, but that's factored into -- we'll factor that into the guidance.","Operator","The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Can you just remind us, maybe what the gating factors are on getting more aggressive on the buyback, if it's to completely repay all the debt you borrowed or to hit that leverage target, which you seem quite close to now?","Brandon Pedersen","I tried to cover it a little bit in the prepared remarks you know we are awfully close to our leverage target. We're going to end the year at 41%, our goal was 40% that wasn't an exact goal. I think we're going to cross into the sub 40% territory early to sort of mid-ish next year. I don't think, we've necessarily decided if we're going to pay off all of the Virgin America debt, although we simply could. The point really that we're trying to convey is that our balance sheet is rock solid, and it gives us some optionality whether it's increased returns to shareholders and or position us to do something with the fleet that doesn't impact the balance sheet too negatively.","Duane Pfennigwerth","And then, I think you have covered it as well. But, it's been a long day already admittedly, so I apologize. Just on the headwinds and tailwinds for costs and where those net out. I don't know if you're in a position to give guidance yet on 2020 CASM.","Brandon Pedersen","No, we're not. I mean, we're going through the planning process now, and what I can say is, is that we've got a lot of cost momentum going into 2020. But our people are working their budgets really hard right now.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Okay, thank you very much.","Brandon Pedersen","Duane, I might jump onto the sort of capital allocation question. I think everybody knows here, we strategically we felt like the industry is changing, we needed to get bigger. We bought Virgin America, borrowed $2 billion in the last 2.5 years, have paid $1.5 billion to that off and the one thing we know is it in 2020 and 2021 that we won't -- we might pay down a little bit more debt, but I think mentally we're sort of crossing a threshold year that we're done dealing with the Virgin America debt and we're going to be looking forward, looking at new capital allocation opportunities for the company.","Operator","The next question is from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Savi Syth","Andrew, you talked a little bit about some of the network changes that you've made kind of focusing on some of the shorter haul business markets. But, it is looking and it seems like it is shorter haul and you're kind of moving away from the transcon. Could you talk about what you're seeing on the transcon and why you need -- that the transcon might be funding some of those shorter haul growth?","Andrew Harrison","I'm not quite sure on the transcon, we've actually increased that flying especially out of Pacific Northwest with the seasonality. Really, if you look at the network moves, you're seeing a number of what I'd call Mid Continent flights out of California that quite frankly have a very seasonally pull in the fourth quarter and certainly the first quarter. And so, what we've been doing with aircraft is instead of doing that, we've been flying those aircraft up into our core Pacific Northwest, and connecting directly with some of our larger focus cities, and then we've also increased our capacity out of the Pacific Northwest during the winter quarters to take advantage of the seasonality there.","Overall, as I've mentioned in our notes, our transcon network from California is significantly improved and it's doing good things. And so, we continue to commit to that, but those are most of the changes it's just really some of the short-haul is going up -- the Pacific Northwest instead of Mid Continent.","Savi Syth","And then you mentioned Hawaii did well in the third quarter. I know there were some easy comps. Just, as we kind of look forward, any thoughts there since that was kind of one of the bigger areas and just a follow on to that, last time we talked about Alaska as well and is that -- I think that was supposed to be just like a summer -- a seasonal pressure, but just want to clarify that, that was still the case.","Andrew Harrison","Yes, on the Hawaii, you're right, there was some bad weather and volcanoes and all sorts of other things that were happening last year, but I think what we're seeing is still very solid demand, great load factors and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our airplanes are really configured well, especially for Hawaii with that premium class cabin, the first class cabin which has great demand on Hawaii flights and just the service we provide.","We're really made for these longer-haul flights and so, we feel really good about that. Of course, with Hawaii, if there's more capacity comes in, that puts yields under pressure, but we feel very well prepared for that. On the Alaska story, you're right. In the summer, we have a lot of people who like to fly to Alaska. Some folks are flying wide-bodies longer distances, but we cater to very much demand on the West Coast and we do a good job connecting it. So, I don't see that to be a huge issue as we move into 2020.","Operator","The next question is from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","Starting on a housekeeping item, the fuel efficiency, that's implied by the fourth quarter guide shows more deterioration year-on-year than what we've seen earlier in the year. Also the sequential decline is a bit more than customary, I recognize there's probably some wiggle room in there around completion factor. But, is that just a modest shift to shorter stage lengths, because that's been going on for a while, so I'm just -- I'm surprised that it's more pronounced in the fourth quarter.","Brandon Pedersen","Are you looking at ASMs per gallon or what's your metric that you're looking at?","Jamie Baker","Yes, ASMs per gallon.","Brandon Pedersen","The only thing -- I don't have that at my fingertips, but the only thing I'm guessing is that on a year-over-year basis, it reflects the increase in regional flying as a percentage, given the fact that Horizon took so many E175s late last year, and then into this year and I'm guessing that's probably the contributing factor.","Jamie Baker","And second and this sort of follows on Duane's line of questioning, you talked about some of the headwinds and tailwinds, puts and takes on ex-fuel CASM for next year. I'd forgotten about lease return accruals for example, so thank you for that. But, I'm wondering if you could expand that narrative from costs to pre-tax margin? Synergies are obviously going to be a tailwind, you've talked about that, but how are you thinking about the other dynamics as it relates to pre-tax margin, next year? Fuel -- the industry impact of the MAX coming back, more Southwest service to Hawaii, what are the three or four items in the tailwind and the headwind buckets?","Shane Tackett","Jamie, its Shane. Good afternoon, this is an excellent question. I don't think I'm going to sort of delve into anything that gets close to guidance. But as we -- I'd just remind you that we laid out a roadmap to get to 13% to 15%, 18 month ago at Investor Day, I think as Andrew noted, we've got a bunch of commitment to you all that we need to deliver on, on the revenue side to sort of complete what we had talked about there, and we intend to do that next year -- and we intend to add to that amount ultimately ultimately and that's what Andrew alluded to in the script in terms of new initiatives that we'd like to talk to you guys about in the first quarter.","On the cost side, I think at Investor Day, Brandon mentioned or I did, we always say its 4% to 5% sort of just core cost pressure, internally within the company. We're growing 3% to 4%. So, we're trying to find ways to continue to manage ourselves to a number that's more in line with our historical norm of flattish on the cost side, but our goal would be to see margins ultimately continue to expand. But, we haven't done all that planning yet and to your point that the industry dynamic is changing. So, we obviously will be talking to you all, more in the coming months about next year.","Operator","The next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","So here's my one question, you are supposed to have some MAX this year. I think you're thinking all 10 of them are going to come next year, and I know they're not in the schedule, et cetera. But are you -- given those issues are you thinking about the Airbus aircraft on a more serious basis? I mean obviously, you are not because you're doing lease returns, but are you thinking about more Airbus aircraft unless Boeing aircraft or are you still kind of focused on the 73s?","Brandon Pedersen","I want to re-introduce to you and introduce to the rest of the folks on the call, Nat Pieper. Nat's our Senior Vice President of Fleet, Finance and Alliances that sounds like a perfect opportunity for him to share his views on that.","Helane Becker","Thanks Nat.","Nathaniel Pieper","Just a quick reminder, we of course have Airbus aircraft as well, 319s, 320s and A321 neos. It's all really part of the fleet initiatives that we've been working for some time. It's a core component of our three to five-year strategy and in the 15% margin targets. We're looking at near-term opportunities to retire inefficient aircraft, as well as longer term looking for the best aircraft for our future network.","We're confident in the margin accretion possibilities, there's going to be up gauge involved, new aircraft obviously feature a step function improvement in airframe and engine technology. So we're working closely talking to manufacturers, and really hoping to bring something out here in the next handful of months. We're going to order in a financially prudent way, obviously and manage our CapEx and cash flow and end up with an airplane that we know our guests and our Alaska team mates are going to really want to fly.","Helane Becker","I just had one follow-up question. I don't remember who talked about airport costs, but I've heard other of your peer group complain about airport costs to, but when to -- and actually Spirit, this morning they commented that airport costs should be a pass-through. So, wouldn't you -- as you think about those airport costs wouldn't you think about raising fares in those markets so that you recover some of that cost?","Brad Tilden","I might jump in Helane. The first thing -- one of the fun things about these jobs is you get to see your own people move up and sort of move around, you see new people coming to the organization. Nat is a tremendous addition to the team. I've known Nat for -- I don't know, how long, Nat? 15 years or 20 years now and it's just delightful to have you here. I think you're making an excellent point on airport cost. Other airlines may have different perspectives, but the truth is not only airports, but a whole lot of our infrastructure needs a lot of investment and SETAC Airport as an example, our home it needs a lot of investment and we have to -- we want them to invest efficiently, we want them to build the right projects, but we've got to be their partner in there. The investments need to be made, and I think they are investments that any of us would make, if it was our home or a car or whatever. So, yes and of course we do want to find a way to recover those investments through modest increases in fares that help us sort of keep the whole value proposition together. But, I don't think SETAC's that unique. I sort of think airports all across the country need investment, and that's sort of the season we're entering. We've been in it to some extent, but I think the next 10-years 15-years we're going to be seeing this in a lot of airports.","Operator","The next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","So you talked a lot about the 8% growth in redemption Shane, can you talk to me about your current assumptions on breakage, which I think are around 17% that seems high, how do you feel about that number right now and sort of the modern loyalty era. And all else equal, forget the P&L for a second, would you rather see that 17% breakage go down or go up?","Chris Berry","Well, this is Chris. Hi, how are you.","Hunter Keay","Okay. I already know your answer.","Chris Berry","So you know what -- Shane answered it too, but the 17%, yes, we do actually look at that on a semi-annual basis, really to say is that still falling in line with our expectations and the reality is it, we would change it, if it were materially different from that. In terms of whether we would want that higher or lower I can tell you, my answer from an accounting standpoint but it's not probably the answer from a business standpoint, so I'll let Shane if he wants to take that or Shane or Andrew.","Andrew Harrison","I'll just take that. I think, Hunter I get the accounting side and all our estimate. But, I think, at the end of the day we want the breakage to go down. If the breakage goes down, that means people are using our program and we saw a lot of volume come through this quarter. So, we want to grow it, and make it stronger and healthier. So, that's just my take on it because I think breakage goes down strength and loyalty go up.","Hunter Keay","So if that were to change, you would prefer to actually force that down whether it's a change to the policy of miles or how people use them -- giving them more opportunities to use and things like that. And in that case, you would probably have to lower your breakage assumption, but obviously for a net long-term benefit. Is that fair?","Andrew Harrison","Yes.","Hunter Keay","And then, Brandon can you elaborate on this aircraft order strategy? What's going on with that? What do you mean by that? Is that like smoothing of capex, is that fleet types, like what do you -- what are you talking about?","Brandon Pedersen","It's all of the above. It's just doing it in a way that makes sense, both for the needs of the fleet long term, not just today and in a way that preserves our ability to generate free cash flow and do this in a way that allows us to do other things from a capital allocation standpoint too.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Michael Linenberg","I guess two here and I guess for Andrew. What's going on with the American relationship, it does look like maybe there is a potential. I don't know if there is a phase out as we look into 2020 or maybe the code share goes away. Can you just -- can you update us on that?","Andrew Harrison","The reality is that after the acquisition of Virgin America that's when the fundamentals of our relationship with American actually changed. The Department of Justice said, we couldn't do certain things around code and everything else, and just given the size and overlap at the time, there was a lot of adjustments made, a couple of years ago and most of that -- all of that economics is through our system today. So really what you saw is, we still have a partnership with American just -- it's still a good partner, we're working together on our mutual interests.","We still have a lounge program with them, we're still connecting guests through their Chicago hub and they are connecting folks here. But, we've really shrunk it and the footprint is smaller. I think at the highest level, which is I think a testament to Alaska Airlines a couple of years ago 15% of all of our traffic was code and into interline basically dependent. Today it's only 7%. I think that's just a testament to our ability to have grown, to cover most of the destinations where folks go, and then of course use partners where we can mutually benefit and work together.","Michael Linenberg","And I want to make sure that you said that you're still going to continue to connect through Chicago, is that interline or is that code share because like, if I look at schedules today, I still see the Alaska code on say Denver LA, or Austin LA where it's the American metal. Does that code go away, is that going away this spring, or is that...","Andrew Harrison","Yes. Going forward, it all winds down essentially from the Pacific Northwest. You can connect through to Chicago to about 20 destinations, and then on American you can connect through our hubs to about 20 destinations. So the code share will really basically be very, very small.","Michael Linenberg","And then just one other question. When I think about competitive capacity in your markets, as we look into, not just this quarter and also March quarter March quarter 2020, because there has been -- you alluded to this on the call earlier, there has been a lot of network adjustment and in many cases, you know to fund -- as you mentioned the growth into the Pacific Northwest from say LA and San Fran, in some cases you pulled down a whole bunch of capacity, in some markets where there was a decent amount of competition. So, I'm curious about what that number looks like, if you have that at your fingertips for both the December quarter and March quarter 2020 what the competitive capacity is?","Andrew Harrison","Yes, competitive capacity in the fourth quarter is only up about 1.6%. The first quarter is higher than that. It's showing about 4% right now. But of course, I think the first quarter is scheduled to still influx and I'm not sure what's going to happen with schedules with the MAX and everything like that. But, I think to your point, moving around some of this capacity has in some ways reduced some of the overlap, but net-net, we're still putting roughly the same amount of seats in California. At the end of the day, we're just pointing the airplane to different places.","Operator","The next question is from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi","Brad, two questions for you. I think for the last two years, you've been the only CEO in the industry, who's incentive compensation is driven in part by the airline's growth in credit cards. Can you talk a little bit about what change in terms of how you spend your time, how you manage the business before that was a metric versus after? And then, what was the motivation of the Board in making that a metric for your comp? Thank you.","Brad Tilden","Honestly, we went to the board with that idea, following our acquisition of Virgin America, and we just realized that you didn't -- we just really believe in the all idea of building loyalty, building preference, getting people into the club and we've seen the power of that in the rest of our network, and as we bought Virgin America and moved into California it was -- I mean, it's interesting you talk about me and it's certainly true. But, what we really wanted was that in the compensation base of 23,000 people, and that's what happened. So, I think it was 10% credit card loyalty and 10% mileage plan. 10% and 10%, that's how I think also, 10% credit card and then 10% mileage plan.","We just wanted the fantastic army of people at Alaska Air Group really focused on growing customers growing their loyalty, and so that is -- is that, that's what it was all about. I think the leadership team went to the board and proposed it, and the Board said, absolutely it sounds like something that will drive long-term value.","Brandon Pedersen","And Joe, this is Brandon. Just as a reminder, we have a gain sharing plan that is consistent across all of our employees, not just the leadership, but across the front line as well. So, it really gets down to alignment.","Joseph DeNardi","And then Brad I try and ask you this question every now and then, I'll ask it again. Just given your experience to-date with the Virgin transaction and turning that deal into value for shareholders, how successful do you think you've been and kind of in the context of your balance sheet, nearing a point where you'd be in a position to do something. Does M&A look more or less appealing now than it did before the Virgin deal? Thank you.","Brad Tilden","Yes, thanks for giving us a chance to talk about this. We, at that time -- if you go back to when we considered this it was when we announced it was April, 2016. I think we felt like, we had an amazing economic engine, a great brand. We're really proud of our culture in the way people take care of customers, we felt really positive about the long-term prospects for the industry. But, we did feel like industry conditions were such that we just needed more real estate, and we wanted to have strength beyond Alaska, Seattle and Portland. So that was the idea behind the Virgin merger.","It as you guys know, you go through life, you learn stuff. When you do stuff, you learn stuff and it was -- it was a lot of work. But, I think everyone here is feeling optimistic, we're feeling good that we're getting through it, and I think we really feel that we have materially enhanced sort of the cash producing sort of capability of this economic engine. We've enhanced career of security for our people in doing that. As you mentioned, I'm extraordinarily proud that we borrowed $2 billion to do it.","You guys know, our people did it with no investment banks with no, nothing like that, they just went to the banks and borrowed $2 billion on their own and we're going to pay three quarters of it off, in three months' time, so we're really proud of the team. As we look at doing more, you know I just think, my own view of the world is it's a combination of organic growth and M&A.","We've done amazing with organic growth. I'll just tell you -- and different people around this table may feel differently. But, as I look at the next few years, I sort of see the biggest opportunity us growing organically, pushing -- taking what we are proud of what we feel like we do well, and pushing it organically into markets where we're already strong.","Operator","The next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski","I want to come back to the puts and takes on the cost discussion because I actually did hear the headwinds, but maybe could you elaborate again on where you see the tailwinds on cost looking in 2020. And again, I'm not looking to get guidance from you.","Brad Tilden","On the tailwind side, there's actually a number of those as well. First of all, we're going to be able to grow a little more next year than we've grown this year that will help. We're going to continue to work productivity, you might remember that we focus on two different things for cost control; productivity and overhead. Productivity is a huge lever going into next year. We have continued simplification of our overhead structure that's the other prong. And then, our team just did a great job on a lot of different initiatives. The supplier cost reduction campaign was one of them, and I think all of those initiatives that we worked hard to get this year's cost down will continue to bear fruit, as we go into next year as well.","Brandon Oglenski","And it seems like the Airbus restyling how far along are you in the fleet there?","Brad Tilden","Yes, in terms of the number of airplanes that we've reconfigured -- we'll have...","Ben Minicucci","We'll have -- so 60% of the fleet will be reconfigured by the end of the year, Brandon. This is Ben. So we have roughly 73 airplanes, we'll have 42 to 44 done by the end of the year.","Brandon Oglenski","So if anything, we would see the benefits from that even more so in 2020. Is that correct?","Ben Minicucci","Correct.","Brandon Oglenski","And then, I mean maybe this is just way too premature, but you guys obviously are delivering pretty decent results this year. I mean, does that make you go back to the drawing board on long-term growth because I think Brad in the past you said, if we can get into that targeted margin range, then we would think about expanding the network at a faster pace. Is that still the framework?","Brandon Pedersen","No, we're very comfortable of 4% to 6% growth. We used to talk about 4% to 8%, 8% is pretty big on a company our size now, so 4% to 6% is a pretty good clip. And if we can grow 4% to 6% per year for over four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 years, that's a lot of growth. And we want to make sure that we can do it in a prudent way that keeps our balance sheet intact, where we can achieve our margin goals, it all needs to fit together, but we're really optimistic about our ability to grow 4% to 6% and we feel like that's the right growth rate for the time being.","Operator","The final question is from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Dan Mckenzie","Just following up on that last question, it's really sort of house cleaning the 60% of the A320s that were reconfigured with the new seats, what percent of the flying does that equate to? Brandon Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc. Well, we have to have 53 A320s and on a fleet of 235 mainline airplanes.","Ben Minicucci","Dan, just a lot of the benefit from those actually comes on the revenue side, just to be frank. We're taking the first class cabin from 8 to 12, and we're going to have adding premium seats. And I think, it's anywhere from one to three extra seats per aircraft. So, it's actually more of a revenue boost than a cost one.","Shane Tackett","And so the big thing is we're moving the airplanes primarily North-South, here we're doing a lot of East West flying. Most of the airplanes as of January will be -- its north-south line, which will be more helpful, putting the Boeings and A320 Alliance transcon.","Dan Mckenzie","Going back to the prepared remarks about realizing the $330 million in incremental revenues that were targeted. What inning are we in with respect to saver fares? And I guess, how are you benchmarking to the industry at this point and I guess I'm just thinking the industry as a whole, seems to be finding more upside in this particular bucket. I'm just wondering what you guys can share.","Shane Tackett","We got these out really in full force full force in Q1 of this year. They've performed well, they performed above what we had committed to and talked about, and I don't think we've shared -- updated sort of take rate numbers or economics, but they've performed quite well. Our guess, just based on what we hear other people talk about is, we're on par, if not maybe a little better on the buyout of saver and that's really what we want. We want as few people as want to be on the actual ticket. We like the fact that people buy out more than we had originally sort of estimated.","In terms the -- and I think, we've got a full quarter next year to annualize, it was only sort of partially in Q1 of this year, and then we've not really done anything to try to optimize it anymore. So, there is the potential that, after we have used it for a year, we just get smarter about how we're managing it and it's sort of a tool in the toolkit. So, there's probably more value to be had, we're not quantifying that today. I don't know if we will when we get here in January either, but it's still more upside from saver for a little while.","Dan Mckenzie","And if I could just squeeze one last one in intra-California earlier this year, I think was a headwind to revenue production, or maybe it was partially last year that's changed. I think, you highlighted in the prepared remarks it's doing well. And I'm just wondering, is this in any that's gone from being a RASM drag to a RASM tailwind at this point or how are you thinking about this piece of the network puzzle?","Andrew Harrison","Dan, my prepared remarks were more around transcon, and we don't like to get into the details of specific regions. But what I will tell you is that this flying has also benefited from all the initiatives that we've shared with you and rolled out. And so we are seeing improved profitability across our network and including in intra-California as a result of our changes.","Brad Tilden","Thanks Dan. Thanks everybody for tuning in. We'll talk with you again at the -- for our full year report out in January. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call.

My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Investor Relations, Chris Berry.","Chris Berry","Thanks, Jonathan, and good morning, everybody. Thank you so much for joining us for Alaska Air Group's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Call.","Today, our CEO, Brad Tilden; and our CFO, Brandon Pedersen, will share their thoughts on our third quarter financial results, our operations and our outlook for the remainder of this year. Several members of our senior management team are also here to help answer your questions.","Our discussion today will include forward-looking statements regarding future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings available on our website.","We will refer often to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings or unit costs, excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a third quarter GAAP profit of $163.4 million. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio, Air Group reported a record adjusted net income of $150.3 million or $2.09 per share. This result is basically in line with the First Call consensus and exceeds last year's adjusted net income of $131.1 million or $1.79 per share.","Additional information about our unit cost expectations, capacity plans, future fuel hedge positions, capital expenditures and other items can be found in our Investor Update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brad.","Bradley D. Tilden","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris said, Alaska Air Group reported an adjusted net profit of $150.3 million this quarter versus $131.1 million last year. Our revenues increased 6.2% to nearly $1.3 billion on the strength of our low fares and the preference for our product. This is the highest quarterly profit in our history and is the 14th consecutive quarterly profit that we've reported.","Our people are working together better than ever. And to the employees listening today, I want to thank you and your colleagues for everything you did to make these results possible.","Our pretax profit margin was 19.2% this quarter versus 17.7% last year. We believe this margin leads the domestic industry. Seasonally, this is our strongest quarter. Our pretax margin for the last 12 months is 11.5%.","On a year-to-date basis, we produced $289 million of adjusted net income, and for the last 12 months that figure is $327 million. These strong earnings are driving our return on invested capital, which is 12.7% for the last 12 months and they're also enabling us to improve our balance sheet, reward our shareholders and reinvest in our business.","You've probably seen that on September 26, we announced a $250 million share buyback program. The size is roughly 10% of our current market cap and it's significantly larger than anything we have done before. The program comes on the heels of 6 programs since 2007, 5 of which have been fully executed and which together have amounted to $312 million of share repurchases and a net reduction in shares outstanding of 13%. Given what many of you have said about our valuation, we think share repurchases have been and will continue to be an excellent use of capital that will materially benefit our long-term investors.","We also just announced an order for 50 Boeing 737s, including the new 737 MAX. The new order provides for mainline fleet replacement over the next 10 years. With options, we'll have the ability to flex up if economic conditions warrant and if we are achieving our ROIC objectives. Over the last several years, we've seen the material advantage that comes from having modern, fuel-efficient aircraft that are bought at the right prices, and we're extremely pleased that we secured airplanes to continue this pattern well into the future.","The reason we're able to make commitments like the share buyback and the aircraft order is because of our earnings and our strong balance sheet. Looking at the changes in our balance sheet since 2004, which might be viewed as the peak of the post 9\/11 industry crisis, our equity has increased from $665 million to $1.4 billion. Our debt and lease obligations have declined from $2.3 billion to $1.7 billion. And we've moved from 78% of our capital structure being represented by debt to 54% today. In those same 8 years, our revenues have increased from $2.7 billion to over $4.5 billion, and we've added 93 737-800s and Q400s to our fleet, 36 of which are owned free and clear.","Turning to our growth. We have several new markets starting in the fourth quarter, including San Diego-Orlando, Bellingham-Maui, Portland-Kauai and Anchorage-Kona. Our growth over the past few years has been successful and has been accretive to earnings. We believe that we can continue to modestly grow our network in a way that is consistent with our return goals and in a way that gives our customers even more choice when flying Alaska.","On the labor front, we recently signed a 6-year agreement with our Alaska ramp service and stores agents. And I'll note that at that point, 6 years was the longest term for a labor deal that we've ever had. This follows agreements reached in the past couple of years with Alaska technicians and Horizon pilots. Each of these contracts provides for pay raises, productivity improvements and continued alignment around financial goals through our incentive plan.","And just yesterday, Horizon reached a tentative agreement to extend our deal with our pilots, again to 6 years. This deal is mutually beneficial to both the company and our pilots, and both sides worked hard to craft an agreement that should be funded through productivity gains. Voting will commence in November and will conclude by mid-December.","Elsewhere our teams are working hard for equitable, long-term agreements with flight attendants at both Alaska and Horizon, and we also recently started early discussions with our pilots at Alaska. I'm optimistic that we can reach deals that follow our guiding principles and that provide long-term assurance for everyone involved.","I can tell you that everyone of us here is focused on running an excellent business that is sustainable and that provides good results for all of its stakeholders over the long run. I don't need to remind any of you that this is the airline industry, and this sort of long-term success and balanced, consistent execution has evaded most airlines. But we believe we have a solid plan and employees who know what is at stake and who are committed to our success.","One of the things we spent a lot of energy on over the past 12 months is a program we call Flight Path that is attended, in small groups, by everyone of our 13,000 employees. In these full-day sessions, the rest of the leadership team and I listen to our employees and talk with them about the industry, the threats, our plan and what we need to do together to keep our company thriving. The response from our people has been good, and I believe we have a strongly aligned team that is ready to take advantage of the opportunities and deal with the challenges that come our way.","I want to end with a thank you to all of the employees at Alaska and Horizon for a record summer performance. They were able to handle more customers than ever before and still managed to run 2 of the most on-time airlines in the country with very high customer satisfaction ratings. And when they weren't at work, our folks were involved in 67 community events, demonstrating our commitment to local areas across our route network. My hat is off to all of them for their incredibly hard work and their -- and for their contribution to the success of this company.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Thanks, Brad, and hello, everyone. Air Group's third quarter adjusted net profit increased by nearly 15%, up from $131 million last year to a record $150 million this year. This represents an after-tax 12.7% return on invested capital for the last 12 months, which was up from 12% at September 30 last year. This will almost certainly mark the third year in a row that we have exceeded our 10% after-tax ROIC goal. With the cost of capital estimated to be between 7% and 8%, the investments we're making to the business are creating significant value for our owners. As recently as 2009, our ROIC was just 6%.","The improvement that we've seen over the last 3 years is not by accident. Our track record of financial performance can be attributed to matching capacity with demand while expanding our network, offering low fares, reducing costs by controlling overhead and improving productivity, having industry-leading operational performance, flying single fleets of fuel-efficient aircraft at both airlines and because our people are working together to deliver an engaging travel experience that keeps our customers coming back. Because of these and other factors, we have improved profit and we've reduced the amount of capital invested in the business.","On a pretax basis, our adjusted profit grew by nearly $33 million to $244 million. The improvement was driven by a $74 million increase in operating revenues and a $14 million improvement in nonoperating expenses. These gains were partially offset by a $33 million increase in adjusted nonfuel operating costs and a $22 million increase in economic fuel costs. Pretax margin expanded by 150 basis points to 19.2%, the second quarter in a row of margin improvement.","We know that others in our industry focus on operating margin, but we believe looking at pretax margin is important because it fully considers the effect of aircraft financing decisions and the amount of leverage in a business. For example, net nonoperating expenses were only $4 million this quarter compared to $17 million in the third quarter of 2009 with much of that improvement coming from lower interest expense because we have much less debt now than we did 3 years ago.","Passenger revenues were higher on a 6.8% increase in capacity with flat unit revenues. Mainline PRASM was up 1.2%, which compares favorably to the A4A domestic average of 0.3% for the quarter. Our industry comps are even more favorable when adjusting for our 4% increase in stage length. As we move into the fourth quarter and for the first half of next year, PRASM will again be affected by longer stage lengths.","We would once again characterize the demand environment as stable. Both leisure and business traffic seem to be holding up despite continuing concerns at the macro level. As we look to the fourth quarter, advanced booked load factors are up about 2.5 points for October, 1 point for November and December is currently down 0.5 point.","Turning to costs. Our adjusted nonfuel operating expenses increased by 5.3% on the 6.8% increase in capacity. This resulted in a 1.5% decline in our consolidated nonfuel CASM, which was consistent with our latest guidance and represents the best unit cost performance we have reported this year.","There are a few notable changes in the P&L that I'd like to mention. First, we saw a 12% increase in maintenance costs, largely due to a high number of engine removals at Horizon. Second, contracted services increased by 9% because of handling costs at the new cities we fly to. Third, food and beverage costs increased by 15% because of the growth of buy-onboard sales as well as investments we're making to improve the cabin experience. And finally, variable incentive pay is up because we're exceeding our PBP plan goals more than we were at this time last year.","Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect consolidated unit costs to decline about 2.5% on a 7.5% increase in capacity, bringing full-year CASM x fuel to between $0.0845 and $0.085, which will represent a 1% decline. Full-year mainline costs are expected to be down slightly as well, to $0.0755 to $0.076.","On the fuel side, economic fuel costs were up 6.5%, basically in line with the 6.3% increase in consumption. Although the economic price per gallon was the same in the third quarter this year and last, the month of September tells a very different story, where the economic price per gallon was higher than the quarterly average by nearly $0.20 at $3.43 a gallon and in line with prices we are seeing today.","Most investors are aware of our simple, proven hedging program designed to protect our balance sheet from spikes in crude oil. We really view it like it is an insurance policy. You might recall that late last year, we began purchasing 10% out of the money options as a means to reduce our premium cost and self-insure a bit more, given the strength of our balance sheet. More recently, we started buying options that are up to 20% out of the money, depending on forward crude prices. We'll see the benefit of this dynamic approach in the form of lower premiums in 2 to 3 years as those hedges mature. There's is a table on our Investor Update that provides current hedge protection levels.","Looking to next year, we're in the middle of the 2013 budget season, and our divisional leaders are working diligently to build budgets that leverage capacity growth and to further unit cost reductions. The higher gauge 900ERs that will begin to enter our fleet next month and customer-facing initiatives, such as self-serve bag-tagging at the kiosks, and our new booking functionality offered on our mobile site, will help us keep costs in check.","We are, however, facing significant cost pressures in several areas. First, because of the decline in the discount rates, pension expense will increase, perhaps up to $15 million based on what we were seeing today. Medical costs continue to grow, and we're planning to increase IT spend again this year to fund required infrastructure projects and innovation activities, such as the mobile and self-service investments that I just mentioned. Finally, there is some uncertainty with airport costs, principally at Sea-Tac, as we come up on the expiration of our lease there. Although we're not ready to give preliminary 2013 cost guidance just yet, let me assure you that even with these cost pressures, we are mindful of the need to make our costs more competitive and maintain our track record of unit cost reductions.","Turning to capacity. We expect consolidated capacity to grow about 7% to 8% in 2013. The Alaska fleet will grow by a net of 7 aircraft over the next 15 months as we take delivery of 13 737-900ERs starting next month and retire 6 aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2013.","An advantage we have, that the majority of our airplanes are owned versus leased, giving us a great deal of flexibility to adjust our fleet growth. An example of this flexibility is our recent decision to dispose of 3 additional 737-700 aircraft next year, bringing our planned retirements to the 6 aircraft I just mentioned compared to 3 originally planned.","Moving to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. During the first 9 months of this year, we've generated $635 million of operating cash flow compared to $609 million last year. Capital spending was $340 million, resulting in roughly $295 million of free cash flow. We have paid off $240 million of long-term debt, including $102 million of debt prepayments, improving our debt-to-cap ratio to 54% and taking net balance sheet debt to 0, in fact slightly net cash. We've also purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of our common stock for $52 million so far this year.","Brad mentioned our recent Boeing deal. With this order, our planned capital expenditures for 2012 increased $30 million to $500 million because of the initial predelivery deposits. Firm CapEx in 2013 increased by only $40 million and is now expected to be $420 million, and firm CapEx in 2014 increased by $135 million to $370 million. We have options that, if exercised, would increase those amounts, but we'd only do so if we felt confident we could meet our return objectives.","Our treasury team, which also handles fleet transactions, has been very busy lately, and I want to thank them all. Besides the new repurchase program, the Boeing order and debt prepayments, they recently completed the extension of one of our 2 credit lines out to August, 2015, with lower fees.","We're pleased that the hard work of the last decade is paying off in many ways, including solid financial returns that are exceeding the cost of capital, strong cash flows and material balance sheet improvement. We're often asked why improvements in returns, cash flow and our balance sheet are not better reflected in our multiples. Of course, we don't know the answer to that question. But what I can say is that we're very focused on running the business in a way that benefits our long-term owners by sustaining a level of performance that meets our return goals.","And now, I'll turn the call back over to Brad to kick off the Q&A.","Bradley D. Tilden","Thanks, Brandon. And operator, at this time, we're ready for questions from analysts.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Trahan.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So I have to ask you about the fuel hedging, I apologize. I asked a similar question to UAL about an hour ago. And I'm only asking because your guys did $3.46 a gallon in the fourth quarter. And Brandon, I appreciate the color and the movement of volume or out-of-the-money hedges. But I mean, the results that you guys have produced over the last couple of years have been unbelievable, and your balance sheet is pristine. You have unencumbered assets. If there is one airline, again, maybe outside of Southwest, that probably has an excuse not to hedge fuel, it is you. And I look at U.S. Airways paying less for fuel than anybody in something like 4 of the last 8 quarters. At what point do you look at that and you say, \"You know what, this is not a fluke. This is a real thing.\" And even if there is a crisis in policy and framing it in the context of you describing the hedge book as insurance, even if there is a crisis, we have the balance sheet and we have the assets to withstand it no matter what happens. So I guess let me ask you a question, at what point did you..","Bradley D. Tilden","Is there a question there or a statement?","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Yes. Well, let me ask you a question, the classic self-side rhetoric. When does U.S. Airways no-hedge policy stop being a fluke?","Brandon S. Pedersen","When oil prices run up.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","I mean, I hear you, but oil prices just did go up in September, and they paid less for fuel than anybody in the quarter.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Hunter, it's Brandon. I get the question, and I'm going to let Mark Eliasen, our Treasurer, answer it. What I will say is that we have a strategy that we really believe in. It's a long-term strategy. In terms of comparison to other airlines, you do get into apples-to-oranges comparisons because of where people put taxes and into plane fees. But I think what you're really getting at is, does the strategy makes sense? And Mark, maybe you have some comments on that.","Mark Eliasen","Yes. This is Mark Eliasen. I appreciate what you're saying and you make a lot of good points. We're always evaluating our program, as you well know, and we may do some things to change. But for now, our program, it serves us very well. Again, I respect what you're saying. But we really don't know where fuel prices are going, and we're not going to try to figure it out. And our program does protect us against spikes.","Bradley D. Tilden","Hunter knows this, but for others -- I mean, you've gone from basically hedging at the money, combining at the money call-outs just a couple of years ago to 20% out of the money is the practice.","Brandon S. Pedersen","That's right.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Yes, I appreciate the progress, no doubt about it. I think it's trending in the right direction. There's even an argument to be made that if you just actually sold the entire hedge book right now, how much that is actually worth, like Southwest had an opportunity to do back in '08. That's another question. But I guess let me ask you another question relating to bag fees. How do you guys quantify the lower bag fee structure that you have relative to peers? How do you measure the fact that your customers are booking away from other airlines and onto Alaska? How do you know that they remembered that they paid $5 to $8 less per bag a week after they took the trip? How do you measure that?","Joseph A. Sprague","Hunter, this is Joe Sprague from Marketing. So it's a good question and definitely something that we pay a lot of attention to. We actually are doing more customers research right now, I think, than we probably ever done in our history, and customer perceptions and behavior around bag fees is definitely something we look at within that research. So that's partly how we know. And I guess just to elaborate a little further on that. I mean, our bag fees on a per-passenger basis are down this year. I think we're seeing sort of an ongoing change in customer behavior, just generally, when it comes to checking bags. But we do feel good about where our bag fees are today. It's not to say we would not ever consider making some adjustments. But right now, there's a lot to be said for the simplicity, where we have each of the first 3 bags set at $20. And we do talk about that with customers. We make sure that they're aware that that's what the fees are and that there is that simplicity. We still have the industry's only baggage service guarantees. So we promote the fact that customers are getting something of direct value in exchange for their bag fees. And it's interesting that the new DOT customer or passenger protection regulations that came out with respect to bag fees, we're not sure that they're accomplishing exactly what they were intended. But it has brought a lot of visibility to bag fees, that consumers are probably paying more attention to the actual fees maybe than they have in the past. We believe that customers are looking at this. And in our case, we have a lot of leisure travelers, as you know, a lot of families traveling with small kids and whatnot. And in those cases -- I mean, just a basic example. A family of 4 traveling together, what they would pay for checking 2 bags each with Alaska Airlines versus any of the other bag -- airlines charging bag fees could be $80 to $100 or more per family traveling. And we think that they do realize that, and that's a meaningful number for them.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Yes. If they check 3 bags, they'd pay more on Southwest than they would on Alaska, by the way. Shame on anyone for checking 3 bags.","Bradley D. Tilden","Hunter, this is Brad. I might just want to acknowledge that this is a good question. I think Joe outlined our current thinking. There's a -- we think the customers notice, and we -- as you look at J.D. Power results and all that, we do think fees do affect their preference for airlines. The flip side is we get that we -- and I think Alaska has been a leader in sort of this notion to provide the appropriate returns to investors. We get that it's an important source of revenue that's helped the industry. So I think we've articulated our thinking about this today. But I -- we acknowledge it's a good question, and I guess it's something that you wrestle with every quarter and you think about all the time. Anyway, just wanted to acknowledge that it's a good question for us to think about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just have 2 questions. My first on some of the competitive capacity. I was going to ask you how your Bellingham-Maui is booking up and then knowing that there's another competitor starting service in that market? And then I was also wondering how Bellingham to Honolulu is doing since you have another competitor starting up in that market? And then that's the -- those are sort of maybe potential negative markets. Then in some of the positives are some of the capacity cutbacks that we're seeing from competition in your markets. If you can just talk about that?","Andrew Harrison","Michael, this is Andrew. Just on the Bellingham -- and I might touch on Hawaii, in general, because I'm pretty sure I'm going to get the question. But the Bellingham-Maui is sort of seasonal, and it's booking up within our expectations and the same with the Honolulu. Competitive-wise, you're right. I think many of the airlines have been very disciplined, especially as we move into the first quarter of 2013. People are getting more surgical with discipline, which has been great. One of the things -- I think Mark Dunkerley did an excellent job a little bit describing the environment of Hawaii this summer and the seat capacity, and he shared that the Bay Area was up 25% and Southern California were up 15%. Both Alaska and Hawaiian added seats to those markets. We added over 100% capacity to the Bay Area. San Jose-Oakland to be all 4 markets. People talk about the fiscal cliff. I learned the hard way about the Hawaii-California cliff in September. But jokes aside, we're learning and we're adjusting. And what I can assure you is, is that going forward, as we learn Hawaii better, we will be making adjustments and refinements. Overall, capacity to Hawaii will continue to grow at about 40% next quarter, in the fourth quarter. But what I will say is that we've essentially seen all the capacity come back from Aloha and ATA. We've talked internally about pushing the envelope for Hawaii by still maintaining a good, strong business. I think we're at the corner of the envelope, looking down at the stamp right now, but -- that's to say we will do a little bit more. But I think you'll see the growth subside and us get smarter about our revenue management and capacity discipline, especially for the seasonality going forward.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, good. And them some of the other markets like some of the moves by Virgin and Southwest in your markets?","Andrew Harrison","Yes. So as is probably obvious to some folks, basically our San Francisco network, for lack of a better word, is completely covered now by Virgin. They have launched on top of us in every market. So we're seeing some challenges there, same with Portland to the Bay Area. And San Francisco is up 40% in seats. They're abating going forward, but those are pretty much some of the hotspots that we're seeing. But on the plus side, we're seeing some rationalization of capacity in the Pacific Northwest, especially in some of our feeder markets. And so overall, net-net, we see competition somewhat -- the capacity, again, somewhat neutral going into the fourth and the first quarter.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, good. And then just my next question to -- I guess to Brandon. You talked about higher pension expense. With some of the legislation, I think it was the transportation bill back in July, there was a modification to the discount rate. And I'm not sure if you guys benefit from that or not, because you're -- I believe you're also a beneficiary of the Pension Protection Act of '06, and one may supersede the other. So is there anything in that bill that would benefit you from a pension expense or even a contribution basis?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Mike, it's Brandon. I want to apologize, I will not be able to come up with nearly as humorous of analogy as Andrew has been able to put forth on this one. The -- I think you're confusing funding with GAAP expense. From a GAAP-expense perspective, we don't get any relief, if you will, from any sort of bill that's floating around Congress. That's a funding thing. On the GAAP side, what I was talking about is movement in the discount rate down to what GAAP says you're supposed to use which, as I said, would put our pension expense up, maybe up to $15 million next year. Now having said that, on the funding side, we actually have no required funding this year or next. And so it really doesn't help us in that regard. We choose to fund, but we have no required funding.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Dahlman Rose.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just on a couple of things. One is with respect to your maintenance costs. I was kind of surprised that they were up 12% in the quarter. I don't think we were thinking it would be that high. Is there something in there?","George Newman","Actually, the maintenance costs are split between our 2 divisions. Alaska is up probably about $1 million, and original operation is just the one that's contributing to it. Most of it is attributable to engine repairs. And I will let Glenn expand further on it.","Glenn S. Johnson","Thanks, George. Helane, this is Glenn. So we are actually in a heavy point in engine maintenance cycle. So this year, we had 14 engine events in the quarter versus 7 last year. What I would also say is that we had some issues with the engine work that was done by Pratt, where the life of some previous repair work that they had done did not meet the expectations that we had. And so that affected 5 of that increase of 7 year-over-year. And we're expecting to see that same kind of trend through the fourth quarter of this year, and we're also working with Pratt to determine what we can do in terms of mitigating the costs that we were not expecting due to that deficiency in the earlier work.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Oh, okay. So the same level of increase for the fourth quarter?","Glenn S. Johnson","I'm expecting to see an increase in the volume of again in the fourth quarter.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Got you, okay. And then my other question is just with respect to some of the new service like Portland, Washington, Seattle, San Antonio that you talked about in the press release comments, did you say how those have booked up, and how the success have been -- sorry, has been on those?","Andrew Harrison","Helane, this is Andrew. I was just reflecting on this morning. I think we've started 17 new markets in the 12 months ended September. And so what I would say, although we don't state specifics, is that many of these markets are booking up certainly on the volume side is where we would like to see them. Right now, they're healthy with sale fares and promotional fares going into the fall season. So we are going to be watching those closely. In general, normally markets take 1 to 2 years. What I will tell you is that there is nothing that we have seen that gives us cause for major concern on these new markets. So overall, we feel pretty good, but we'll be working them hard with Joe and his marketing team to promote those markets going forward.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just my last question. Did you say that you were going to slow the number of new cities that you are opening now going forward? I thought I heard you say something about growth for next year, and I kind of missed that, sorry.","Andrew Harrison","Okay. That's okay. I was probably referring to Hawaii growth and how that is going to become much slower. What I will tell you is, Helane, that I think given the aircraft deliveries, we're looking about 7% to 8% growth next year. In the next 3 weeks, we will be announcing 3 new markets for 2013 for the mainline business, and from where I sit today, that will be it for new market in 2013.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Helane, this is Brandon just some more color on that. You might have been referring to the comments I made about slowing down the fleet growth. We've made the decision recently to get rid of 3 additional 737-700s late in the year next year. Just because we want to be prudent with the fleet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted first to ask a question about your thoughts behind the fleet order that you placed. We've seen a number of airlines sort of be very opportunistic about taking advantage of what seems to be kind of almost rock-bottom pricing for some older used aircraft. Relative to those types of opportunities, what made timing of a new aircraft order so attractive?","Brandon S. Pedersen","John, I'll start and then maybe Mark can jump in here a little bit. Brad made the comment in his section that we have really benefited in a material way from having a fleet of really efficient aircraft, larger-size aircraft, and for us, that's kind of the mindset that we have. We know that there's great deals out there on used airplanes, but that has not really been successful for us. We prefer to go the other direction. As we looked at the timing of the fleet order, it's important to know and to keep in mind that of the 75 firms now that we have on the books, about 2\/3 of that book are largely -- are replacements, and the other 1\/3 allow a really modest amount of growth over the next 10 years or so. And then the final thing that we were really thinking about was getting in line for the MAX. The MAX is going to be an awesome airplane. It's going to have 13% better fuel efficiency. And what we didn't want to do is put ourselves in a competitive disadvantaged position by not being appropriately timed on that. Mark, do you want to add to that?","Mark Eliasen","I was just going to add that our partnership with Boeing is very strong, and we're happy then pleased that they gave us early slots in the MAX, so we can get both the Dash 8 and the Dash 9 early in the cycle. And like Brandon said, we're really impressed with the fuel savings that, that will bring us.","Bradley D. Tilden","Yes. And you might just join -- you don't -- from the way we look at the economics, it's not like you have to pay something to have new airplanes. As we look at a 15- or 20-year-old airplane, and look at those airplanes on a cost per block hour or cost per seat basis, they're normally very, very pricy for both maintenance costs and fuel costs. So we look at these -- the analyses that our teams run, we look -- the new planes make sense. They pay for themselves. And as Brandon said, you have the chance to up-gauge as well and bigger airplanes are working for us.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Yes for sure,especially if you think about the 900ERs that come in the next 5 years or so. The NPV on that decision is great because what you do is you take that -- you take an airplane that has a 181 seats, low maintenance costs, great fuel efficiency and you use it to take out a 400 that has high maintenance costs, bad fuel efficiency or a 700 that, frankly, is the airplane -- an airplane that's just too small for what we want to do with it.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And is it fair to say that just given the size of the order, we're unlikely to see any sort of another order for a number of years? Are we sort of taken care of for a while now?","Brandon S. Pedersen","I guess the way I would answer that is when we were thinking about the way to structure this order, what we really wanted to do was position the Alaska book to allow for replacement and a potential -- and potential growth to the extent we saw market opportunities. This is a very, very dynamic business. Lots of changes. What I will say is that we're really happy with how we positioned the order now. But I can't say over the long term whether or we would not need more airplanes if there were some big change in the industry that caused us to want to do more than we're doing. But just to reiterate, for now, and based on what we see, our order book positions Alaska and -- for exactly what we want to do over the long term.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And can I just ask a question about the advance book factors that are out there? And I know that, that is not the only moving part, and you guys have put a very good PRASM numbers even when we've seen some volatility in advance book factor. But I couldn't help but notice how much it was revised down and then the fact that it's negative in December, which kind of caught my eye. Can you just kind of talk to maybe what's going on there, and in particular, to the extent you have any visibility, how are the holidays booking up?","Andrew Harrison","John, this is Andrew. As we look forward and look at -- October is up 2.5 November 1 and December down just a 0.5 point, that feels right to me personally. We have often seen further out, especially when you have a lot of holidays in the December period. The holidays are actually -- both Christmas and Thanksgiving, are all booking up solidly and normal. The one thing to also remember is our trip length is going to be up 4.3% also in the fourth quarter. But overall, other than as I shared earlier, recovering a little bit from, I'll just say, lack of understanding of the seasonality of Hawaii and California, so we're going to bring that in a little bit more. So I think some of these you'll see improve. But overall, we feel pretty solid about the fourth quarter.","Brandon S. Pedersen","John, it's Brandon. I want to come back and just add one more thing about the fleet. What I was really focused on was the mainline fleet and how our order with Boeing positioned us for the future. The other thing that we're thinking about, and we've talked about this internally with our employees, is we're looking at whether or not it make sense to have Q400s up in the State of Alaska at some point. This is really, really early in the planning stage. But to the extent that we did something like that, we may see a need for more Q400s.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ray Neidl with Maxim Group.","Raymond Neidl - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","With your big cash reserves and strong profitability, have you ever thought about buying another airline and shown on how to do it right? Are we getting...","Bradley D. Tilden","Yes, you guys are doing great.","Raymond Neidl - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","It might be worthwhile, but if you just read up. Now I just wanted to just clarify a couple of things about what's happening, the great direction in your ROIC and debt-to-capitalization ratios. Do you have any new target levels that you're shooting for now in those 2 areas as use of your cash?","Brandon S. Pedersen","In terms of targets, no, we don't really have target levels necessarily. I'll take each one of those individually. ROIC, we have long said that our goal is to generate a 10% return on invested capital over the business cycle. We have had a couple of really strong years. We're at a 12.7% ROIC number on a rolling 12 basis now. And we will certainly finish the -- this year, 2012, with a really strong number. But we're sticking by our long-held goal on ROIC. In terms of debt-to-cap, we are really, really proud of what we've been able to do with the balance sheet over the last couple of years, 3, 4 maybe and bring debt-to-cap down to 54%. I noted in my remarks that we had prepayments of roughly $100 million so far this year. We would likely not prepay any more debt. We're feeling good about our capital structure. Just if you look at normal maturities next year, we have $160 million-ish of current maturities, and then you take that and you assume there's going to be some increase in equity if we have profitability again next year, which all signs are pointing to us having, that would bring our debt-to-total cap down into something that started with a 4. People would say, \"Is that too low?\" And I don't know that there's ever an amount that's too low in this industry. I think the history of this industry has been that there's been way too much debt. We don't necessarily have a target. But boy, I'll tell you, as we realistically look at our capital structure, I just do not see it getting down into the 30s. We would probably want to do something a little bit different, tweak our strategy a tiny bit. But I don't see anything, any issues with having a capital structure that has a debt weighting in the 40%-something range.","Raymond Neidl - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's interesting. Also talking about the Q400 that you were mentioning a little while ago. Maybe bringing them up to Alaska, whatever. That leads to my question with Horizon. I guess at this point you've got it pretty well-fixed that way that you wanted, maybe there is a little bit more work to do there. Now are you looking at other tasks for maybe Horizon? Other parts of the country? You've mentioned Alaska. I assume that Horizon, if you were going to use the Q400 up there, it would be Horizon flying it. Are there any other opportunities separate from Alaska Airlines where you can move that type of model or that product?","Bradley D. Tilden","Ray, it's Brad. The first thing -- and I'm going to ask Glenn to really answer the question, but the first thing I want to say, to Glenn and to the Horizon employees, is they have done a fantastic job of improving that company's performance. If you look at the cost structure and the move to the single fleet, lots of back-office overhead they pulled out. The branding stuff, which I think is really -- their Alaska-branded airplanes or Alaska with a small Horizon. I think the operation is really, really cleaned up. And if you look at the returns that company is producing, they've come a long way in a couple of years. And so I think a huge compliment goes to Glenn and his leadership team and all the folks at Horizon. And then Glenn, you could talk more about that and talk about further opportunities for Horizon.","Glenn S. Johnson","Sure. Thanks, Brad. Ray, this is Glenn. The first thing I would say is like Brad, I want to extend my thanks and compliments to the whole Horizon team. They're the ones that got this thing turned around. At the same time, I'd like to say that we're never done. We've got cost pressures still on, in particular, our maintenance costs that we're working very hard internally and with Bombardier. So those things are still in our sights in terms of improvement. In terms of future opportunities, as Brandon said, we are starting a very preliminary look at how the Q400 might be a good fit in the state of Alaska. Beyond that, we're kind of a typical CPA carrier now, so we look to our friends at Alaska to determine what opportunities they can best use the Q400s to feed these -- the growing fleet size as well as the growing gauge at Alaska. And I'm personally very enthusiastic about those opportunities, both in the Pacific Northwest network as Alaska gets bigger airplanes that Brandon was talking about and then potentially more in the state of California. I guess I would say you've seen us do some things intra-California and I personally believe the Q400 is a great airplane for that kind of stage length, just like it will be in the state of Alaska.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Engel with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A question on the regional operation. If I look at the regional, the RASM there was down about 4%. So why is the regional lagging the mainline so much?","Andrew Harrison","Yes. Firstly, we have very tough comps. Our unit revenues were up 15% last year in Q3 as we shrunk ISMs and restructured the fleet. But just bluntly, the major region for the reduction in unit revenue was competitive capacity in the summer. Southern California had some big increases. California to Portland, we have 10 flights a day. And as I said, seats were up 60% between Portland and San Francisco. We see those competitive pressures abating a little bit going forward, but that's the main reason for those negative unit revenues.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And can you talk about the transcon opportunities? I guess when you're looking at the 7% growth, what region of the country now starts looking most attractive, if Hawaii is starting to fill out, and how is that opportunity doing?","Andrew Harrison","So I mean, as I mentioned earlier essentially we've got all the new markets going into 2013. We're going to announce 3 more here shortly, which I can't comment on right now. But you're going to see very few new markets going into 2013 outside of the new ones that we have already done recently.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Finally, I have noticed that you've been cutting Alaskan capacity quite a bit. What's driving that?","Andrew Harrison","I believe we were flat in the third quarter. But we -- historically, we had too many seats in the market, to be quite honest. And we've been shoring that. We look at Alaska week by week by week. So we're just getting the seats right in that market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just one additional question on Hawaii. How is the ancillary revenue trends in Hawaii?","Joseph A. Sprague","Savi, this is Joe. Ancillary overall is about flat in absolute dollars year-over-year, down a little bit on a per-passenger basis. Big contributor there, as we've already talked about, was the bag fees. But maybe specific to your question, Hawaii does a couple of things that are really nice for us from an ancillary standpoint. One area where we have had really strong performance for the last several months is with our buy-onboard food and beverage program. We do especially well with that on our flights to Hawaii. We try and plus up the product a little bit there to make it -- for a great customer experience, but we get some additional revenue benefit as well. And then over time, we're trying to build up more of our car and hotel business. It's not where we want it today, but over time, we think we can grow that a lot higher. And Hawaii will be a key part of that. And in fact, as it pertains to our current hotel business, Hawaii actually is up nicely year-over-year.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","What is the gating factor in building up the hotel and car business?","Joseph A. Sprague","I'm sorry Savi. One more time?","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","What is the gating factor or what will you need to see for that component to start increasing?","Bradley D. Tilden","Savi, it's Brad. I think, I mean, the first thing I think I would say is I think there is enormous opportunity in places like Hawaii for us to sell cars and hotels over alaskaair.com. I think it's customer preference and awareness in kind of getting critical mass and the right relationships with the hotels. So I think it's all of that stuff. And I think we're -- I don't know, with a lot of these things, that if you maybe contrast it with other technology moves, you see little moves to get from 0 to 1% to 2% to 3% to 4%, then you start moving bigger. And I don't know if we can say right here what the gating factors, but I would just say that I think over time, there is enormous potential there because I think customers trust us. They like the Alaska Airlines experience and I think alaskaair.com is a trusted place to buy airline tickets, and it will also be a good place for cars and hotels.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Understood, great. Just one quick last follow-up question on the booking trends. I think in the past, you have mentioned just because the selling patterns that you should see book load factors narrow as you get closer to the date. Is that still the case, or has something changed there?","Andrew Harrison","Savi, this is Andrew. I don't see any major changes in our booking patterns except as I shared earlier. We've got some work to do on how we've been selling Hawaii, especially California, and you're going to see us make some adjustments there and maybe sell more a little earlier and sort of build our way up there. But other than that, nothing significant.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Fintzen with Barclays.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones, maybe one for Andrew. You talked about sort of being a little more tactical in Hawaii, and I think you mentioned California in terms of seasonal capacity. Are there good counter-seasonal markets to shift into? Or should we be thinking in terms of a bit less aircraft utilization?","Andrew Harrison","I think, overall, between the summer in California and the winter in the Pacific Northwest, we have opportunities to offset each other. We have opportunities to leverage our fleet network in the Pacific Northwest to help out California. So I think what you're finding is sort of just a tweaking of our Hawaii network on some of the weakest days, nothing majorly material.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Okay, that helps. Then on the 7% to 8% ASM growth that I think Brandon mentioned for next year. How much of that is up-gauging? Is that, what, 2, 3 points or is that less?","Brandon S. Pedersen","David, it's Brandon. I don't have that handy. Andrew, do you know off the top of your head?","Andrew Harrison","Smaller portion of the...","Brandon S. Pedersen","Yes, I don't know the answer to that off the top of my head. What I do know is that we've got 15 900ERs coming in, 6 going out -- excuse me, 13 coming in, 6 going out. So that's basically 7 net aircraft. They are bigger and our stage length is going to continue to grow as well. But I don't know the split.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve O'Hara with Sidoti & Company.","Stephen O'Hara - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Just going to the buyback. I mean, in terms of the amount, looking at the consensus estimates that are out there, I mean, it looks like you guys are going to generate -- you should generate, based on the estimates at least, a lot of free cash flow based on the CapEx guidance you have so far. Your debt repayments are going down, I think, in the next 2 years. So I mean it seems like the -- maybe the $250 million seems a little small or maybe the time frame seems a little long? But can just talk about that a little bit?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Sure. This is Brandon. I obviously can't and won't comment about the first call and guidance and our -- your assertion that the cash flow is going to be big. What I can tell you is that generating free cash flow is certainly a goal of this company. And in terms of the $250 million being small, I guess I would push back a tiny bit and say it is 10% of our market cap. And if you look at the history of what we've done, we've done a series of $50 million authorizations for, I think, there's 4 of them in a row. And what we really wanted to do with a $250 million authorization, that's again, 10% of our market cap, is demonstrate our confidence in our plan and our cash flow. So I don't know that I have a whole lot more to add other than that.","Stephen O'Hara - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. I guess I mean, just in terms of what you guys have done to the balance sheet over the last couple of years, it seems like you could easily do a lot more.","Bradley D. Tilden","Steve, it's Brad. I mean, think another thing we might say about it is, is it is something you continually look at. And Brandon, I can't remember, but we -- in our grid, we increased our repurchase rate by 71% a few months ago. I can't remember the month when we did that at current stock prices. But it's something that -- we've just announced this $250 million. Now we get into 2013, see how things are looking at. You just -- you continue to evaluate it as you go.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Yes. The other thing I would add is that a balanced approach has worked well for us. As I said, we probably won't do anymore prepayments necessarily, but we have had a cash balance of roughly $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion for quite a while now, and we have always found good uses for that cash that are investor-friendly.","Stephen O'Hara - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And then second, I guess, just going to Delta's buy of the trainer facility, I guess, just curious about your opinion of that as maybe an option for Alaska on a smaller scale? I mean, is this something that the industry could do on a JV or kind of a coop basis to help save on fuel costs?","Mark Eliasen","Steve, this is Mark Eliasen. I would just say that we understand why Delta did that, we're all frustrated with fuel costs. As far as our immediate plans, those are creative ideas that you threw out there, but we really don't have anything in the works right now other than to continue to watch fuel and do our best through our hedging program to protect ourselves from spikes in that fuel cost.","Stephen O'Hara - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And then lastly, I guess, what's your ancillary revenue per passenger? And then I think Allegiant's done a pretty good job cutting their credit card fees by moving to debit cards. Is this something you could do for in cabin? Would that help at all or is that something that you guys have at your radar?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Yes. In terms of ancillaries, our ancillary fee per passenger right now is about $11.80 on a year-to-date basis. In terms of opportunities, I think Joe spent a few minutes earlier talking about the ancillary opportunities that we have. Turning to the debit card thing, we have seen a significant -- excuse me, decline in credit card costs because of the Durbin Amendment and how that has brought credit card costs down. In terms of moving to debit cards in the cabin, we do accept both debit and credit. Joe do you want to add to that or...","Joseph A. Sprague","No. Just that we're -- we think we have some opportunities with our overall credit card agreement. It's an important financial vehicle for us and we think we can enhance on that even further.","Andrew Harrison","This is Andrew. I might pile on here real quick. We talked a lot about ancillary, but one thing folks should be aware of is we're doing a lot of work to get more revenue onto our aircraft. For instance, we only have 1 fare. Say Seattle-San Francisco, we only have 1 fare. We only have 1 class to sell in the first class of the deepest -- of the lowest to the highest of the highest, peak-peak season. We're going to add more booking classes. We have a leg-based revenue management system. We're hoping by 2014 to have an O&D system that will significantly improve our revenue performance. We sell upgrades at the gate. We need to get that electronic and more variable. So we have a bunch of things in the works, to Brandon's IT comments, that we think are going to bring more revenue in as we continue to grow the airline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore Partners.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of little items most of the stuff has been well hashed here. On the CapEx guidance through 2015, I appreciate that's a long-term plan. You got some footnotes around incremental deposits, around options. How should we be thinking about how you think about whether or not you are going to exercise those options and timing? So like for next year, what do you need to see to decide if you're going to pull the trigger on that incremental $100 million of CapEx?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Duane, it's Brandon. What we need to see is a plan that gives us confidence that those incremental airplanes are going to be able to meet our return targets.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So I guess when would you know that? Is it middle of next year, and you say, \"Yes, we're going to hit a 12% ROIC again, so let's do it.\" Or how do you think about that?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Yes. It's really more where these airplanes are going to go and what we think the NPV looks like. One of the difficulties in this business is you have to put down deposits on airplanes a fairly long period before you actually get the asset and then it's a 20-year asset that you have to use profitably. And so there is a great deal of uncertainty, obviously. But as we talk about it internally, as we look at the fleet plan, as we look at our list of market opportunities, as we look at the direction we're going on our cost structure, again, it would all come down to whether or not we have a high degree of confidence that we can deploy those aircraft in a way that meets our return targets.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Consistent, good answer. What is the value of your unencumbered assets as they stand today? And along those lines, if you had to raise something against them, what you think you could raise?","Mark Eliasen","Duane, this is Mark. I would say that we're got, as we have mentioned, 40 unencumbered aircraft. It's a little bit speculative to say how much we could raise. We talk to banks and creditors all the time and they would be anxious to lend against especially our 737-800s. So it's in the several-hundred-million-dollar range if we needed to. But right now, we don't see that need.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Crissey with UBS.","Kevin Crissey - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You got it covered by this point.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Trahan.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Andrew, I just want to sort of hear your opinion on one particular market, that is San Diego-Orlando. I believe that it is historically kind of a lower-yield market on an O&D basis. I'm curious to know, A, why you think that specific market can work? And, B, more broadly, just tell me what you think about when you decide to open up a market like that, that doesn't touch Seattle?","Andrew Harrison","Yes. In short, number one, you are very -- you are spot on as it relates to a lower-yielding market. What I would is that, firstly we look for is we still have a good presence in Southern California. And San Diego-Orlando, we have experience with Orlando. It's one of the largest demanded markets that is -- that has not got direct service today, largest O&Ds out of San Diego. So there is no head-to-head competition, it has very high demand and our airplane that we are using there is around utilization. We're actually getting some utilization play there. But to your point, it's a test market. I mean it's outside of our core and we'll be working that hard with the marketing group. But that's a little bit how we think about it.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call over back to Mr. Tilden.","Bradley D. Tilden","All right.

My name is Julie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for analysts. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Director of Investor Relations, Matt Grady.","Matt Grady","Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. On the call today are CEO, Brad Tilden, who will provide an overview of the business; our CFO, Brandon Pedersen, who will discuss our cost performance and cash flow; and Andrew Harrison, our Chief Commercial Officer, who will share an update on our revenue performance and outlook. Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.","Earlier this morning, Alaska Air Group reported fourth quarter GAAP net income of $367 million. Excluding merger related costs, mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments, and a special $274 million tax benefit associated with recent tax reform legislation, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $103 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.83 or $0.01 ahead of first call consensus.","As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","We have also included certain unaudited supplementary data labeled Combined Comparative Statistics on Page 9 of our earnings release to help investors make meaningful comparisons to the combined results of both airlines from last year's fourth quarter and full year. We think this provides investors better insights into how the overall business is performing.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Brad.","Brad Tilden","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. For 2017, we reported adjusted net income of $823 million or $6.64 per share compared to $911 million or $7.32 per share in 2016. For the quarter, we earned $103 million or $0.83 per share, compared to $193 million or $1.56 per share in 2016.","As we shared with you on our third quarter call, our earnings are under some pressure as we deal with some step-function cost increases, as well as significant new competitive capacity in markets where we fly. As we'll talk about on this call, we are optimistic about our future, as we work our way through these issues as we complete the majority of the integration activity by early this spring and as we begin capturing the advantages of the merger.","As an example of our confidence in our future, our board today announced a 7% increase in our dividend to $0.32 per share. I'd like to take a minute to frame for you where we are in the integration journey. As you know, we embarked on this journey because we believe we bring value to everyone who depends on us. We wanted to continue doing this in the years ahead.","We are in an industry where competitive advantage drives both current success and long-term staying power. And we believe that Alaska has real and durable competitive advantage. We have this with our operational processes and capability, with the fantastic service our people provide to our guests, with the very clear cost advantage that's masked with the history of offering low fares, with our growing route network, and most importantly, with the way we work with our employees to bring all of this together.","The merger closed on December 14, 2016 or just 13 months ago. Today, as we expected, we have substantially all of the cost of the combined company in our results with very little of the revenue.","Of the $300 million original synergy target, we expect to realize $65 million in 2018, consistent with our prior forecast. We continue to believe that revenue potential of the new Alaska network is substantial, that we expect synergies to reach $200 million in 2019. More important than the synergies however is the incredible platform that we'll have to grow revenue and profit in the years ahead and create value for our owners, our customers and our employees, just as we have in the last couple of decades.","On April 25, we'll transition to a common PSS system, which will give us a single shopping, buying, flight scheduling and airport check-in system, as well as a single branded digital and airport experience. At that point, which will be just 16 months after closing, will be through 75% of the merger work and will begin realizing the full potential of the merger as Andrew will further describe in just a moment.","We believe we're getting through our merger at a pace that is equal to or faster than the most rapid mergers in the industry. Some specific merger related accomplishments from the last few months are as follows. We have co-located Alaska and Virgin America operations at 22 of 31 airports. The rest will co-locate in April.","We've rapidly built out a route network, adding 44 new routes on top of the 38 we acquired with Virgin America. We've grown both loyalty members and credit-card holders far in excess of our passenger growth. We converted to a single loyalty program for customers, and single HR finance and payroll systems in the back of the house.","We received a single operating certificate from the FAA, a Herculean effort that allows us to operate Alaska and Virgin America as one airline and which is also a prerequisite for other merger-related activities like the PSS cutover. We made all aircraft delivery and interior decisions and our first Airbus airplane came out of the paint shop yesterday with new Alaska colors.","And as you know, we financed the purchase of Virgin America in an accretive and all cash transaction and have already brought our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio back to 51%. On the labor front, while we still have work to do, at this point, we have single joint collective bargaining agreements with our pilots and our customer service and reservation agents. And we believe we're closed with both our flight attendants and our maintenance technicians.","One important priority we'll have remaining after April 25 is our move to a single crew planning and crew scheduling system. In light of so many important achievements last year, I want to pause and personally thank our entire team of more than 23,000 people for their contributions in 2017, a year that I believe we'll look back on as having laid the foundation for our future growth and prosperity.","We will share $118 million in incentive pay tomorrow as annual bonuses are paid out. This is the 9th consecutive year in which we proudly share profits with our employees at levels that have averaged of about one month of additional pay per employee per year. This year's payout averages 7.3% of pay for Air Group frontline employees.","As we look at our business in 2018, we have work in front of us. There is substantial competitive capacity in our markets. And we expect that this level of capacity will continue to put pressure on unit revenue. But there are number of levers that we can and will hold this year. We plan to attack the revenue pressure by reconfiguring our Airbus fleet for greater revenue. By undertaking significant cross-fleeting in high volume markets, by driving continued loyalty growth, and most importantly, by tapping into segmentation and up-sell opportunities post-PSS.","While we focused on expanding our network in 2017, our growth will stabilize in 2018 and we expect it to slow to about 4% in 2019 and 2020, as we take advantage of the substantial growth of the last few years and optimize and refine our network. Of the growth plan for 2018, approximately 70% is flying today and Paine Field represents the bulk of the rest.","As Brandon will share in a moment, we expect capital expending to decline in 2019 and 2020, and free cash flow to increase consistent with the lower capacity growth.","On the cost side, our relative cost advantage has been a hallmark of our business for years. And is one of our greatest assets, second only to our people. We will sustain this advantage by focusing on low overhead and industry-leading productivity.","As I mentioned earlier, we do face a step function increase in cost, which Brandon will detail for you in a moment. For now, I'll share that there are clear opportunities which we will seize to improve our control over cost structure. This brings us to operations.","Though we rank second in operational performance last year, our on-time performance at the Air Group level was down about 5 points compared to 2016. While we struggle with external factors like challenging winter weather in the first quarter and ATC delays, we have room for improvement.","For the fourth of 2017, our on-time performance was up, more than 2 points year-over-year. We're focused on maintaining this positive momentum as we move through 2018. I finally like to provide a brief update on Horizon, where we brought in Air Group veterans Gary Beck and Constance von Muehlen, and where we've made several other leadership changes.","We've now operated three months without a single pilot related cancellation. We are very optimistic about Horizon's future, as we're consolidating our headquarters in Seattle, as we're building better career pathways between the two companies for front-line employees starting with pilots. And as we further grow and develop leadership talent between the two companies.","In summary, we laid a solid foundation for our future last year and the integration will be largely complete by early this spring. Alaska has real competitive advantage. By the end of April, will be poised to focus on full attention on the things that matter most, being close to our people, running a great operation and for serving and enhancing both our great service and our low costs and low fares. We operate one of the best route networks in the country based in some of the best performing regional economies of the country.","And finally, we've long run this company in a balanced way to bring superior value to everyone who depends on us, including you our owners. We have a very talented team is working hard to ensure this continues. We appreciate you all tuning in. And once again, I want to thank our employees for their incredible commitment to Alaska.","And now I'll turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everybody. As you've heard, we've reported fourth quarter adjusted net income of $103 million bringing - full year net income to $823 million. This was the third best year for us ever, and came in at a time of rapid growth, significant competitive pressure and then 18% increase in fuel prices, all while we were busy integrating two airlines.","Let's start with cost today. Q4 cost came in slightly better than our final guidance, that's positive. But we also know that our cost management practices both in the operation and in the back office can be improved. So with the integration on track 2018 marks are returned to the basics. And one of those is a finally tuned cost management. This is not about cutting what guests care about. Instead, it's about productivity, a mindset of frugality, leaders knowing their cost drivers and making smart trade-offs.","Cost management is like a diet. It needs to happen every day to work well, keeping costs low is vital to our low fare model and powers our business success. All-in consolidated CASMex fuel should be up about 2.5% in 2018. This is on an apples-to-apples basis, after confirming the 2017 numbers to the changes required by the new accounting rules for revenue recognition and presentation of pension expense, which are relatively small. This information in this morning's investor update that explains these expected changes to the way our 2017 results will be restated.","I talked last quarter about the pressures on 2018 costs. The new rates with our pilots, the power by the hour deal on our 737-800 engines, and the growing mix of higher costs regional flying. Excluding those items, our unit cost for 2018 would be down about 1% on the 7.5% increase in capacity, a strong result for the underlying business.","On my point is not to create a new CASM metric that excludes big cost items. But it is to underscore the hard work that our divisional leaders did through multiple budget cycles to produce the plan that recognizes our need to keep costs low. I'll offer us couple of specific goals. First, we measured overhead as a percentage of non-fuel costs, and have set a budget goal for that to be less than 10%. Total overhead is growing by only 2.6% and our overhead CASM declined by more than 3% in the budget.","Second, we've budgeted productivity improvements in nearly every operationally every operational division. Horizon is a great example with pilot and flight attendant productivity budgeted to be up 3 and 9 points respectively.","We expect Q1 CASMex to increase 6% three things drive the increase. First, wages and benefits are higher, with much of that due to the increase in mainline pilot rates. Second, maintenance expense will be up 31% year-over-year by far the largest increase expected in any of the four quarters, some of this is the power by the hour deal, some is event driven. And third, we expect to record higher incentive pay expense, particularly for our operational rewards program, which paid almost nothing in Q1 of last year given our operational challenges. Of course, we have to hit those operational targets to earn those rewards.","The Q1 CASM increase will be the highest of the year, we expect much smaller increases in Q2 and Q3, and an ex fuel unit cost decline in Q4. One open item that could impact our 2018 cost is a possible deal with our flight attendants. We're working with them now, and hope to get a deal done soon. If and when we reach an agreement, we'll revise our cost guidance accordingly. If we can get this done, we'll have 63% of our unionized workforce and 80% of the payroll that they represent under contract through the end of 2019, giving us great cost visibility.","Bottom line, our unit costs will rise in 2018, but our team is committed to having a cost structure that maintains a cost advantage over the legacy carriers. And even though the income of 2018 budget is hardly dry, we're already thinking about 2019 and have a planning mindset that consolidated cost should be flat to down slightly in each 2019 and 2020. This will, of course, depend on capacity growth, it gets harder as capacity growth comes down and it will also depend somewhat on the timing of a flight attendant deal. That's not guidance, but it is directionally where we think we want to go.","We ended the year with $1.6 billion in cash. Total cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion, excluding merger related costs. This was a record for us, surpassing 2016's mark by more than $175 million and represents our fourth consecutive year of operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion. CapEx for the year was $1 billion, resulting in $670 million of free cash flow again ex integration cost.","In 2018, we'll take delivery of 12 new mainline jets bringing the mainline fleet to just over 230 aircraft. Our mainline fuel efficiency will continue to be among the best in the industry at about 80 ASMs per gallon. An efficient fleet is the best hedge against rising fuel prices, but it's worth noting that we also have fuel hedges with strike prices at about $62 level in place for 50% of our expected consumption in the first six months of the year.","On the regional side, we expect - we're schedule to take delivery of 25 E175s between Horizon, and our CPA arrangement with SkyWest. We expect to retire 13 Q400s bringing the regional fleet to 95 units at the end of 2018, of which 61% will be modern, comfortable and versatile E175s.","In total, we own 67 next-gen mainline and E175 jets free and clear, and expect that number to grow in 2018, including our $400 million of undrawn lines of credit, our uncapped borrowing capacity will exceed $2 billion by the end of the year.","We expect total CapEx of 2018 to be about $1 billion. In my comments last quarter, I guided to $1.4 billion, which we assume - which assumed we'd exercise all options for deliveries beyond 2018. Further, we're targeting 2019 and 2020 CapEx to each be about $750 million. We've been looking at our delivery skyline across all fleet types and plan to take advantage of the substantial 18% growth that we've had in the last two years, and refine, and as Brad said, optimize our network accordingly.","The CapEx figures above should allow for growth in the 4% range of 2019 and 2020, which is still be above GDP growth. We're very committed to generating free cash flow and these moves will enhance that. Free cash flow provides a convenient place to talk about the new tax loss, and the anticipated impact on cash flows.","In short, we'll benefit significantly a nice tailwind at a time of rising fuel prices and competitive pressure. Our book effective rate for 2018 should be about 24.5%, but our cash effective rate should be between 10% and 15% after consideration of our acquired NOLs.","Our investment-grade balance sheet continues to get stronger. We ended the year with $2.6 billion of on balance sheet debt, down from the end of Q3, driven partly by the prepayment of $71 million of debt laid in Q4. Including leases, our year end adjusted debt-to-cap stands at 51%, and 8 point improvement in the last year. We should have on balance sheet debt down under $2.5 billion by the end of 2018 and we expect debt-to-cap to improve to 50%, even with a couple of points of headwind that will face with the adoption of the new revenue recognition rules and the related hit to equity.","We remain committed to getting to our goal of having debt-to-cap in the mid-40% range by 2020. We're also well positioned in a rising interest rate environment as roughly 0.5% of our total debt is fixed. During 2017, we returned $223 million to shareholders via $148 million in dividends and $75 million in share repurchases. As you've seen in our press release, and as Brad mentioned, we're again increasing the dividend by 7% to $0.32 per share for quarter. We've now increased the dividends five times since we initiated in 2013.","And before I turn the call over to Andrew, I do want to call out the impact of the new revenue recognition standard that will be effective for Q1 of 2018. Big picture airlines like ours that have used to incremental cost method for miles earned through travel, will now have to defer a portion of their related flight revenue instead. It's important to emphasize that although there will be an impact on reported revenues, it has nothing to do with pricing or cash flows. It's simply a question of timing of revenue recognition. We've provided more information in our investor update to help investors understand the impact on both revenues and costs.","With that, I'll turn it over to Andrew.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks, Brandon, and good morning, everybody. As we've reported total revenues in 2017 rose 6% to $7.9 million on a 7% capacity growth. Revenues for the fourth quarter grew 6% to approximately $2 billion on 10% growth. There are specific drivers behind our current revenue performance, and it's important to look at each one to appreciate that our fundamentals are sound, and significant opportunities lie ahead for improved revenue performance.","When you just stick the fourth quarter CASM performance of down 4% year-over-year following a very important competitive capacity. I want to start with this, since it's an environmental factor that is real and elevated at this time. Looking at our network, competitive capacity was up from a 1% increase in Q3 to 4% in Q4. Looking forward, first quarter 2018 competitive capacity is expected to increase 2 points to 6% and another 2 points in the second quarter to 8%. We believe that overtime, conditions will improve and our ability to compete will get better, which I'm going to discuss in detail shortly.","Same-store TRASM, same-stores represent approximately 90% of our total ASMs and we grew capacity in these markets by 1.6% during the quarter. TRASM in these markets was down 1.5%. However, after factoring for stage length increases, TRASM was down about 0.8 point. The nominal decline is being driven by a subset of markets as pockets of industry pricing and capacity pressure remain in California. Most of our same-store markets continue to show either flat or positive TRASM.","Turning to new markets, 44 markets in operation less than one year represented approximately 10% of our total capacity and contributed the remaining 2.5 points of the overall 4 points decline in TRASM. Finally, 28 of the 44 new markets launched in 2017 commenced post summer break, so many currently operated TRASM levels well below our long-term expectations. And I want to drill into two specific points on this. First, promotional activity to both support these markets and grow loyalty has more than 1 point impact on the quarter. Our challenging on the near-term results, this is great for the long-term health of our network.","And then second, we are seeing improvement in the performance of our new market, while it's too early to call in on the most recent additions to our schedule. Markets that have operated at least six months already profitable and are tracking ahead of our initial expectations. These results tell me that our service, product and low fare offerings are resonating with guests, and gives us confidence that our newest routes will continue to mature over the course of 2018.","The brand health and guests loyalty data associated with our growth initiatives are showing strong year-over-year trends. California preference has increased 4 points on year-over-year basis. And importantly, Alaska's unaided brand awareness now exceeds Virgin America in California by 9 points. We fully expect strong performance in these metrics will lead to greater market share and profitability. In addition, the volume and quality of the growth we are seeing our Mileage Plan and credit card programs system wide fuels our optimism that our efforts in 2017 laid the groundwork for strong future revenue performance.","Looking forward, TRASM guidance for the first quarter is down 3.5% to 4.5%, on capacity growth of 8% and weighted competitive capacity growth of 6%. The headwinds reflected in this guidance are expected to be the same as the fourth quarter, new markets, pricing in California and promotional activity. Alaska's full year 2018 capacity guidance is now 7.5%. More than 5 points in this growth comes from annualizing the new flying we launched last year. As Brad mentioned earlier, our network expansion is now largely complete, and our focus in 2018 is to optimize what we built in 2017.","Bearing in mind what I've just shared about fourth quarter performance and the first quarter outlook, I want to spend a moment talking to our owners. I was just reflecting this week that this is my 10th year with you on quarterly earnings calls. And while every call addresses current results, Alaska's executive team have always run this company with the express goal of delivering sustainable returns to our shareholders that are above our cost of capital, and we have done just that over this past decade.","The acquisition of Virgin America, which only closed 13 months ago, is arguably the single-largest impact to our business outside of the great recession over these past 10 years. And the reason I raise this is we're only three months away from a single reservation system. While some will insist on comparing our current revenue performance to carriers who achieved this single reservation system anywhere from two to eight years ago, the reality is, we are about to unlock the critical levers we need to generate revenues required to continue delivering on returns to our shareholders. This upside is obviously not reflected in current results, but it will be reflected in future results.","The opportunities that will begin to materialize post-PSS include the following: first, all but one of our international partners that serve California, that's approximately 50 wide-body departures a day, will gain full access to the acquired network from Virgin America, including the nine new markets we started with Airbus metal over the past six months. We will commence moving Boeing and Airbus around our network to leverage the significant gauge and trip cost differences to ensure that we have the right aircraft and the right market to maximize revenue and profitability. This will build Q2, Q4 with full cross-fleeting in effect by the beginning of 2016.","E-commerce resources will free up to ensure that the significant loyalty growth we've achieved since acquisition will continue and that we capitalize on a single guest experience, whether via digital channels at the airport or in the air, and this will drive incremental revenue over the long term. Our first reconfigured Airbus will enter service in September, and the additional seats, we will gain will not only reduce Airbus fleet CASM and Airbus represents approximately 25% of our mainline fleet, it will result in meaningful increase in First Class seats and the introduction of Premium Class on these aircraft. This will drive both incremental revenues and the ability for our Elites to obtain better access to upgrades.","And finally, with a single reservation system, we will be able to address up sell and segmentation opportunities which the legacy carriers are executing on today and that we have not been able to participate in. There are a number of ways for us to participate. Basic economy is just one of those, fair families and ancillary bundles are others.","And whatever approach we take, we are committed to tapping into the opportunity before us to increase up sell and ancillary revenues. This particular opportunity would represent incremental revenue above our stated synergy targets for the merger. We're just beginning to evaluate the full potential of up sell and will share more with you on our future calls. While the full carriers that represent about 85% of U.S. domestic revenues have taken to adding significant capacity in our core network while we integrate, the switch to a single reservation system for all the reasons above will increase our ability to weather these challenges.","Our history is one that is built upon adversity and has always resulted in us becoming stronger. And it is my firm believe that the competitive landscape we face today will do just that again. And since we'll only enter a handful of new markets in the year ahead, we'll be able to fully turn our attention to optimizing our product and pricing across the newly established network.","So with that, let's go to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Savanthi Syth","Hey, good morning. I was just wondering if I could follow up on the operational improvement in fourth quarter and it seems like you're still kind of behind historical levels. Just wondering what the expectation is for the improvement as you go through the year. And maybe kind of separate that out by the issues that you've had in kind of the Northwest versus California.","Ben Minicucci","Good morning, Savi, it's Ben. Yeah, you're right. We saw a great improvement in the fourth quarter and one of the things we've done in 2017 with this merger is put our Alaska operational process within the Virgin network. So everything now is operating within the same framework, the same mentality of how we operated Alaska in the past. So our goal, just to be really honest is to lead the industry in operational excellence.","Savanthi Syth","What's the timing around that, Ben?","Ben Minicucci","Starting now, starting [indiscernible].","Savanthi Syth","All right, and if I may just ask the - on the follow-up question on the targeting of flat to down CASMex in 2019 and 2020, given the slower growth, any drivers of that, that will help reach that goal?","Ben Minicucci","So, Savi, you're asking about our capital spending and capacity growth in 2019 and 2020?","Savanthi Syth","Or more the cost side of things than the cost target.","Ben Minicucci","Brandon, why don't you?","Brandon Pedersen","All right, hey, Savi. It's Brandon. Yeah, it's the things I mentioned. It's being really, really keen on productivity. It's really being frugal in the back office. It's watching the overhead. There may be some structural things that we need to consider. But at the end of the day, we've had two years now of cost increases. And I think we need to get back to flat to down CASM. And that's where our mindset is and we're already starting to think about 2019 today as I said in the prepared remarks.","Savanthi Syth","Okay. Got it. Helpful. Thank you.","Brad Tilden","Thanks, Savi.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew, your line is open.","Andrew George Didora","Hi, good morning, everyone, and thank you for the questions. I guess, just a follow-up to Savi's question. Maybe to ask it a little bit different way. I guess, now that you've gone through a big part of the integration, you've been operating in California in a bigger scale for a year now, how would you rank your operations in California versus your Pacific Northwest operations?","I would think they are worse and do you think they can ever get back to where Alaska was pre-merger?","Ben Minicucci","Good morning. It's Ben again. Obviously, California is a little tougher with San Francisco. We're dealing with ATC programs on a daily basis. One of the strategies we have in place right now is to operate the best we can in California. Part of doing that one, like I said is putting operational process in terms of departing airplanes always on time like we do. We call that, controllable departures on zero.","The second part is dealing with ATC strategy. So we got a team focused on ATC mitigation on a daily basis with our management team and with our dispatchers. It also has schedule implications, how we structure the schedule, when we depart, type of airplanes we put at different times of the day. So our goal really is to really mitigate it to the largest extent possible and to - on a network basis, get the highest operational performance.","Andrew Harrison","And, Andrew, this is Andrew Harrison. Just one follow-up really to your question and to Savi's. We acquired - with the Virgin America acquisition we walked into 2017, inheriting a network with block hours, totally separate than we planned for. And it wasn't until late in this year where we're able to push through block changes and changes to the operations to start to stabilize it.","That's why Ben and I are confident that as we move into 2018 where we had time to restructure the network, get the block times right, understand how we're going to fly and going into 2019, we think this machine is really going to start to hum.","Andrew George Didora","Great. Thank you. That's all I had.","Brad Tilden","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph, your line is open.","Joseph DeNardi","Yeah, thank you very much. Brandon, just on the CapEx outlook, it seems like that's changed quite a bit relative to how you guys were thinking about it before and you're going to forego some options that you're maybe thinking about taking earlier. So can you just talk through, I guess, what changed and what the uses of cash are going forward?","Brad Tilden","Yeah, Joe, this is Brad. I might start with this. One of the things that Alaska has prided itself, being good stewards of capital. And as part of that, I think we've been a pretty contrarian management team. There have been times when the industry has been down where we've chosen to grow aggressively. And then in other environments, you've got to make the right decision.","As we look at the environment today, I will say we are extraordinarily confident about our competitive advantage. We do think our low cost, our operational capability are real. Our network is solidly profitable. But the opportunities aren't the same as they were three or four years ago. And so, one of - so if you are a good steward of capital, you've got to make the right decision at the right time.","So as we look at 2019 and 2020, we're going to grow considerably. We'll grow 4% each of those years. That's enough to hang onto our current market position and grow a little bit, but it's not at the same level. I was looking back last night, our growth over the last 5 years without Virgin America has been 7%, 7%, 10%, 10% and 7% or something like that. And if you look at the fuel prices are up $20 a barrel in just the last 6 months. Capacity is up.","As we look at the future, we're going to grow. But we just don't think - in terms of us being great stewards of capital and providing returns on capital that we want to provide and that we will provide. We just don't think this as an environment that argues for 7% or 8% growth. It argues for a lower growth number, and that's what we're going to do.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. Yeah, that's helpful. And then - and, Brad, another one for you. When you look back at kind of the experience thus far with acquiring Virgin, I think maybe you paid a little bit more than you would've wanted to. The integration seems to be largely on track, maybe a little bit better. Can you just talk about your appetite for M&A in the future, and whether your experience with Virgin makes you more or less comfortable looking at acquiring other airlines in the future?","Brad Tilden","Joe, that is a great question that I don't think we're going to answer. But I will just say, the Virgin experience has been a good one. We've - the company has got an $8 billion platform today. It's considerably better than our platform before. That brand has pushed us. Those people were great marketers. If you look at the way Alaska is promoting itself, I think it's activated something inside us in terms of getting into California, growing loyalty.","It's been a really good thing for this company. We've gotten through a lot. We're very, very excited about the future. But in terms of us talking about other M&A activity, I don't think we're going to bite on that.","Joseph DeNardi","Thank you.","Brad Tilden","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael, your line is open.","Michael Linenberg","Oh, yeah, hey, thanks, hey. Good morning, everyone. Two questions here. Hey, Brandon, you talked about your cash tax rate being 10% to 15% after consideration of our acquired NOLs. And I believe with the acquisition of the company, you may have called out in your - I don't know if your 10-K or 10-Q that maybe you would potentially delimit on the use of the NOLs or maybe I'm wrong on that. Do you have - are you going to be able to use - fully utilize the NOLs that you got as a result of the Virgin acquisition?","Brandon Pedersen","Yes, we think we will. We started the year with, I don't know, $750 million of NOLs or something on a gross basis. We think we'll be through that by the end of 2019, so the 2019 tax year.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, very good. And then, just second question to Andrew. You called out some of the competitive pressures that you're seeing in California. And I believe last quarter, maybe it was the prior quarter, you called out California, I think you also called out maybe some pressure on the transcons. And I just - I didn't hear that on this call. And I'm just - I'm wondering has the - for you, your transcon sort of situation revenue environment, has that improved or may be stabilized for you? If you could provide some color on that, that would be great, given it's a sizable part of your network.","Andrew Harrison","Yeah, thanks for the question. Transcon, we do have a lot of transcon in California. What I - and we don't like to talk about regions, but what I will tell you is load factors are actually up and traffic is extremely strong. I think that what I've been looking at on a network basis is that our seasonality with the merger with Virgin America has actually got worse in the first quarter and in the September\/October months and stronger in the summer peak periods.","And so, we have a real opportunity, as we go through this year to restructure our network, to these shoulder periods to actually leverage better growth and unit revenue performance. So I would say that California, we feel very good about. As I shared in my prepared remarks, a lot of the places where we're feeling weakness and pressure, I should say, we have a lot of things coming that we feel are going to significantly strengthen our position.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, great. Yeah, that's very interesting on the seasonality point. I don't even think about it. Thanks, Shane. Thanks, Andrew.","Andrew Harrison","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev, your line is open.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thanks. Thanks for the time, gentlemen. Two questions. Andrew, I guess, first for you. Can you just walk us through when we should start to see a lot of stability in your RASM, and then, I'm guessing 2Q might be tough, just given comparison to the competitive capacity. And what's the goal, which you're trying to get to, I mean, you did a good job of laying out capacity, et cetera, a bit. Are you trying to get RASM up sort of like Southwest is describing? Just how are you thinking about it?","Andrew Harrison","Sorry, Rajeev. I missed the first part of your question specifically to something. And I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?","Rajeev Lalwani","When do you start getting to a level of stability on RASM trends? I'm guessing it's not the second quarter, or maybe it is?","Andrew Harrison","Got it. Yeah, stability, in fact, we're hoping for stability trends as we move into Q2, but really into the back half of the year, where, given all things were equal today, we feel like there should be stability northward trends in our unit revenues going forward, especially if some of the things that we shared earlier start to kick-in. And as I shared earlier too, we're working on all of our schedules right now. We've got better seasonality coming up in the second half, so that's what we're focused on.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. And then, the second part of that question was just, in terms of RASM, do you have a general goal as far as where you want to go? And like Southwest talks about maintaining positive RASM going forward, is that something that you're looking to get to? Or are you approaching it in a different way?","Andrew Harrison","I think, really what we're focused on is profits. And RASM needs to do what it needs to do, costs need to do what they need to do to get to do to get higher returns to our shareholders. So that's really what we're focused on.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. And then, Brendon, a quick one for you on the CASM side. More of a clarification, I guess, as far as the flat to down goal that you laid out, that is based on 4% or so capacity growth and that does or doesn't take into account the flight attendants and the technicians, et cetera?","Brandon Pedersen","Correct on both counts.","Rajeev Lalwani","Thank you.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks, Rajeev.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks, Rajeev.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter, your line is open.","Hunter Keay","Hey, thanks. Good morning, fellows. So you talked about $225 million of synergies originally with this deal, and $175 million of it was on the revenue side. So to look at this commentary about CASMex flat to down in 2019 and 2020. And you said you're going to get a couple hundred million dollars in revenue - in synergies, I think you said this year. And given that 1 point of RASM is only about $70 million, I guess, that implies that we could be sort of leaving 2018 given the deceleration in capacity, on a pretty strong trajectory on RASM if you are, in fact, capturing majority of those synergies on the revenue side, as you laid out in the presentation. Is that fair?","Andrew Harrison","This is Andrew, again. Hunter, I don't have a crystal ball, but I - that's what we see and that's what we believe. And I will also tell you just to say it now that the up sell and segmentation opportunity that we are looking at, that is not in the synergy numbers, and we think that's a $100-plus million a year or more once we get that up and running.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Good. Thank you. And when we think about the 4% capacity growth in 2019, and we'll just focus on 2019, you originally said you were going to be up 6% to 7%. What did you scale back? Was it some new market growth? Was it just a function of a little bit of stage length and some gauge moving around? Did you kill off certain underperforming routes? Or are you just not going to start certain routes you maybe planned on doing? Can you talk us through to the amount - to the extent you can, what changed in the plans specifically?","Andrew Harrison","We have long term plan, and quite frankly when we looked out, if you take the fuel of this last year, the capacity and the economic environment, there were markets that we wanted to continue to invest in, really not new markets but add to some of the core. But the environment has definitely changed, and so we're going to be watching our network and we won't be adding capacity to markets that don't need capacity added. So that's really the major change, but our core network and our footprint is fundamentally where it needs to be for a while.","Brad Tilden","Yeah, Hunter, I might add to that. With all the growth, we've done in last couple of years, we do have the utility that we wanted to get into California. I don't think, we know exactly where the 4% of 2019 or 2020 are going to go, but I think our thinking is that we want to take care of our core. We've got core royal customer basis, economic models that are working very, very well. We're going to sort of bolster those and invest in those, and then we'll see what opportunities happen beyond there. But I think we will pay attention to the core first is what I'm trying to say.","Hunter Keay","Yeah. Thank you all.","Andrew Harrison","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Dan, your line is open.","Dan McKenzie","Hey, good morning. Thanks, guys. I guess first question here is, I'm wondering if you can just help us understand just how big the cost and revenue overhang is from the integration process in the first quarter here? So I think investors are having a hard time connecting the dots on what all these things could really mean to margins, so anything you can share his appreciated. So maybe imagine that you've got a single reservation in place, is the international partners are on the platform, the Airbus aircraft are reconfigured, you didn't have the cost inefficiencies, what might this have meant? What would this potentially mean like for the first quarter here, just for perhaps some perspective?","Brandon Pedersen","Dan, it's Brandon. Can you just repeat your question, just so I can make sure I understand it?","Dan McKenzie","Well, yeah. I'm just trying to get a sense of how big the overhangs, the cost and revenue inefficiencies are in the first quarter here, just by not having a fully integrated airlines. So there is a lot of things that happened after the integration, after April. I'm just trying to get a sense of - investors are kind of having a hard time connecting the dots. I'm just trying to get a sense of what this potentially could mean? What this might - what it could have meant, say, here in the first quarter if the merger have been completed, say, in December?","Brandon Pedersen","Yeah, it's - we haven't quantified it specifically, but what I will say is, we made the comment in the prepared remarks that we do really have all of the costs of the integrated company without all of the revenues. And there are specific costs in - that we will incur that even, frankly, don't get quoted as integration costs that will be in our business through PSS, certainly perhaps through the first half of the year, and those are extra time in our call centers, and extra time in the operations as we kind of put all this stuff together. Is it $50 million? No, is it more than $5 million? Sure. If I had just kind of put a number on it, I might say that there $10 million than the first four months of the year of cost friction, if you will, that will dissipate as the year goes on.","On the revenue side, we have - as Andrew described, the opportunity to unleash a whole bunch of new revenue once we get PSS behind us, starting in late April. And that will start then and continue to grow as we move through the year. And we've talked about it in the context of our revenue synergy opportunity. So there's - you can do some math and kind of figure out what we would've had, had we pulled it forward to, say, January 1. But it's hard to quantify really, but it is real. Your point is right, it is real, and it's one of the opportunities that we see as move into second half of 2018 and 2019 to really improve the financial performance of our business.","Dan McKenzie","Yeah. Thanks, Brendon. And then, Andrew, with respect to your remarks on the embrace of basic economy or something similar, can you elaborate a little bit further on what it's costing you today by not having it? And what could be the timing for any rollout as you move in that direction?","Andrew Harrison","And, Dan, I'll let Shane talk to you more about that.","Shane Tackett","Thanks. Yeah, I think that Andrew mentioned segmentation, obviously, basic of sort of where everybody else has gone. We have modeled the impact. Andrew just mentioned, we think it's north of $100 million once it's fully out and running and sort of optimized, which that would take some time. I would just say, other airlines, I think, it took a year or more to get to market and sort of fully roll it out to every, their network. I think some of them are still expanding it now into international.","And I think we'll go faster than that. We certainly are going to be motivated to be faster than that, but it's not something that's going to hit like Q2, as an example. And I'll just say we haven't decided on what this would look like for us. And it could be something that's like basic, we tend We tend to not do me-toos of sort of the network carriers. Our business is little bit different. It usually doesn't need the same product set. So we're looking forward to being able to talk with you guys in the future call about what this might look like for us.","Dan McKenzie","Okay. Thanks for the time you guys.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks, Shane.","Operator","Your next question comes from the Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie, your line is open.","Jamie Baker","Hey, good morning, everybody. Just a housekeeping question on this 4% growth figure for 2019 and 2020. I'm just trying to understand how new this actually is? I mean, you had already indicated at Investor Day that you were going to be slowing pretty significantly after 2018. So could - whether that's the original figure? Could you give us sort of a genesis of maybe when as opposed to how your reached the new figure?","Brandon Pedersen","Jamie, it's Brandon, hi. We've always talked for the last seven or eight or nine years about growing in the 4% to 8% range as Brad alluded to earlier. We've been on the high side of that.","Andrew last quarter, I think articulated a desire to grow 5% to 6% in 2019. And so, really that change has happened in the last 90 days. And the genesis of the changes are the things that Brad talked about, which is the rising fuel price environment, the additional capacity that we're seeing. And frankly, just we don't see as much opportunity to produce the kinds of returns that we want to.","And so, over the last 90 days as I said, as we thought about 2018, 2019 and 2020, we really wanted to dial it back. It's still on a big base and it's still higher than GDP, but it is the right level for us going forward.","Jamie Baker","Okay, that's perfect clarification. And second, we got a random guide from you for the quarter. Thank you, very much appreciate it. But the industry is starting to pull ahead again, we're starting to see actual earnings guides from airlines. And, look, they may prove wildly inaccurate. Who knows? But just like buybacks and dividends have the additional benefit of acting somewhat as a governor on growth, you could argue that having management beholden to actual earnings guides could also limit maybe some of the riskier competitive behavior that we occasionally see out there.","I kind of feel like a kid that already opened his Christmas present and now he's asking for another one, the first one being random. But have you given this any thought? Once we get a little bit further through, do you think you'd play catch-up once again with the industry? Any thoughts?","Brad Tilden","Baby steps, Jamie, Baby steps.","Jamie Baker","Okay, yeah.","Brad Tilden","In all seriousness, what I would say is - and we did talk about that a lot. And for us, you're right. It's the first time we guide TRASM and we plan to do this going forward. But we really landed on a way of thinking about it where we say, let's guide to what we can control. We've guided on capacity. We've guided on CapEx. We've guided near-term unit revenues, not long-term unit revenues. So I think we're very comfortable guiding to what we control.","And on the rest, we'll respond to what we get in the way that's best for our shareholders.","Jamie Baker","Cool, that's perfect. Thank you, everybody.","Brad Tilden","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. Helane, your line is open.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much, operator. Hi, team, thanks for taking the time here. So, I don't know if Andrew or Brad want to answer this question, but what's the thought behind the growth at Paine Field? And looking at the roots that you're adding, I suppose, you're not expecting connecting traffic there.","Brad Tilden","Hey, hi. Maybe I'll start, we'll get Andrew to weigh in. But I think Paine is roughly 30 miles from Sea-Tac. But for those who live in Seattle, they know the getting from Snohomish County airport to Seattle is very, very difficult. Traffic, there's long delays in the morning. So this is going to be an enormous benefit for our customers that live in the northern part of the city Snohomish County area. I think, Andrew, you'll correct me, but I think it's something like 20% or even more, 22%, 23% of our customers that flying out of Sea-Tac might prefer Paine as an option for them.","So that's some of the thinking behind it. In terms of connectivity, I think we're thinking more Portland than anywhere else, Andrew, but maybe you can elaborate on that.","Andrew Harrison","No, I mean, Brad's pretty much hit it on. I think what it does for us is able to provide more convenient travel for our guests directly. I mean, these are big markets for us that we serve today, and so we're going to serve them in a more convenient way for guests. And it allows us to move capacity around in Sea-Tac for other markets that we want to put metal in because it's getting constrained.","Helane Becker","Got you, okay. I think that was all my questions. I was going to ask a unit-revenue related question on trends, with a peer group seeing up unit revenue and you guys still seeing down unit revenue. But it seems like you're starting to address that - this difference.","Shane Tackett","Yeah, hi, Helane. This is Shane, again. You're absolutely right. We're fully aware of sort of the directionality of the industry and us. And I think we are interested in our sort of absolute revenue performance and what sort of revenue production this company needs to produce the returns we want. And that's what we're committed to figuring out, how to go get in the next several quarters.","Helane Becker","Perfect. Thank you.","Brad Tilden","Thanks, Helane.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon, your line is open.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey, good morning and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for getting me on the call here. I just want to go back to the third quarter call, and I know as we move forward in the integration, you guys are going to talk more and more just about the Alaskan network. But I think there's some lingering fears that the Virgin integration maybe isn't going quite to plan. And we talked about that last quarter.","I think you guys called out some pretty significant revenue underperformance at Virgin. And Andrew, I think you talked about the transcon markets to an earlier question, but can you guys just comment further, how's the revenue dynamic playing out core of Alaska versus core of Virgin? And do you feel you've got the right strategy in place to fix some of those deficiencies?","Andrew Harrison","Yeah, I mean, just to get back on to the third quarter call, I mean, I can't understate enough how inheriting a network on December 17 that has already been scheduled and planned, not done under Ben's operational parameters, not under our normal parameters has been very, very challenging for us.","What you've heard me share on the call, Brandon, is that we view our network in really two pieces. There are same-store sales, which includes Californian and the rest of our network that's been operating for a year and getting that improved, and then our new markets and getting those improved.","I think as we look again into 2018, we look at the international connectivity, we look at these initiatives, the California marketplace specifically will benefit greatly from these changes that are occurring over 2018 and beyond.","Brad Tilden","And I would just add that the California markets as a whole are up materially in load factor year over-year, new markets, inter-Cal, California de-con [ph]. So we're excited about the demand and traffic overall that we're seeing.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. And this next question is going to be a little more difficult I think. If we go back a year in time, I think a lot of investors were benchmarking profitability at that time saying, okay, put a pilot deal and some headwinds in 2018. But then layering the synergies from a much higher earnings level, I mean, just looking at consensus EPS for 2018 back then, and obviously fuel changes and everything else.","But we were talking about an 8-hour handle. Now, we're talking about a 6-hour handle with a lower tax rate. So when looking forward, when you guys are talking about the synergies in the deal, should we be thinking the level of profitability that we're modeling this year is the right basis from which to now be adding the deal synergies? Or should we be thinking, hey, what was attainable a year ago, given a little bit of time and ability to catch up on fuel, we should be back to that level of profitability?","Brandon Pedersen","Brandon, it's Brandon. The only thing I can say to that, because I actually don't know the answer to your question is that we are focused on delivering adequate returns to our shareholders. And this is an extraordinarily dynamic industry with lots of competitive capacity that comes in, it comes out, labor markets move, plans change. So what I would say is that it's hard to say what was then versus what was now. What I can say is where we are now is not a place we want to be and we're looking to improve the results going forward.","Brandon Oglenski","Appreciate it.","Brad Tilden","Thanks, Brandon.","Operator","Your next question comes from Susan Donofrio with Macquarie Capital. Susan, your line is open.","Susan Donofrio","Yes, hello, gentlemen.","Brandon Pedersen","Hi, Susan.","Brad Tilden","Good morning.","Susan Donofrio","Just wanted to touch-base on the employee side, I'm just wondering what you're doing to smooth out and just make sure that the two cultures are blending together?","Ben Minicucci","Good morning, Susan. It's Ben. Well, just to start, our people and culture are something we cherish a lot at Alaska. And Virgin had a great - has a great culture. And if you remember, what we said last time, and one of the things we did first was align on the purpose of our airline, which is creating an airline people love, and then we reestablished the values of the airlines. So one of the things we are doing is making sure that every 23,000 of us at Alaska, Horizon Air Group are living our purpose in both.","That's the one thing i.e., get your culture aligned. The second thing we're doing is we're getting leaders out in the operation. We are out a lot. Our frontline leaders are out a lot, talking about the importance of coming together as one team, as a new Alaska under - just coming together and focusing on just running the best airline we can. And I think we're making progress.","We've been out the last couple of weeks. We're going to be out the next two weeks. And we have a steady cadence of communication and getting out with folks.","Susan Donofrio","Terrific. And then just a follow up just on the overall merger. You had spoken before about just some an extra cost related to like res agents, et cetera, just explaining things that you didn't expect are those cost starting to abate now that you're getting more well known in your market?","Brandon Pedersen","Susan, it's Brandon. Yeah, I think so. A lot of that cost really comes as a result of transition, whether it's transition, moving people from a Virgin flight to an Alaska flight or transition because of changes in our loyalty program as we move people from Elevate into Mileage Plan. And by the way, I'd like to thank our res folks and our customer service agents, because they've had to deal with the lion's share of this. But that does go away. And once we get through PSS, I think it's safe to say that the vast majority of that will have been abated.","Susan Donofrio","Great. And then just an unrelated follow-up. Can you just comment on the Hawaiian market, and just what you're seeing there right now?","Andrew Harrison","Yeah, Susan, this is Andrew again. We don't like to comment specifically on regions. But we have been in that market 10 years now. We've got it finally tuned and we're very happy with how we're running and operating that today.","Susan Donofrio","Terrific. Thank you.","Brad Tilden","Okay. I guess, our team is telling us that Susan had the last question. We want to thank you all for tuning in. We look forward to chatting with you next quarter.

Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Investor Relations, Lavanya Sareen.","Lavanya Sareen - Managing Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Joana. Hey, good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Alaska Air Group's third quarter 2015 earnings call.","On the call today our CEO, Brad Tilden, will provide an overview of the business, our Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Harrison, will share the revenue results for the third quarter and outlook for the rest of the year, and then Brandon Pedersen, our CFO, will discuss our financial results and our capital allocation plans. Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.","Our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations. Several risk factors could cause actual results to differ from our expectations. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings.","During the call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as unit costs excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a third quarter GAAP profit of $274 million. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio, Air Group reported a record adjusted net income of $277 million. This was ahead of First Call lean estimate of $2.10 per share and higher than our last year's adjusted net income of $200 million, or $1.47 per share.","We've included additional information about cost expectations, capacity plans, capital expenditures, and other items in our earnings release and investor update filed this morning.","So now, I'll turn the call over to Brad.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Hey, thanks, Lavanya, and good morning, everyone. Lavanya just shared the numbers. I thought I would take a minute as we enter the fourth quarter to sort of look back and measure ourselves against the things that we set out to do at the beginning of the year. And as you know, we've got three strong quarters behind us now and 2015 is shaping up to be a really good year on almost all fronts.","First, we are operating safely and reliably. Second, our employees are engaged and our team of 15,000 people is providing our customers with great experiences every day and on every flight. Third, we are growing our customer base. Our Mileage Plan members and our Alaska Airlines credit card holders are both growing at record rates. Fourth, we're successfully entering new markets. We've entered 10 new markets thus far this year, creating new, diverse, and profitable revenue streams.","And fifth, finally, we believe we're doing the right things for our owners. We have not only strong profitability, but also excellent cash flow from operations, an extremely strong balance sheet, and a commitment to shareholder-friendly stewardship and capital allocation that's been demonstrated over many years now.","In this industry, all of us know that there are always things to lose sleep over and we all do plenty of that. But we believe the first nine months of 2015 have been very solid. We believe that this new competition we're dealing with is making us better, and we believe that our competitive position today is very strong.","Our $442 million pre-tax profit for the quarter equates to a pre-tax margin of 29.2%, which is 740 basis points higher than last year. In fact, this quarterly profit is larger than all but four of the annual profits we've produced in our 83-year history. We expect our margin performance to lead the U.S. industry this quarter and to also be better than about 90% of the companies in the S&P 500. Our ROIC for the trailing 12 months is 24.2% and that's driven by higher revenues, by strong non-fuel cost performance, and by a large benefit from lower fuel costs.","Despite continued competition, 2015 is shaping up to be a year of record profitability. Pre-tax income for the first nine months of the year is over $1 billion, or about $130 million higher than our full year result for last year. And year-to-date cash flow from operations is $1.2 billion, which is enabling us to reinvest in the business and return a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders. Brandon will talk more about this in a moment.","In the first half of the year, investors worried about the industry's ability to capture the benefit of lower fuel prices. Today, we are capturing two-thirds of this benefit and those savings are flowing directly back to our shareholders. If you look back over the last several years, we have successfully adjusted our business to many changes: to higher fuel in 2008, to a steep recession in 2009, to an unprecedented competitive incursion in 2013 and to a lower fuel price environment this year.","Not only have we raised our margin profile, but we have been an industry leader consistently through these changes. This speaks to our team's ability to quickly adjust to changes in the economic environment. We're building a business that works throughout the cycle, that is sustainable and that creates value for all of our stakeholders.","Operationally the third quarter was challenging with high loads and record traffic flowing through our airports. Continued runway construction in Seattle and Los Angeles added additional complexity. But our people did a great job rising to the challenge and running a strong operation.","For the first nine months of the year we completed an industry-leading 99.6% of our flights, and 86.4% of those flights in the third quarter arrived on time. That on-time percentage is the highest percentage of the U.S. airlines with the exception of Hawaiian. And as you know our team generates these strong results with aggressive block times.","And last our people take pride in taking care of our customers and offering them genuine and caring service. 6,500 of our front-line employees have completed our Beyond Service workshops thus far this year.","We're also making investments in our product. Earlier this month we garnered national media attention for becoming the launch customer for Boeing Space Bins. These new bins will allow us to carry up to 57 additional bags on each 737-900ER, and that's a 50% increase in bag space.","And our year-to-date customer satisfaction score of 86% is a new record. Our customer satisfaction has improved an average of 2 percentage points each year since we first began tracking this data eight years ago. This continuous improvement reflects our thinking around everything we do. While 2% might seem nominal, the compounding over the last seven years has allowed us to improve our score dramatically and create a durable competitive advantage.","I talked with you last year about a series of workshops we ran with our leadership team, where we asked them to shoulder more of the responsibility for running the company. This year we are taking this a step further, and we're working with these same folks to enhance our high performance culture. To us this means three things. First, not shying away from setting high standards and tough goals. Second, getting to decisions quickly without compromising quality. And third, leveraging our culture and becoming expert at executing projects and delivering results.","Looking ahead we're just now putting the finishing touches on our 2016 plan, and we look forward to sharing some of the details of this plan with you at our Investor Day, which will be in New York City on December 3.","As I close I'd like to thank our employees for just a terrific quarter. We have a fantastic group of front line employees who are fully engaged and a leadership team that is both talented and dedicated. All of these folks are working together like never before.","And with that I'd like to turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everybody. Our third quarter revenue performance was solid. And we were able to sustain high load factors while increasing capacity 8.2%. We grew passenger revenue by $48 million or 3.8%, despite competitive capacity increasing 13% in our markets.","While strong demand in summer months is not surprising, we were pleased with our year-over-year change in PRASM for the month of September. It was 40 basis points better than August, despite year-over-year change in capacity for September being 250 basis points higher than August. This strength, despite Labor Day moving further into the fall, which resulted in lost traffic as the majority of school children in Washington State had returned to class by Labor Day this year.","In the third quarter we continued to grow and diversify our revenue by adding more new markets to our network. We've added 15 markets since the beginning of Q3 2014. And about half of those new markets were added in the last quarter. 75% of new markets are not only profitable, but generating returns in excess of our cost of capital, some of them achieving this level of profitability within six months of launch. This is unprecedented for Alaska Airlines and has been possible given our foundation of low cost, powerful Pacific Northwest network, global loyalty program, award-winning customer service, and industry-leading operation. But specifically four key areas helped us deliver the solid Q3 results.","First, our strategy of adding non-stop service to destinations our frequent flyers previously flew from our hubs with one or more stops on other carriers. This is creating new and profitable revenue streams. About 40% of seats on our new flights are filled with Mileage Plan members, which is in line with our system average for mature routes. This demonstrates strong support for our brand and natural demand for our new non-stop markets.","Second, we added Embraer 175s into our fleet this quarter, allowing us to enter markets too thin for 737s to serve profitably and too far for the Q400s. All three E175 markets are exceeding expectations with very high load factors consistently near 90% and achieving profitability in their first quarter of operation.","Third, our cost profile continues to improve, while our competitors are seeing their costs increase. For the 12 months ended June 2015 our non-fuel unit costs have come down about 2%, while the industry's costs have increased 1.4%. This is an important sustainable advantage for Alaska.","Fourth, the tremendous loyalty we enjoy in the Pacific Northwest continues to support our expansion into new markets. Active members in our loyalty program are up 15% for the third consecutive quarter this year, active credit card accounts are up 11%, both ahead of our passenger growth of 9%, with these rates being historic records for Alaska.","Greater network reach improves our scheduled utility and drives greater customer affinity for our brand. To that end, we entered a new codeshare and frequent flyer agreement with Icelandair last month, adding service to over 20 European cities for our customers. The agreement with Icelandair features reciprocal lounge access, priority check-in and boarding for late customers, and builds on our previously-announced frequent flyer partnership with Hainan Airlines.","Our foreign flag partners are putting 1,100 passengers today on our network. With premier global foreign flag partners that fly out of Seattle, including British Airways, Emirates, Hainan Airways, and Korean Airways, our members enjoy tremendous choices in both main and premium cabin service across the globe. Our partnerships are helping us create both a national and global network for our customers.","We want to congratulate American for smoothly transitioning all U.S. airway flights into the combined American airline system this past weekend. A monumental task, to say the least. For Alaska, this means our customers now have access to a 50% larger network with 2,900 additional daily flights on which to earn and redeem miles. This is very exciting for us, and there is more to come as we continue to expand the number of flights that American and Alaska market for each other.","For the third quarter, American put about 5,000 passengers per day on our network, a 10% increase over Q3 of last year. The benefit that Alaska provides to its partners is valuable local and connecting traffic for their international flights and additionally for American, greater West Coast utility for their customers.","And lastly, for the third quarter, we added 12% more regional seats into and out of Seattle and, as a result, have seen connecting passengers over Seattle increase 15%. Our feed-in network is helping support our Seattle markets, both core and new. This demonstrates the resilience of our network in the Pacific Northwest.","Looking ahead, there's some important facts to highlight with respect to capacity in our markets. So let me start with our own capacity. We expect Q4 capacity to be up 12.5%. About half of that growth is driven by longer stage and larger gauge, another 2 points by new markets, with the remaining 4.5 points being additions to existing markets where there continues to be strong demand. This brings our full year capacity growth to just over 10% and in line with previous guidance.","We are very pleased with our forward load factor for October, down only 0.8 point. It's actually up 0.5 point for November and flat for December.","Looking at our Q1 2016 capacity, it's expected to be up 13%, which is the high watermark of the year and will decline over subsequent quarters. The vast majority of our new market growth for 2016 will start this year with seven markets this past quarter and another 11 in the fourth quarter.","Moving to competitive capacity, as we look at published schedules, we expect Q4 competitive capacity to be up 7%, Q1 of 2016 to be up 15%, and then Q2 of 2016 moderating back to 8%. We've heard some concerns around the increase in the first quarter competitive capacity and wanted to share some color.","First, 40% of the incremental competitive ASMs in the first quarter are driven by the annualization of markets added by competitors in the second half of 2015. In fact, there are only three new markets being launched in the first quarter of 2016 in our network, which is Boise-Sacramento, Seattle-Victoria and a once-weekly service from LA to Sun Valley.","Second, new competitive markets launched in the second half of this year are materially smaller as measured by passengers per day each way versus previously-launched markets. In fact, the average size of the impacted market is 50% smaller compared to the same period last year. Competitive capacity moderates in the second quarter of 2016, which is the seasonally stronger demand period.","We believe that strong demand in Seattle, the loyalty of our customers, industry-leading margins and return on invested capital of over 20% warrant investment in our business and, therefore, we expect to grow about 8% on a consolidated basis in 2016. That 8% can be broken down into 1 point related to gauge, 1.5 points related to growth in stage length, and then the remaining 5.5 points driven by departures.","Continued investment in our network and product while driving unit costs lower and growing profits is important for us. This enables us to continue delivering value to our customers and shareholders. We are working diligently to strengthen our commercial engine, and we will share specifics of our 2016 revenue strategy at our upcoming Investor Day on December 3.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Thanks, Andrew. Hey, everyone. Air Group's adjusted net profit improvement of 39% coupled with the 6% reduction in shares outstanding drove our Q3 earnings per share of 47%. Trailing 12-month after-tax return on invested capital stands at 24.2% and is 700 basis points higher than at this point last year.","As Brad said, our pre-tax margin also improved by more than 700 basis points to 29.2%. This marks our third consecutive quarter of 700 basis point plus improvement. We expect our margin performance to lead the industry this quarter.","We earned $442 million before taxes, a $122 million or 38% increase. Traffic was up nearly 8%, contributing to a $50 million increase in revenues. Economic fuel declined by $150 million and non-fuel operating costs climbed by $82 million or 11%. On a unit basis, non-fuel costs increased by 2.5%.","Our cost performance was significantly better than our initial guidance, driven by a favorable outcome on certain property tax assessments, a shift in maintenance and advertising initially planned for Q3 into Q4, and good cost performance throughout the business as people continue to focus on productivity and embrace our culture of frugality. I want to give a shout out to our tax team for doing a fantastic job ensuring that our property tax assessments were fair.","Looking forward, we expect non-fuel unit costs to decrease about 1% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we now expect to report non-fuel unit cost reduction of about 0.6%, slightly better than the guidance we've been providing most of the year. This would make 2015 the sixth year in a row of unit cost reduction for Air Group and the 13th year out of the last 14 years for mainline. We'll end this year with our lowest cost structure ever, which is another way of saying our competitive advantage has never been greater.","As we've been developing the 2016 plan, we've been talking internally about the notion of \"good costs\" and \"bad costs.\" An example of a good cost is employee incentive pay, which has paid an average of about a full month's pay over the last five years. This year should be no different based on current trends and a great result for our employees who have worked hard to meet safety, operational and financial goals set out in the plans. We've already accrued $90 million to-date, 7% more than at this time last year.","We're planning to share our initial 2016 cost guidance at Investor Day in December. Our cost plan will reflect the excellent visibility and stability we have around our labor costs because our largest employee groups have contracts in place until at least 2018.","As I alluded to earlier, our results reflect the significant decline in economic fuel costs. Our price per gallon was down 42% to $1.82, the lowest price yet this year. Importantly, our fuel efficiency continues to improve. Year-to-date, the mainline fleet is 2.9% more efficient than last year on an ASM per gallon basis. This will just continue to get better as we retire our 737-400 fleet over the next two years. Fuel prices are low, but they won't be low forever, and this remains an important source of competitive advantage for us.","During the first nine months of the year, we generated $1.2 billion in operating cash flows, an increase of $337 million over the first nine months of last year. We've invested $650 million into the business this year, most of that into our fleet. We've taken delivery of eight Boeing 737-900ERs so far this year and have three more scheduled in the fourth quarter.","Next year is a particularly busy year for our fleet and maintenance teams with 19 new deliveries, 14 lease returns, and the start of our initiative to modify three 737-700s into freighters. By the end of 2017, we'll welcome 34 more 737-900ERs and our first MAX, or about one per day on average \u2013 or excuse me, one per month on average. That's a lot of CapEx otherwise.","However, most of these deliveries support our plan to retire the 737-400 fleet in that period and so our mainline fleet should only grow by about nine units from where it is today. The Boeing 737 is a fabulous airplane for our network. Boeing is a great company to work with and our partnership with them could not be stronger.","We've produced more than $560 million of free cash flow so far this year and have aggressively returned much of that to our shareholders. So far this year, we've repurchased 5.6 million shares of our common stock for $381 million or more than 4% of the shares that were outstanding at the start of the year, utilizing both the prior $650 million authorization and the new $1 billion share repurchase authorization announced in August.","We've paid out $78 million in dividends, bringing total capital return this year to $460 million. Our dividend yield is just over 1% and it's the highest among North American airlines that pay a regular dividend.","We're on track to return about $600 million to our owners in 2015, 43% more than our initial target. Our investment-grade balance sheet is in a net cash position and we have no required pension funding, so we expect that we'll continue to deploy our substantial free cash flow back to our shareholders.","We're building a high quality business and I want to share three examples of how ALK compares to other well-run companies, financially speaking. First, we expect our 24% ROIC over the last 12 months to be among the top 10 industrials in the S&P 500 and in the top 50 of the index overall. Second, our free cash flow yield of 6.2% based on consensus is 60% higher than the average and better than 75% of all the companies in the S&P 500. And third, the 4% of our stock that we've repurchased so far this year is about twice as much as an average S&P 500 company.","We're working hard to make sure that these great financial results are sustainable. But just as importantly, our employees are safe, they're running a great operation, and they're taking great care of our customers, which really is the foundation of our financial success, and we appreciate all their efforts.","And with that, let's open it up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julie A. Yates-Stewart - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Hey, Julie.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Hi, Julie.","Julie A. Yates-Stewart - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Based on the other calls it seems the rest of the industry is seeing some sequential improvement in unit revenues in Q4. And I realize you guys don't give unit revenue guidance, but can you offer any perspective on whether you at Alaska would expect to also see this dynamic, despite the increase in capacity growth in the fourth quarter?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Hi, Julie. It's Andrew. You're right. We don't give fourth quarter guidance, because the CFO won't let me. But other than that I would just go back to the remarks that I shared, which is our advance book load factor, where we even have positive gap in November and December is flat on top of our capacity growth. So we aren't seeing any change in the demand environment. If anything it continues to be very robust here in Seattle.","Julie A. Yates-Stewart - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then with the 11 new markets in the fourth quarter though, does that impact it as you have some introductory pricing in those markets?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","We always do. But I think you touch on something that I think is important for me to clarify. I mean if you look at the fourth quarter where we're up 12.5%, 9 points of that is in trans-con, mid-con and the Pacific Northwest, Hawaii, where we've been doing very, very well.","And in fact when we talk about new markets, what we're really looking at is markets today that have either no non-stop service or very little non-stop service. So whether it's Milwaukee, Oklahoma City, Raleigh-Durham, Costa Rica, Nashville, Portland, Austin, all of these new markets fit very well with our network and bringing good solid revenues in. So that's why we have good confidence with that.","Julie A. Yates-Stewart - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Excellent. Thank you.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Thanks, Julie.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Thank you.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Hey, Joe.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Brandon, I think there was some concern \u2013 or maybe Brad \u2013 there was some concern earlier in the year as the capacity guidance ticked up throughout the year. But can you just talk a little bit about how that additional capacity has translated into some of the additional cash that you've returned to shareholders?","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. Joe, it's Brad. Maybe I'll jump into that. I think what I would just simply say is what's \u2013 in Seattle what we see is quite a strong economy. We are adding. We're growing. We're taking delivery of these new airplanes. We're putting them into markets. As Andrew sort of suggested, many of these markets are doing great right out of the gate. Andrew, I can't remember the exact figure you quoted, but 75% are early in their life producing returns that cover our cost of capital.","So I think the simple answer to your question is yes, this is good new growth. We're producing returns as a company that are far in excess of our cost of capital. And this is helping us with our substantial returns to the owners of the company.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then for Brandon, just on the CASM trend going forward. Is there any inflation in your CASM associated with kind of addressing the competitive environment there? And maybe you're investing more than you otherwise would, and that starts to get better as the competitive pressures start to level off a bit?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","I don't know that I would call it inflation necessarily. But what I would say is, is that we've done a lot to invest in our product. And ultimately at the end of the day customers choose your service because you operate well and you've got great people on board and you've got great product. And we want to make sure that our product is as good as it can be. And so we are investing into food and beverage, we are investing in some of the training initiatives that we've talked about. I wouldn't necessarily call it inflation. I would call it intentional investment into what customers see every day.","Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Hey, Hunter.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Good morning, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","So your lost bags were up like 34% in the recent period \u2013 I forgot the period, but it was up a lot. And presumably that's because you're giving away more of these checked bags for free with the credit card. So, Brandon, you talked about bad costs. Are you going to have to maybe spend some money to address that problem? That's part one of the question.","And part two, if this feeds into a bigger membership base for when you recut your credit card deal, how should we think about the magnitude of that in relation to the roughly $50 million benefit you got when you did the deal with BofA a couple years ago? Thanks.","Benito Minicucci - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, Operations","Hunter, it's Ben. I'll take the first question on the bag performance. We had a rough quarter on mishandled bags, and the operations folks own that. We are not happy with how we performed. We actually have an initiative right now and going into 2016 to get our mishandled bags right in line. I don't want to put the cause on the free bag with a credit card. That is us to perform at the levels that I know we can perform.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","And, Hunter, in terms of if we were to renegotiate our bank card deal, I mean whatever is in the base is in the base. So I just think the economics get better across the board.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","In terms of free bags is in the base is what I mean to say.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, I got you. I guess I was just trying to get to it. I think you said there were a lot more members. 75 \u2013 what is it? 40% of your seats are filled by Mileage Plan members or something. So I'm assuming the number of people that have credit cards and these Mileage Plan numbers are improving in volume, which would lead one to conclude that you get more than $50 million when you re-cut this credit card deal, whenever that would be. But anyway. Okay, so yes, whatever. Asked and answered, right?","Okay. So how do you think about competition? You talked a lot about competitive capacity in the context of where your passengers buy their tickets. So would you be \u2013 in an all else equal situation, would you be generally more protective of keeping passengers that live in your core origination market, as it relates specifically to how you manage your inventory? As opposed to customers on your planes that maybe originate in your destination markets? Does that change the way you think about managing your inventory?","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Yeah. Hunter, I might start, and then I'm going to turn it over to a new personality on the call. But sure. I mean the way we would look at our network is we have incredible strength in the state of Alaska, in Washington State, in Oregon, and considerable strength in California. And to the extent we have competition in those markets, a lot of these results that you see are the results of the loyal customer base, the flight schedule, everything we're doing out of these markets. So for sure we would want to work hard for originating traffic out of those hubs, out of those regions and protect what we have here.","In terms of your second question I want to introduce a new personality. Shane Tackett is our Vice President of Revenue Management. Shane has been with the company a long time. Fifteen years, Shane? Or...","Shane R. Tackett - Vice President-Revenue Management, Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Yeah.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Shane has worked in our corporate real estate group. He spent a long time at financial planning and analysis. He did a terrific job in labor relations. He's the one that helped us get many of these deals that we have today. And now, he's running revenue management. So Shane will \u2013 there's your introduction.","Shane R. Tackett - Vice President-Revenue Management, Alaska Airlines, Inc.","Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everybody. Hey, I'll add just a little bit to what Brad said. We are sort of keenly focused on making sure we retain sort of the loyalty of the customers and our work. And so, we're very strategic about what competitors are doing, what fares they're offering and you'll find that we're competitive across the board. We're not interested in building our base of strength. I think in terms of outside of Seattle-Anchorage, some of the core parts of our network, we actually have been doing a little bit better in terms of focusing on getting originating passengers off of the core network.","One place that we've done a good job over the last 12 months is Salt Lake City where we started struggling a little bit out of the gate in terms of load factor. We put a lot of energy into it as a commercial team and we've seen those load factors come up nearly to our system average. So, we'll do more of that as the network gets broader and more complex, but I think we're doing a great job and most of that is to the credit of my team down in RM.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Hi, Savi.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. On the margin commentary that you made, stepping back, I was curious what your thoughts were? I mean, historically and you continue to have a leadership position on the margin versus the industry. Maybe what drives that and how do you maintain that? Or how do you think about margins longer term? Is it versus in relation to ROIC? Or how should we think about margins? I know right now fuel has been a big tailwind, but as we look forward as fuel recovering somewhat maybe and with the competitive landscape much changed.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Good morning, Savi. It's Brandon. Maybe I'll start with that. It's actually a good question and it's one that we're thinking a lot about right now. Back a decade or so ago when we set out a goal of having a 10% margin, it was viewed as sort of aspirational in nature certainly by others in the industry and we worked hard to get there and our 10% margin was directly connected to an ROIC goal.","What I will say is that the industry is much different now than it was then \u2013 structurally, revenue environment, the competition in Seattle. And so it's really fair to say that 10% or $0.10 on the dollar as we talked about internally is probably not a relevant place to be over the long term. On the other hand, we're at a 29% margin for the quarter, 23% on a rolling 12 basis among the top three in the industry, typically behind Spirit and Allegiant. Congratulations to those guys. They're doing very well.","But that's probably not sustainable either both because as you say, fuel will recover, but I think just in the context of where airlines as a mature industry that's healthy are going to be, it's probably going to look more like industrials broadly than as a real outlier like it is today. So it's a really good question. It's one I don't have a great answer for, but I suppose what I've done is maybe set out the goalposts on each side, and the right answer is probably somewhere in between.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Savi, I might sort of jump onto that as well. It is something we're spending time on right now just to make sure we understand where our profitability comes from so that we can sustain it. I think a lot of our margin performance comes from our low-cost structure. I mean, just simply said, our costs, as Brandon said, they've been down 13 of the last 14 years. We did restructure this company outside of bankruptcy. We sit here today with a low-cost position, and Brandon, you know the exact numbers, I don't. But I think we're something like 20% lower CASM ex-fuel than the mainline airlines, and we're just a little bit higher than the LTCs.","So part of that low-cost structure gives us margin, part of that low-cost structure gives us the ability to offer our low fares. I think a second big thing that sort of leads to our margin performance is customer preference. Our customers do like to fly with Alaska Air Group. They like to fly with Alaska, with Horizon. And some of that's the fare, but a lot of that's the service. So I sort of think those two things.","And then you might say, well, okay, you've got a low-cost structure, where did that come from? And there's lots of answers to that. But anyway, I guess I just want to simply say that I think the low-cost structure is a very, very important part of our margin advantage.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you. And just more for the near-term question. On ancillary revenue on a per passenger basis, it seems like you might lag some of your peers on that front. Is that by choice and you get it more on the base fare? Or is there opportunity on the ancillary revenue side?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Savi, it's Andrew. I think we're down about 2.8% and I think what you're seeing right now is sort of a transition period. As you know, we've gone out with free bags on the first bag fee. But we've also seen massive increases in our loyalty membership, credit-card holding. So, our goal and we continue to be focused on getting to be more industry average on our ancillary revenues as far as the big network carriers go.","And as you've heard from Shane a little bit, his team is also very focused on first-class cabin and continuing to, as we invest in the product there, continue to achieve the premium and the first-class load factors that we also need. Even if it's sell off at the gate and the preferred seating we've launched this year. All of these things together we think are going to continue to work well, but we just need a little bit more time after the first free bag adjustment.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Helpful. All right. Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, Savi.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for the time. First question, just on Seattle. It seems like the demand has been incredibly strong there. How do you get confident that capacity growth from others won't stay elevated just given that dynamic as we look forward?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Rajeev, it's Andrew. It's hard to predict the future. But what I will tell you as I look at our COO here that the room at the inn is getting very tight. If you take out morning banks between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. and our evening banks bags between 20:00-22:00, they seem full, completely full. And we're already having to move our network around because we have a sizable network to accommodate. So while I don't know what the future holds, what I do know is that I think we're going to see it slow. And in my prepared remarks, the size of the new markets that competitors are coming into are getting smaller and smaller and smaller. So we've learned to adjust in this environment. And so I don't have huge concerns that we will be continuing to be able to adjust as we move forward.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Rajeev, Brandon here. Maybe I'll add one other thought on that. We tried to build our business to withstand competition. We've seen it over the last three years to be sure. But our mindset is that there's always going to be competition in our market. This is an extremely competitive industry. But for the reason that we just talked about with Savi, I think this company has been successful and will continue to be successful because of the great service that we provide, the excellent operation that we run and our low-cost structure. So, I think we'll be fine.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, that's great color, gentlemen. And just a quick one for you, Brandon. In terms of the capital allocation, I think you've been paying down a little bit of debt this year, and correct me if I'm wrong there. But just thoughts going forward. Are you going to maybe continue to do that? Or is it \u2013 is all the cash flow going to go exclusively to shareholders?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Yeah. Any debt paydown that we've done has been just paying normal maturities. We've got an awesome balance sheet right now, and we don't have any specific initiative to pay down more debt because we're already in a very substantial net cash position. I think what I'm saying is that the strong free cash flow that we're generating is for the most part going to get deployed back to our shareholders, just like it has been over the last nine months or so.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, Team Alaska.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Thank you.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","As it relates to the American coach here and accepting that American doesn't have a Northwestern Pacific gateway, but they do still have a fairly respectable presence of their own at West. My assumption has been that your relationship with American won't fully replace what was once the high level of revenue cooperation with Delta. Is that the way that you see it?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Good morning, Jamie. It's Andrew. I'd say a couple of things. We're focused on really two aspects our partners and ourselves, and I think if you look at the dynamics and we will share with you at Investor Day much more visibility in where we are today with all of our alliance partners and the traffic. So look forward to that. We're finding that we're basically \u2013 American as I shared in my comments, up 10%, but we're also finding a lot of traffic coming back onto our network and so really the way we look at it is growing the overall traffic. And so we're using our own network and our own expanded network as well as American and their expanded network to net, net be better off. And that's how we're looking today and that's where we want to keep moving forward.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just secondly, and this is a housekeeping item. You cited your view that you're retaining about two-thirds of fuel's lower benefit. And I'm just curious as to the methodology you used there. Are you simply looking at year-on-year fuel savings and comparing it to the year-on-year change in EBIT? Or is it something more complex and proprietary than that?","Lavanya Sareen - Managing Director-Investor Relations","Hey, Jamie, this is Lavanya. Nothing more proprietary than that. Just bringing it to the bottom line and how much fuel prices have come down.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Perfect. We come up with the same figure. I just didn't know if there was a way to build a better mousetrap. So, okay. Thanks so much, everybody.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Thanks, Jamie.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Hey. I guess two questions. I actually \u2013 I think both for Andrew. Andrew, you talked about connections in Seattle up 15% and I sort of think Seattle historically just based on how it's positioned would probably see a lot more local traffic historically than connect with the exception of some of the international. Where is that split now when you look at your traffic in Seattle connect versus local? And where could that go? It's never going to be a Chicago like 50\/50, but where could that potentially go, especially given the significant amount of new flights coming from the international carriers?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah. I think a couple of things and I honestly I don't \u2013 and maybe we can follow up, but I don't have a scientific split for you right in front of me on that whole question as it relates to the flow and the local. But the way I look at it is, especially on the domestic side, for our network good, solid local demand. Where we have capacity that's coming in that's maybe incremental and that's where Shane and his team can use our expanded regional network to bring traffic in from our Montanas, Washingtons, Oregons and Alaska to help fill those additional seats.","I think what's really exciting on the international front, to your point is, Seattle relative to New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, demand is way, way smaller and so the feed is imperative for these international carriers and partners of ours. And so what we're seeing, number one, is our own members with our partners choosing to fly on our international partners and then we're using our network, including all of our new markets, to help bring traffic to the West Coast through their international network and beyond.","So overall all these pieces have been working well for us. And we have a lot of refining to do. We have more things to do, but we're feeling very good about that.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then the second one, and maybe this is just more of sort of a footnote. But the partnership that you have with United, is that just limited to a few club rooms? Is that all that is?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah. I mean we have interline with United. Maybe what you're referring to is there has been changes in our lounge agreements. And we won't be partnering with Delta in our lounges anymore. But we have a new agreement globally with American. And so we've got about five club rooms where we're using United to help supplement out our lounge system, and so that's really what you're seeing.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you for the time. So you guys, I noticed in the press release today you talked about new routes out of Portland. And I know that airport tends to be somewhat underutilized. Is that something we should think about going forward, that Portland is going to be an increasingly more relevant to the route network?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Helane, good morning. It's Andrew. Yeah I think obviously Portland is extremely important to us, so well over 120 plus flights a day. And what we're seeing with the strength of our cost performance and our lower cost performance and our rule of thumb is Portland's always half the demand of Seattle. We're seeing opportunity with our cost structure and new aircraft, especially the 175, to grow Portland. So you see in the first quarter we've got Portland-Minne [Minneapolis], we've got Portland-Kansas City, Portland-Omaha. So I think you'll see us continue to grow Portland as we move forward.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","So those routes that you just mentioned are being flown with 175s?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yes, I believe so. Yeah.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Okay. And then my other question, I think, Brad, you talked about those new Space Bins, and the fact that you can carry more bags on them. How do you monetize that for us, for your shareholders \u2013 or for yourselves actually? How do you get paid for having those extra bags on board? Because you're not charging your frequent flyers for the checked bag. And it seems like putting all those extra bags on board will just slow the boarding process down. And you already have a pretty tight turn time. So how are we supposed to think about those bags coming on board? And how it winds up measuring up to your high expectations for yourselves?","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Helane, that's a hard question, so I'm going to ask Ben to answer that.","Benito Minicucci - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, Operations","Hi, Helane.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, Ben.","Benito Minicucci - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, Operations","Helane, most airlines today, we struggle with carry-on bags. And the problem with airplanes today, on 737-800 with 150 people, we have maybe 120, 130 carry-on bags. There's at least 10 to 20 on every flight that don't fit. So we have a process to try and manage carry-on bags on every flight. They get lined up in the jet way, and they've got to get taken down downstairs. These are legal carry-on bags. These are not bags that people will normally check.","So what we've done \u2013 what the bigger bins will actually do is actually speed up the boarding process, have people bring their bags in. Instead of us having to create a process where, after we check in \u2013 or we on 110 people, we start tagging bags and putting them on the jet way for our rampers to come pick them up. So operation wise this is going to be a massive, massive help and help our operation.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","And, Helane, just on that, I mean Ben is talking about already regulation carry onboard bags. So these were coming on anyway. It's just that he's not having to take them downstairs. And one thing that \u2013 and I think we've shared this in the past, that we are very aware of obviously what the bag fees generate for our business. But that's not something that \u2013 bag fees, there's different views on those. We are investing in additional or ancillary products that our customers want to pay for, really enjoy. So our preferred seating is an example, our buy onboard products and other things as we invest in our business. Those are the things that we are looking to increase the revenue per ship versus bag fee revenue.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Okay. Thanks very much. Those were my two questions.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Thanks, Helane.","Benito Minicucci - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, Operations","Thanks, Helane.","Operator","Your next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Hey, thanks for taking the question and squeezing me in here. Just curious, my model on a quarterly basis only goes back to 2006. When is the last time that Alaska has grown consolidated capacity 13%?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Off the top of my head I don't know. I'm pretty sure \u2013 well we've been growing it double-digit per quarter in many quarters. First and second quarter were all double-digit growth and in previous years. Actual 13%? Off the top of my head, but it's certainly within a point or two of what we've done many, many times over the past few years. That's just off the top of my head (50:26).","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","And, Duane, Lavanya pulled some data for us just in the last couple of days. We have \u2013 so 13% is the high watermark. We plan to grow 8% next year for the year. And we've actually grown 7.2% ASMs I think is what you told us, Lavanya, for the last five years. We've grown 7% on average for the last 20 years. So next year's growth is \u2013 on an annual basis is right in line with \u2013 a little bit high, given what's happening in Seattle. But basically in line with what we have been doing. I mean it is what it is. It's a little high in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, but there's no difference in our thinking about next year as compared to other years.","Lavanya Sareen - Managing Director-Investor Relations","Duane, just to add to that, if you sort of dissected that by five-year increments, you would find that it's essentially about 7% in every five-year increment. So it's interesting to see that. And next year we're right in the ballpark of what we've said for the long term, which is between 4% and 8%.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","I appreciate that. I guess, we started this year at 8% and are ending at 11%. So maybe you can just help us understand what changed over the course of the year, how the thought process changed? What's actually driving 13% right now? Maybe the answer is, look, fuel is ridiculously low, and we can make a lot more money doing this right now. And if that changes, then we'll revert back. But maybe you could help us think about your thought process over the course of the year. Thanks for taking the question.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","I think what you're really seeing is us continue to accelerate new markets as we see new revenue opportunities. And I mean they're performing, and we will continue to do this as long as they perform. Those are the main reasons. Also next year, we have a lot of gauge going on. And even this year, I think we updated our forecast to about 10%. We're going to be about 10.6%. That's basically flying half or more airplanes than we had shared with you. So you're going to continue to find us waver around a little bit. But we will make sure that we adjust capacity one way or the other, given the economic environment if we see a change.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Maybe further to your point, Andrew, Duane, if you go back and look at 2009, I think what you would see is Alaska quickly, quickly responding to a downturn in demand. So this is working now, as Andrew says, but if things change, we'll change.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Okay, guys. Again, thank you for taking the questions.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Good morning, guys. Thanks. A couple questions here. Andrew, in the competitive markets, what percent of system PRASM are they trending? So 70%, 80% of what's normal? And, I guess, what I'm trying to get at is, what is the trajectory? We've got a very good demand story in Seattle. I guess, I'm just trying to understand is that trajectory \u2013 is that gap narrowing? Or perhaps are you trying to suggest it may widen in the first quarter?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","I think high level, the color I would give you is that Shane's team has done a fantastic job where we've had incursions in the first year. As they move into the second year, our performance has actually improved. And I think what you're also seeing is some of the downward pressure, especially on like Alaska long haul being offset with good, strong revenue performance in other areas of our system. So I probably didn't do a great job answering your question. But overall, where we see pressure on unit revenues, we have offsetting benefits on unit revenues from a network perspective.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yeah, maybe I can circle back. But, I guess, just on the offsets here, I guess, I'm just wondering what percent of revenues now come from codeshare relationships? And with American Systems now integrated, I appreciate the commentary. But maybe you could just remind us how fast is that overall codeshare growing? And what's really the target here as a percent of total revenue?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","I think overall on a complete partner basis, I think traffic's about 15% of the third quarter. And I think what you're going to find, Dan, is that we will lose in some and gain in others, net-net be solid. The goal, though, is to increase the yield and really working with American and our other partners with premium product, corporate customers and accounts. And so we're very, very optimistic about turning that on in a powerful way. But as for specifics, I'll share what we can at Investor Day and I think you'll learn more there.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. But I think if I can maybe clarifying a little further. Historically has that been 14% and so you've now recovered basically the codeshare traffic that you've lost to Delta?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah. I would say \u2013 I mean, really broad scope here is anything we've lost, we've replaced. And that's the big picture.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","It's actually a touch over 15% right now, Dan. And that is \u2013 my sense is that maybe is a little higher than we've been the last few years.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Well, congratulations. Thanks, guys.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Thanks.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Your line is open.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for the time.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Good Morning, Darryl.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Brandon, your maintenance CASM has been for the most part a good guide for you guys for the last couple of years. Just wondering now, as we approach the timeframe where you've kind of done retiring 737 Classics, what would you kind of anticipate there in terms of perhaps an upward movement? I mean, is this something that should continue to benefit you until all the Classics are gone? Or just, I guess, 737 NGs that you have purchased over the last several years as they were off warranty likely to start to push the maintenance CASM back up again?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Yeah. Darryl, maybe I'll start and then Ben can jump in here. What I would say is that to the extent that 400s are exiting the fleet, that's a benefit to maintenance CASM. But we are getting to a point where some of those initial NGs are getting to their first big overhaul. And that's something that we're thinking about as we move into 2016 and certainly into 2017. Ben, you want to talk about that?","Benito Minicucci - Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, Operations","Yeah. Darryl. So we have \u2013 of course, we have our Classics and they'll be going away. But our NGs are reaching 13 years to 15 years old. We've got brand new ones and ones that are 15 years old. So we manage those NGs with cost \u2013 larger heavy maintenance cost. And getting into the first major overhaul on NGs. So yeah, you will see an uptick in maintenance costs on our older NGs. But with the younger planes, the NGs under new have just been terrific cost profile for the first 10-or-so years.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. And then, Andrew, just with regard to these multiple partnership agreements that you have in place, when you go out and market to the corporate contract customer in particular, is there often a sort of joint marketing event that happens with the partner? Or are you still for the most part kind of marketing on your own? And does that create an opportunity down the road?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","I'm going to let Joe handle that one, as he looks after our corporate accounts.","Joseph A. Sprague - SVP-Communications & External Affairs","Hey, Darryl. It's Joseph Sprague. I've got external relations and sales as part of that team. Yeah, in fact, we have a more intense effort going around corporate accounts in Seattle, but throughout our system right now than probably ever before. And the team's doing really great. We are doing more and more sort of joint sales activities with American and maybe that's a big opportunity for us going forward. And then you've heard us talk about our partnerships with the foreign flag carriers, the international carriers, particularly here in Seattle. And promoting those to corporate accounts here in Seattle is another big opportunity. There's a lot of interest in folks that fly out domestically that can then use those other international carriers out of Seattle to get anywhere in the globe.","Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Thanks, Darryl.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Thank you, Darryl.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Fintzen with Barclays. Your line is open.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Bradley D. Tilden - Chief Executive Officer and President","Hey, Dave.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","When we think about the 8% growth that you're talking about for 2016, and if I go back to last quarter, I believe you had said something along the lines that your mindset had been you to grow more. And you weren't going to say exactly where you're going to grow. You gave us some guidance that kind of fits that. But that mindset was pushing you to lower that number. Is this 8% a continuation of that? Or has your view of 2016 kind of stabilized through the course of this third quarter?","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","Yeah, David. We're still got 8% in the sight here. And as I said earlier, it's really mid-con and trans-con are big primary drivers in the first half. And then as it relates to the landscaping economy, we will continue to look out and make adjustments as necessary. But nothing materially changed since we last spoke.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And are you seeing anything sort of residual oil demand-related in Alaska that you're watching? Or where would that come from realistically or what are the places you're most concerned about?","Joseph A. Sprague - SVP-Communications & External Affairs","This is Joe. I'll touch on just the state of Alaska piece and then Andrew can pick up anything else. The state of Alaska, the falling oil prices they are having a big impact on the state government, but overall consumer demand is strong. Their permanent fund dividend check they get each year, all the state residents get, was one of the highest ever. The tourism numbers to the state of Alaska this summer were quite strong. So I think that market is steady and I think will be for the foreseeable future.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Joe, isn't it correct that the state has big budget reserves that they'll use to smooth out variations according to a...","Joseph A. Sprague - SVP-Communications & External Affairs","They do.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Finance","Okay.","Andrew R. Harrison - Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer","And then just on the demand side, the only thing that keep me up most at night is just managing competitive capacity coming in on our markets and using the full breadth and depth of our network and our partners to compensate from that.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would like to now turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Investor Relations, Lavanya Sareen.","Lavanya Sareen","Thanks, Christina. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for Alaska Air Group's third quarter 2016 earnings call.","On the call today, our CEO, Brad Tilden will provide an overview of the business and share our progress on the proposed acquisition of Virgin America. Our Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Harrison will share the revenue results for the quarter, followed by Brandon Pedersen, our CFO, who will discuss our financial results and outlook for the rest of 2016. Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.","As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings.","We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs, excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","This morning Alaska Air Group reported a third quarter GAAP net profit of $256 million. Excluding the $14 million in merger-related costs and a $2 million impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio, Air Group reported an adjusted net income of $272 million and earnings per share grew by 2% to $2.20 per share that compares to First Call analyst consensus estimate of $2.09 per share. Additional information of our cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging, capital expenditures and other items can be found in our investor update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brad.","Bradley Tilden","Thanks, Lavanya, and good morning everyone. As Lavanya just shared, our third quarter net income was $272 million, a bit below last year, but our earnings per share of $2.20 or 2% higher than last and our highest quarterly earnings per share ever. 2016 is shaping up to be a year of record profitability. Pretax income for the first nine months of the year was over a $1 billion and $90 million higher than last year. And on a trailing 12 months\u2019 basis, our pretax margin now stands at just under 25%. This is an extraordinary level of performance not only in relation to our industry but also in relation to other high quality industrial companies. Some have asked, would Alaska\u2019s margin should be over the longer-term? This is a good question, one that we can all speculate about, where we can say definitively is that our goal is to be a leader in this industry. That means we need to be safe, be on time, provide great service and very importantly have both low payers and low cost. If we do these things well, we will be in a position to lead the industry in terms of financial performance regardless of what part of the cycle we're in.","Before we get into details of the quarter, I\u2019d like to touch briefly on Virgin America. Many of you have asked questions about the timing of the merger and about our ongoing discussions with the Justice Department. ","As the timing, we were hoping to get this done a couple of weeks ago and we are obviously not there quite yet. The scope of issues that remain with the Justice Department is manageable, but there are important matters and we want to take the time that\u2019s necessary to work through that. It\u2019s hard to predict the exact timing for when we'll ramp up, since there are two parties involved. There is a process at play and we're working through that process and we're respectful of that process. Our hope is that we'll have answers for our clearance soon.","All that said, we continue to be very confident that the deal will get done and get done in a way that benefits all of our stakeholders, most importantly our customers. This is a pro-consumer merger of two smaller airlines that will bring new low payer competition, industry leading service and innovative product offerings for the customers we serve. And unfortunately, when I have just shared the extent of the comments that we're going to be able to make this morning about the review process.","As we prepared for the merger, there are two things our leadership team is really focused on. First, bring in together these two teams, so everyone has aligned, motivated and working on the same things, a pulling together in other words. In doing this well lays the groundwork for number two, which is achieving the synergies of the deal, which based on everything we have seen to-date, we feel confident about doing. ","Ben Minicucci and his team have been working hard on the integration planning and Ben and others will be happy to share details of the planning work during the Q&A. And as a reminder, this combination ultimately positions us as the fifth largest airline in the country and airline with the national footprint and an unmatched stability to serve West Coast travelers.","And with that, I'd like to turn the focus of this call back to our standalone business and our Q3 performance. It\u2019s football season and we're all cheering on Sea Hawks and our other CFO Russell Wilson. One of the things that Sea Hawks do well is stick to their game plan and I am really proud of our folks for sticking to our game plan during our busiest summer yet. ","A big part of Alaska\u2019s success is built on being safe, being on time and taking great care of our customers. Our team flat delivered during the third quarter.","Let me start with safety. You've heard us say that safety is our number one priority. In last quarter, we were the first airline to have our new safety management system or SMS accepted by the FAA. This system was the FAA's mandating for all airlines is the new way of monitoring, managing and mitigating safety risk and it\u2019s a project that we've been working on for almost five years. I am really proud of the teams in Alaska and arise for being the first airlines to have this in place. And again, leading the industry on this underscores our commitment to operating safely and to doing things right.","Second, we continue to run a solid operation and in fact this was one of our best quarters operationally ever. 89.1% of Alaska's flights arrived on time during the quarter and we completed 99.8% of our flights. On a year-to-date basis, our on-time rate is 88.5% and we expect it will be the best among the six largest carriers for the seventh year in a row.","Over and horizon, Dave and his team have been focused on improving their operations and their efforts are paying off as our third quarter performance went from 79.9% last year to 85.3% this year. This is especially important as we continue to grow the regional side of the business, including the addition of new Embraer jets. ","And third, our people are taking care of customers. Our internal customer satisfaction score for the third quarter was 87.3%, our highest score since we started tracking this back in 2007. This is a fantastic achievement and I want to thank our employees for taking great care of our customers over the summer.","As no surprise that how you treat matters. We're seeing the results as active members in our mileage plan have increased by 35% in the last two years. And this in the face of intense competition in some of our markets.","Being safe, being on time and offering a great service with low payers are the key ingredients of our game plan, not only for customers, but also for our owners. Looking at the most recent quarter, we expect our trailing 12 month ROIC of 24% and our third quarter pretax margin of 27% will be among the very best in the industry. These are strong results and you'll hear more from Andrew, Brandon next on the underlying actions that drove these outcomes. ","As I look to the future, I am very confident about our core business and even more excited about the future when the Virgin America merger is complete. A lot of people will say this, but I really feel it's true at Alaska. We have a fantastic group of people here who are working together and I want to thank that for everything they're doing to make us the best airline that we can possibly be for our customers.","Now, I'll turn the call over the Andrew.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter revenue performance was solid with growth of 3.4% or $51.2 million. This contrast with the industry revenue contraction of approximately 2%. We were able to sustain high load factors, while increasing capacity at a right more than two times that of the industry. Our present change improved about 200 basis points from the prior quarter and outperformed the industry by approximately 40 basis points despite competitive capacity growing double-digits in our markets once again.","Looking at monthly trends, revenue [ph] was down by an average of 6.5% in both July and August yet it was up 0.5% in September. Slower September growth and strong bookings within the month along with an improved closing yield trajectory contributed to the strong performance during the shorter period. Our September load factor of 84.1% was up 2.5 points year-over-year and while sales remain low, they appear to be stable and we're not seeing anything to suggest that this will not continue into the fourth quarter. Our underlying business remains sound and we expect to continue to outcome of momentum for several reasons.","First, our revenue streams continue to grow and diversify due to our growth. We started our transcon service 15 years ago in September of 2001 with one flight from Seattle to DCA. Today, we serve 15 cities in this region with 33 flights a day and transcon service now accounts for approximately 15% of our revenues and the similar amount of our profits. We're continuing this growth with new flights to New York from Portland, San Diego, San Jose and a third daily departure from Seattle. And here is a little fun fact, if you combined our network with Virgin America, we'd have up to 31 flights today to the New York City area alone.","Second, we added Embraer 175 into our fleet a year ago and this has been a fantastic aircraft for reaching markets in the mid-continent, which were too fast for the Q400 and too thin for the 737. We've rapidly growing the number of markets served by the Embraer 29. These aircraft that delivering the results we'd hope for as they are creating new and profitable revenue streams supporting our mainline growth and providing greater non-stop convenience for our customers. Even though many of our Embraer 175 markets are still maturing. In aggregate, they're profitable and already earning their cost of capital. We take delivery of 18 175s next year.","Third, this growth is buttressed by the loyalty we enjoy from our members. We believe we have the most generous and far reaching loyalty program in the industry. Members in our credit card portfolio grew 11.5% for the quarter with retail spend on the portfolio outpacing this membership growth and additionally, our frequent flyer members grew 10%. ","And fourth, our growth is enabled by offering low fares. In some recent analysis, we conducted, we found Alaska's one way fares were more than $40 or 23% lower than each of the three network carriers on a system wide stage length adjusted basis.","Our low fares were enabled by our low costs. We remained focused on bringing these low fares to our customers and maintaining the cost advantage that enables these fares. I want to move to the fourth quarter now. ","Our Q4 growth was slow substantially to just over 3%, this brings our full year capacity growth to about 8.5% in line with our previous guidance. However, competitive capacity is expected to stay elevated for the remainder of the year at about 10%. While we expect to close in bookings strengths, we have seen in September that carried through to the fourth quarter, December is expected to be softer than October and November on a relative basis, as both Christmas and New Year\u2019s fall on a weekend this year, compressing the holiday travels. We estimate this will lower PRASM for the quarter by about 0.5 point.","I also want to update you on the progress we are making on our premium cost product. We expect to complete the conversion of all 61, 737, 800s by year-end, we\u2019ll start selling tickets for premium class in early November and travel starting January 5, 2017. As a reminder, we expect this to add approximately $50 million in revenue next year and achieve $85 million, a new run rate by the end of 2018.","With that, I\u2019d like to touch on 2017. On a standalone basis, that is excluding any impacts from the acquisition of Virgin America. We expect to have growth to slow by about a 150 basis points versus this year to slightly more than 7%. This growth comprises as approximately two points from longest stage length and a point from the annualization of markets we already launched in 2016.","As we look at published schedules, we expect Q1 2017 competitive capacity to come down slightly to 9% in our markets, still elevated but a nice change from the double-digit increases we have been seeing for quite a while. As we enter the last quarter of the year and look to 2017, we remain confident in our business. We are operating well, fundamentals in the economies we serve are strong. Our loyal customer base continues to grow and we continue to add new and profitable revenue streams through our portfolio. ","Like everyone else at Alaska, the rest of my commercial team and I are excited about the opportunity that Virgin America presents for our business, which will allow us to accelerate our growth while bringing low fares to more customers and strong returns for our shareholders.","With that, I will turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everybody. We\u2019re pleased to report another very strong quarter financially punctuated by the 2% increase in earnings per share. Even though net profit declined very slightly, we\u2019re benefiting from the significant share repurchases that we have made since the end of third quarter of last year. ","As Andrew said, revenues grew by more than 3% and although our non-fuel cost grew by nearly 10%, we were none the less pleased with our cost performance. Our non-fuel unit cost was up 1.6%, but that was lower than we initially expected for the quarter. We remain on track to have a full year unit cost reduction of about a 0.5% which would make this the 7th straight year of unit cost reduction. ","Andrew offered some early guidance on next year\u2019s growth, but we aren\u2019t yet able to share initial 2017-unit cost guidance. Our leaders are busy compiling budgets right now, folks across both Alaska and Horizon recognize that low cost create an important competitive advantage over higher cost legacy carriers and are required for us to grow.","We\u2019re planning to provide 2017 cost guidance on our fourth quarter call and speaking of guidance, I want to remind everyone that we\u2019re taking a little different approach this year by having our Investor Day in March, we\u2019re looking forward to sharing much more with you about our past merger plan at that time. Our earnings benefited less of it\u2019s from less of a tailwind of lower fuel prices that in Q1 or Q2. Economic fuel cost declined by $18 million this quarter, where that the year-over-year declines in Q1 and Q2 were more than three times that amount.","With oil prices now over $50 a barrel, it\u2019s worth mentioning the improving efficiency of our fleet that will help offset rising fuel cost. ASMs per gallon improved by another 2% this quarter, because of the ongoing retirement of 737-400s and the addition of fuel efficient of 900 ERs. In fact, we've taken delivery of 21 737-900 ERs since the end of the third quarter of last year and our mainline efficiency should just continue to get better as we finish retiring the 400s and add another 13 900 ERs by the end of 2017.","As we've told you before these new aircrafts are 37 seats larger, they're more comfortable they're more reliable and set the fuel like a pre [ph] with wings. A 900 ER brings less than 910 gallons per flight compared to 940 gallons per flight hour burnt by the smaller 737-400.","Turning to the balance sheet, you might have noticed that we ended the quarter with more than $3.2 billion of cash that total includes more than $1.5 billion that we've raised at quarter end to fund the Virgin America acquisition. At this point, we're fully prepared to close the deal once we have DOJ approval. Our treasury and legal teams did an incredible job putting all this together and I wanted to extend a huge thanks to both of them.","We're using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and our weighted average interest rate on this new money currently stands at 2.37% even after the financing. We still have more than 40 unencumbered Boeing 737 aircraft, including 20 next generation 800s and 900 ERs. The borrowing rates and the fact that we have so much remaining collateral are both the testament to the great balance sheet that we've built and incredible amount of cash flow we've been able to generate over the last five years.","Cash flow from operations for the first nine months of the year was $1.2 billion about flat compared to the first nine months of last year. Year-to-date CapEx is just over $500 million resulting in about $700 million of free cash flow. We expect full year CapEx to be now be $680 million down slightly from prior guidance. There are two drivers. First, we elected to differ our first step our first 737 MAX aircraft from the fall of 2017 to early '18. The MAX will be a great airplane for Alaska with its extra range and lower fuel burnt that was so much going on we wanted to fit more time to bring it into service. We want to thank Boeing for accommodating our request.","And second, we've lowered our estimate of non-aircraft spending as certain projects have shifted to the right. Looking forward, and as we told you last quarter, we're planning for 2017 CapEx to be about $1.1 billion, which of course is current air group [ph].","Andrew and I have thrown out a lot of information on fleet changes, so I thought I'd might recap. On the mainline side in 2016, we're adding a total of 19 new aircraft and retiring 10. And in 2017, we're adding 12 new aircraft and retiring 16 which is the rest of the 737-400 fleet.","On the regional side, we'll take delivery of our first 13 E-175 jets into the Horizon fleet. And by the way I want to recognize the Horizon team that's working on entry into service and we'll add another five to our capacity of purchase arrangement with SkyWest.","We're very pleased with the strong results both operational and financial and our people should celebrate the great summer we had. We're mindful that there is a lot going on, a lot of hard work lies ahead and we need to keep executing on the things that continue to make us successful.","And with that, let's go to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Savanthi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Savanthi Syth","Hey, good morning, everyone. ","Bradley Tilden","Good morning.","Savanthi Syth","And just a quick follow up on the Virgin comment you made Brandon. You said is everything been wind up as soon as you get approval you've been close. Or are there kind a non-financing that need to happen. And if you get too close to the holidays and just to get a shot for 2017?","Brandon Pedersen","Sav, it's Brandon we are good to go from a financing perspective but I might turn it over to Kyle to just touch on the other process. Thanks.","Kyle Levine","Hey, Savvy, good morning. Yeah, the things now as things currently stand as soon as we get DOJ clearance and have the financing all set up, we're good to go.","Savanthi Syth","Okay, great. And then on the Horizon front, just wondering is that kind of middle of the next year and how should we think about is there are going to be something transition introduction expenses around that and as we think about 2017?","Kyle Levine","On the Horizon, the introduction of E175s? ","Savanthi Syth","Exactly.","Kyle Levine","Yes, so time we have right now, we'll take the first aircraft in March of next year, we hold the service by the first of May. We submitted all of our manual update with the exception of one, so far the feedback is very positive, so I think we're pretty much on target. We have no confirms at all, training and staffing for the policy that is going very, very well so, I think we had a really, really good position overall, 175s. ","Savanthi Syth","All right. Great. Thanks. I'll get back in the queue. ","Bradley Tilden","Thanks, Savvy. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for the time. Just on the Virgin transaction on a high-level question for you. Just dig on that various headlines out there, how do we get comfortable with that. Yeah, the full price you pay, it doesn't get fuller and that synergies remain intact?","Bradley Tilden","Rajeev, its Brad. This is a hard deal. But I think the bottom-line of this is, we actually have said, what we are going to say about it. I think everyone on the call was familiar with the M&A process in our country. And we\u2019re going through that process and what we have said is that we are extremely confident that the deal will get done and we\u2019re also very confident that we\u2019re going to realize the synergies that we talked about. But that\u2019s actually the limit of what we can talk about on the call today, unfortunately.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay, that's okay, no it\u2019s a tough question to answer. A related question to the \u2013 if I could maybe just explore sort of a plan B in the event that the deal doesn\u2019t go through for whatever the reason. What would you then do with the $3 billion or so of cash that you\u2019ve got sitting on your balance sheet?","Bradley Tilden","Again, Rajeev, I just don\u2019t think we can go there, but I do respect you for trying and thanks very much. We\u2019ve actually just said what we can say about the process.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay, no worries. Thanks.","Bradley Tilden","Yep.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julie Yates from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Julie Yates","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Question on the growth cadence for '17, any color you guys can provide, I imagine you'll be starting below the 7% in Q1, and ending above in Q4?","Andrew Harrison ","Julie, it's Andrew. At this time, you know we may have Investor Day in November where just giving high level guidance or a group today at about 7% for next year. To your point we start lower as we come into the first quarter but as we move through the year and come to event today we'll give you quarter-by-quarter guidance.","Julie Yates","Okay, great. And then Andrew, you mentioned a competitive capacity, remaining elevated, but around 10%, In Q4, I think last you told this it was 12%. So, I\u2019m assuming thing are looking a bit better, is that correct?","Andrew Harrison","You know I don't want to celebrate too early but the third quarter competitive capacity of that 13%, fourth quarter 10, as we mentioned nine in the first quarter, but as the bookings sit today, the book schedule is currently up 1% in the second quarter. So, that\u2019s going to be very good.","Bradley Tilden ","Julie, it's been a long time since we\u2019re seeing numbers like that in our markets, obviously.","Julie Yates","That\u2019s great news. Okay, great. Thanks so much. ","Andrew Harrison","Thank you.","Operator","You next question comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Hunter Keay","Hey, good morning. How are you guys doing? So, Brad, you talked about, I mean the first things you said about people are asking you about long-term margins and you said they\u2019re going to be better than everybody else, but you didn\u2019t give a number. If I were to think about the average pretax margins you guys did in '12, '13, and '14 it's about 14% pretax. So, is that good sort of all sequel guide post to how I think about long-term margins or will it be a little bit lower than that, given some likely dilution from Virgin? You can answer the standalone or pro forma however you want? ","Bradley Tilden","Yeah. I think this is the place where we\u2019re all - you guys probably have a better view of what\u2019s going to happen with long-term margins in our industry than we do. Btu we do look at other industries, we look at other high quality industrials, and we look at sort of gaps that people are earning over their cost of capital. And so, I think the industry, you would hope that as we settle down, and have capacity, control and have consolidation that we settle into a place where we're earning as an industry, margins that are several hundred points above our cost of capital. And then what we\u2019re saying is the last, it should be above that that sort of how we see ourselves, that\u2019s what we want to do. How you do that math I don't think I want to be the one -- I think I have told you what we know and we want to -- we have always done is try to talk about what we know and not talk about what we don\u2019t know. So, I think that\u2019s where I am leaving. ","As divergent is to be really candid, yes, the two together. We're not issuing one new share for this acquisition, so any profit that they bring into the company is accretive to our profit. But I think you have seen the math, Virgin's historical margins are lower than Alaska. So, I would expect that our company-wide margins will dilute a little bit and Brandon I can\u2019t remember the exact numbers, but it's not huge -- once the synergies are realized, it\u2019s not a significant decrease as I recall.","Brandon Pedersen","In the margin\u2026.","Bradley Tilden","In the margin percentage.","Brandon Pedersen","Yes. Once that synergies are realized and then obviously, we need to have Virgin\u2019s actual numbers for this year in the next to know that with certainty.","Hunter Keay","Yeah, right, okay. Cool. And then what\u2019s on the table in terms of assume it still gets done, how you guys might think about communicating with the industry, you have been pretty consistent over the last seven or eight years I thought not giving PRASM guidance, not giving margin guidance. I think the stability of your earnings are better than most, have you ever considered talking about -- I know we talked three months ago about long-term PRASM guidance. But is there any -- are you guys give any thought to how you want to think about communicating financial guidance in general once the deal closes.","I mean in particularly giving something like annual EPS guidance like other high quality industrial companies do, so you can pull. Yeah, right I mean like it\u2019s -- I am serious you can improve, so if you give me a range and you hit it year-after-year your multiple will go higher. If you believe the fuel and surge correlated for example, you should be able to hit a range of EPS. So, as you guys think about this, are you giving thought to how you communicate guidance longer-term in general, not just PRASM, but guidance in general.","Andrew Harrison","Yeah, Hunter. We are thinking about it. What I will tell you is, we were on the cost of giving a lot more forward-looking disclosure and then we went in and did the deal of Virgin and so we're not going to do that right now. And what I would say is I recognized that that\u2019s what good high quality industrials do. I would love to get there at some point, what I will tell you is that the reality of putting business A together with business B, we are going to have numbers that are unfamiliar to us for a while and I think what we'll do is we'll wait until we get more familiar with those numbers and we'll get really confident on what the comps look like from our own perspective and then ones we're confident with that we'll start giving more to you guys.","Hunter Keay","All right, yeah, that\u2019s cool. Thanks, guys.","Bradley Tilden","Thanks, Hunter. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Your line is open.","Joseph DeNardi","Andrew, just kind of looking at the competitor capacity and again if you look at the composition of the growth that\u2019s changed a lot over the past 18 months there was a lot more coming from Delta, now it seems to be American and Spirit. So just can you just speak to conceptually kind of what that mean for you guys from a PRASM standpoint, is it better for you, I would imagine it is, but the growth is coming from American and Spirit rather than Delta or is that not the case.","Andrew Harrison","Joe, the numbers we give you a sort of divided to us now I think you can just 1% versus 9 at the end of the day, we compete with everybody, each competitor comes with their different flavor, but at the end of the day as it relates to that from my perspective competitive capacity is competitive capacity on our network and we just needed to deal with that irrespective of what that it is.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. And then Brand and you mentioned mainline fuel efficiency potentially getting better next year, I mean can you put a finer point on that should we think mainline items per gallon up like 3% or 4% or just kind of in line with what you guys have done in the past couple of years?","Brandon Pedersen","Yeah, I don\u2019t have the number off the top of my head, but if I had I would say it\u2019s probably what we have done over the last couple of years. We have been on this course of phasing out the 400s now for a few years, next year they said the last 10 go out. So, I think it\u2019s probably pretty consistent with what we would expect to see again on an Alaska only basis. As we look ahead to the merger Virgin America does enjoy a very high fuel efficiency as well and so the combined entity should be just as well positioned.","Joseph DeNardi","Great. Thank you very much.","Brandon Pedersen","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamie Baker","Hey, good morning, everybody. ","Bradley Tilden","Good morning. ","Jamie Baker","When the merger was announced you talked about re-deleveraging and I am wondering if you've dug deeper into the integration planning process, have you established any timing or sort of annual progress that you hope to make in that regard I mean is it a five-year goal to return to where you currently are premerger or where you were in March or some other timeframe, is there some annual number in terms of how much you'd like to, how many terms of leverage you might want to decline, anything like that?","Brandon Pedersen","Hi Jamie, it's Brandon. Good morning. Maybe I\u2019ll start and then Ben can tell you about the integration progress that we're making. We have models that re-deleveraging that we talked about and when we come out of the gates, we should have debt to cap right 59% to 60% and -- but our would be to get down into the mid-40s within say three years or so that\u2019s obviously depended on the economic environment. But if we do it right that\u2019s where we\u2019ll be and then I think we'll stay there for a while, I think we like leverage in the mid -- low to mid 40% range, I don\u2019t see us going back down to 28% like we were pre-deal, but I think we can get there quick and at that level we'll have a balance sheet that looks a lot like another high or other high quality industrials and it will look very favorable compared to other carriers in the industry.","Jamie Baker ","Very helpful. I appreciate that. Second question and this is not uniquely tied to merger specifics or the negotiations, so hopefully you will choose to answer. Can you assure us that you at least identify the terms under which you would not do the deal and the reason I ask is that I am just trying to assess whether the goal here is to get the deal done and give up as little as possible which make sense or get the deal done only if you can assure that ROIC remains above acts, I mean have you established a floor internally, I\u2019m not asking you what the floor is, just trying to dig into the thought process here?","Bradley Tilden ","Jamie, it's Brad. I think what we will say is that we\u2019ve always run this business for the long-term, we think about what\u2019s going to be good for all of the people that's been on this place over the long-term for customers, for employees, for all of you, for the owners of the business and that\u2019s the mindset we're taking as we have this conversation with Justice Departments and so we are pushing. ","There are some things that we feel are important to our future success and our ability to do good things for customers and that\u2019s what's motivating us here, but -- and I'll just say, we do have a pretty strong internal accomplice about what is workforce and what will workforce in the future so that\u2019s an answer to your question, there you have it, but there is just not a lot more than we can say about this.","Jamie Baker ","No, that'll suffice and I could just sneak a housekeeping question and I guess somewhat revenue - Hunter was asking about in terms of guidance, have you thought about how you are going to be reporting post-merger? Should we expect these still breakouts regional mainline or is there an opportunity to just move everything into a consolidated basis as you guys going forward, any thoughts there or we're just jumping too far ahead? I\u2019m just thinking about how do I rebuild my model?","Bradley Tilden","Yes. What about you Jamie. What we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll probably report regional and mainline, I would say, but until we have a single operating certificate, Virgin America and Alaska Airlines separate results would be available on that one as well.","Jamie Baker","Yes, okay. Yes, make sense. All right, I\u2019ll turn it over to somebody else. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Michael Linenberg","Hi, good morning everybody. Just follow up on Jamie\u2019s question about Brandon, where you would want to get to with respect to debt to cap, if getting back to the low to mid 40s still then get you back to an IG rating. Would that be -- would that matter or is it at the very least you want to do what you need to do in order to get back to the coveted investment grade credit rating?","Mark Eliasen","Hi, Mike, this is Mark Eliasen maybe I\u2019ll take a shot at that one. First of all, we are not changing our principals and our principal got us to the investment grade rating and that is generating good cash flow on a conservative balance sheet running a good company, good high quality industrial company. So, we\u2019re going to get there and we\u2019re confident that the rating agencies will come around, when they see that and they know as well and they'll see that we are going to just refer back toward to our pattern. ","One point I\u2019ll make about the -- we are going to have additional debt, but because the interest rate is quite a bit lower than what we have before actual interest expense will be right in the range of what we\u2019ve had historically. That\u2019s a good thing even though our leverage is a little bit higher.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, great. And then just a second question and this is probably, I don\u2019t know it\u2019s for Brad or Ben but we had the new, I guess another phase from the DOT as it relates to consumer protection and legislation and well there was kind of lot of verbiage, lot of noise, it seems like that there were a couple of things that are going to come into play here and one of it has to do with the on-time performance, and I am just curious I mean I know that you know under the new rules Horizon doesn\u2019t need the new threshold, but it looks like it actually very close to the threshold, so maybe it\u2019s a 2017-2018 type event. ","But if you could, if you would include Horizon in with the Alaska numbers, where would you stack up on time completion factor, like how would you compare you know and I really you probably have to do that analysis for your other carriers but does it enhance, is it neutral or does it take away from the numbers.","Benito Minicucci","Hi, Mike, yeah that\u2019s a great question and Frank and you guys would it expect that it from me, I track that every day Alaska, Horizon and I actually track every other carrier in the industry and I was backup and I will tell you today, if we combined Alaska and Horizon we would still lead the industry in on time and combined completion rates. ","So Horizon I am looking forward to Horizon getting the 175 a more reliable airplane, in fact we\u2019d include sky in that total as well. So, I think it\u2019s a good thing what the DOT has done, I mean the customer when they book on an airline they really don\u2019t distinguish whether they are flying a regional airplane or mainline airplane, I mean it\u2019s our commitment it\u2019s been our philosophy all the time here at Alaska that whether you fly mainline or regional we will look after you like the same across all touch points.","Michael Linenberg","That\u2019s super helpful, Ben. Thank you.","David Campbell","Michael, this is David Campbell of Horizon. One of the things that we\u2019ve turned our decision towards really, really clear focus on operational excellence, we\u2019ve seen a 9 and 7% improvement so far in this year on DOT performance for getting out \u2013 DOT on time performance for getting out the gate and still about a 5% improvement as far as on time arrival.","One of the challenges I think we have here is the idler is really dealing with ATC delays, but everything else that we can control, we\u2019re driving a much, much stronger profits in place, so I am pretty excited about the focus, I think you better see a continued progress on performance from Horizon. I think the second piece of it, that you\u2019ll certify that\u2019s a reliable great airplane that\u2019s could actually help us in great deal so that\u2019s going to be really a good tool in our toolbox that will really take care about of our customers.","Michael Linenberg","Great. Thanks, David. Thanks, everyone.","David Campbell","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Darryl Genovesi from UBS. Your line is open.","Darryl Genovesi","Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Andrew is there a further step up in the credit card economics in 2017.","Andrew Harrison","I am sorry, if you could repeat that.","Darryl Genovesi","Right, I was asking if there is some of your peers have announced so that credit cards that they have signed recently have had a step up in the economics in year two as well and I was wondering if that was the case on the deal that you announced at the Investor Day last year.","Andrew Harrison","I am going to look at Brandon, we don\u2019t normally just throw the traction relationships with the bank, what I can tell you is that we expect and we continue to see a continues strengthening of our economics through our credit card arrangement because we have got strong growth both on the Boeing side and the loyalty.","Brandon Pedersen","Yeah Darryl, it\u2019s Brandon, it does step up due to term although I don\u2019t remember of the top of my head whether it\u2019s annually if there is something here that we go flat for a year.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. Thanks for that. And then Brandon you said, you weren\u2019t ready to provide 2017-unit cost guidance yet, which is understandable, but just wondering if you could highlight what some of the big moving pieces are for us I guess you\u2019ve got the 175 introductions that\u2019s been discuss, but there is anything else I think you have got a mechanics deal that\u2019s amendable I mean any other sort of big items that you would highlight.","Brandon Pedersen","Yeah, you\u2019re right, we do have mechanic deal that is amendable on the Alaska side. We have what I would call a likely increase in our pension expense just given returns and where rates are this year we won\u2019t know that amount until the end of the year, I think it\u2019s possible that we might have a deal with the OEM for an engine services agreement we\u2019re still looking into that so if that gets done that would be a cost win for us, although that\u2019s really just a smoothing arrangement over a longer term period and then we do have a little bit of a I\u2019d say both cost and ASM headwind associated with premium class as Andrew shared premium class is going to be awesome from a margin perspective both dollars from the dollars perspective on the margin line although it does dilute ASMs a little bit and there is additional cost of serving those premium class passengers. So, those are kind of the big things of the top of my head.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. And then, if I could just quick one last one in. when you retired the last 737 classic, is there some sort of step down in infrastructure spend or something associated with that in addition to the fuel cost savings or no longer operating that airplane.","Brandon Pedersen","Yeah, I'll let Ben to take that one.","Benito Minicucci","Well, first that we're going to have a party when the last classic goes at least the maintenance at all. There will be some we're investing in an anchorage hanger. The anchorage hanger only accommodates classics. We do need a bigger hanger up in the State of Alaska to accommodate the larger NGs. Besides that, we have chilling and spares and -- to maintain the rest of the speeds, so we're -- with that.","Darryl Genovesi","Okay. All right, thanks guys.","Benito Minicucci","Thank you, Darryl.","Operator","Your next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen. Your line is open.","Helane Becker","Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Thanks for the time here. So, I have two questions. One you didn't really mention much about Hawaii. I was kind of wondering if you could talk about the competitive capacity that's going on in the market and what you're seeing there and whether there are plans to increase capacity or not?","Andrew Harrison","Helane, it's Andrew. I would generally characterize the Hawaii right now as stable. We've seen some capacity increase in California especially in the Bay Area. But again, without going into too much detail, we feel very, very good about our Hawaii 26 plus flights a day franchise and it's performing very, very well, very, very stable right now.","Helane Becker","Okay. And then I think over the past couple maybe last week or the week before there were some really bad weather in your neck of so what you don't normally see. So maybe you can talk about the impact that would have on October results?","Benito Minicucci","Helane, it's Ben. Yeah it was we were expecting extremely high winds and rain. What I will tell you is that we got some of it but it wasn't to the extent that we expect it. We did cancel just a handful of flights maybe about 30 flights we accommodated most of customers we did that alone then. So, I can't tell you dollar amounts maybe I'll ask Brandon.","Brandon Pedersen","Yeah, I think it would be immaterial.","Benito Minicucci","Yeah, so we came through it particularly yeah we don't get to see many of those storms so hopefully it will be the last when we see in a while.","Helane Becker","Okay. And then Brandon, I noticed that the CRJs are going away at the end of the year. Is there any impact we need to be aware from balance sheet perspective?","Brandon Pedersen","No there is just couple of left that are flying and maybe the one that's still flying. We've taken care of all of it from a balance sheet perspective.","Helane Becker","Okay. Thank you.","Brandon Pedersen","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan McKenzie from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Dan McKenzie","Hi. Good morning. Thanks, guys. Andrew, taking a step back, I am wondering if you can help us understand how codeshare agreements work more broadly. There is a broad view that there will be like a light switch either you don't -- you turn them on, you turn them off. And so, the question here is, does how it really work? What are the various components how easy are they to customize it? And where does the value really come from, it is on the routes that you don't serve, but your partner does. Or is it on the markets that you both serve?","Andrew Harrison","Hey Dan, good morning, that\u2019s a very good, big question, I'll keep it high level I think and I'll just speak for an Alaska Group. In couple of key things here that codeshare provide us firstly domestically, we can connect into our partners' hubs in the middle of the country and then connect our customers to anywhere in the rest of the country.","So, first this codeshare agreements domestically give us a lot of ability to be able to get our passengers everywhere I need to go at the times that need to go and give them plenty of choice if there is when that need to go.","I think the other key component of that is also obviously the loyalty side. So, our customers can still prove elite status in miles when they fly on our partners' metal or on their own metal and of course redemptions, our customers want to redeem -- 85% of our customers redeem on our sales.","And then the last piece is really international and the international is really, really important. For our international partners, we provide huge value to help them fill their airplanes. I mean the statistics are quite significant, hubs especially on how many passengers we put on our foreign flag friends. And for Alaska customers, it allows them to both redeem globally 800 plus destinations globally as well as earn and redeem miles.","So, overall, I would say that these codeshare relationships provide great utility, but at the end of the day, Alaska able to fill fun its fundamental products and the majority of customers and majority of loyalty, majority of revenue is all based-on Alaska Air Group's metal and what we do.","Dan McKenzie","Got it. But if I can kind of just back up Andrew just a little bit there, how early customize them to turn on or turn off certain routes I guess number one. And then secondly, the majority of the value come from the markets that you don't serve or because I would presume there are some markets that you jointly serve. I'm just wondering if you just kind a help us understand a little bit further.","Andrew Harrison","So, I think for mechanics it's very easy to turn things on or off. We just got to give notice to that customer, change the booking schedule and not disrupt passengers, so we work very closely with our partners. And you know there is no silver bullet on value. In our Seattle hub, it might come from connecting beyond from international loyalty in California where we're less prevalent or maybe even in Los Angeles, our partners give us a much full schedule and allow customers where we don't have a whole lot of utility still stay in the family and in our program to travel on them.","I think loyalty codeshare revenue, all of these things are the portfolio, Dan, I honestly there is no one single area that's more important that the other from my perspective at least.","Dan McKenzie","Understood. And I then I guess secondly here Andrew you mentioned the transcon presence for Alaska. The rest of the industry is gone to a life flat scene in this segment. And I guess I'm just wondering what are your thoughts about this going forward just given the acquisition of Virgin here. Is the more upscale approach make sense or is the thought simply to maintain a density advantage.","Andrew Harrison","Yeah, Dan, it's a great question and that's a project that we are working on right now. I think the point you're making is the good one that a lot of carriers are moving to, but certain number of [indiscernible] in certain markets. The other side of it is Alaska has got a long standing, we're very proud of the low cost low fare position that we have. And so, those are the two and there is also a simplicity element of this thing. So, those are the things that we're going to be balancing as we think about this decision. I think you'll hear say more about this in the next few months. But it is an open question. I think you know the two sides - the two arguments for each side of it.","Dan McKenzie","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Andrew Harrison","Okay, Dan.","Bradley Tilden ","Hey Christina, we have got time for one more question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Savanthi Syth from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Savanthi Syth","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just maybe on the capacity growth side, I'm little bit surprised by next year's level of growth given that you are having pressure on the field side and you're going through this integration. Just any thoughts on what got you comfortable with that. And given the changes in the fleet that you've talked about. I know in the investor day you've had outlined maybe getting like 80 ASMs per gallon level of fuel efficiency and if that still the same thing?","Bradley Tilden","Savvy, maybe I'll start with the first part on capacity. But so, couple of things as you've heard earlier. There is obviously decent growth on the regional side of our business. And all the CIJ is going away that was 70 seats we're going to 70 seats on the 175. So, there is some good growth there. A lot of our growth is really transcon and midcon, 80% of it was this quarter a 100% of it will be next quarter. We'll give more details later on. But there are markets that we found to be very, very good for us and adding a lot of new revenue.","As Brandon shared these are high level estimates and again as we said today the hub and all the new each of those were point of growth were three quarters of point of growth. So, it's not have to get the 7% already with what we've already done. We will continue to monitor this and of course with the new combined entity we will take a high look at it. But what we are seeing to-date is our growth has provided good economics for this company. If these economic conditions and the continuing strengthen of close in bookings and the environment are still very next year we will continue with our plan.","Savanthi Syth","Excellent.","Mark Eliasen","Hey Savvy, this is Mark. You've talked about ASMs per gallon, are we talking about an objective or goal for Alaska.","Savanthi Syth ","I thought at the Investor Day that you outlined the 85 number.","Mark Eliasen","Yeah, so I can give you a couple of facts that I just looked up. The 900 ER gets about 92 seat miles per gallon right now on our fleet. And the 800s are about 85, so as we phase out the 737-400 as Brandon mentioned, we should approach to that number, we should be in the 80 -- that\u2019s going to be about 88% of our fleet will be those very large jets and they're great airplanes for us.","Savanthi Syth","Okay. Sounds great. Thanks. ","Mark Eliasen","Thank you.","Bradley Tilden","Thanks, Savvy.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn call over to Brad Tilden.","Bradley Tilden","All righty. Thanks, all of you for tuning in today. We appreciate your questions and we look forward to chatting with you in 90 days\u2019 time.

Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session for analysts and journalists. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Investor Relations, Lavanya Sareen.","Lavanya Sareen","Thanks, Melissa. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Alaska Air Group's fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call.","On the call today our CEO, Brad Tilden, will provide an overview of the business, our Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Harrison, will share the revenue results for the fourth quarter and full year. And then Brandon Pedersen, our CFO, will discuss our financial results for 2015 and outlook for 2016. Several members of our senior management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.","As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings.","We will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a fourth quarter GAAP net profit of $191 million. Excluding mark-to-market fuel hedge losses and certain other items that netted to $5 million, the company recorded fourth quarter 2015 net income of $186 million, or $1.46 per diluted share. This result compares to First Call estimate of $1.40 per share and exceeds last year's adjusted net income of $125 million, or $0.94 per diluted share.","For the full year, Air Group reported a record adjusted net profit of $842 million, that\u2019s up 47%. Earnings per share grew 56% to $6.51 per share with the incremental growth driven by the significant number of shares repurchased during the year. Additional information about cost expectations, capacity plans, fuel hedging, capital expenditures, and other items can be found in our investor updates included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com. ","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brad.","Brad Tilden","Thanks, Lavanya, and good morning, everyone. I am sure you\u2019ve all seen our results by now and have seen that 2015 was a record year on almost free front. While every airline has benefited from low fuel prices, Alaska led the industry in many of the underlining drivers of financial performance. Areas like operational reliability, customer satisfaction, customer growth and low fares low costs \u2013 these are the areas that represent our competitive advantage or our economic moat and they are also the reasons that our financial performance is what it is. ","I\u2019d like to start the call by covering a few of these areas. First, safety. We\u2019ve reduced what we call our risk level 3 events dramatically over the last five years and over the same time period our lost time injuries are down more than 25%. We\u2019re by no means perfect, and safety events no matter how small remind us of the enormous responsibility we have towards our customers or employees and their families. And again, a focus on doing things safely is also a focus on doing things right and that benefits everyone. ","Operationally, Alaska leads the industry. Notwithstanding a tough December at Horizon, 86.1% of our flights in 2015 arrived on time and that resulted in Alaska being named the number one North American carrier by flight stats for the six straight years. We also led the industry with the fewest number of customer complaints and a completion rate of 99.5% with second among the nine largest domestic airlines. This performance led to the Wall Street Journal ranking us the top airline for the third year in a row and for the fourth out of the last five years. ","I want to thank Ben and Dave, together with their operational leaders and all of our frontline employees for their focus on getting -- getting it right with more than 900 flights every single day. ","Moving to the next item, in 2015 our internal measure of customer satisfaction reached a new record high of 86%, a 2-point improvement over last year and a remarkable 16-point increase since we began collecting this data in 2007. We know that satisfied customers have contributed to record growth in both our mileage plan and our credit card. Considering how established these programs are, these record growth rates are extraordinary and they are huge credit to our people. ","And we\u2019d spoken to you in the past about Beyond Service, a two-day customer service workshop for our frontline employees. We\u2019ve now completed all 66 classes. Long-time company leaders Andy Schneider, Diana Shaw and Jeff Butler led this fantastic effort. I want to both thank and congratulate them and their teams who put in countless hours putting these classes together. I believe this program is already moving the needle in terms of how we focus on our customers. ","On the labor front, with our new dispatcher contract we are the only U.S. airline to have no open contracts at this time. The weighted average duration of our agreements is almost 3 years which compares very favorably to the rest of the industry. ","As folks have said before, the airline business is the ultimate team sport, and for an airline to run well, the team has to work together. As you know, this is an area where we spend a lot of time and our people are incredibly proud of what they build at Alaska. Our employee engagement scores and our top 100 ranking in the Forbes employer survey are testament to this. ","We\u2019re also very proud that when our company does well, our employees benefit. Every employee at Air Group participates in the same gain-sharing plan which we call PBP. This program, combined with our monthly operational bonus program, will pay out a record $120 million this year with $98 million of this being paid to our employees tomorrow. This is the seventh consecutive year where our employees will get a full month\u2019s pay and performance bonuses. This alignment is very powerful and we believe it will do nothing but benefit us in future years. ","So those areas combined with our low fares and low-cost, our strong balance sheet and our simple and profitable fleet represent our competitive advantage. Our performance in these areas together with low fuel prices drove our financial results, and I\u2019d like to highlight those now. ","As Lavanya said, our net income for the quarter was $186 million, up 49% from 2014 and for the year it was $842 million, up 47%. Our pre-tax margin expanded 680 basis points to 24% for the year and our ROIC for the trailing 12 months of 25.2% is more than three times our cost of capital. We expect these results will put our pre-tax margin and ROIC both in the top 10% of the S&P 500. ","Our cash flows from operations were almost $1.6 billion. Free cash flow was $760 million and of this total, over $600 million was returned to shareholders. We bought back 5.5% of our stock this year and we bought back 35% since 2007. ","We were very excited to announce this morning our third dividend increase in the last two and half years. And with today's announcement, our dividend yield is 1.6%, bringing us closer to our goal of having a dividend that resembles high-quality industrials. ","And with respect to the quality and diversity of our route network, I thought you might be interested in knowing that even if we adjusted our fuel prices to $3 a gallon, markets representing 95% of our revenue would still be profitable. 2015 was a great year for all of our constituents: customers, employees, communities and owners. And as you know, this continues a longer-term trend. So we feel good about our performance. ","There's obviously some concern in the industry about the revenue environment, and on that score, I would like to say that we\u2019re quite optimistic about 2016, and we feel good about both our geographies and our customer segments. 90% of our revenue is generated in the domestic U.S. market, which is a good place to be, and two-thirds of our revenue has a leisure focus, which is more resilient in a downturn and more stable through the cycle. ","As we move forward in 2016, we\u2019re focused on a number of new initiatives which we expect will bring value to both customers and shareholders. These include: launching our new premium economy product; continuing to reconfigure our fleet with renewal of the 737 fleet at Alaska in preparation for the possible introduction of regional jets at Horizon; growing the 20 new markets that we added in 2015; enhancing our alliance relationships primarily in the international arena; better marketing our mileage plan and credit card which have new benefits for members; and finally, further lowering our cost structure and making our fare advantage better known to customers. ","As I close, I want to thank our team of 15,000 people for an incredible year. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks, Brad and good morning everyone. We were very pleased with our 2015 passenger revenue which grew 4.7%. This is in contrast to the industry's revenue decline of 1%. We were within one point of industry unit revenue performance despite competitive capacity headwinds of 12%. ","For the fourth quarter, our revenue was up 5.5% against the backdrop of 9% increase in competitive capacity. That drove our PRASM down 6.6% but well within our expectations. We added 18 new markets in the second half of 2015 and 11 of those were in the fourth quarter. This is the largest number of new markets added in any single quarter in over a decade. ","And we understand there continue to be questions around our growth, so we went back and looked at a few data points that I want to share with you. These reinforce for us that we continue to take the right actions. First, our launch of 20 new markets over the last year brings our total North American destinations served from Seattle to 86, that\u2019s more than two times our closest competitor at 39. And this creates the best schedule utility for customers in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest. ","Second, notwithstanding a competitive onslaught, our growth has helped us maintain our Seattle market share at 51%. This is unchanged from three years ago, and our Seattle hub is performing exceptionally well. ","Third, our new markets are maturing quickly. The portfolio of new markets launched in the last 12 months are profitable. More importantly, half of these markets have only operated for one quarter, being our seasonally weakest Q4. ","And finally, as we highlighted at investor day, over the last five years we've added 90 new markets, grown capacity at a compounded annual growth rate of 7.6% and revenue at 7.9%. Industry\u2019s revenue grew at a rate of less than 3% over the same period. ","If you are asking, Andrew, what is your point here? The point is this: our total capacity growth over the past five years accounts for $1.8 billion, or a third of our revenues. Margins on this revenue are in line with system average. Said another way, our earnings per share would be approximately $2 lower than what we\u2019ve reported today had we decided to keep capacity flat. The bottom line is this: growth has been good for our customers, our employees and unquestionably, for our shareholders. And we believe that a thoughtful growth as a low-cost carrier that enjoys strong customer loyalty will increase our network utility, diversify our revenue base and create durable earnings streams. These outcomes far outweigh the short-term impact of RASM comps, which we are experiencing today and we will likely see through the first half of 2016. ","Moving to the performance of the broader commercial business. Our partnerships are growing. Over the last year we provided our customers with access to an incremental 60 international destinations and 3600 flights per day on which to earn and redeem miles. In fact, passengers on Alaska medal coming from Hainan, Icelandair and Emirates increased 43% in the fourth quarter as a result of our new agreements coupled with our partners\u2019 expanded service. ","Customer loyalty is growing at unprecedented rates even in the face of competition. Active mileage plan members are up 15.5% this year, outstripping passenger growth of 8.9%. This is the second consecutive year of double-digit growth in our mileage plan members. More impressive, our Elite members grew 19% pointing to increased stickiness with our brand. And our credit card members increased 11.6% making 2015 the strongest year for card member growth since we started tracking this data. ","Our affinity program generated nearly $700 million of cash flow in 2015 and will continue to grow 2016. And in speaking of 2016, I wanted to remind you of two very important initiatives that we announced at investor day in December that will further grow our revenue. ","First, we will introduce a Premium Class product on our 737s and our regional jets adding at least $85 million in annual profit by 2018. We\u2019ll start to retrofit existing aircraft in the second half of 2016 and will complete 75 aircraft by year-end. ","Second, our new agreement with Bank of America will add $60 million in new annual revenue starting in the first quarter of \u201816 and our affinity Visa card offers industry-leading benefits like no first bag fee, no international transaction costs, a companion fare and the lowest annual fee amongst comparable cards. We are confident that our card will remain top of wallet for existing holders and help us continue to grow the cardholder base and related revenues. ","And then finally, we will be adding two more regional jets to our network this month to fill a market need for an aircraft that can serve longer haul markets with demand that doesn't justify 737s. We will also be replacing our 8 CRJ-700s with Embraer 175s as they have an 8.5% more capacity and allow us to sell premium seats and give us greater range. This is an area where we think we have plenty of room for profitable growth in 2016 and beyond. The four markets we launched thus far are already profitable with six months -- within six months of launch. And Brandon is going to talk a bit more about this in a moment. ","Looking forward at capacity growth, Q1 is expected to be up 13.5% given a heavy new delivery schedule that meters down to 10.8% as we enter the seasonally strongest second quarter and we move to retire 737-400s. Today I am reiterating our 2016 full year growth expectation of 8%. We expect growth in the second half of 2016 to be in the neighborhood of 5%. ","Moving to competitive capacity, other airline [ph] capacity, competitive capacity is expected to be up 13% and 12% in Q1 and Q2 respectively. To reiterate what Brad said, we\u2019re optimistic about 2016. Underlying demand in our geography is strong. New markets continue to deliver and loyalty and credit card programs are growing. The new revenue initiatives we\u2019re implementing will deliver an annual run rate of $150 million. This gives us confidence that our growth is sound and that we will continue to deliver on shareholder returns. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks, Andrew and good morning everyone. As Brad said, fourth quarter adjusted earnings grew by 49% to $186 million and earnings per share grew by 55% to $1.46 per share. The record fourth quarter result brings our full year net profit to $842 million and earnings-per-share to $6.51 per share. Earnings-per-share has almost doubled since 2012 even in the face of unprecedented competition in our Seattle hub since that time. ","Similarly, our after-tax return on invested capital has grown from 13% in 2012 to 25.2% this year. Our net operating profit has more than doubled over that period, yet our invested capital base has grown by only 11%. We expect our ROIC to lead about 90% of the companies in the S&P 500 and all the 10 industrials in the index. ","Fourth quarter pre-tax profit grew by $86 million led by a $100 million decline in economic fuel costs. We recognize that low fuel prices will probably not last forever, so we remain focused on creating a permanent sustainable advantage by lowering non-fuel unit costs and increasing the fuel efficiency of our fleet. ","Fourth quarter ex-fuel unit costs declined by another 1.3% bringing full year non-fuel unit costs down eight-tenths of a percent. 2015 marks the sixth year in a row of non-fuel unit cost reduction and the 13th year out of the last 14 for the mainline. Looking ahead into 2016, we expect non-fuel unit costs to be down 1% on the 8% ASM growth, consistent with our investor day guidance. ","I might offer some thoughts on that track record. Every year now for 14 years we\u2019ve been chipping away unit costs and while each year -- in each individual year like a half a percent or 1.5% of cost reduction doesn't sound like a lot, the cumulative impact is enormous, especially when the competition has unit costs that are growing, albeit slowly. Because of that focus on productivity, our emphasis on low overhead and a general culture of frugality that's growing throughout Air Group, our cost structure today looks a lot like the low-cost carriers and is nearly 25% lower than the legacy carriers. ","And if you include fuel and non-operating expenses, our cost gap widens to 36%. To borrow Brad\u2019s phrase that he used at investor day, our economic moat is getting wider and it gives us confidence about the sustainability of our results. ","As I mentioned, we remain focused on having one of the most fuel-efficient fleets in the industry. In 2015, our fuel efficiency on an ASM per gallon basis improved by another 2%, with much of that coming from the delivery during the year of 11 737-900 ERs and the installation of split scimitar winglets across the majority of the Boeing fleet. This year's improvement extends the cumulative fuel efficiency improvement over the last 10 years to 24% and the trend should continue in 2016 as we take delivery of 19 new 737-900 ERs, phase out 13 older, less efficient and maintenance intensive 737-400s and add longer stage length regional flight. ","And speaking of regional flight, Andrew mentioned the profitable growth opportunities we see with large regional jets. In order to fund that growth and to replace 15 Q400s that are scheduled for lease return in 2018, we are in the final phase of a regional jet campaign. It\u2019s likely that we will place an order for 30 large regional jets in the first quarter of 2016 with delivery starting in 2017, if we can reach acceptable commercial terms with the parties involved. Our intent is for those jets to be flown by Horizon, if our pilots and flight attendants approve changes to their collective bargaining agreements that will make them cost competitive with other CPA providers. Voting is taking place now. ","SkyWest has a great job operating regional jets for us today and they will continue to operate them in our network despite us potentially bringing some of that jet flying back in-house. Alaska ended the year with $1.3 billion in cash. Operating cash flow increased by 54% to almost $1.6 billion. 2015 marks the second year in a row of operating cash flow in excess of $1 billion. CapEx was just under $800 million resulting in free cash flow of almost $800 million. ","We used that considerable free cash flow to buy back 7.2 million shares of our common stock or about 5.5% of the shares outstanding. It\u2019s noteworthy that going back to 2007 we bought back 35% of the company. In addition, we paid $102 million in dividends bringing total return to shareholder to $607 million. Our announcement today that we\u2019re increasing our dividends by 38% reaffirms our board\u2019s confidence in the sustainability of our cash flows is consistent with our goal of creating a track record of dividend increases, like other high quality industrial companies and makes Alaska the highest yielding stock among US airlines that pay a regular dividend. ","Normal principal payments of $116 million brought our long-term debt balance to $686 million. We\u2019re now on a $300 million net cash position even after including operating leases. Alaska's adjusted debt to cap ratios stand at 27%, this compares with the median S&P 500 debt to cap ratio of 45%. We have 78 unencumbered mainline aircraft and 86 unencumbered aircraft overall. Our pensions are 92% funded on a GAAP basis and we have no required contributions again in 2016. ","Alaska remains one of only two US airlines to have an investment-grade balance sheet. And of course, in a rising interest rate environment, our low debt levels will further widen our cost gap versus competitors who are more highly leveraged. We expect to generate very strong cash flow again in 2016. We currently project CapEx to be $705 million next year, including options but excluding CapEx associated with the regional jet order, which could add up to $90 million next year bringing the total close to $800 million. Using consensus estimates, that would imply a free cash flow of nearly $650 million and free cash flow yield of over 7%. We still expect to return more capital to owners in 2016 than we did in 2015, both through our higher dividend and through share buybacks. We have $880 million remaining on our $1 billion repurchase authorization. ","As we enter 2016, our business is working well. We\u2019re safe, we run the most reliable operation in the business. We\u2019re delivering award-winning service. Customer preference has never been higher. Our labor relations are excellent and contracts have an average length of just under three years. Our costs are low and they are getting lower. Our investment-grade balance sheet is getting stronger. Our new cash flow streams are earnings accretive. We\u2019re returning record amounts of cash to our shareholders and more importantly and most importantly, our people are engaged and we\u2019re confident in their ability to continue to do great things in 2016. ","And with that, we\u2019d like to open it up to questions that you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth ","Hey good morning, everyone. On the regional jet kind of strategy here, I wonder if you could just elaborate a little bit more about -- I know the E175 success you've had, but I think the Q400s also served a purpose along the West Coast and maybe even in Alaska. Just wondering what the thinking behind taking down that fleet was? And if you don't get the pilot deal, would you reverse that thinking or pilot and flight attendant deal? Or would you go forward with it just maybe with a third-party carrier?","Brandon Pedersen","Savi, it's Brandon. Good morning. Maybe I'll start and Andrew can jump in. As we think about the regional jets, the opportunity here is as follows: One is they have increased reach versus the Q400. It delivers a better passenger experience, especially on those longer stage length missions than the Q400. Our competition, frankly, is using those in many of our markets and I think we want to make sure that we are staying on par or better with the customer experience side. We have a much higher revenue opportunity with a three-class cabin and actually, in excess of 400 miles, the regional jet has a lower trip cost. The Q400 has been a great airplane for us and it works well in the short stage lengths around the Pacific Northwest, but I think there's an opportunity to tap into lots of new revenue opportunities with the regional jet by bringing some of those in-house.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani ","Hi gentlemen, thanks for your time. Just a question on competitive capacity. It seems like it continues to grow as we look at the next couple of quarters. Can you just talk about why that is? And just in particular it seems like there are gate constraints at the Seattle Airport, which would tell us that there shouldn't be growth, but it seems like there is. I'd just like to understand that dynamic a bit better, if that makes sense.","Andrew Harrison ","Rajeev, it's Andrew. As we've shared, competitive capacity is up 13% for the next few quarters. A lot of this is annualization of competitive capacity that was already announced in 2015 and started in 2015. As we have been talking, this is something that we spend a lot of time preparing for and equipping ourselves for with our low-cost strong customer base. So we very much have this in our sites.","As it relates to Sea-Tac, I think it's one -- you're right -- it's getting a little fuller, certainly at the peak times. And it's one, if you want to fly at certain peak times, there's trade-offs to be made. In some of the lull periods there's still space. But overall we think that we still have a lot of good opportunity at Sea-Tac as we continue to grow our network and mature our new markets.","Rajeev Lalwani ","Okay. But Andrew, in terms of the competitive capacity, I mean, is most of it just lapping? It seems like we've been hearing of announcements from folks like a Spirit and American. I guess I'm just wondering if it's more than just a lapping dynamic.","Andrew Harrison ","No, there is some new -- you're obviously aware of the major reasons of the growth. But as we look at the Q1 and Q2, of the 13% in the second quarter, about 2.5 points of that 13% is actually ULCC growth. And we\u2019ve also seen some Southwest growth as well. So there is some new growth in those figures, for sure, as we move forward.","Lavanya Sareen ","Rajeev, this is Lavanya. Just to keep in mind, ULCC has added four flights on top of our 900 daily flights. Some of it gets exacerbated because of the weighting that we use and we spoke to you guys about in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse.","Julie Yates ","Andrew, I appreciate the reiteration of the capacity guidance for \u201816, but thinking about how 2015 trended, and I think you ended up about 250 bps higher than your original guidance. Q1 is about 50 bps higher than where you were in October. How are you thinking about incremental capacity growth in \u201816 with crude sub $30 and competitors continuing to aggressively enter Alaska markets?","Andrew Harrison ","Thanks, Julie. I'm not -- it's a good question. I knew I was going to be held accountable for my 8% guidance growing pretty large. That's actually why I have reiterated. I think what I would share with you is in 2015 -- and I think we've sort of been transparent here -- is that a part of that was bringing forward some of the growth to continue to grow Seattle at a higher rate than we initially planned to do. But as we move into 2016 -- and yes, we are a little higher in the first quarter -- we're getting a lot of deliveries this year. We're getting 19 ERs. They are heavily loaded to the front end, and we don't start pushing out our 400s till the middle of the year and there's 13 of those. So we are a little higher in the first half of the year than we would like to, but as we move into the back part of the year I think we're going to be around 5% or so.","And the other thing is we have a lot of mod lines going now putting ATG-4 Wi-Fi on as well as mods for premium economy. So we are going to be using a lot of those aircraft to get all of that done by the end of the year. So I feel fairly confident about where we sit today with our capacity guidance.","Julie Yates ","Is there flexibility to delay the retirements on the -400s or even accelerate deliveries if you wanted to? Or is there room still in utilization if you wanted to push the growth above 8%?","Andrew Harrison ","The Chief Operating Officer is looking at me right now and if I was to extend the 400s I may lose some body parts. So the reality is the 400s are going, we really need those to leave because of training and all sorts of other things. New deliveries are all fixed. I think the opportunity for us is if we wanted to grow more, we certainly have utilization play. And certainly, if we want to reduce capacity, we can do that by getting things through the mod lines. At the end of the day, we're going to do what's best for Air Group and we do have that flexibility.","Brad Tilden ","Julie, this is Brad. I might just sort of add on. The calculus is sort of risk\/return. And as you guys have seen, we have had tremendous success putting this new capacity in the markets; the returns have been there. Most of the markets we added in 2015 were profitable in the first three months, but there is risk to growing at a higher level over a sustained period of time. There's risk and so we're sitting here trying to balance our presence in Seattle, which is an incredible economic engine for the company, taking advantage of market opportunities while sort of measuring risk.","So I think today we want to reiterate that our long-term mindset is 4% to 8% growth. When we see more opportunities we will be at the higher end of that, but that is our mindset and that's what we want you to know.","Julie Yates ","Okay, very helpful. And then maybe just one last one for Andrew. How should we think about the impacts from Easter to Q1 unit revenues just conceptually? How would that typically impact your network?","Shane Tackett ","So I might -- this is Shane Tackett with Revenue Management. It's not a ton. There is obviously the shift. I think we're calling it about a point to 1.5 points, coming out of April and going into March.","Julie Yates ","Okay. That's for the quarter or that's for the month?","Shane Tackett ","It would be between the two months.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay ","Brandon, you sound very fired up and passionate in your prepared remarks, like more than usual. I'm wondering if that is sort of because you are displeased with the stock performance this year. And the question that I have is how do you think about the buyback? One of the things you guys have done better in the last couple years is has been a little more opportunistic about the timing of when you buy on pullbacks. But do you think about ramping it up significantly when it pulls back like this, if you are not blacked out tomorrow? Not just because you get the chance to buy it cheaper, but because you get a chance to sort of send the message that if this happens again and if your stock goes down like it has gone down as much as it has lately, that you will be there to take advantage of it and to support it. Do you think about that?","Brandon Pedersen ","Good morning, Hunter. It's Brandon. I had a triple latte on the way to work today. That's why I'm fired up. And I do have a high degree of anxiety about the decline of the stock price since the start of the year. But in terms of execution, Mark is the guy to talk about that.","Mark Eliasen ","Yes, hey Hunter, it's Mark Eliasen. And we are opportunistic and we also are programmatic with our stock buyback. We do buy more shares when it's down, and you've seen our behavior in the past. I can't comment on specific actions we might take, but we are aware of where the stock is trading and we do aggressively buy the stock.","Brad Tilden ","And the algebra of buying back the stock at lower prices rather than higher prices is very good for the owners of this business.","Hunter Keay ","And then, Andrew, one of the big topics sort of over the last six to nine months has been this concept of customer segmentation. It's really only something that\u2019s really been talked about in the context of the legacy guys competing against ULCCs as the goal is to sort of prevent business travelers from buying fares that are designed to sell to leisure travelers. You guys highlighted today that you have about a third of your passengers coming from business travel. So is there a level of self-cannibalizations that you are not happy about right now as it relates to sort of how you manage that? And, if so, are there any sort of IT-based projects underway -- IT-based projects I'm saying, not seat reconfiguration -- underway to sort of address it, particularly as you see ULCC growth ramp in your markets?","Andrew Harrison ","Hunter, I think I'm going to have Shane Tackett, VP of RM, answer that question. He has been spending a lot of time on that subject.","Shane Tackett ","Hunter, I hope I answer the right question. We have been in a unique position, maybe not strategically, but we have nonetheless to be able to watch how other legacy carriers have handled sort of the segmentation at the lower end of the demand curve. And we have been sort of interested to see how that has played out, how they have developed the different fare products, and whether or not we think that we actually need to develop something like that on our own. If we did feel like we needed to access that part of the demand curve, we could. There's not a lot of IT hurdle in the way. We could develop a product and get it to market pretty quickly.","Our sort of history with this, albeit small, certainly out of Portland where we have faced the ULCC competition, is we haven't felt the need to use those types of products. We think our customers not only appreciate the superior product we have, but recognize we have already very low fares. And so our differences in fare price for the leisure-focused traveler that ULCCs are going after is much closer than maybe some of the other carriers have had to experience in their market. So thus far we haven't had to do it, but we could if we need to.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg ","I guess, couple questions here. Hey, I just want to go back to your competitive capacity; I think you said 13% March quarter, 12% June quarter. Does that -- and I realize -- I'm not sure if this is in the number or not, but American put out some new markets yesterday and it looks like things like LA-Anchorage, LA-Portland, LA-Seattle. Is that in that number?","Andrew Harrison ","No, it is not. I understand that will be starting maybe in June, so that wouldn't need to be added to our number.","Michael Linenberg ","And then, Andrew, since I have you on, I mean, when I think about your relationship and how you are sort of moving away from Delta and moving closer to American, I was actually surprised by the number of frequencies that American is putting in those markets. Those are important markets for you. When I think about LA-Seattle, LA-Portland, those markets are pretty well served. I mean so, it just was a bit of a surprise. Any thoughts on that or maybe you can't say anything about that?","Andrew Harrison ","I can't say a whole lot except to say that I read the press like you do and it's very clear to me that what American is doing is continuing to fortify their position in Los Angeles. I think Seattle is probably in the top 10 largest O&Ds on the planet and they've decided to serve that with their own medal. Again, we have code on each other and we are looking at that, but at the end of the day they are doing what I see is in their best interests.","Brad Tilden ","I think, Andrew, you are saying this but -- and, Mike, we actually need to think about this more ourselves. But I think what could be happening here is this is more about LA than Seattle. And there's a couple of airlines that are going to be fighting for dominance in LAX with the consolidation that\u2019s happened in the industry and with what\u2019s happening with LA facilities. And that actually may be the story here.","Michael Linenberg ","Okay, that's helpful. And then just lastly, the large regional jets that you are looking at to replace the Q400s, are those large regional jets of a similar size or could we be looking at larger aircraft, 90 seaters, 100 seaters, being flown at Horizon?","Andrew Harrison ","76 seat aircraft.","Operator","Your next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Helane Becker ","Thanks very much, operator. Hi guys, thanks for the time. Have you guys thought about a 100-seat aircraft?","Brandon Pedersen ","Good morning, Helane. It's Brandon. Actually, we've thought about it but right now we're moving forward with a 76-seat regional jet at Horizon and we're also comfortable with 737s at Alaska. We love the simplicity of that. We recognize there might be a hole in the market, but we're not doing anything at this point to suggest that we would move forward with a 100-seat type aircraft.","Andrew Harrison ","Helane, we have a good number of 737-700s which very much fit that gap between the 76 and the 163.","Helane Becker ","And then my other question is, have you guys tried to quantify what percent of the fuel cost decline you've been able to keep in your pricing?","Lavanya Sareen ","Helane, this is Lavanya. This is obviously rough math of what's coming down to the bottom line, but about two-thirds is what we are bringing to the bottom line.","Helane Becker ","Great. I think those where my only two questions, actually.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie Baker ","Hello. Good morning, two questions. When we think about the RASM declines at Alaska, they are comparatively unique to those of the industry in that they are mostly representative of the increased competition, as opposed to the elimination of fuel surcharges, a strong dollar, a crappy Brazil, and so forth. Fuel is obviously a blessing for you here. But if and when fuel escalates, your competitors are actually going to be picking up RASM along the way that you won't, save maybe for budgets improving in the state of Alaska. So I am just wondering if you are content with what appears to be a virtual guarantee of significant margin compression if fuel begins to escalate. And if you are not, does that alter your view on the optimal network construct and\/or your opinion on consolidation?","Brandon Pedersen ","Jamie, it's Brandon. That's a super complicated question. I have [ph] trouble following it. We're not that smart out here in the Pacific Northwest. I guess what I would say is -- and I addressed it a little bit in my prepared remarks, which is we don't have a belief that fuel is going to be $28 a barrel WTI forever. And what I would say is that no public company can report record earnings quarter after quarter after quarter.","And the other thing I would say is we are generating really, really, really outstanding returns right now. If fuel goes up, I think it is possible that you could see margins come down. In terms of the broader strategy, what we're -- it goes back to something maybe that Brad said, which is we're going to do the right thing for Alaska. We do have a profit hurdle internally. Most of our markets are well above that -- most of our markets would be well above that at $3 fuel. And so we're going to continue to -- we are very satisfied with the networking and we're going to continue to do what's right. If fuel prices go up, we may adjust capacity, but again we have a view on what our network should look like because we have internal profit targets that those routes need to meet.","Brad Tilden ","Jamie \u2013 ","Jamie Baker ","No, I am sorry, were you going to add something?","Brad Tilden ","Yes, I was going to add that I think the industry today is different than where it was six or eight or 10 years ago. These airlines are run by business people. People want to have earnings. They want to have returns on capital. I think that if fuel prices go up, as they did four or five years ago, I think you will see people adjust capacity throughout the industry. And that makes us optimistic.","And again, I think to get to your point about margin compression, Alaska's financial performance comes from our competitive advantage. It doesn't come from international exchange rate or Brazilian currency or anything. It comes from us having a cost structure that\u2019s 36% lower than the other guys when you factor in fuel and interest costs. It comes from the fact that customers prefer to fly with us. We have incredible loyalty in Seattle. It comes from a very strong balance sheet, the right fleet. So I sort of think -- whatever, the world is going to move -- what we get thrown our way is going to change from time to time, but I personally think this company has pretty strong competitive advantage that\u2019s going to serve us well no matter what environment we're competing in.","Jamie Baker ","Those are all helpful observations. Second question, if you did want to lock in the forward curve or something shaped similar to where the forward curve is today, say for the next 12 months, what sort of premium do you think you would have to pay? In other words, how much would oil have to move against you before a big hedging bet became profitable?","Mark Eliasen ","Hey Jamie, this is Mark. First of all, I don't think you would see us taking a big hedging bet there. We like the way we're working right now. The forward curve is nice and low. It's something like $50 a barrel or below that looking out for a long time. So we could do something like that, but we kind of like our program the way it's working right now.","Jamie Baker ","Oh, no, I wasn't suggesting that you should or you need to. I am just kind of -- I'm just trying to gather some information on where hedged premiums might be right now, because it feels like if you did or if anybody did, it would be less a hedge and more of just a sheer bet that oil prices would be moving higher. I was just trying to quantify the expense.","Mark Eliasen ","Yes, that's exactly it. It's about $3 a barrel is what we're paying right now for hedging. ","One thing back to your earlier question, Jamie, I just wanted to explain [ph] about what we're doing and what happens if fuel goes up is, as you know, we are retiring all of our 737-400 Classics and those burn about 935 gallons an hour. And we're replacing those with 900ERs and those burn about 910 gallons an hour. So you can see we are getting more fuel efficient as we get rid of those aircraft.","Brad Tilden ","And adding -- going from 144 to 181 seats.","Mark Eliasen ","That's right. And it adds 37 more seats so that's a huge plus, lower fuel burn with more seats. So that helps us over the long run as well.","Lavanya Sareen ","Jamie, not to pile on here, but just to throw another stat out there, so in a rising fuel environment, we are 25% more efficient than the industry. That helps us. And, two, if you go back to \u201809 we had eight aircraft that were unencumbered. If fuel spikes up or the economy turns, which some people suspect it might, we've got today 86 aircraft that are unencumbered and we'll be well positioned for that.","Jamie Baker ","I appreciate everybody piling on. I'm off to get my own triple latte. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Darryl Genovesi with UBS.","Darryl Genovesi ","Hey, Brandon, at the investor day you alluded to the possibility of being a net borrower this year in order to fund the buyback. With the stock market turmoil and concerns about global growth, granted it doesn't seem like we're seeing any major affect at the US airlines yet. But have you -- I guess are you still thinking about your leverage in the same way as maybe you were at the investor day? I realize it's very low to begin with, but just wondering if you are still thinking about potentially being a net borrower.","Brandon Pedersen ","Good morning, Darryl. Yes, I think we are. I think that our balance sheet is -- I would call it a fortress balance sheet right now. Our debt-to-cap is low. If there is a recession, there is no better positioned airline than Alaska. But the amount that we were talking about borrowing, I think at the investor day we put up on the slide maybe $100 million to $200 million, that's pretty small in the grand scheme of things. It certainly does not put the company at any more risk, recession or not. So we are very open to continuing to look at borrowing to manage the capital structure and would likely do so in 2016.","Darryl Genovesi ","And then on CapEx, it looked like from your investor update [ph] that you split some deposits forward in the fourth quarter. We've actually seen that at another airline this quarter as well. Just wondering what's driving that and if you are getting better pricing as a result of making the deposits earlier.","Mark Eliasen ","Darryl, this is Mark. I will just say that we did do that. It was a favor to one of our manufacturers and it does help us out. Favors go back and forth. We have a great partnership with both of our manufacturers and we do that from time to time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth ","I wonder can you just talk about demand in the state of Alaska, if there's been any change there? I don't know to what extent it's a source of corporate bookings for you. And obviously, there is this annual dividend. We get questions on that from time to time. Is there any change in demand trends given the decline in energy prices here?","Joe Sprague ","Hey Duane, this is Joe Sprague. And since I just got back from Juneau late last night, people are pointing at me to take this one, so I will give it a shot. I know there's some question about oil activity, oil business-related activity in the state of Alaska. And I think the first thing I would just say is that despite Alaska, the state being known for its oil reserves and its oil production, our exposure on that front is actually relatively small. We get business, oil-related business obviously flying our scheduled flight up to Prudhoe Bay, and then we get additional oil-related business because there's so many of the oilfield workers that actually live outside of Alaska and commute to work. And so we do get revenue from that activity. I would say it's fairly stable. A lot of the oilfield production workers, although production is declining, those oilfields still require the same amount of workers to sort of operate the drills and the pipelines and so forth, and so it's actually very stable business.","I think that we probably will see a bit of a reduction in the exploration for new oil deposits, but that's a much smaller portion of our overall oil portfolio. So bottom line is I think that our exposure on the oil side is minimal and stable. Beyond that, obviously the state is having some issues because of the fact that they get most of the state revenue from oil reserves, oil royalties and so forth. And so there is a lot of question about this permanent fund dividend check that all of the state residents receive. However, that\u2019s tied more to overall market performance at this point than it is to oil prices. So ironically in 2015, the PFD check that all residents received was over $2000, and that was actually up from 2014. So some of the proposals floating around in the legislature might take that number down. It won't eliminate it by any means. And I think as you look at some of the other factors for travel in the state of Alaska, a lot of the intra-Alaska travel by residents is nondiscretionary because they just -- they have to go. There's no roads in a lot of cases.","And then another big driver over the course of the year for travel in the state of Alaska is tourism, which is actually up. They had their best year ever in 2015 and they are expecting another good year in 2016. So all-in-all I think we could see stable demand in the state of Alaska.","Duane Pfennigwerth ","All right, that's great. That's helpful color. And then just a brand question. Given your excellent product, service, and reliability, how do you think about balancing that perception for customers that end up on segments operated by your partners? Let's say just a hypothetical example, a customer books an Alaska flight that\u2019s actually an American code share, which is actually operating on an RJ by Mesa. Purely hypothetical, how do you think about managing that customer experience?","Andrew Harrison ","This is Andrew. I think the good news is that as we have continued to grow, and I think I have shared in the past, just a massive amount of passengers are actually traveling on our own new, expanded network. Most of that experience you are referring to is going behind big partners' hubs. And we try to be very clear on our confirmation records and everything else who they will be flying and what they will be flying. But from all the surveys and everything we receive, we don't see any indication that instances like that have any real impact on our customers.","Ben Minicucci ","Duane, this is Ben Minicucci. We do a lot of business with SkyWest regional jets. I have folks today with SkyWest reviewing their performance on a quarterly basis. So whether it's safety performance, operational performance, customer satisfaction performance, we hold our CPA carriers to a very high standard, the same high standard as Alaska.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew Didora ","Great. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for the question here. I guess a follow-up to Andrew just on the competitive capacity here. Certainly appreciate the update. It seems like the 2Q numbers moving to up 12% from I think it was up 8% as of last quarter is largely coming from the Spirit and Southwest routes that were announced. I guess, one, do you have an initial read on 3Q competitive capacity? And then, two, with the ULCCs growing more, how do you think about the impact to pricing in your markets, if any? And what do you plan to do to adjust to these new entrants? Thanks.","Andrew Harrison ","I will take the first part and I will hand Shane the second. So Q3 right now, if you just run the numbers, recognizing there's still industry changes, it's about up 13% again. So I'm not personally expecting competitive capacity to abate anytime soon. But also, as I shared earlier, as we implement new initiatives as well as dial back our own growth in the back half of the year, I feel very good about where we sit. Shane, on the pricing?","Shane Tackett ","Yes, on pricing, and I'll just reiterate what I said earlier, we haven't in the past really felt the need to match sort of the published structured price points that ULCCs have brought and we still perform very well. If you actually look at some of the markets out of Portland, we will typically in a market operate more seats than the ULCCs do and outperform on both load factor and yield and have done so over a series of quarters. So I think our product has held up very well, our loyalty has held up very well. We have incredible point-of-sale strength out of Seattle. I don't really think that that part of the market, the Seattle part of the market, is where they're focused on. So we've seen stability in the structured price environment even as they have come in. And that\u2019s sort of what we anticipate. If something changes, we will obviously react to it and defend our market share if we need to.","Andrew Didora ","And then one follow-up for Andrew. I think on the last call you said your forward load factors for November and December were flat to slightly up, but I guess the realized loads were down about a point in those months. Was that something you were anticipating or what changed over the course of the quarter that caused that to decelerate a bit? ","Shane Tackett ","This is Shane again. I know we issue, at times, where we actually are. I don't know that we actually give sort of end-of-period guidance. So I think the numbers that we've shared are just where we are right now. Anytime we grow capacity at a sizable rate we're always looking to book ahead of the booking curve last year. Sort of get out in front of it, get as much leisure traffic as we can. We don't see the same sort of elasticity for the close-in traffic. It's more stable. We know that it's not going to grow at the same rate as capacity does. So we totally anticipate that those early load factor gaps would decline towards sort of flattish performance year over year. And that's typically what our goal is to keep flat load factor performance year over year. Sometimes we hit, we often do. Sometimes we are a little bit shy of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Simpson with Barclays.","David Simpson ","A question on that third of your volume that\u2019s corporate, particularly technology travel. I would think you guys are sort of overweight technology travel versus the industry. I'm just curious if you are getting any sense of fear or concern that maybe some of the weakness in energy and industrial travel in the economy may be feeding into technology. Just anything you are hearing there.","Joe Sprague ","David, this is Joe again. Nothing too specific there. I\u2019ve already sort of covered our exposure on the energy stuff is largely tied to the state of Alaska, so you've got the background on that. Certainly here in Seattle, where we have far and away our greatest utility for corporate travelers, we have the benefit of a lot of technology companies here in Seattle and they are traveling a lot. They are doing quite well and we're seeing good strength on that front.","David Simpson ","So you are not hearing anything out of travel managers that would make you nervous that this malaise may spread?","Joe Sprague ","Not at this time, David.","David Simpson ","And then just a quick one on the credit card spend, the $60 million for the year. Does that phase in fairly evenly through the year, or is there a ramp up we should be thinking through the quarters?","Brandon Pedersen ","David, it's Brandon. The cash starts immediately and there's no phase up on the cash. But as you get into the revenue recognition, there may be a little bit of a lag that comes with that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Dan McKenzie ","Two quick housecleaning questions here. Will Alaska code share with American on their newly-announced capacity adds? Then, secondly, the plan to borrow in 2016, Brandon, what is the new optimal leverage target that you want to get to?","Andrew Harrison ","Dan, I won't be able to comment on that first question.","Brandon Pedersen ","Dan, Mark will take the second question.","Mark Eliasen ","Yes, so, Dan, I will just tell you that we don't have an exact number. What we know is that high-quality industrials do have more leverage than we do. They are in the 40% to 45% range. As you know, we are down at 27%. So we don't have a target. We know that we've got some room to grow there and we will be borrowing in the next couple of years.","Dan McKenzie ","I see. And then, Andrew, I appreciate the commentary around competitive capacity, but as I look at the schedules data it doesn't look like Delta is impacting any new revenue streams sequentially in the first quarter. So as I look at the DOT data here, I believe Delta impacted about 69% of Alaska's local revenue at Seattle in the fourth quarter and it's that same 69% that\u2019s really affected in the first quarter. And if we move to second quarter it looks like it might tick up to 71%. So if we are trying to really isolate the incremental revenue headwinds from Delta, it seems like the damage has mostly been done. But first, is my analysis close or correct? And then, secondly, what do we really need to keep in mind? Because the competitive growth -- the growth in competitive capacity sounds a lot worse than what it might actually be as I look at the underlying data.","Andrew Harrison ","Dan, your analysis is spot on. Essentially really for the first three quarters it was 100% associated with one carrier, but as we move forward you have some Southwest and some ULCCs. And the other thing that we\u2019re seeing a little bit too is that the big network guys have been adding to their hubs, which we fly to many of the hubs. So that's the other piece that's replacing the decline in Delta's impact.","Operator","We have time for one final question and that question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savi Syth ","Thanks for the follow-up. Just a quick question on Seattle. I know it's been talked about and you mentioned the tightness in capacity availability, especially in the peak times. How do you manage your growth around that tight capacity?","Ben Minicucci ","Savi, it's Ben. I think the first thing to do is, between Andrew's group and mine, we just work really closely in Seattle, and what we do is we just model every time of day, not only our schedule, but all the other airlines' schedule, and we map out by hour, by 15-minute increments how we can best manage the schedule. And if we move things around by 10 minutes or so. That's kind of how we do it.","So we have all the departures, all the arrivals and we model it out and then we figure out the best schedule to fit -- to fit, to optimize our network.","End of Q&A","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to Brad Tilden for any closing comments.","Brad Tilden ","Thanks, everybody.

Last quarter and at our Investor Day in November, we discussed our multiyear plan to produce profit margins averaging 13% to 15% over the business cycle.","We also discussed our intent to achieve those margins by improving performance in the controllable parts of our operations. Viewed through that lens, the first quarter results were solid. On the revenue side, our initiatives began to deliver on schedule and in some cases, ahead of schedule. And on the cost side, we outperformed our guidance by delivering better productivity than we planned despite completing fewer ASMs than planned. So in factors we control that drive long-term value, we're headed in the right direction. That said, the underlying improvements we're making to the business were masked somewhat by two unusual factors: first, a series of winter storms in February that significantly disrupted our operations; and second, a substantial drop in close-in fares in our California and New York-based transcon markets, which extended through most of the quarter.","These items had a significant impact on our revenues. And though we are not satisfied with our results, even if we exclude the impact of these events, when we do adjust to the noise they created, we see our initiatives gaining traction, and we see momentum in the business. To put it more directly, we believe we're on track to deliver higher margins and returns in 2019 as we indicated last quarter and at Investor Day.","Regarding the storms, I want to first thank our terrific employees who through their skill and determination got us through the most significant winter weather the Pacific Northwest has seen in 50 years. Our teams went above and beyond to keep our guests and each other safe, and to minimize the number of flights we had to cancel. We did end up canceling 1,100 flights. Our customer service and reservations agents did an outstanding job dealing with the cancels and reaccommodating our guests who were impacted. We're grateful to all teams across the organization who worked diligently to keep the airline moving during this time.","And looking ahead, we're optimistic about the rest of 2019. The summer travel season is almost upon us, it should provide a more stable pricing and operating environment. And the integration with Virgin America is largely behind us. We're on track to realize $330 million in revenue synergies and initiatives this year, and we'll harness these opportunities to improve our margins and grow earnings per share. We slowed our growth to let recent investments mature and to focus our energies on making better use of what we have.","We're investing in our people and our product, and we're coming together as one team to realize the great potential of our platform. As we do these things, we will be leveraging our competitive advantage over a larger and more powerful route network, and our profitability will improve. And as our margins improve, we'll also get back to growing the airline, albeit, at a more moderate 4% to 6% annual pace that we believe is appropriate given the size of our business today. We got a lot to cover today. So at this point, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Ben Minicucci, our President and Chief Operating Officer. As a reminder, Ben took on expanded commercial responsibilities in September of last year with the changes we made to our old structure. Ben, over to you.","Benito Minicucci","Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. After years of participating in these calls and responding to your questions during Q&A, I'm pleased to participate in our prepared remarks today and provide you with an update on our business. In the first quarter, total revenues grew 2.4% year-over-year to $1.9 billion on roughly flat capacity, as unit revenues increased 2.2%. Our pretax margin improved to 1.5%, 20 basis points better than prior year, and our adjusted earnings per share also improved versus 2018.","I'd like to echo Brad's comments that we're encouraged with the progress we're making towards our multiyear goals despite the challenges we faced last quarter. With the integration almost complete, our attention has turned to streamlining and improving our business at the core. As we implement the initiatives on our roadmap, we're building greater awareness of our brand, aligning our guest experience, improving our product, and starting to make headway on productivity. All of these efforts tie back to our strategy of attracting new customers and building guest loyalty in West Coast markets. Here are a few examples of our team's recent accomplishments: first, we began to capture material revenue synergies as we swap more of our Boeing and Airbus aircraft into the most appropriate routes. As of March, we had cross fleeted our higher gauge, lower unit cost Boeing aircraft into the most capacity-constrained markets with overflow demand. This will improve our margins going forward, especially during the peak summer season; second, we've now repainted 66 of our 71 Airbus aircrafts, and we'll complete all 71 by June.","Airbus interior renovations are also in full swing, and Andrew will provide a further update on those in a moment. Third, our flight attendants began flying together as fully-integrated teams on January 31; fourth, last week, we completed our Flight Path program, a series of face-to-face workshops with our people to reinforce our culture and bring us together as one team.","Over 20,000 employees attended these sessions with leadership over the past 6 months, and they've helped us move forward as one team toward our strategic and financial goals; fifth, although our operating performance was really challenged in February, as we navigated the winter storms, our team recovered well and took great care of guests. Key performance metrics have improved substantially in March and our departures on zero and controllable departures on zero are looking quite good in April. Sixth, we launched our new Saver Fare product in January. This was the most significant change we've made to our product and pricing lineup in years. And as we adapt to it operationally and respond to questions from some of our guests, the incremental revenue it has generated has thus far exceeded our expectations. And last but not least, we continue to enhance our network and product. In March, we launched service from Paine Field and added new international connections through our global partners. We are also upgrading our cabins, over Wi-Fi offering, employee uniforms, and the guest experience at the airport with the opening of the North Satellite terminal at Seattle in June. Each of the steps are making our airline more accessible, attractive and valuable than ever for our guests.","Our momentum continues to build on all these fronts. We still have a lot of work ahead. We are making good progress optimizing our network, building guest loyalty, and ultimately, increasing our profitability.","Before I turn the call over to Andrew, I would like to comment briefly on our longer-term growth potential. We always said the merger with Virgin America was about growth. And we still stay that today, however, given our slower growth this year, some investors have asked whether our thinking on this has changed. A short answer to that is no. We still see lots of opportunity for profitable growth, especially in California, leveraging the valuable airport assets we acquired with the merger. We're taking a pause this year to let our recent network investments mature and increase returns. But beyond this year, we will leverage our competitive advantages especially, our low costs, our award-winning service, and our generous loyalty program to continue delivering profitable growth in the years ahead as we've done historically. We're just getting started on what we can and will deliver for our guests, our employees and our owners, and we are confident that our trajectory is heading upward. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew for his commercial updates.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks, Ben, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll be covering our first quarter revenue performance, updates to our product and service, and where we see Q2 revenues given what we know today.","As Ben just stated, in the first quarter, total revenues rose 2.4% to $1.9 billion, and a RASM increase of 2.2%. Despite navigating severe winter storms and the collapse of the close-in industry pricing that lasted for an 11-week period in California-based transcon markets, we still delivered on our goal to outperform our domestic peers on unit revenue growth. The first quarter can present challenges. Given it's seasonally our weakest, but this year was especially choppy with close-in fares, which we highlighted on last quarter's call.","When this noise behind us, we see positive revenue momentum heading into the spring and summer. Close-in fares have firmed over the past month and our synergies and other initiatives are set to reach their full run rates mid-second quarter. Before turning to the future though, I would like to provide more insight into the puts and takes that resulted in our 2.2% RASM increase in the first quarter. So in terms of tailwinds, our synergies and initiatives ramped up on schedule and contributed a combined 300 basis points of RASM increase.","Saver Fare, the largest component of these, exceeded our expectations as more guests chose to buy out of the product than we planned. As Saver and other initiatives reached their run rates in Q2, we expect this tailwind to grow. Due to the initiative strength as well as pockets of improved pricing, we saw many areas of strength in the quarter. 9 of our 11 operating regions delivered positive unit revenues and some significantly so, compared to our West Coast yield environment that was up only slightly. Our loyalty member base and credit cardholders also continue to grow, especially in California. Total Mileage Plan revenues grew 7.3% or 3x faster than our overall revenues.","Now moving to headwinds. The winter storms and the 1,100 cancellations they caused in February directly reduced Q1 revenues by $15 million and Q1 RASM by 20 basis points. In addition, California transcon markets, specifically San Francisco and Los Angeles to the New York Metro and Boston airports, were one of two operating regions to experience negative RASM in Q1. These markets representing 14% of our network saw significant weakness in close-in pricing from January through mid-March.","Since tickets purchased close to departure date generally sell for above-average prices, this close-in weakness had a material, 110 basis impact on Q1 and explains most of the variance to our original guidance. These prices were isolated, however, and do not affect the way we think about our revenue trajectory for the rest of the year. Close-in fares rebounded significantly in mid-March and have continued to firm since, consistent with their typical seasonal pattern.","We are cautiously optimistic on California transcon pricing as we head into the spring and summer. Hawaii was the only other region to experience revenue softness in the first quarter. This was reflected in our original guidance due to lower pricing that has been in market since September of last year. Importantly, though still negative, pricing in Hawaii has remained quite stable of late and in some cases has improved. Looking ahead, the commercial team's focus continues to be on improving margins through higher unit revenues. And while Saver Fares and other images are major contributors, we're also implementing a number of improvements to our network and product this year that I would like to summarize briefly.","First off is our service at Paine Field, which began last month, offering 18 departures to 8 destinations for a greater utility and convenience for our guests that live north of Seattle. Results from the first few weeks of operation have been very positive. Next our Alaska Global Partners network is expanding with new direct flights out of Seattle from Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong, Japan Airlines to Narita, and Singapore Airlines to Singapore.","We're also beta testing the ability for our guests to book international flights on our global partners directly through our website. And third, we're installing new cabin interiors on our Airbus and 737-700 aircraft that align and improve the guest experience. Each Airbus renovation increases total seat count and builds in a greater mix of First and Premium Class seats. And we're on track to complete all 71 retrofits by this time next year. Fourth, satellite Wi-Fi, which is 20x the bandwidth of current offerings, satellite is being installed on 26 aircraft to date, is already operating on transcon flights and will be installed across our fleet by mid-next year.","And lastly, the new North Satellite terminal at Seattle opens this June featuring a new 15,000 square-foot lounge for our guests. We'll also be opening a rooftop lounge in San Francisco next year. For all of these reasons, we are optimistic heading into the second quarter. Our ASM growth is a modest 1% and competitive capacity growth eases to 1.7%.","Our Q2 RASM guidance range of up 2% to 5% reflects the sequential improvement we expect and assumes 350 basis points of incremental revenues from synergies and initiatives, a 100 basis point benefit from the Easter - timing of Easter, which is offset by 100 basis points of continued headwinds from pricing softness in Hawaii. As we leverage the significant self-help opportunities in our plan, we expect Q2 RASM to outperform the domestic industry by a greater margin than it did in Q1, and our target is to outperform our domestic peers by 200 basis points for the full year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks much, Andrew. Just to recap. Air Group posted a first quarter adjusted net profit of $21 million or $0.17 per share, up from $18 million or $0.14 per share in 2018. On the surface, the result is only up modestly versus last year, but the improvement is more substantial after factoring in the headwinds we faced.","Notably, this was the first quarter we've improved pretax margin since Q2 of 2016, and the result indicates that we've begun the steady upward climb toward higher margins and returns. We still have more work to do on both the revenue and the cost sides of the business to achieve our margin target. My comments today will focus on costs.","Overall, we were pleased with our cost performance in Q1. CASMex fuel ended up 2.8% or 200 basis points better than our initial guidance despite completing fewer ASMs than planned. About half of the 200 basis points was timing, and about half was better than planned execution across much of the organization. This result gives us increased confidence in our full year cost outlook and more importantly, demonstrates our ability to protect our low cost structure despite slower growth. Unit costs are - low unit costs are, and have been for years, a key source of our competitive advantage. And despite the solid quarter, we need to make more progress on productivity and manage overhead lower.","Let me give you a couple of examples of where we did this well in Q1. First, mainline pilot productivity was 2.5 points better than planned. This was great, but productivity still trailed last year; second, productivity in our res group was 7.5 points better than planned and a full 12% better than prior year. Kudos to the res team for a really strong performance this quarter; and third, overhead spend was 5% lower than last year after adjusting for some timing items, reflecting the management reductions we made in 2018, cost synergies, and lower spend in a host of other areas. In addition, our cost reduction efforts also extended to our vendor relationships. As we mentioned at Investor Day, we're engaging many of our external business partners this year to renegotiate the rates we pay, and the initiatives are starting to deliver real savings. I want to recognize the supply chain team for their leading - for leading this effort and thank the vendors that have made pricing and other adjustments that will help us to continue to lean out our cost structure.","Looking to the second quarter. We expect CASMex to be up approximately 5% on a 1% increase in capacity. The higher sequential costs reflect the continued mix impact of substantially higher regional growth this year as well as our current maintenance timing, which continues to be front-loaded in the first half of 2019. While this guidance is consistent with our previous Q2 guidance, it does represent better overall performance since our Q2 capacity growth is now 100 basis points lower than our initial plan.","For the full year, we have lowered our CASMex guidance by 20 basis points to 2.1%, reflecting the savings we captured in Q1. As a reminder, our full year cost guidance does not include the impact of any new labor deals we may complete in 2019.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash. Total cash flow from operations for the first three months was $490 million ex merger-related costs, while net CapEx was $110 million over the same period. This resulted in about $380 million of free cash flow, ex integration costs, which was nearly $300 million higher than in Q1 of 2018. Increased profits and lower CapEx should lead to consistent year-over-year improvement in free cash flow throughout 2019. This free cash flow is allowing us to continue to deleverage, which remains our #1 capital allocation priority.","We've repaid a net of $140 million in debt so far this year, and we're on pace to reduce our overall debt balance by about $350 million in 2019, including $70 million of pre-payments. We also crossed somewhat of a milestone this quarter, having now retired more than $1 billion of the $2 billion we borrowed to acquire Virgin America. With leases, our quarter-end adjusted debt-to-cap stood at 47%, and we should end the year at about 43%.","We now have more than 90 unencumbered Boeing NGs and Embraer 175s, and $400 million of undrawn line of credit. As we repaid debt, we've also returned $55 million to shareholders via the dividend, which is currently yielding about 2.3% and share repurchases. We still expect aggregate returns to exceed $220 million by the year end. And once we achieve debt-to-cap closer to 40%, we'll have greater flexibility to increase capital returns to our owners, and to pursue other opportunities that are consistent with our balanced approach to capital allocation.","Let me close by returning to a few of today's themes. We're working hard despite setbacks from mother nature and other factors to improve the financial returns this business is generating. Merger synergies and initiatives are creating revenue momentum. We're enhancing the guest experience. Our loyalty program continues to grow faster than passenger growth. Our cost outlook has improved. Our balance sheet is strong, and our expanded network footprint gives us significant runway for growth longer term.","Nothing in this industry is without challenges. With the noise of Q1 behind us, we are optimistic in our outlook for the rest of the year. And we look forward to leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver superior shareholder value in the years ahead. And with that, let's go to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen.","Helane Becker","So just two questions. One, can you talk about the cadence or the trajectory during the second quarter of what you see in terms of bookings in and revenues that give you some degree of confidence hitting the numbers for the June quarter?","Andrew Harrison","Helane, it's Andrew. I think firstly, with our revenue guidance sort of the range, and you can see there's an acceleration of growth there. But just as we sit today, just the visibility we have from April that's nearly done and then looking at advances as well as looking at the fare environment at it sits today, we feel very good about how the next three months are going to come in, all things being equal that I see today.","Helane Becker","Okay. So are there areas of strength that you can specifically speak to?","Andrew Harrison","I think what we're seeing a little bit is - in our prepared comments we talked about couple of regions that were softer and the headwinds in Hawaii. But I would say, across most of our regions, we are seeing normal strength as we head into spring and summer in both the booking patterns and the fare environment firming up. So we feel pretty good about that as we move forward.","Helane Becker","Okay. And then Andrew, just another question for you on loyalty and card. You mentioned that the card continues to grow and exceed your expectations, I guess. Are you seeing - it continues to grow, but has the growth rate slowed off the tougher comps?","Andrew Harrison","I would - we'll still hit, without getting into details, double-digit growth in both Mileage Plan and the credit card in the first quarter. And in fact, California growth was double the systemwide growth rate. So I would say that we're still seeing very good momentum even in the base that we're growing off increases.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani","Andrew, a question for you, first. You made a pretty bold statement in terms of your ability to outperform on RASM going forward. Some of your peers that you're sort of alluding to are highlighting kind of low-single-digit, maybe even 2%, 3% growth in RASM, and so 2 points above that would be a pretty big number. Can you just talk about your comfort there? I mean, if you look at just your 2Q guide, it's not too dissimilar from where JetBlue, Spirit, Southwest are. So you are kind of in line with them today. But I'd love to just hear more about how you're thinking about it in terms of some of your comments?","Andrew Harrison","Thanks, Rajeev. Firstly, as we see what the domestic unit revenue growth were for the industry, we beat that by about 160 basis points. And as we go into the second quarter and just seeing what others are guiding to, we feel pretty good with the self-help initiatives that we're putting in to continue that.","I mean, at the end of the day, if you look at the comments that we made, and our midpoint of our guidance, which is 3.5, it's basically we said, 3.5 points from initiatives in self-help. There was a bonus there for the move of Easter and then you deduct Hawaii from that. So essentially, what we're saying is that all of our growth is going to come from initiatives. If industries fares go up, we'll do better, if they come down, we might have headwinds. So that's sort of how we sit today.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. And Brandon a question for you. There's obviously been lots of discussion around the MAX and some of the headwinds it's causing for your peers. Can you talk about how you're going to navigate that? I think you start get some deliveries as the year progresses? And what incremental training could do? That sort of a thing?","Brandon Pedersen","Rajeev, it's Brandon. It doesn't really impact us a ton this year. We have three MAX scheduled for delivery June, July and October. Obviously, we're watching the situation closely, but we don't expect much of an impact on the capacity side, certainly. Ben, you might want to comment on the upside or training side?","Benito Minicucci","I think you're right. I think we'll see very minimal impact with the three airplanes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Brandon, I might have missed it in your prepared comments, but when would you expect to hit that 40% debt-to-cap level as we proceed through the year?","Brandon Pedersen","We would likely hit that in probably early to mid-2020. Did you say 20%, Duane? Just clarify.","Bradley Tilden","40%.","Brandon Pedersen","Yes. 40%, we would do in probably, as I said, early to mid-2020.","Duane Pfennigwerth","And then any updated thoughts with respect to your 2020 growth rate and the profile of your cost structure into next year?","Benito Minicucci","Duane, it's Ben. Like we said in our prepared remarks, Alaska has traditionally been a growth airline. We took a pause last year just to absorb the growth and focus on increasing margins. But what you'll see forward from us, we're a growth airline. You'll see anywhere from 4% to 6% over a period of time. So that's our mindset right now.","Duane Pfennigwerth","And maybe Brandon, just the longer-term thoughts on the cost structure into next year?","Brandon Pedersen","I think we're really committed to having a low-cost operation. Costs have been super important to us. They will continue to be super important to us. We need to do more going forward, but we're early into the planning process, and don't have specifics to share at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Matt on for Savi. My first question would be in regard to Saver Fares. It sounds like you're having good progress with that. But could you talk about may be any potential learnings have had there? Operational complexities in terms of markets rolled out? And if it is exceeding expectations that $100 million target gone up? And correct me if I'm wrong on that target, by the way, please?","Bradley Tilden","Matt, let me start. When - like we said, the Saver rollout exceeded our expectations. It's been a really good rollout. And as you rollout new big changes like this, of course, we did have some issues operationally with managing what we call oversold list, but we're working through those right now with our frontline folks. And having that rolled out, we handled some customer questions on how this thing works. So there were a bit of issues we had to work our way through. But I would say those things are working well, and we're making our way through that.","In terms of total dollars, I think, we feel totally comfortable about - we said $100 million. And when we look at - we look at it overall with all our revenue initiatives, we feel pretty good about that. And we've only launched it for four months. We'll give you more of a sense as we get more traction over the next few months on how it's going, but we're optimistic that we improve on that.","Unidentified Analyst","All right, great. Thank you very much for the color there. And then maybe - maybe to Andrew or Ben, whomever. Could you talk maybe just high-level about your second half RASM trends? Any puts and takes there? How we can think of timing of initiatives or tough comps that are going on in the back half?","Andrew Harrison","Thanks Matt. As we shared in our remarks, we plan to it full run rate on our initiatives and synergies by the middle of the second quarter, but we don't give any sort of guidance or outlook beyond what we've done on today's call.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JP Morgan.","Jamie Baker","Your cost guidance was careful to point out no incremental labor expense or - reflective of any contracts progress. Just so that we can establish where the market is, what competitors do you currently use in your peer set when thinking about wage expense? I ask because given how the company has evolved and particularly post-merger, it may be fair to say that, that peer set has changed somewhat. Not asking you to negotiate in public, just wondering who you kind of set yourself up against when thinking about where market wage rates are?","Shane Tackett","Jamie, it's Shane Tackett. Obviously, I'll be brief. I think, we generally look at all the major carriers to understand where they are. Obviously, our labor groups would look at those folks as peers. And what we try to do is find a way to get really, really competitive contracts, and at the same time, find ways to drive productivity up. It's the only formula that's going to work for the company over long term, and that's sort of been our approach with our labor groups over the last 15 or 20 years.","Jamie Baker","Okay. So it's fair to say that, that approach hasn't been altered in any way as the carrier itself has matured. Yes, I think it's totally fair, I'm just confirming that.","Shane Tackett","Yes, Jamie, I think our mindset in terms of high productivity and really competitive contracts hasn't changed. I think that obviously there's two parties in all of these discussions, and our folks need to feel like they have contracts that respect the work that they do and the contributions they make to our success.","Jamie Baker","Cool. And a quick follow-up to Helane's question. I apologize for sounding like a broken record. I've asked about loyalty on several of the calls this season. But the Virgin acquisition kind of put California into play, in my opinion. You've acknowledged stepped up competition there with Southwest. They spoke very enthusiastically today about rapid reward traction. So I just want to confirm - and I'm not of the view that some hold that loyalty benefits are competed away over time. But I just want to confirm that specific to California, not Seattle but California, you're not seeing any evidence of more aggressive card competition in that market?","Andrew Harrison","Jamie, we see the usual periodic bonus offers that are just sort of glittery deals to bring people in. But what we believe the fundamentals are that over the long term, loyalty programs only work if you actually reward people for their loyalty and have [indiscernible] and deeply embedded built - generous mechanisms to keep people's loyalty. And so what we see right now is that our loyalty program and the growth that we've been able to achieve, we feel like what we offer to guests is being well received. And as I shared earlier, our California growth on both card and Mileage Plan is double the rate, albeit on a smaller base and our systemwide growth, which is double digits. So it's always moving around. But as we continue to roll out new products, people get to know us more. Our awareness gets higher. We feel really good about what we have to offer to folks who want to join our club.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs.","Catherine O'Brien","So Brandon, the first one is for you. So if better execution did drive some of that better March quarter CASM performance, is there anything that we should be thinking about that's unique to the March quarter that drove that better execution? Or if things continue the way they are, could we potentially see further improvements in the cost outlook as we move through the year?","Brandon Pedersen","Catie, I don't think I would drive or call out anything specific in the first quarter that drove a number that was \"artificial.\" I do think it was really good execution across the organization. In particular, our team did a good job scheduling the airline. I think it's required that we continue to have this good execution going forward. I don't see anything that's going to derail that, but it's super, super important that we hit our plan. That's what we aim to do.","Benito Minicucci","Catie, it's Ben. How we schedule the airline has a massive, massive impact on not only the productivity of people, but of assets. And I think what we're going to do now, we've got a full-court press with a team looking at how we optimize this network with a Boeing and Airbus product, getting the right airplanes on the right routes, maximizing utilization on airplanes, maximizing productivity of our people, and getting this to configure to how we had it before the merger. So I mean, that's our focus and I think you'll see just a steady improvement on that.","Catherine O'Brien","That's great. Congrats on the strong performance this quarter and hopefully more to come. And then one for you Andrew. So if you're noting that all of your June quarter RASM growth is due to internal initiatives and synergies, should we be assuming that you're not incorporating the rebound in transcon fares you noted earlier in the call into that guide? Just any color on how should we think about that would be great.","Andrew Harrison","Catie, I think what I'm really saying that the growth that we're seeing net of everything is really being driven by the initiatives. That said, we gave a fairly decent range, a 3-point range, and we have a high end, of course. And so to the extent that things go the way we like to see them go, we will move up that range. To the extent not, we'll probably - the goal is we hit the midpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.","Joseph DeNardi","Andrew, I just want to follow up, I guess, on that question. Is there some sort of offset on just kind of the base fare line from some of these initiatives? Because it does seem either conservative that 1% capacity growth shouldn't produce low to mid-single digit core RASM on top of the initiatives? Or is there kind of demand leakage somewhere? I mean, the competitive capacity outlook is pretty benign, why is it core RASM is stronger than what you're expecting?","Andrew Harrison","I think, number one, we [indiscernible] guidance, which is what we have to do in the first quarter. So we're being a little bit more sober and prudent about how we guide. I would, you characterize a conservative guide, I wouldn't necessarily argue heavily against that.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay, okay. And then I guess I'll join my loyalty brother Jamie with a question along those lines. Brandon, I never really understood why the Virgin transaction didn't trigger kind of a renegotiation of sorts with BofA, and an improvement economic. So given how clear it is that kind of the economics of loyalty have gotten better of late, is that something that we can assume you guys are kind of working on with BofA, and if you like to talk about what you think the opportunity there is? I would love to hear it.","Brandon Pedersen","It's Brandon, that actually falls squarely into Andrew's area. He owns the relationship with the bank right now and perhaps, it's a good that if you would answer the question.","Andrew Harrison","No. Yes. So we don't disclose - we renegotiated that not too long ago, and...","Joseph DeNardi","It was like three years ago, wasn't it, Andrew?","Andrew Harrison","Yes, time flies. But we've had a small extension I think a few years ago. But what I would say is that a couple of things. Number one, these agreements in my career have never sort of gone their full tenure. Changes in the market condition, if there are some, are always I think, good things, especially if they're to the positive side. And we continue to talk to Bank of America on how we can continue to build a very, very strong relationship we have. So there may be some more market data out there today. But again, we'll digest that and continue to work with our program and make it the best for us and Bank of America.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter Keay","Brandon, can you give me some color on the $26 million of merger integration costs. I've got three questions. Number 1, why were they up 20 million year-on-year? How much of that was cash? And when you guys going to be done pulling these out?","Christopher Berry","All right. Chris is going to answer them instead of Brandon, Hunter. So 50 - about little more than half of it was noncash. It was related to a onetime sort of true-up vacation balances. When we integrated the former Virgin America crews into the Alaska crew scheduling or crew tracking system. So that was the majority of it that's noncash. The rest of it are things like paint lines for the Virgin America livery as well as some IT costs associated with moving former Virgin America data centers and consolidating those. So we should be - that was - the year-over-year impact is solely because - primarily because of that onetime labor vacation through our balances and it's not nonrecurring.","Hunter Keay","When was it done, Chris?","Christopher Berry","When was it done. So the biggest because we have remaining or associated with the maintenance integration, which has not really started yet. And so that should be really over the next 12 months, 15 months. But we said, I think, $400 million of onetime charges were about $345 million from acquisition to date. And I still feel pretty good about the $400 million.","Hunter Keay","Okay. Chris and Brad, and then couple of years ago you guys resisted the urge of lie-flats because a couple - one of the reasons at least was because you thought you might make yours - your airline more prone to a downturn, which I felt was actually really insightful. But look, you've said before you try to attract new customers and the marketplace has changed. Not only Pacific Northwest, but now you're in these markets in San Francisco and Los Angeles. You've got the credit card, and your competitors are having some success with these lie-flat seats. So how are you thinking about that now? Are you fighting the urge to do it? Or is it something you guys have just decided we'll never going to do this and that's just who we are.","Shane Tackett","Hunter, it's Shane. I think I answered this question before. Our thinking haven't changed. And in fact, if you look at some of the pricing softness in the markets that you're talking about, a lot of that is actually on the premium side of the cabin. And so I'm not sure that the economics would be any different. In fact, they would probably be more challenging at this point.","I think the question about do we have a good enough first-class product, which is again a very small percentage of the overall market that demands that. Is it good enough to compete with lie flat, I think it's a good question, and it's one we're sort of humble about and we're just - we're going to take a little more time to understand if we need to go a different route. We don't really have the aircraft to do lie-flat today. We've got some of the A321s. That's the aircraft you would want to do it on. So we said before, if we needed to go there we could. But right now, our sort of view is more loyalty and upgrade into our premium cabins, and less sort of all-out looking to yield in the premium cabins and that still works for us. Throughout the system, we think it will. If that changes, we'll be able to go lie-flat if we have to.","Operator","Your next question comes from the levels Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg","Okay. I want to go back to something in your prepared remarks, you talked about Alaska being a growth airline and you're excited for next year, profitable growth opportunities. I think you sort of referenced the acquired assets in California and presumably you were referring to San Fran and LA, LAX. And I'm just curious, those - obviously space is tight at those airports, and I was under the impression that your utilization of your current gauge there is actually pretty high, but just based on your comments it seems like maybe you are only using 60% or 70% of the space. Can you just give us a sense of how much maybe additional room at LAX and SFO you may have? And maybe you have some gauge coming online over the next 12 months or so that I'm not aware of?","Bradley Tilden","Mike, thanks for the question. A couple of things. I wanted to put in context was I know there were concerns about our growth and our - we are a growth airline, and our longer-term strategy is to grow. Now I said California, there are some constraints in San Francisco and Los Angeles. There is construction that sometimes constrains us. There is some coming up, but those are two places where we have considerable strength.","So those are definitely options for us to grow, but we have a broader California network as well that we're going to look at as well. So our mindset is always 4% to 6%. And California, of course, we made the acquisition of Virgin America to get those valuable slots and gauge. So we're going to take as much advantage and get as much activity of the assets we have to grow. And we're not giving too much detail on that.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, not a problem. And just Andrew, the 9 of 11 regions where you had positive RASM in the March quarter, Andrew, as we look to the June quarter, is - are we going to be able to get to a point, where it's 11 of 11 or maybe 10 of 11?","Andrew Harrison","Yes, that is the hope. I think, as we move in - a lot of that's going to depend on the industry pricing. We have a lot of time spend at fares that are technically industrywide may be rolling off or not. But at the end of the day, I think, that there could be strength there. On the comments though we did say with Hawaii. I think just I'm not sure that's going to get to positive unit revenue just given the capacity that sort of come on board both there and the fare environment.","Michael Linenberg","Andrew I didn't even know you had 11 regions. So I couldn't even name them, so I just - I'll ask that off-line.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Bank.","Brandon Oglenski","Andrew or Shane, I guess, we've heard this commentary too from other carriers as we go through earning season here that leisure was soft up until I guess the end of March or beginning of April. Where do we get that - I mean, we've heard others talk about low World Cup fares on transcon as well. So what changed? Was demand not showing up? Or did we see capacity tweaks in these areas? Where is the confidence that things have improved into the summer?","Andrew Harrison","Number one, I think really specially what went on with World Cup fares had nothing to do with demand and supply. I mean, it just - there was just the pricing actions taken by carriers that brought those down very, very low and they doubled - these fairs doubled overnight starting in mid-March. I think you for us specifically, the first quarter is always deeply seasonally weak and weak quarters affect demand to our network, affects the pricing up into Premium Class. So as we move into the spring and summer season, we are seeing the traditional strength that we've always seen in these markets. But at the end of the day, the fare levels out in the marketplace are somewhat flat give or take across the system versus last year, and we continue to see them move. So over the next 2 or 3 weeks, we'll learn more about where this is headed.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay, I appreciate that. And then I wanted to follow up on the question about business-class versus your domestic First Class. Have you guys put the 900 on the transcon routes yet? And are you getting the relative revenue production out of the aircraft that you thought you would? I guess, more from like a square foot perspective?","Andrew Harrison","Sure. We actually just - it was only really mid-March that we fully transferred all of JFK and New York to Los Angeles and San Francisco on to the ER and the 321, so - as we get into these demand periods. So we will get a lot more visibility to how they perform over the next few months. So that's just really started as we speak.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jose Caiado with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jose Caiado","I just have one quick follow-up question on the second quarter guidance. I guess you said that you wouldn't push back on the notion that there are some conservatism in Q2 RASM guide. But when I think back to the last earnings call where your provided first quarter guidance, I think, there was also an explicit statement at the time that there was no Q1 forecast embedded, less confidence in close-in pricing. So maybe that could have been characterized as conservative at the time as well and then it obviously came in materially worse than what you were expecting. So how were you thinking about that in the context of this Q2 guide here, the assumptions behind close-in specifically, just given your experience in the first quarter?","Andrew Harrison","I think what we were trying to say on the first quarter was that we saw real volatility and choppiness in the fares, and we were just pointing that out as we - as part of the basis of our guide, is what we are saying, but - and then literally days after the call, we saw them continue down. I think what we're really saying here is, is that at the end of the day, we feel good about what we see today, but we see fares still move around a lot and there is a good chance that fares could continue to move up across the industries, the demand comes in. Honestly, we have seen seats come out close in due to the MAX groundings. We've seen carriers pull seats out of the market. We've seen numerous frequency reductions across our markets as late as last week into June. So some of these things will actually help RASM going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Darryl J. Genovesi with Vertical Research.","Darryl Genovesi","The first quarter - the calendar first quarter was the first quarter of year-over-year fuel decline that we've seen in a while, perhaps the last as well. Within that construct we had a somewhat bifurcated revenue progression with Delta and American guidance holding up by-and-large while the more domestic-oriented carriers like yourselves and Southwest and JetBlue cetera had to cut. I knew there are some geographic differences. But I'm also wondering the extent to which this bifurcation may also be related to the global network carriers more mature customer segmentation efforts relative to yours in a fuel environment that perhaps engendered some competitive pricing behavior. Any thoughts on that, Andrew?","Bradley Tilden","I think you've confused, Andrew.","Andrew Harrison","I'm not. That was - it was an impressive question, but I'm going to - I'm not sure I quite understood it, and that's. I'd take it off-line.","Bradley Tilden","Better able to - with more segmentation history - better able to recover higher fuel costs. That's what you're asking, Darryl?","Darryl Genovesi","Yes, basically. I know Delta and American have had basic economy for a while. You guys just rolled yours out. JetBlue doesn't have one yet. Southwest doesn't have one yet. The three of you [indiscernible] guidance. United, Delta and American didn't. I'm just wondering if there's a connection there?","Andrew Harrison","Got it. I'm not sure but what I can tell you that we have going on that others do not have going on is this, the massive change going on in our business. We really - we forget about this - we just really rolled out Premium Class last year. So we had a 23% increase in Premium Because seats just in the first quarter. The Saver Fares having rolled out, the fleet. So we have a lot of choppiness and noise and distraction going on a little bit historically, just to be honest with you. So I don't know the answer to that question. But what I do know is going forward as our business settles down and we get a much better grasp of our levers, I'll probably have a better answer for you next time.","Bradley Tilden","Darryl, what I would add is, we believe, Alaska has competitive advantage. So we know there's a lot going on in the industry, but we have a great product. Everything from the Saver Fare we've introduced, Main Cabin, premium cabin, First Class. And we don't have lie-flats. But I think the net we cast over the customer population is pretty large. So we feel that we can weather a lot given our low cost structure and we just feel we're in a good place.","Darryl Genovesi","Great. And then Brandon, I mean, if I may ask, on this 40% debt-to-cap target, can you just give us some sense of how you came up with that target in particular, how do you go about stress testing it. Apologies, I knew you've probably done it before, but as the cycle gets a little bit more mature, I think it becomes more important to understand these balance sheet metrics?","Brandon Pedersen","No, no, no. It's a very fair question. What we did was we looked at the leverage that generally high-quality industrials keep and it's usually right around that, and if you blend that with absolute debt balance look, you blend that with the coverage ratio look, I think, all of that sort of works into this view of kind of 40% is a good place for us to be. We want to maintain an investment grade balance sheet. We want to have - I mean, all of that, that's basically the answer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Mckenzie with Buckingham Research.","Daniel Mckenzie","Shane, I guess this question would be for you. From what I can tell the Saver Fare appears to be more mechanical and less dynamic today. First, am I correct in that characterization? And then is there potential to be more dynamic here and how do we think about what that could mean for revenue as we look forward here?","Shane Tackett","Yes, Daniel, you are right. I think we've gone out initially with a pretty sort of flat approach. We've really done it essentially based on how far people are traveling, and I think that's really what the industry has gone out with and more or less has stuck with. I think there is - we're starting to ask the same question you just asked me. Is there a way to get a little smarter at the flight level to move the buy up around. Our goal with this would be loss of buy up at pretty low price. We would love to sort of maximize the economics by getting a lot of people into the main cabin fare that's the better product. And so we want to make that buy up attractive to folks over time. So we are very motivated to figure out how to get more dynamic, as you say, with this but it's probably a couple of quarters away. We really do need a little history before we start changing that goal a lot.","Daniel Mckenzie","Understood, okay. I guess second question here going back to pilot productivity, which was in the prepared remarks. I believe it was roughly - responsible for roughly 1\/2 of the CASMex improvement in the first quarter. Based on the second quarter cost guide, which is unchanged here, it doesn't appear to be filtering through to the second quarter. And I guess I'm just wondering if that's correct? Or is there some potential upside here?","Shane Tackett","Dan, this is Shane. I'll take that as well. I think this was asked by somebody earlier. In Q1, we had a number of areas that we actually performed a little better than what our plan was. Productivity was one driver, and the one that was mentioned by Brandon was crew productivity. We had - we actually had good performance in a couple of other areas as well, distribution costs, selling costs, and overhead, which I think Brandon also mentioned. In Q2, ASMs were actually pretty low again and what I would say is we're still fully understanding why and how we got as good versus plan, as we did on the productivity side. And our goal is to definitely drive that through the rest of the year, but it actually was better than we had planned. So we are just making sure we fully understand what drove that so we can continue doing those things.","Daniel Mckenzie","Understood, and if I can just squeeze one last one here. Just going back to the Investor Day and the fact that you shared around Mileage Plan members, generating 4x more revenue. Just given the loyalty growth rates that you've highlighted, to what extent is that helping to infect revenue today? And does that help revenue inflect more materially as we move throughout the year? I am just wondering if you can provide more color here as well?","Andrew Harrison","Dan, it's Andrew. All of that holds true. And I think as we've shared earlier, the strength of the loyalty shows historically, what it does to the percentage of people we booked through AS.com. The percentage of those folks who actually spend more than the average fare, and as we see and as we look into California, we have been feeling more and more percentage of our seats on our aircraft with loyalty members in California. So we're going to continue to work that and we expect to see the same relationship between loyalty members in the Pacific Northwest, as in California, as we move them up the value chain.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Kevin Crissey with Citigroup.","Kevin Crissey","Just one quick one. We've heard argues that your good results from a network and revenue perspective have been traditionally your legacy Alaska markets, and your weakest results have been your traditional legacy Virgin routes. Can you talk to that? And maybe put another way, what areas of Virgin network and assets are doing well?","Andrew Harrison","Kevin, it's Andrew. We - I recall and maybe I've made, I made in earlier quarters, some very high-level comment around that Pac Northwest versus California. We don't share that level of detail, but what I would, going forward that was just initial half of the acquisition. What I will share with you is that what we have squarely in focus with all the initiatives we are doing with the cross fleeting, with the Saver Fares, with the loyalty growth, the productivity, cost reductions is continuing to improve the results of the California marketplace, which is as you know, a very highly competitive marketplace. And we have seen good solid trajectory there. We have a lot of work to do, no question, but our results continue to improve and that's exactly what we're looking to do.","Bradley Tilden","Kevin, it's Brad. I might add on that to that a little bit. In my time here, I've seen lots of different reasons for this company be - reasons that were challenge for sometimes for a period of years. When I first joined Seattle to the Bay Area - Pacific Northwest to the Bay Area was a challenged area. It's a highly contributing area today. When we first went into transcon's sort of a similar experience and it's really, really valuable part of our franchise today. Southern Cal to Mexico, if you go back a few years was not - was underperforming for some period of time. And so some of these California transcon markets aren't doing what we believe they should do. But it doesn't shake our belief in our need to be there and it doesn't shake our belief in our competitive advantage. So we're going - I don't know that we'll add a ton of capacity in these markets, but we're going to stay there. And we are going to fight it out, and we believe our company has real competitive advantage that will be rewarded over time.","Matt Grady","And then I think that Kevin I thank you very much for your question. I think that might've been the last questions of the day. Thank you all for our interest. We look forward to talking to you at the end of the second quarter. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference. This call will be available for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. You may now disconnect."],"713":["Alaska Air Group, Inc.

My name is Amber, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Alaska Air Group Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Director of Investor Relations, Matt Grady.","Matt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Amber. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2018 earnings call. On the call today, our CEO, Brad Tilden, will provide an overview of the business; Andrew Harrison, our Chief Commercial Officer, will share an update on our revenue results and outlook; and our CFO, Brandon Pedersen, will discuss our cost performance and cash flows. Several other members of our management team are also on hand to help answer your questions.","Earlier this morning, Alaska Air Group reported third quarter GAAP net income of $217 million. Excluding merger-related costs and mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $237 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.91, ahead of the First Call consensus.","As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Brad.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We are rapidly approaching the two-year mark since our merger closed and while there's still a lot of work ahead of us, we are extremely happy about the pace of progress and we remain confident in our future. We've now completed roughly 90% of the integration milestones and have done so at a pace that is equal to or more rapid than virtually any other merger in the industry.","The performance of our core business remains strong and our brand and product are gaining increasing traction in California. As our network investments mature and the merger synergies accelerate, we're doubling down on the disciplines of productivity, teamwork and cost control, disciplines that have been the source of our competitive advantage for many years now.","In the third quarter, our financial performance started to turn the corner with our employees delivering unit revenues and unit costs that were both better than plan. We were especially encouraged to see RASM stabilize in the face of multiple headwinds. We expect RASM to inflect positive in the fourth quarter as we begin the steady climb toward the higher margins and higher returns that we believe are achievable with our combined network.","As we've discussed, we're not satisfied with our current financial returns. Fuel prices continue to rise and we need to do more to recover these higher costs. One way we've responded is by raising bag fees for the first time in five years, bringing our fees into line with those that are now prevalent in the marketplace. We announced these changes last week and Andrew will discuss them further in just a moment.","Stepping back a bit, we see an industry environment that has not yet adequately adjusted to higher fuel prices. We've slowed our growth in 2019, as market dynamics simply don't argue for adding much new capacity. That said, we are comfortable with our current growth and we're very comfortable with our new network footprint.","We have a solid plan in place to leverage the many factors within our control and to drive unit revenues and margins higher going forward. We're making it even more granular as we go through the budget process. We're confident that we're on a path to significantly improve our profitability and our free cash flow in both 2019 and 2020.","Before I discuss future plans though, I'd like to highlight a few of our team's accomplishments in the third quarter. First, we were proud to win Best U.S. Airline from both Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler and KAYAK. The Cond\u00e9 Nast recognition is especially meaningful, as it continued a tradition. Virgin America had won this award for the past 10 years and now our folks have extended the streak to 11.","Second, our operation continues to run well. Our CD zero, or our controllable departures leaving within zero minutes of their scheduled time, improved 90 basis points to an excellent 86.6%.","Third, we continue to see operational strength at Horizon where our on-time performance continues to be the best in the industry and where our pilot staffing pipeline is full.","Fourth, our mainline pilot seniority list was recently integrated which means that all but one of our workgroups has a single CBA and a single seniority list.","And fifth, we achieved a number of additional milestones on the integration front. In August we started repainting the Airbus fleet and we've now repainted 16 of 71 airplanes. And we've also integrated our aircraft movement systems, which means we can now swap between Boeing and Airbus aircraft on short notice.","The last accomplishment signals a shift in the type of integration work we're now doing. During the last 22 months we've been busy becoming a single airline. We were aligning hundreds of systems and processes, integrating guest-facing platforms and programs and working with our labor leaders to negotiate single collective bargaining agreements. Now that the vast majority of that groundwork is laid, we're dedicated to realizing the value of our significantly larger platform. For example, our nearly 6,000 flight attendants have been training on both aircraft types for several months now and they'll begin working both types on January 31. This will improve productivity.","We're also preparing to fully deploy cross-fleeting by March of next year. This will drive higher revenues and margins and will help us realize another key merger synergy.","And third, we begin to reconfigure Airbus cabins this quarter. We'll complete four to five aircraft per month between now and the end of 2019 when the entire fleet will be done. These changes bring with them a number of margin benefits including four additional seats, 10 additional first and premium class seats, a common experience for our guests and new opportunities to upgrade elites.","In addition to capturing merger synergies, our plan for the next year includes the pursuit of several revenue and cost initiatives. We've always been proud to run our business in a balanced way where all boats rise as our business succeeds. And these initiatives will help us improve returns for investors as we move from getting the integration done to realizing the benefits of the merger.","Some of the levers we're managing to improve profitability include slowing our capacity growth to let our investments mature, increasing segmentation due to the launch of Saver Fares which will produce $100 million in revenue next year, increasing bag fees and other ancillary revenues such as exit row sales which will produce another $100 million in revenue next year, optimizing our larger route network and schedule which is part of our broader plan to capture $130 million in synergies next year, improving the productivity of our operation, and finally controlling management head count through the difficult but we believe necessary step of eliminating some positions. This will save overhead, but more importantly it will improve the speed of decision making and the flow of information throughout our organization.","Finally, we're continuing our tradition of maintaining a strong balance sheet. We're on pace to have paid down $800 million or 40% of the debt we took on to purchase Virgin America by year-end. We look forward to discussing each of these opportunities in greater detail at our Investor Day next month.","For now let me conclude by saying that we feel confident we're on the road to producing better returns in the quarters ahead as we work together as a single team to demonstrate the true power of our combined company.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Brad, and good morning everyone. Total revenue for the third quarter rose 5% to $2.2 billion on capacity growth of 4.8%. RASM came in flat which was our best unit revenue result in five quarters. We had good progression during the quarter with unit revenues down 1.3% in July but up 0.7% in August and up 0.5% in September. This is only the beginning and we expect our unit revenue momentum to continue as we execute on a number of substantive initiatives to ensure that our recent trajectory continues into the fourth quarter and well beyond.","Other bright spots worth a mention include Mileage Plan revenues were up 11%, Premium Class revenues were more than double at 122% and First Class revenues increased 8%. Once we work through some IT issues related to paid upgrades on the Airbus along with Airbus cabin modifications that begin this quarter to increase First Class capacity by 50%, we expect to see significant revenue increases from the front cabin in 2019.","Before I get to the outlook though, I'd like to provide some additional color on our third quarter results. First, same-stores, or markets in operation longer than 12 months and representing about 94% of our capacity, delivered positive TRASM of 1.5%. Solid demand and stabilizing and improving close-in pricing across most of our network drove this result. Overall, we were pleased with the quarter's revenues given the 150 basis point headwind created by the higher level of award redemptions across our system which we guided to last quarter and have mitigated going forward.","Now turning to new markets, or markets in operation less than 12 months, these negatively impacted RASM by 160 basis points versus the 210 basis points last quarter as new market capacity declined to 6% of capacity from 9% in Q2. New market mix is set to decline again in the fourth quarter to just 3% of ASMs. And by the end of the year we will have fully annualized the 44 markets we started last year when we made a strategic and long-term investment in the relevance of our California network. These markets continue to develop well. We are very pleased with the network foundation we have laid in California today and our focus now is the continuing maturing in the coming months, quarters and years ahead.","Looking by region, we see a lot of strength versus last year. Yields are positive in the Pacific Northwest despite high single-digit industry capacity growth and we continue our significant focus on California and are seeing positive momentum across a number of leading longer-term indicators. Specifically, Mileage Plan membership continued its double-digit growth this quarter; credit card acquisitions also grew double digits and well in excess of passenger growth; brand awareness has improved 9 points in the past four months; and international traffic has increased 26% year-over-year now that our California network is accessible to our global partners. We forecast further improvement in all of these metrics as we finalize the integration and bring the guest experience on Boeing and Airbus into full alignment by the end of next year.","The only region in our system that is experiencing materially lower pricing today is Hawaii. West Coast ASMs to Hawaii grew 9% in the third quarter and they're set to grow another 8% in the fourth quarter, while filed fares and yields are down significantly year-on-year. Nevertheless, we remain confident that we will be able to weather the softer near-term environment better than our competitors due to the growth of our loyalty program across multiple West Coast origin markets, the additional segmentation we will introduce next year with the Saver Fare and an onboard product that is very well suited for long-haul leisure markets such as Hawaii.","So looking to the fourth quarter, we continue to trim our initial capacity plan as we settle into a growth rate of just under 2%, which is where we expect to be for the next few quarters. After years of elevated growth, we are happy with our network footprint and are now focused on optimizing it. Our fourth quarter RASM guidance range of up 1.5% to 3.5% continues the positive trajectory we began in Q3 and will be our best RASM result in six quarters. Our guidance assumes recent strength in close-in pricing will continue and factors in a 125 basis point headwind from soft Hawaii pricing.","As we look ahead into 2019, we expect our positive revenue trajectory to continue as we implement a number of new initiatives that should generate in excess of $330 million next year. And to re-summarize some of the things that Brad mentioned, first, we're raising our bag fees for the first time in five years effective December 5 and we estimate that will generate $50 million in incremental revenues next year. Secondly, our synergy opportunities such as credit card growth, cross-fleeting, Airbus fleet modifications will produce an additional $130 million next year. Third, the launch of our Saver Fare product on November 20 will add another $100 million. And then fourth, the other ancillary revenue changes we have already implemented such as exit row sales and demand-based pricing for Premium Class will reach a $50 million run rate next year.","In sum, we are optimistic about our revenue outlook. Driving margin improvement through higher RASM is our team's number one priority today and we will achieve it as we reap the benefits of the significant investments we've made in our network, brand, product and loyalty program over the past two years.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, Air Group posted a third quarter adjusted net profit of $237 million or $1.91 per share. Our pre-tax margin was about 14% which was a 6.6 point decline from Q3 of last year. Flat unit revenue performance was certainly positive in light of recent trends but inadequate to recapture much of the higher fuel prices and higher wages and benefits costs resulting from labor agreements we've amended over the last year.","Like Q1 and Q2, our unit costs were better than our original guidance despite completing fewer ASMs than we had planned. About $14 million of our better performance came from lower incentive pay accruals as the higher fuel prices take their toll on expected full year profits and we failed to meet certain other non-financial metrics that are part of our annual goals-based plan that we call PBP or performance based pay. In addition, we had approximately $10 million of expense shift from Q3 into Q4 as the timing of certain maintenance and marketing activities was delayed versus prior plan. Yet, even accounting for these two items leaves more than a point of CASMex true cost outperformance in the quarter. This is partially a testament to the growth of the loyalty program, since more bookings are coming directly through our website and on our credit card today than at this time last year, which is our lowest cost form of distribution. But it also illustrates the hard work of our leaders and other employees who have delivered better productivity and have embraced the back-to-basics culture of frugality and cost discipline that has made us successful for many years.","As mentioned, fuel continues to be a substantial headwind with per gallon costs rising 30%. Higher fuel prices alone reduced our pre-tax margin by 5 points, or about three-quarters of our year-over-year margin decline. Without the $12 million net benefit from our hedging program, higher fuel would have cost us an additional 55 bps of pre-tax margin. Consistent with our standard hedging process, we currently have 50% of our planned fuel consumption hedged over the next six months and our average strike price during that period is $70 a barrel.","We expect Q4 unit costs to be up roughly 3.6% on a 1.4% increase in capacity, bringing our full year CASMex increase to 3.2% on 5.3% capacity growth. This compares favorably to our initial guide of up 3.5% on capacity growth of 6.5%. Bottom line, we're doing a good job managing costs this year with most of our divisions forecast to come in better than their original plans.","We've talked in the last couple of calls about the rigor with which we've been planning for next year and how we've been laying the groundwork for the 2019 budget for several months now. Well, the 2019 budget process is now in full swing and we're leveraging opportunities for cost reduction in a number of areas, including network and schedule optimization, labor and aircraft productivity, hotel and healthcare costs, and reducing overhead.","Some investors have asked whether 2% growth is a negative for our business because it will put pressure on unit costs. It is true, 2% growth will put pressure on unit costs, but 2% capacity growth is the right answer for 2019 margins, especially in light of our rapid growth in recent years, and growing faster than 2% when the environment simply doesn't justify more capacity than that just to take pressure off unit costs would be irresponsible. We'll provide more details on our 2019 unit cost plan at Investor Day next month.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash. Total cash flow from operations for the first nine months of the year was $1.05 billion excluding merger-related costs while net CapEx was about $550 million over the same period. This resulted in $0.5 billion of free cash flow.","The free cash flow we're generating has enabled us to continue to re-deleverage our balance sheet. Through the first nine months of the year, we've reduced on-balance sheet debt by nearly $550 million. It's also noteworthy and bears repeating that we'll have paid off nearly 40% or a net of $800 million of the $2 billion that we borrowed to acquire Virgin America less than two years after deal close. That improves our balance sheet but also saves us more than $30 million in annual interest expense.","I want to give a shout out to our treasury team. Over the last two months they've taken advantage of our balance sheet and today's credit markets to refinance or restructure $1.1 billion worth of our on-balance sheet debt. This effort will continue into the fourth quarter and when complete will lower interest expense in 2019 to the tune of $4 million. I also want to acknowledge our partner banks who worked cooperatively with us on this initiative.","With leases, our quarter-end adjusted debt-to-cap stood at 49%, 3 points lower than last quarter and it should end the year at around the same level. Continuing to strengthen our conservative investment-grade balance sheet is our number one capital allocation priority right now.","As we've repaid debt balances, we've also returned $155 million to shareholders during the first nine months of the year via the dividend and share repurchases. And we still expect that number to exceed $200 million by year-end, consistent with our initial plan.","Let me close by offering some higher level summary thoughts. First, most of the major merger integration milestones are behind us and we're now squarely focused on two big things: culture and improving our financial performance. Second, the slower growth for 2019 will let us digest the tremendous growth we've had over the last few years. Third, our unit revenues are inflecting to positive and we have specific plans that will add $330 million of new revenue to the business in 2019. Fourth, our renewed back-to-basics focus on cost is evident and we're going to tightly manage costs again in 2019. And finally, the initiatives above give us line of sight to higher profitability in 2019. This will produce higher cash flow and when combined with lower CapEx will produce higher free cash flow which we can use to further re-delever the balance sheet and ultimately improve the cash returns back to our owners.","And with that, let's go to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Savi Syth of Raymond James, your line is open.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Good morning, Savi.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hi, Savi.","Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","You laid out a lot of initiatives that should be \u2013 different initiatives that should be kind of being a nice tailwind next year. Could you talk a little bit about the progression as you go through the year on how those build?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey Savi, this is Andrew. I think by, probably as you go into the second quarter, we should be pretty much at full run rate. The Saver Fares will kick in and really be up and running for sales beginning January 1. Bag fees are already going in and there's a booking curve happened. So, I would say that we'll start off a little lighter in the first quarter but as we go into the second quarter, we should be at full pace.","Operator","Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank, your line is open.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, good morning everyone. Two questions here. I think, Brad, you basically said you're at a point now where you're comfortable with the network and I guess there were, what, 44 city pairs that were added, but there was also some culling, some cutting of frequency in some city pairs. Are we at a point now where going forward \u2013 and I guess maybe this is even the question for Andrew as well \u2013 that we're not going to see anything more material with respect to the network, like the big changes have occurred and this is the network of 2019 and beyond?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. Michael, this is Andrew. That's right. I think if you look at the culling, we cleaned up Dallas Love Field to the East Coast. We took care of our Mexico City slots which weren't going to be long-term winners for us. And as we've shared previously, the network we inherited from Virgin America, we've made significant changes there. So, we feel really good about the network. Our big opportunity \u2013 Ben may comment on this \u2013 on the schedule, but also just the marketing times of our network and getting our flights leaving at the times we want them to leave is our next big opportunity.","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","And, Mike, also, we talked about the cross-fleeting of airplanes, putting the right airplanes in the right markets. So what we're doing by Q1 is making sure we deploy the bigger airplanes on the right markets and the small airplanes on the right markets as well.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just my second question, you did a really nice job laying out all the different revenue initiatives next year, $330 million or exceeding $330 million but you also threw out some things that clearly are going to benefit on the cost side. I mean, Ben, you just mentioned cross-fleeting, your flight attendants are going to be working under a single contract January next year, you'll be able to sort of mix and match, that's obviously going to help on the cost side. Is there a number out there that we should use for the cost savings in 2019?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Mike, it's Brandon, maybe I'll take that one. No, not at this point. We do have a lot of stuff going on but as I said in my prepared remarks, we're still working hard on the budget and we'll have more to say about that at Investor Day.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Your next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth of Evercore ISI.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Hey, thanks. Not to start exactly where Mike left off, but obviously lower growth has been discussed as a headwind, but from a high level, could you just discuss the tailwinds that you see? For example, you've adjusted the plan lower at least a couple of times this year and my guess is there's some costs associated with that, with those mid-course corrections. Can you just give us your list of tailwinds that you see?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Duane, hi, it's Brandon. Maybe I'll start with that. I mean, certainly the biggest tailwind to that is just the variable costs that come with the business and just the lack of startup costs and things like that, training costs I would say are a big one. You do have a certain element of the cost structure that's fixed and obviously with lower capacity growth, there'll be pressure on that, but to the extent that there are variable costs both on an ongoing basis and then costs that we incur in anticipation of further growth, those will be certainly mitigated in 2019.","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","And, Duane, it's Ben. As you heard some of the things that are coming together with the integration in terms of systems coming together and labor groups coming together, for example, our flight attendants will be flying together by the end of January of 2019, that drives productivity back into our business. So as we bring systems together and we start aligning the operations and how we run it, those are going to be tailwinds for us in 2019.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Thanks. And then just for my follow-up, on Hawaii, I wonder if you could provide a little more detail historically, because capacity has been up there for a while. You had a high rates of growth from an industry perspective 1Q, Q2. My guess is the industry was absorbing it. You've had some non-recurring events here, volcanoes, hurricanes and maybe there's some lingering impact. But maybe could you provide some longer-term perspective on Hawaii? And you've seen competitors come, you've seen competitors go, typically capacity finds a level. Maybe the incumbents have overshot a bit here. Would love some more fleshed out thoughts on Hawaii. Thank you.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. That's a really good question. And you just said it. I think for those who've been in Hawaii, and we've been there 11 years now, Hawaii really follows supply and demand of seats. And there's been an escalation of industry seats over the last few quarters and that will continue, and we've seen what that has done to the revenue environment.","I think specifically to us, a couple of important things to note. Number one is that we serve Hawaii from eight gateways off the West Coast, and many of those all four islands on a nonstop basis. So, we have very much \u2013 have our flights not anchored in any single or specific city. But what's really exciting I think is you heard about on the initiatives, as we roll out, many of these will directly impact the economics in a very positive way of our Hawaii routes, and especially with our onboard product now, with satellite coming onboard, with the Premium Class seating, First Class seating, food and beverage programs both in the main cabin, we feel really good about our product, our network and the incremental revenues coming into 2019 that will help us deal with some of the softness as the industry finds its water level.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Matt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Duane.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, gentlemen.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Good morning, Rajeev.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Two questions, a RASM one and then a CASM one. Andrew, I'll start with you. You're seeing a nice inflection in unit revenues here in the fourth quarter. Would it be unfair to assume that you can just build on some of these numbers as we go into next year and then maybe just add on top of the 4Q levels the 3 to 4 points of revenue initiatives that you're seeing? Is that too optimistic or too aggressive?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","No, Rajeev, I'll give you my personal views. But I think we are going to continue to ramp. I mean, I think if you just look at the industry's revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, I think our guidance is starting to nestle right in there amongst many of the ranges. And if you take into account all the real revenue initiatives that are kicking in as we speak, I would personally expect us to start to outperform the industry in unit revenue increases as we go into the first quarter.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful. And then, Brandon, a question for you on the CASM side. So in the fourth quarter you've got 1%, 2% capacity growth and you're seeing 3.5 points of unit cost pressures or an increase there. Can you just help break that down? And I'm assuming we shouldn't be using that as a run rate for 2019 to maybe think of some of the headwinds associated with lower growth. I think you get where I'm going.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. Hi. Yeah, I totally get where you're going. It really just is a timing thing. I don't think the Q4 CASM guide should have surprised anybody, because our full year CASM guide really remains unchanged. When you put together a business plan and you make estimates of what certain things are going to land in certain quarters, and stuff is just slipping into the fourth quarter. So it's really timing more of anything else, not indicative of where we think we're going to be long term on the CASM guide with lower capacity.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then within that 3.5 points, how much is timing? Can you parse that out a bit?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","You know what? If I went back to our original CASM guide for the fourth quarter \u2013 which I don't have in front of me, I bet it's probably \u2013 I would say it's probably most of it. Hold on, I'm looking at something here.","Christopher M. Berry - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","This is Chris. About half of the increase in CASM really came from the decline in capacity. And then the other, we got about $10 million, $15 million worth of shift in timing of costs into the fourth quarter. So those two things together pretty much get to your CASM guide for the fourth quarter.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, everybody. A follow-up to Rajeev's question which was a follow-up to Duane's question, which was a follow-up to Mike's question. I know you don't want to give a precise cost guide, you're holding something back for Investor Day, that's fine. But I can't think of a time since standalone United that an airline was ever able to materially decelerate without seeing a substantive year-on-year increase in ex-fuel CASM, and they only pulled it off \u2013 this was quite some time ago \u2013 because they punted all of their 737 Classics. So, obviously that's not an option here. If ex-fuel CASM goes up 3% this year, which is the guide, isn't it a foregone conclusion that next year goes up more than this, it's just a question of magnitude?","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Jamie, it's Shane Tackett. Love your questions. I think maybe I'd just start higher level. We spend something like $5.5 billion on non-fuel costs, and natural sort of inflation of that might be, I don't know, call it 5%, something like $300 million. I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that we have to go up $300 million next year, and that's sort of where \u2013 that's where our mindset has been, that's what Brandon has talked about throughout the year, that's what we're alluding to as we lay out cost initiatives. Similar to a list of revenue initiatives that were very well laid out by Andrew, we just need to do the exact same thing with costs.","The other thing that I think you can appreciate is as we've gone through the integration and merger, there's just a lot of potential opportunity to go in and look at areas that got a little bit ahead of themselves the last couple of years.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Can't blame a guy for trying. Second, on the segmentation, and this is somewhat similar to what I asked last quarter, but many of your \u2013 well, not many \u2013 your peers have stumbled out of the gate with basic economy. Do you plan to roll out Saver Fares all at once on January 1? It sounds like that's the plan. I'm just wondering if staggering the rollout might be an option that would minimize execution risk.","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hey, Jamie, this is Shane again. And I might speak to this, I've been sort of principally involved with it. We are going to do a \u2013 what we're calling a soft launch on November 7 where we will start selling Saver Fares in a small subset of markets for flying in December and we'll use those lessons learned throughout December to figure out if it makes sense to launch fully on January 1. And it probably won't be January 1, it'll be like the 10th, we'll get through the holiday returns or if we need to go at a little slower pace. But I will say, as is often the case, we go a little slower on these sorts of things, and the benefit of that is we've been able to learn from others that have gone before us and so, we should be able to get here quicker than others have had in the past.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just super quick follow-up. Are you going to disclose those markets or is it up to us to find them? I mean we \u2013 and which we can do, I mean, anybody can. It's just trial and error.","Shane R. Tackett - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. No, I think we won't \u2013 we'll disclose them once we've got sort of the final decision on where they're going to be. We'll have Matt follow up with you all.","Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, cool. Thank you, everybody.","Matt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thank you, Jamie.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Helane Becker of Cowen Securities.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, operator. Hi, team. Thanks for taking the time. When we look at the changes that you guys were talking about in terms of the retrofit of the fleet, where are we seeing that on the income statement? And is there a reason why, or is it in that line item for maintenance that was up 22% in the last quarter?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Helane, it's Brandon. Good morning. In terms of the retrofit costs, those are capital and so you'll see those in CapEx, which will ultimately flow through in depreciation once those mods go into service. There's really nothing in the maintenance line per se related to reconfiguration of Airbus airplanes.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Then was there a reason why those costs were up so much in the last quarter?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","I mean, certainly there's reasons. It was just really timing of various activities and some of it is the power-by-the-hour deal that is, on a year-over-year basis, driving some of that increase. But we've talked about that a couple of quarters in a row now.","Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, got you. All right. Well, thanks very much. Good luck. See you next month.","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Helane.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Folks, you guys are probably disappointed not to pay out PBP at target, and I'm kind of curious to know how you're thinking about setting PBP levels next year. Are you going to set them low? You like to set them generally sort of conservatively so you can make payments. I know that. But how are you preliminarily thinking about setting PBP targets and how should I think about that variable incentive pay line next year if you set them really low?","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hunter, it's Ben. I think in terms of payout, we are going to be above target for 2018. So I just want to correct that.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Oh, okay.","Benito Minicucci - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. So we're going to be above target. I think our philosophy hasn't changed in terms of how we set our performance goals. We want them to be aggressive and reachable. Like if you look at the last nine years, we've been about a month's pay. It's a little lower this year. I mean, fuel has been a big issue for us. And some of the other targets, we didn't miss. But I think we're looking hard at those goals. We're setting targets right now. And I think I personally feel good and where we're going to hit them. Just in terms of context, at least 20% of the PBP goals are non-financial elements like safety and customer service. So, there's always a good balance in terms of how we set them.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then a little bit more on Hawaii and Saver Fares to marry these two things up a little bit. How are you thinking about the appetite for those fares in Hawaii? And was one of the reasons why Hawaii might be soft right now is because of some of that basic version that's being deployed that you could see in filings of course by your competitors maybe ahead of your Saver Fare launch? Is that one of the issues that you think maybe you're optimistic that can get cleaned up pretty quickly once Saver Fares are in that market, if that makes any sense?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah, I think it does, Hunter. I think what you're saying actually is system-wide for us. Our hands are a little bit tied behind our back because we don't offer Saver Fares. And so our competitors, one in four times they're getting an extra $25 to $35 more than we are. And that will be rectified going forward next year, and obviously we've seen that on Hawaii across all our major competitors.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Matt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thanks, Hunter.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thanks, guys. Andrew, I wonder if you can clarify the positive RASM result in the Northwest despite high single-digit capacity. I wouldn't have guessed that that would have been the outcome. Is it that Anchorage offset some of the pressure at Seattle, is it just local economic growth in Seattle, is it corporate growth, all of the above? How do we think about the demand and revenue drivers in that market as we look ahead, because it seems like capacity may continue to be somewhat elevated there?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. I think a couple of things. I mean, we've had new growth everywhere, not just California but also the Pacific Northwest. But I think fundamentally, and you've heard us talk about this, is back to basics. We have been \u2013 with most of this integration behind us, we are focusing back on our core disciplines and what we do and what we do well and I think especially with the Pacific Northwest, we've continued to mature markets, we've continued to look at our pricing environment and our network and our hub structure. Certainly Horizon has been performing exceptionally. We had real challenges last year as you know. So, I think all of those things are coming together. And loyalty continues to grow at very significant rates believe it or not in the Pacific Northwest, not just California.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Is there any international traffic benefit that's \u2013 I wonder if you can just elaborate a little bit more on that as well. You mentioned that in the prepared remarks. To what extent is that helping to benefit your revenues, not just in San Francisco but across your system?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, on the international, it's not huge in the scheme of things. It helps us fill in some seats here and there but the real advantage on the international is giving our loyalty members access to the globe, helping fill our partners' planes with valuable revenue and giving our members award redemption. So it's a very profitable relationship for both parties and that's only going to get stronger.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","If I could sneak a third one in here. Brandon, the cash levels, now that Alaska is 90% integrated, you're essentially at your target leverage in the mid 40s, does that loosen up some liquidity for some incremental shareholder returns as we look ahead to 2019, or does it make sense to take down the debt a little bit further before you consider some more aggressive shareholder returns?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Hi, Dan. I wouldn't say we're in the mid 40s yet. We ended the quarter at 49%. We'll be there by \u2013 we'll be at that same level at year-end. Here's the way I'm looking at it though, and I'm glad you asked the question because I think it's a super exciting story. As we look to next year and we see profit improvement and cash flow improvement and free cash flow improvement, our current maturities will be about $300 million. Once we hit that, we'll probably be in the low 40% range debt to cap, our dividends probably in the neighborhood of $160 million, $170 million. So anything in the free cash flow bucket beyond say $450 million to $500 million, that would probably be available for share buyback.","Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Matt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Dan, it's Brad. I might just weigh in. We have gone through this merger process and the profitability has been challenged. A lot of the theme of this call and the last couple have been the different initiatives we have to improve margins, improve returns for shareholders and we've got a lot of confidence in that stuff.","That said, I've been super impressed with the cash flows the business have produced, what Brandon and his team have done with the balance sheet. To be sitting here two years into the merger having paid off $800 million of the $2 billion we borrowed and have an adjusted debt to capital below 50% is really something else. And we've got \u2013 I think you're asking a great question. We've got the ability to improve that even further in 2019 and then this business is producing a lot of cash flow that we'll have a good problem to have as what do we do with that cash flow that we're producing.","Matt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Okay. Operator, I think Dan's off the line. The next question?","Operator","Yeah. Sure. Next question is from Joseph DeNardi of Stifel Nicolaus.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you very much. Good segue. Brad, I think I asked you this question before, just going to try and ask it a little bit differently and in a multiple choice format. Has your experience with Virgin and the M&A process made you more likely, less likely or equally likely to engage in further M&A in the future?","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Everyone's \u2013 they're all doing their hands, they're pushing them sideways, Joe. Here's what we'll say about it is I think the industry has changed a lot. If you look 10 or 15 years ago, it took nine airlines to make up 80% of the pie. Today it's four. I do think we're all really, really happy of what this company has done for everybody that depends on us over decades and getting bigger was important. And so we're really happy with the merger in that respect.","In terms of culturally, we bit off a lot and the interesting thing about business and life is you sort of learn as you go. I think in terms of us biting off another merger, our plate is more than full right now and we're just going to be completely focused on doing what we \u2013 what we've got on our plate right now, doing it as well as we possibly can. So thanks for the question though.","Joseph William DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Bradley D. Tilden - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yes.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning or good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for getting me on here. Andrew, I want to come back to the revenue question area because it's been asked several ways, but if we think specifically about this Saver Fare opportunity, I think you called it out as about $100 million looking into next year. But if that's explaining some of your underperformance to the market, is it still fair to say, yeah, we can get back to market RASM and then some of these initiatives will actually be additive above and beyond that?","Andrew R. Harrison - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think if you want to talk about bag fees, that's getting back to market, Saver Fares is maybe getting back to market although Saver Fares will help us compete very aggressively against other carriers that don't have Saver Fares. So that's a big win. But the big one that we've also been talking about is just really the synergies and bringing our product to life across the system is going to be very incremental. We won't be at \u2013 we've still got low fares, so I don't think we'll ever going to be at market RASM, if you put it that way. We rely greatly as well on our low costs to have the low fares. But I think overall, all of these things come together to provide a good rising tide for us next year.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate that. And, Brandon, I'm going to take it one more time on the cost side, see if we can get something out of you. But it seems like you do have a lot of integration activities ongoing this year. I got to believe that's impacting the operating cost structure too just from even an overhead perspective. Shouldn't some of that activity come down as we head into 2019 and could you help us quantify what that was this year?","Brandon S. Pedersen - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Brandon, thanks for the follow-up question to the follow-up question to the follow-up question and we appreciate that. Here's what I'll say. We have a long history of doing a good job managing cost because ultimately we know it's important to our success. We're going to manage the heck out of costs in 2019 and we'd be delighted to tell you more about that at Investor Day.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","See you there.","Matt Grady - Alaska Air Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much. Hey, thanks, everybody, for tuning in today.

Today's call is being recorded and will be accessible for future playback at www.alaskaair.com. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Director of Investor Relations, Matt Grady.","Matt Grady","Thanks, Sia. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings call and for connecting with us at this new call time. In today\u2019s prepared remarks, our CEO, Brad Tilden, will provide an overview of the business; Andrew Harrison, our Chief Commercial Officer, will share an update on our revenue performance and outlook; and our CFO, Brandon Pedersen, will discuss our results and expectations for costs and cash flows. As usual, several other members of our management team are also on hand to help answer your questions during the Q&A portion of the call.","This afternoon, Alaska Air Group reported fourth quarter GAAP net income of $23 million. Excluding merger-related costs and mark-to-market fuel hedging adjustments and special charges, Air Group reported adjusted net income of $93 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.75, ahead of the First Call consensus. For the full-year 2018, Air Group reported record revenues of $8.3 billion, adjusted net income of $554 million and adjusted earnings per share of $4.46.","As a reminder, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future performance, which may differ materially from our actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings. On today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted earnings and unit costs excluding fuel. And as usual, we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today\u2019s earnings release.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Brad for his opening remarks.","Brad Tilden","Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon everybody. Last month marked the two-year anniversary of our merger with Virgin America, and as we look back over that time, we\u2019re very happy with how far we\u2019ve come. Just 24 months ago we were two airlines in complementary geographies with distinct products, operating processes and cultures not to mention separate FAA certificates, labor agreements and IT systems. Today, virtually all of that has changed.","Our operating processes are fully aligned, substantially all of our systems have been merged, and all but one of our labor groups are under single collective bargaining agreements. To be sure, everyone in our organization has navigated a period of significant change in growth during this integration. We\u2019ve also faced material external pressures from fuel prices and competition, but we believe that competition makes us better and time after time this team has responded to competition with new strength and new capabilities.","We want to thank our terrific employees who\u2019ve done so much to bring these two airlines together, while also continuing to deliver excellent service and reliability to our guests. We\u2019re very proud that they\u2019ve earned $120 million in performance-based bonuses, which will be paid tomorrow and we\u2019re also proud that this is our 10th consecutive year with payouts that are above our target, which as a reminder is 5% for most employees, 5% of pay.","We\u2019re making great progress with the integration on a number of fronts. Culturally, our employees are coming together as a single team. Across the fleet, our guest experience is increasingly aligned and will reach full alignment early next year when we finish renovating the Airbus fleet. We\u2019ve already begun to swap Boeing and Airbus aircraft on the most appropriate routes, our flight [attendants] begin flying as integrated crews next week, which as you know is very early compared to other airline mergers, and we\u2019re working on the integration of our pilot schedules as we speak.","All of this means, we\u2019re rapidly becoming a better version of ourselves with greater reach and scale with the same competitive advantage we\u2019ve always had and with fantastic opportunities ahead of us. The progress we\u2019re making is also starting to show up on our financial results. The fourth quarter was solid and represented a turning point in our margin trajectory. Unit revenues rose at the fastest pace we\u2019ve seen since 2011 and we expect continued RASM outperformance this year as we begin to harvest the value of our combined platform.","At this time last year, we faced multiple-headwinds from aggressive competition, our own growth, new higher cost labor agreements, and rising fuel prices. Today, that picture looks very different. Our growth has slowed. Newer parts of our network are maturing and fuel prices are down. Demand overall is solid and we\u2019re beginning to implement the margin improvement initiatives we laid out at Investor Day. We have good momentum heading into 2019.","Before I talk more about our future, I\u2019d like to provide a few details on the recent accomplishments of our people. First, our operation continues to run very well. Our CD zero, or our controllable departures leaving within zero minutes of their scheduled time was flat at 85.5% in the fourth quarter and it rose 1.5% for all of 2018 to 86.6%. Second, momentum is building at Horizon where our productivity is improving and where our on-time performance was the best in the regional industry last year.","Third, we\u2019ve integrated 95% of our integration milestones and the remaining items once completed will improve the productivity and efficiency of our network. Fourth, we\u2019ve repainted 39 of 71 Airbus aircraft and will re-paint the remainder of the fleet over the next few months. Interior renovations are also underway and our first refurbished Airbus aircraft entered service two weeks ago.","Fifth, our balance sheet is strong and getting stronger. We\u2019ve now repaid $866 million or 42% of our merger-related debt and we ended 2018 with an adjusted debt-to-cap ratio of 47%. And finally, roughly half our employees have completed our Flight Path program thus far and the remainder are scheduled to do so by April 30.","As a reminder, Flight Path is a series of face-to-face workshops we\u2019re conducting with our people. It\u2019s a mix of presentations, open and honest dialogue, and interactive activities focused on Alaska's culture and future. These sessions are helping us come together as a team, something that\u2019s been so important to our historical success and we intend to continue doing this sort of thing in the years ahead.","Many of you have asked us about how recent economic forecasts and market volatility might impact us this year. As you all know, we like to focus our energy internally. Nevertheless, we will say that not unlike other airlines near-term bookings suggest modestly more revenue uncertainty in the first quarter, compared to the fourth as we move through the year\u2019s seasonal trough period. But in general, demand is solid, and we have not seen any dramatic shifts in the marketplace. Andrew will elaborate more on market conditions in a moment.","Most importantly, we\u2019re determined as a leadership team to stay clearly focused on factors we control to deliver consistent value for our guests, employees, communities and shareholders. We believe that if we do this, we\u2019ll produce strong relative margins and returns regardless of the industry environment and that\u2019s our primary financial goal. For 2019, this means delivering on the $330 million of revenue initiatives and synergies that we\u2019ve detailed for you and hitting our operational and cost objectives. Andrew and Brandon will talk more about these in a moment.","Summarizing and taking into account our general expectation for the industry, our multi-year goal is to produce profit margins, which average 13% to 15% over the business cycle by improving performance in the controllable parts of our operation. We believe we can and will do this as we unlock the value of our newly combined platform and since lower capacity growth supports us in this process, we believe our plan to increase capacity is 2% this year and by 3% to 4% next year is the right plan.","We are on the road to delivering higher margins in 2019 and 2020 as we work with our people to leverage Alaska\u2019s substantial competitive advantage over our route network that now has greater reach and scale. With most of the integration now behind us, we look forward to doing just that in the quarters and years ahead.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Harrison","Thanks Brad and good afternoon everyone. Total revenue for the fourth quarter rose 6% to $2.1 billion on capacity growth of 1.1%. RASM increased 5.2%, which was our largest increase in several years. Slower capacity growth in a more stable competitive environment provided a favorable backdrop, while the network, brand, and loyalty investments we\u2019ve made to activate the Virgin America acquisition began to yield strong results.","As we outlined for you at Investor Day, this positive momentum should continue into 2019 as we further enhance our revenue production through synergy capture and accretive initiatives. Before turning to our future plans, I would like to provide some additional color on our fourth-quarter results.","First, same-store markets or markets in operation longer than one year, represented 97% of our capacity and contributed positive 5.7 points to RASM. Strong close-in demand and yields across most of our networks, due in part to the strong growth and business volumes, delivered roughly two-thirds of the increase, while accretive network adjustments made earlier in the year and strong mileage plan revenues contributed to the balance. We\u2019re especially pleased with the strength in business traffic, considering historically we\u2019ve had a much stronger orientation towards the leisure traveler.","Next, developing markets, these are markets in operation between one and three years, contributed about a positive 70 basis points to RASM. These markets are a subgroup within our same stores and represented about 7% of capacity in the fourth quarter. They include the routes launched in 2017 that created a headwind for us over the last year. Today, these markets are comping positively with RASM, up 10% on improved yields and load factor. We continue to be pleased with the development of these routes.","And then finally, new markets or markets in operation less than 12 months represented just 3% of capacity in the fourth quarter, and had a negative 50 basis point impact to RASM. As mentioned last quarter, the Hawaii market is navigating a period of elevated capacity and weak pricing. West Coast ASMs to Hawaii rose 8% in the fourth quarter. Yields were down year-on-year, and had a 125-basis point impact on our fourth quarter RASM, and that\u2019s consistent with our guidance.","Though we expect yield weaknesses to continue this year, we believe strong growth in our loyalty program, the introduction of Saver Fares and our low-fares high-value positioning will enable us to weather the near-term environment better than our competitors. And speaking of competitive positioning, we\u2019re continuing to enhance our product offering. We have a number of upgrades planned for 2019 that will drive continued momentum for our brand and will translate to higher guest preference and stronger revenue growth over time.","To name just a few of these improvements, first one, we're deploying satellite internet with 20 times a bandwidth of our current offering on a 125 aircraft this year. We\u2019re installing next generation interiors on a third of our mainline fleet. We\u2019re launching a re-imagined food and beverage program along with continued expansion of our in-flight entertainment offering. We\u2019re adding more Embraer 175 aircraft and now represent approximately 60% of our regional fleet and our equipped with first-class and premium cost savings in-flight entertainment and Internet connectivity.","And finally, we\u2019re upgrading our lounges and opening a new flagship lounge in Seattle, which will offer handcrafted coffee beverages and premium food for purchase. All of these enhancements have been engineered to deliver high value for our guests at relatively low costs and will stand on their own from a P&L perspective. As our product improves, we are also highly focused on delivering the $330 million in incremental revenues from synergies and self-help initiatives this year, which we outlined at Investor Day.","Let me give you a quick update on each of these. First, Saver Fare, which competes with basic economy offerings at other airlines is arguably the most important of all the initiatives and is on track to deliver at least $100 million this year. Our November product test went smoothly and enabled us to refine our processes and technology before rolling it out network-wide, which we did on January 7. The other product is still new, early results are encouraging and have tracked ahead of our expectations.","We look forward to updating you more fully on Saver\u2019s progress in the near future. Once it\u2019s had time to mature and related revenues have ramped need a run rate level which we anticipate by Q2. Second, we have several ancillary revenue initiatives underway, our recent bag fees increase worth 50 million annually is also new to market and should reach its run rate by the second quarter. Other ancillary initiatives such as the exit row sales and change fees, they remain on track to deliver a further $50 million this year.","And third, our ability to capture revenues synergies is accelerating now that key commercial integration projects are behind us. In Q4, we crossed the Boeing and Airbus aircraft on a handful of routes, but that number will increase significantly in the first quarter before reaching its 2019 run rate in Q2. Our loyalty program also continues to perform at a very strong level with revenues, which is redemption and credit card, up 17% for the fourth quarter. That\u2019s quite remarkable results on a 1.1% capacity increase.","Looking to our first quarter, competitive capacity growth is similar to Q4 at 4.2%. Our own capacity growth will be modest at 1.2%, and we expect it to remain around this level through the second quarter before rising above 3% in the second half of the year. For the full-year, we still expect ASMs to increase approximately 2%. In terms of revenue guidance, we established a Q1 RASM guidance range this afternoon of up 2.5% to 4.5%, continuing the year-over-year gains we saw in the fourth quarter.","Though this guidance includes a meaningful tailwind from our ramping synergies and initiatives it nevertheless shows a modest deceleration versus the fourth quarter for three reasons. First, Q1 year-over-year comparison is 200 basis points more difficult than Q4 of 2018, a 120-basis point of RASM has moved into the second quarter with a holiday shift and then volatility and file fares have increased in both positive and negative directions since late Q4.","Since Q1 is our seasonally weakest quarter, we have put a bit less confidence in close-in pricing behind our Q1 forecast then we saw in the fourth quarter. Despite these impacts, we expect our Q1 RASM will outperform the industry by a wide margin as it did in the fourth quarter, and as we expect it will do consistently this year as we leverage the significant self-help opportunities of our commercial plan.","Bottom line, we\u2019re entering the year with positive revenue momentum, which is a big change from this time last year. Delivering margin improvements through higher RASM continues to be the commercial team's number one priority in 2019, and we are confident we\u2019ll achieve it as we exploit new revenue sources that are largely within our control.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon Pedersen","Thanks, Andrew. Hi, everyone. As you've seen, Air Group posted a fourth quarter adjusted net income of $93 million or $0.75 per share, bringing our full-year adjusted net income to $554 million or $4.46 per share. Return on invested capital was 9.4% or 140 basis points above our cost of capital. At $8.26 billion, this was Air Group's highest revenue year every, certainly something to be proud of, but overall our financial results are not where we want them to be.","We finished 2018 on a very positive note. After several quarters of significant margin declines, our fourth quarter margin of 6.2% was roughly 100 basis points below prior year and our lower tax rates resulted in net income and earnings per share actually improving year-over-year. RASM strength nearly offset both higher fuel and nonfuel costs. This despite elevated Q4 CASM acts on the lowest capacity growth of the year, combined with a high level of maintenance activity and a jump in depreciation from the 11 new E175\u2019s we took delivery during the final four months of the year.","It\u2019s worth noting that our Q4 cost performance was better than our initial guidance despite us having completed fewer ASMs than planned. As Brad said, the strong finish resulted in our people are earning $120 million of performance-based pay or PBP, which translates to more than 6.5% of pay for the vast majority of our employees. PBP pays based on achieving financial, safety, loyalty, and guest satisfaction goals. It\u2019s also unique in our industry because it aligns every employee, regardless of roll or level around the same set of goals.","When combined with our operational rewards program, which pays when we meet monthly goals, we shared more than $147 million with our people in 2018. And we\u2019re proud of this payout because it\u2019s an example of how we\u2019re trying to run the business in a balanced way that benefits all of our stakeholders. We\u2019re providing good wages and benefits to our people and sharing $147 million of incentive pay with them for hitting important goals. Our guests are getting low fares and an improving product, and our owners are getting a larger dividend that I\u2019ll talk about in a few minutes.","The fourth quarter marks a turning point in our earnings trajectory, and underscores the shift in focus we\u2019ve made from network expansion to business optimization and on generating higher margins. And although we have a lot of work left to do, Q4 was an important step in the right direction. For the full-year unit cost rose about 3% on 5% capacity growth, outperforming our early 2018 guidance of 3.5% CASM increase on a 6.5% growth in capacity. It\u2019s worth viewing 2018-unit cost in-light of step function increase in labor cost that we observed last year.","Agreements we amended added 300 basis points to our unit cost. This headwind aside CASMex would have been about flat in 2018. Teams across the company deserve a shout-out for executing some of the most complex integration milestones last year, while also delivering the kind of back to basics cost performance that has been a competitive advantage for us. As we guided at Investor Day, 2019 nonfuel costs will be up 2% to 2.5% on about 2% ASM growth. This is an exceptionally strong cost plan considering low ASM growth, and the roughly 120 basis points of headwind we expect from a higher mix of regional flying this year.","One important element of our 2019 cost plan is aggressively working to improve terms we have with our business partners, and consolidating our purchasing our efforts across multiple spend categories. Our supply chain team is leading this effort and I want to acknowledge our business partners who have already come to the table and stress for them the importance of this campaign to our near-term success. We're looking for long-term partners who can help us reduce cost today in exchange for future opportunities to grow their business with us.","Our guidance does not include the impact of any new labor deals we may complete in 2019. We\u2019re in active negotiations with the International Association of Machinists, which represents our fantastic customer service, reservations, and ramp service agents, as well as other employees and support functions, and we remain in discussions with the aircraft Mechanics Maternal Association, representing our aircraft technicians.","We hope to secure ratified deals with these groups and as we do, we will update our cost guidance accordingly. Our update this morning provides expected unit cost performance by quarter. Let me touch on the first quarter where we expect CASMex to increase by about 5%. There\u2019s some information on our investor update that should help investors understand it, but in a nutshell, here is a quick summary.","First, on the cost side of the equation, there are several timing events that create tough year-over-year quarterly comps in the first quarter of the year. Those are, first, aircraft maintenance is significantly frontloaded this year, compared to back loaded in 2018. Second, the depreciation impact of 11 E175s that we took in the last four months of the year. And third, our Flight Path employee workshops, which ran from last fall and go through late April. ","On the capacity side of the equation, it\u2019s our lowest growth quarter of the year and that growth is heavily weighted to higher CASM regional flying. Big picture, our costs will be up in the first half of the year, but should be about flat in the second half of the year. Our teams worked hard on the 2019 cost plan, and I have confidence in their ability to deliver on it, especially after the great performance in 2018.","Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $1.24 billion in cash. Total cash flow from operations for the year was $1.3 billion ex-merger-related costs, while net CapEx was about $960 million over the same period, resulting in roughly $370 million of free cash flow again ex-integration costs. Operating cash flow of course should improve in 2019, although the increase will be tempered somewhat by the higher cash tax rate. Our current expectation is 19%.","However, CapEx declines to $750 million with lower fleet grow. So, free cash flow should still increase materially versus 2018. And we\u2019re sharing some of that immediately with our owners. As you've seen, today we announced the sixth increase to our dividend since we initiated it in 2013. We\u2019re raising our dividend by 9% to $0.35 per share per quarter or $1.40 per year, representing about $175 million of cash that will be paid to our owners and increasing our yield to about 2.1%.","We\u2019re also planning to repurchase about $50 million of our stock in 2019 essentially offsetting dilution, however this plan is flexible. Our number one capital allocation priority continues to be fortifying our already strong balance sheet. In 2018 alone, we reduced on balance sheet debt by $470 million. With leases, our year-end adjusted debt-to-cap stood at 47%, 6 points better than at the end of 2017, and fully 12 points lower than the end of 2016. We expect to achieve our leverage target of debt-to-cap in the low-to-mid 40% range by the end of 2019.","Here are four other data points that underscore our balance sheet strength. First, [indiscernible] recently reaffirmed our investment grade credit ratings. Second, we have 95 unencumbered aircrafts valued at about $1.7 billion. Third, we have $400 million of undrawn credit facilities, and finally our defined benefit pension plans, which have all been close to new entrants since January 2010 are 84% funded. Our long-term owners tell us they value a conservative balance sheet and it\u2019s been a hallmark of our past success.","Let me close by reiterating a theme you\u2019ve heard several times today. We're working hard to improve the financial returns this business is generating. We\u2019ve shared with you our longer-term goal of achieving a 13% to 15% margin and 2019 should be a nice down payment on that. Our top line will benefit from merger synergies, slower growth, maturing markets and new revenue initiatives. Our loyalty is growing, our on- board profit is becoming more consistent. Our class plan is aggressive, but achievable. Our fleet is fuel efficient. Fuel prices are reasonable and our balance sheet is strong. And this team is very optimistic about what 2019 holds.","And with that, let's go to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Savi Syth","Hi, good afternoon. First question on the Transatlantic, I\u2019ve been trying to understand with the fleet changes, I realize that it\u2019s still pretty early stage with kind of swapping the Boeing and the Airbus Aircraft, I\u2019m wondering what the core underlying trend is in the Transatlantic and the markets where you have swapped if you can assume the improvement you would have expected?","Andrew Harrison","Hi, Savi, it\u2019s Andrew. Essentially as we said in our prepared remarks, we\u2019ve pretty much affected the cross-fleeting that we wanted to do, especially in the New York area. I think what we see here, traditionally Q1 is our weakest quarter, and so actually what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve added capacity in a trough period on the transcon, so we really expect to see the real benefit from this really start to kick in March and going forward. So, we feel really good about these changes and they are a key part of course of our revenue synergies for 2019.","Savi Syth","Thanks. And on the capacity front, I notice it\u2019s still early on in the year, but I notice that 2020 was kind of updated from like 4% to 3% to 4%, just wondering how you are thinking about capacity and what the flexibility is, especially with kind of few pulling back that I know a lot of uncertainty here on the macro front. Just high-level thoughts on growth here.","Andrew Harrison","Again, this is Andrew. I think one of the things that we feel about the capacity increase for this year as you know we give a range. I think one of the things that for 2020 is also looking at what happens to the environment, how is that going to continue on, where are we at with our revenue generation and of course we have also, with multiple fleets we have pilots that are going through training, and so pilots will be another key area that we need to look at, but it will have a margin effect on our growth getting people through the training house as we continue to grow.","Savi Syth","Okay. Thank you.","Brad Tilden","Thanks, Savi.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Michael Linenberg","Hi, good afternoon guys. I guess two questions here. Andrew, you called out the weakness in Hawaii, I think you said that was like 125 basis points of RASM headwind in the fourth quarter, how was that trending into the March quarter? Is it similarly under pressure or is it \u2013are we seeing some improvement?","Andrew Harrison","Yes. I think for modelling you might want to just carry that forward into the first quarter. Capacity is less elevated in the first quarter, but also given especially geography wise the first quarter, especially for California is a weaker time, so I would just carry forward the same weakness that you saw that we have advised in the fourth into the first and then will be interesting as we get into the stronger months and capacity growth has started to slow mostly where we go from there.","Michael Linenberg","Okay, great. And then just one other question on, you know I think \u2013 not even I think, at your Investor Day, you kind of hinted at or maybe even said that it seems like at the end of the day joining one world would make a lot of sense for Alaska and yet, you know when I look at just the partnerships that you announced over the last quarter or two with Japan Airlines, Aer Lingus, Finnair, Fiji, many of those companies are either in one world or associated with one world, at some point would it be better off for you just to have lots of bilateral relationships with one-world carriers, and not go through all of the \u2013 maybe complications in pain of joining the alliance, maybe like what Aer Lingus is doing, where they are taking that approach where they are going into the JV, but for now they\u2019re keeping one-world on the side? I mean, what\u2019s better for you from kind of Alaska\u2019s perspective?","Andrew Harrison","Mike, I am going to put you on my alliance time because I\u2019m very impressed with your detailed knowledge of Airlines, that was impressive. I think what we had mentioned was really talking about one-world connect, we\u2019re not considering a full membership, so connect is a much lighter version and you still need your bilaterals, so, I mean, but your points are very fair one. I think if you look at our portfolio, the majority of our partners \u2013 our one-world partners where we have good bilateral agreements with them and we also have some independent.","So, I think, as we look at this again, we\u2019re very much just in the research phase, but we\u2019re just looking to see if there is any benefit with all our partners, including American, but if there is not, we think we\u2019ve got a good strategy as it stands today.","Michael Linenberg","Okay great. Thank you.","Brad Tilden","Thanks Mike.","Operator","The next question will come from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Andrew Didora","Hi, good afternoon everyone. First question maybe a little bit of a bigger picture question, maybe for Andrew, but how have you seen maybe your booking curve change since integrating Virgin America haven't you seen it move out further, if that gives you a little bit more visibility or are just more closer and given the corporate focus there and I guess as a follow-up to that, how have you had to just some of your revenue management practices because of that change in booking curve?","Andrew Harrison","I might start it of, and I know Shane obviously saw that for a long time, but I will say that a lot of the changes we made to any of the booking curves we made earlier on Virgin America used to take a lot of bookings more closer in, our traditional comfort level was to take them further out and so we adjusted our booking practices there, but certainly we pull out a lot more Transcon markets now that are very, very competitive and so the JFK, LA is a classic example. So, we\u2019ve had to adjust how we look at that and how we book that, but I don\u2019t know Shane if you\u2019ve got any other commentary to add.","Shane Tackett","Thanks, Andrew. I would just add, I mean Andrew nailed it spot on, the trade-off is if you hold out for yield or not, and then you sort of hope that it comes and when it doesn't you feel bad about your strategy and when it does you feel great and we traditionally like to manage that just further out the booking curve. So, we have seen the California booking curve get a little bit longer. The downside of all of these changes is whenever you change your approach you usually get it a little bit wrong out of the gate, which gives you an opportunity to optimize. So, I think part of what you're seeing now towards us is getting smarter and smarter about this market and managing it better.","Andrew Didora","Interesting, thank you. And then my second question for Brad, you mentioned Horizon in your prepared remarks and that\u2019s clearly an entity that continues to drive your growth into 2019, but then kind of eases as you get later in the year. I think it\u2019s about a year or so ago you made some of the management changes at Horizon, can you maybe talk to how those changes have performed versus your expectations and what initiatives you have for Horizon as you look into 2019? Thanks.","Brad Tilden","Thanks, Andrew. Thanks very much for asking that question. You know a little bit of history, despite the fact that horizon has been part of Air Group for 37 years now, there actually has not been nearly enough sort of management back and forth between the two companies over most of those years and so you end up with cultures that were more different than we were comfortable with, and we did get ourselves into a [mess operationally] a year and a half ago and Gary Beck is sitting in the room right now, came back after a super successful tenure as Alaska's Vice President of Flight Operations to become CEO of Horizon, and he took Constance von Muehlen with him, took John Hornibrook, [indiscernible]. A terrific team of leaders. And I think the turnaround of Horizon has been stunning.","They are totally fine with \u2013 and it\u2019s not that the industry doesn't have \u2013 somebody has to work on Alaska, pilot attraction is something we all need to think about, but I was actually down in the schoolhouse a week ago, I guess it was a week ago today, and we\u2019re super impressed by what I saw and I just want to say this leadership team has done an incredible job. They\u2019ve also, a lot\u2019s going on with their fleet. Gary you\u2019re up to 26 E175s. So, in a short period of time you\u2019ve gone from being an all Q400 to pretty soon you will be 30\/30. 30 E175 and 30 Q400s. So, thanks for the easy question Andrew and it\u2019s a chance to heap a little praise on the group of people that have done just a fantastic job.","Andrew Didora","Great. Thank you, Brad. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Hi, thanks. Just with respect to your commentary about more conservatism with respect to close-in, are the off-peak periods behaving differently into the first quarter than they did in the fourth quarter sort of ex-shutdown impact if there was a way to isolate that? Or is it just sort of conservatism given the fact that the March quarter is highly dependent upon March?","Brad Tilden","Yes. I think really the off-peak periods where there is really not a lot of demand and you see this across the industry, as the fares go down to the lowest level. And really January and February apart from after the first week of January and Martin Luther King Day and a few other, January and February are really quite weak. So, really \u2013 and this has just been history for us, but as a shared previously with the acquisition of Virgin America, our first quarter got heavier again, as far as our weakest period. So, we continue to work on that. As far as government shutdown goes per say, we have not seen any material impact at all to date as it relates to fares and travel although down the road and if Ben wants to comment that, if this continues there will be some real challenges operationally.","Ben Minicucci","Andrew it\u2019s exactly that. Everyone across the country is seeing some challenges along the TSA front and we're just hopeful this thing gets solved soon and things get back on track.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Just to clarify, you had some off-peak in the fourth quarter as well, where you not seeing that in the fourth quarter?","Andrew Harrison","So, what happened and I think this is general, we have seen but there was good fare momentum in the fourth quarter and then be sort of got in coming up to Christmas where the fares all collapsed and came down, business came down as the industry tried to fill seats coming up to Christmas and the softer period. The business fares have sort of come back, the leisure fares took a little longer to come back. So, again, even as we look at fare filings and the industry is putting 4% more capacity in general in the first quarter, I think it\u2019s still finding its way. ","So, I think what I'm really trying to say is, there was a little more confidence in the fourth quarter just with the stability. As we moved into the first quarter and saw what happened over the Christmas holiday season and the fare filing activity in the first couple of weeks of January, we\u2019ve just been a little bit more cautious about where this is going to settle out.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Fair enough. And then just, can you give us an update on your thinking and analysis with respect to potentially moving to a single fleet type down the road? Thanks for taking the questions.","Mark Eliasen","Hi Duane, this is Mark Eliasen. As you know, we\u2019ve got 37 mainline claims on orders. So, we\u2019re looking at the fleets. We\u2019ve said for a long time that the question is whether we return to all Boeing or we continue with the mix of 321neo\u2019s and a Boeing fleet, but we don't have to make that decision right away. We're growing at eight airplanes a year, you can see that we\u2019re 37. We\u2019ve got some time to do it. So, we're learning a lot about Airbus as we operate that Airplane. We're learning a lot about the 321neo, and the way Airbus supports its customers and its launch customers. So, as we evaluate the plane, we\u2019ll be able to make a good decision and we're looking forward to that decision.","Duane Pfennigwerth","Thanks Mark.","Operator","The next question will come from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Helane Becker","Hi, everybody. Thank you, operator for the time. To Andrew, this time around you didn\u2019t talk too much about your Frequent Flyer Program and your credit card acquisitions in the fourth quarter, and I was just wondering if there, you could just give us a little update on that or if it\u2019s gotten to the point where acquisitions slowed?","Andrew Harrison","No, thanks Helane. That\u2019s a very fair question. I mean, the reality is that the trend that I have been sharing all year has continued. I think, maybe just feeling a little bit like continuing to be very, highly transparent about that program is probably doesn't serve us well in the long run and I think initially we did that just as a lot of the concerns over the brand and the Virgin America and the integration. We wanted to just make sure people felt really solid about our program and \u2013 but it has continued to perform, and as I made in my prepared remarks fourth quarter revenues for mileage plan which includes credit card and redemptions was about 13%. And so, it was very, very quite significant.","Helane Becker","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you very much. That\u2019s really all my questions.","Brad Tilden","Thanks, Helane.","Helane Becker","Sure guys.","Operator","The next question will come from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamie Baker","Thanks. Hi, everybody. You know I love competing with Michael Linenberg, so obviously submitting my resume to the Airlines team as well. Just turning to the Q1 RASM guide, you know it\u2019s obviously helped by the high level of regional flying, you said at the Easter shift, which also bodes well for the second quarter, but you know, ordinarily is that regional contribution wanes in the second half? You'd expect RASM trends would moderate somewhat as well, I mean that\u2019s just kind of the math, I'm not asking you to necessarily endorse that. I am trying to understand though whether you believe that your revenue initiatives could offset that phenomenon, which in turn would suggest that quarter-to-quarter RASM trends would be reasonably consistent with one another throughout the year. Any thoughts on that?","Andrew Harrison","That you can go into the RM Department, but so couple of things. On the regional side, a lot of the new markets that we\u2019ve been growing in these maturing markets where all in the regional side of the house. And also, with all these new regional aircraft, they are actually adding I think our first class ASMs are actually up 8%, excuse me, our revenues are up 8% for the first-class cabin, 6% growth. So, the regional fleet although it has \u2013 have higher unit revenues, but was also bringing a lot of premium class cabin as well, which we want to continue to sell. ","I think, so I still see upside as we continue to mature the markets that the regional network is flying and we bring more and more first-class product into the market and Premium Class. And then to your other point, though, you know, first quarter, if you look at our revenue initiatives, whether it was the first bag fee, which came out December 7, Saver Fare came out January 7, the cross-fleeting, which I referred to earlier. We're on a very steep ramp-up during the first quarter. So, we still have a lot of confidence in the revenue initiatives, but it's really the second quarter and beyond that they will really take full hold than you really start to see them come through a unit revenue guidance.","Jamie Baker","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And second, just on the choppiness in regard to close-in pricing and this follows somewhat on Duane's question, but did you afford, maybe I missed it, any geographic commentary around those comments? Is it broad-based, was it SoCal? Transcon? I mean, the comments did catch me a little bit by surprise. Maybe just a little bit additional geographic color, if any?","Andrew Harrison","I think just depending on the markets, but in general, I think we saw that across the system as its related to \u2013 and to varying degrees depending on the market. But if you go take a look, the industry has been very active in fares. You just look back and even December through to January, there's been a lot of fare adjustments coming up and down and again, just given our network and where we compete, we've just been a little bit cautious with that because it'll fall where it falls. But nothing specific geographic that would drive any specific comment there.","Jamie Baker","Perfect. Thank you very much gentlemen. Take care.","Operator","The next question is from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Rajeev Lalwani","Hi, good afternoon. Andrew, actually just picking up on some of the last couple of questions as far as the volatility in close-in fares, what do you attribute it to? You've been doing it for a while. Does it maybe indicate that there's a problem with demand coming or there is competitive issues? Just some thoughts given your history.","Andrew Harrison","Yes, Rajeev, you know I just think that really \u2013 again, I'm only speaking from our corner of the world and you've seen everyone's guidance as we go into the first quarter. I just think there was a pretty decent shift between, you know as we went up to the Christmas period and then people getting ready for the first quarter and especially January and February, and we just saw a lot of fare activity. Fuel is also been moving around a lot. It's just been very active. I'm not saying it's actually good or bad. It's just a little volatile. So, as we look ahead, we expect things to calm down, especially as we start to move into the backend of the first quarter and move into a more solid period in the second.","Rajeev Lalwani","Okay. And then on lower fuel. I think the last time around we saw a big move down. Alaska had pushed capacity growth I think a decent amount. Why isn't that in the cards for this year? And then relating to that, this might be for Brandon. Should you keep a lot of the benefit around fuel, does that mean you could maybe start a buyback program before the end of the year?","Brad Tilden","So, Rajeev, you're asking with lower fuel why aren't we growing more? Just to make sure I understand your question.","Rajeev Lalwani","Yes. And you've done that historically, right? That was a couple of years ago.","Brad Tilden","Yes. Maybe just to take a step back and get everybody up to speed with how we're thinking about things. We are a higher growth airline. That's been our history. We bought Virgin America, we added a huge amount of capacity following that to sort of activate those markets. And the language I would use is we've throttled back here to \u2013 enable the markets an opportunity to catch up a little bit. And also, there's a lot going on internally here as we get pilots moving around, training, getting the right pilots trained on the right aircraft. There's aircraft going through interior mods that sort of affect pilot supply by aircraft type as well.","So, I just think the way to think of it now is 2% this year, we're just sort of settling in a little bit. I think this is the wrong call to ask us really about growth in 2020 and beyond. We're not locked in on 3% to 4%. What we're saying is, this is the right amount of growth for us right now as we look at our business. As we get into the summer months, if we think \u2013 you know this is how we think. If we believe we can create incremental value for the owners of this business by growing, we will grow as we've done over the years.","Personally, I'm an optimist. We all believe in our competitive advantage. I believe in our route network, all of that. I think we're going to find those conditions. When we find them, whether it's summer \u2013 I don't think we really want to be put in that box right now. But that's how we're looking at the world. Brandon, I think there was a related question on if we didn't grow, would we buy back more stock and I'll let you answer that.","Brandon Pedersen","I think the question, Rajeev if I heard it correctly was if cash flows turn out to be stronger than maybe we're expecting because of the lower fuel prices, would we start doing more repurchase with that excess cash flow? And the answer is maybe. In the prepared remarks, we said, we were going to repurchase $50 million of stock this year, but we also said, this plan is flexible. And people should know, this plan is flexible. We're really focused on the fortress balance sheet that we had in getting back to it. We're damn close, but if we want to do more share buyback with excess cash flow, we certainly have the ability.","Rajeev Lalwani","That was it. Thank you, guys.","Brad Tilden","Thanks, Rajeev.","Operator","The next question is from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Catherine O'Brien","Hi, everyone. So, I'm not sure I'm prepared to throw my hat in the ring with Mike and Jamie there, but I also have a question on global partners. At the Investor Day, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe you mentioned that you consider selling partner airline tickets without an Alaska connection in the future. Do you have any update here? I think you said, it could be as early as this year.","Andrew Harrison","Hi, Katie. Nice to hear from you. Thanks for your question. So, we are continuing that route. In fact, we are actually testing that as we speak. In fact, if you were to maybe look up San Francisco to Sydney on Qantas on alaskaair.com, you would actually find a flight. We're not heavily marketing that right now. There're limitations to it. You can't buy first-class or premium-class yet and a few other things, but we are well into our trials with our partners in talking to many of our partners about starting to sell their metal on alaskaair.com.","Catherine O'Brien","Really interesting. And then, I would assume \u2013 would that be above the 330 million in initiatives you've got going for this year?","Andrew Harrison","Well, that's an interesting question. Here's what I'll say is that, we have loyalty and we have initiatives around loyalty and of course selling internationally is going to be part of that portfolio. In fact, [our code share] in interline traffic actually increased 9% in the first quarter. So, our network and working with our partners has actually been a real asset for us.","Brad Tilden","The real strategy there, Katie, is to grow our loyalty program and sort of grow \u2013 be able to be a one-stop shop, a full-service provider. I don't think that selling Qantas is going to bring huge incremental revenue to Alaska, but being a one-stop shop for our customers does have big value to us as a business.","Catherine O'Brien","Understood. Thanks. And if I could just maybe ask one quick follow-up. What inning would you say we're in just in terms of network refinement, cross-fleeting, all of the initiative \u2013 like you kind of had to get under your belt after the reservation system cut over last spring?","Ben Minicucci","Hey, Katie, it's Ben Minicucci. Great question. I think \u2013 as you heard from the tone of the call \u2013 we're feeling pretty darn optimistic coming out of Q4. We're two years into this integration. What's up this year is still not all complete, but we're going downhill is the way I would describe it.","So, whether it's the seventh inning, eighth inning, we're going downhill. We've got some major systems still to integrate, like our dispatch system, pilot crew scheduling, maintenance systems are big ones. And from a customer standpoint, it's just converting all these Airbus to the Alaska interior and getting that complete. So, by the end of the year, we're done. But we're just \u2013 we feel like we've got the wind at our back and we're going downhill, we're feeling pretty good.","Catherine O'Brien","Thanks so much for that guys.","Brad Tilden","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Hi, everybody. This Love Field situation is becoming kind of a mess between Southwest and Delta. You guys are kind of caught in the middle of it. So, a couple of questions around this. Does the settlement from the Virgin merger contain any contingency language that allows you to leave that place if operating conditions change there \u2013 if this legal case takes a weird turn like some sort of MAC clause? And then how core is that airport to you guys in the long run in the event that happens?","Kyle Levine","Hi, Hunter, this is Kyle. I'll take the first one and then turn it back to Andrew. Our consent decree with the justice department does allow us to move on from those gates if it were ever our wish to do so. The circumstances around that just generally are, the court could order us to have that outcome or we could go propose a solution to justice and they would have a right of refusal over it. But as far as the Dallas Love Field litigation goes, that's not our wish at all. We view those as important property that we purchased from Virgin America. We want to take a good shot at it. Even though we're cooperating with the judges and the other parties, we're standing firm.","Hunter Keay","Okay. That's good enough. Thanks, Kyle. And then, Brandon or Matt; how many employees a year has listened to these earnings calls and how has that changed over the last 12 months? If you sort of adjust for growth and headcount.","Matt Grady","Hunter, I would say most.","Ben Minicucci","Hunter, I don\u2019t know if we have numbers. Hunter, it is Ben, when I talk to our folks, I think there's just pockets of people who are really interested. They actually own a lot of shares of Alaska. We've got a great ESPP program that they participate in. I know our union leaders to be honest, and we talk to them. They're also listening on the call. And then, to be honest, right after we do this, we rush over to the airport here in about an hour and we do an entire webcast. We kind of summarize what we talked about with all our employees. And then we have 3,000 people listening in. So that's kind of how we think about it.","Brad Tilden","How about share ownership to while we are talking about this sort of thing, do we \u2013 I saw something recently do we \u2013 do you guys know that figure, it is pretty high. Percentage of our employees that own shares in the company. Hunter, I'm not positive how many listened to the Analyst Call. There are some that do, but when this webcast they'd be a lot more connected to.","Hunter Keay","The nature of the question was, I'm kind of wondering if during the struggles with the stock and the margins if you've found a lot more employees dialing in to these calls over the last 12 to 18 months or so? And whether that's an indicator of sort of morale or confidence or anything like that?","Ben Minicucci","I'll tell you, we talk about it openly. We have these Flight Path workshops that Brad talked about. And when we talk about running a balanced business about taking care of employees and customers and shareholders and communities. When we get to the shareholders we say, look, we've been under pressure honestly in the last 12 months and our job is to get the stock price to a place where we can provide good returns for our owners. So, we are totally transparent with our employees about that. And they understand.","Hunter Keay","That\u2019s great. I appreciate that. Thanks.","Ben Minicucci","Thanks Hunter.","Operator","The next question will come from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Dan McKenzie","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks, guys. Just one housecleaning question on the Saver Fares. Where are you guys at with respect to that average upsell differential today?","Andrew Harrison","We've not really spoken about that. I think we're only like two-and-a-half weeks into it. But as we said on our prepared remarks, we're very pleased with how it's tracking. And the $100 million that we share with you, we're very, very confident that that will be met this year. On the next quarter call, we'll give more of a brief on that.","Dan McKenzie","I see, Okay. And then, of course at the risk of kicking the dead horse here, just kind of going back to the choppy fares on off-peak demand kind of spread across the network. Should we be thinking that potentially is the link between lower fuel and lower revenue potentially leading to some of that choppiness or is it just over capacity? I guess I'm just trying to get a little bit more clarity. And I guess just related to this, how much of the benefit from lower fuel do you think Alaska can capture this year? Is it 100% of the benefit? 75%? Or something potentially a lot less than that as we kind of think about rolling through the year here?","Andrew Harrison","Just on the first one \u2013 again, I want to make sure I don't overplay this choppiness. I think really what I've been saying is that just given the switch from the fourth quarter and then into the first quarter and capacity increases that we're seeing industry-wide. I think there's just been active fare management with the fuel moving around. But I think at the end of the day we're still seeing strong demand, our business demand is very, very strong as well. So that's sort of just where we are on that. I don't know \u2013 Brandon or Shane want to answer the fuel question?","Brandon Pedersen","I mean, just anybody's guess at this point. And it really probably comes down to what happens with fares as you move through the quarter into March and beyond.","Dan McKenzie","I see. Okay. And then I just had one more follow-up here. And that's just really reverts to an earlier question I think maybe from Katie here. In the past, you guys have talked about connecting revenue from connecting widebodies coming into San Francisco from the partners, I guess. Passengers connecting at San Francisco from partners going onto your middle. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on that? What are you seeing? Is it material at this point? Is that something that can get turned on more fully as we kind of move through the year here?","Andrew Harrison","As Brad shared earlier, the real benefit to Alaska and our loyalty program is not so much the incremental passenger getting of a wide body. It's really more our loyalty members getting access to long haul flights. They stay in our program, they accrue miles on us, they pay tickets on their partners that help our partners. So, it's a really good, strong ecosystem that allows our global partners good feed into the United States, and it allows us good access for our members globally and to earn miles. That's how we look at the world.","Dan McKenzie","Okay, thanks for the clarification. Appreciate that.","Brad Tilden","Thanks Dan.","Operator","The next question will come from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Joseph DeNardi","Thanks for the time. Andrew, I was going to say thank you for all of the additional detail you provided in our prepared remarks, but then you said you didn't want to be transparent anymore on the loyalty programs, so I'm not going to say thank you. Just on the guidance for 1Q, 4Q initially was 1.5 to 3.5, you ended up at 5, how much of that was close in coming in better than expected? Just trying to get a sense for whether the first quarter RASM guidance was constructed similarly to fourth quarter.","Andrew Harrison","Well, I think a couple of high level and someone else can jump in. We actually haven't been forecasting unit revenues. We used to be lucky to give you load factors and booking trends and stuff like that. Really, I think it's just in 2018, we've really been forecasting unit revenues for the Street. And with the amount of change in our business \u2013 we went from a three range at one point to a two-point range. So, I think on the fourth quarter there was some strength that came in for sure. But additionally, with all the moving parts in our business, we probably undershot our forecast. But I think as we get more and more of this under our belt, we get more and more confident about how we're forecasting the quarters going forward.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. And then, Brandon, in the investor day deck you had a capital deployment waterfall for 2019, which showed about 130 million left over for buybacks or more debt reduction. You mentioned the 50 million assumption on the buyback for 2019. Does that imply that there's 50 million left over after all the other uses, CapEx, debt, dividend? I mean, is that a comment on cash flow for the year? Can we plug the 50 million into what's leftover in your waterfall chart and back into your cash flow guidance for the year?","Brandon Pedersen","Yes. You could kind of back into the cash flow guidance of the year that way because as we were constructing that chart, we were thinking about our likely capital allocation. We tried to give you more clarity on the call today. I think if you just take consensus numbers, for example, and you say that produces roughly $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion of operating cash flow. You got CapEx [of] 750, debt repayments of roughly 300, dividend 175, repo 50 as we've stated. It probably \u2013 I know you've got some integration funding left to do. That probably leaves around $150 million of additional capital that we haven't yet decided what to do with specifically. We could use that for share buybacks or we could take debt to cap down probably another two points.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. So, it's not to imply that your outlook for 2019 cash flow is less than consensus because you're going to have less leftover than what you had in that chart?","Brandon Pedersen","No. We weren't trying to apply anything like that.","Joseph DeNardi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The final question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is actually Matt on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one from me. You talked about in the commentary and a couple times through Q&A about corporate business surge being strong. Is there something from the initiatives at the Investor Day or is this just general strength in kind of business fares we should think about? Any of the initiatives that are coming through from Alaska in this regard?","Andrew Harrison","Hi, Matt, thanks for the question. Specifically, to the initiatives in the 330, there's not really anything materially baked into that. I think you're going to hear just a tad more from me on a quarterly basis about business given our new expanded network. We have a Vice President of Corporate Sales and we're actually doing a lot of cool stuff with our new network. And just starting to build more muscle there.","So, I think part of what you'll hear from us is actually we have better insight now into corporate travel and business, which is a good measure of the economy. So, I think you're just going to hear a little more talk from us about that. It doesn't necessarily mean we have some massive initiative that you should be counting on for the 330.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank you.","Matt Grady","Thanks, Brandon. And I want to thank everybody for tuning in for this quarter's call. As we break, I want to also thank Mark Eliasen for a terrific career with Alaska Air Group. This is Mark's last analyst conference call. Mark, you retire next Thursday or something like that. I want to thank you for a fantastic 10 years with this company, 38 conference calls and lots of airplane deals and airplane financing deals. Thanks very much.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Investor Relations, Chris Berry.","Chris Berry","Thanks, LeRoux, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today for Alaska Air Group's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Our CEO, Brad Tilden; and our CFO, Brandon Pedersen, will share their thoughts on our first quarter financial results, our operations and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Several members of our senior management team are also here to help answer your questions.","As is our normal practice, our comments today will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings available on our website.","We will refer often to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings or unit costs excluding fuel. We have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a first quarter GAAP profit of $37 million. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio, we reported a record adjusted first quarter net profit of $44 million or $0.62 per share. This compares to a First Call mean estimate of $0.56 per share and to last year's adjusted net income of $28 million or $0.39 per diluted share. Additional information about our unit cost expectations, capacity plans, future fuel hedge positions, our capital expenditures and other items can be found in our investor update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com. And now I'll turn the call over to Brad.","Bradley D. Tilden","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report our fourth consecutive first quarter profit, and we're also pleased that this was a record first quarter. In many of the 22 years that I've been here, we've posted sizable losses in the first quarter that have required us to dig out of the hole in the second and third quarters. This quarter's results demonstrate the positive impact of the changes we've made at both Alaska and Horizon over the last decade and the nimbleness we've gained in tailoring our capacity to meet demand.","It's notable that we earned a profit in each month of the quarter, and this is the first time I've seen us post a profit in the month of January.","In a moment, I'll talk about a couple of the uncertainties we're facing over the next few months, but I want to first highlight the strength of our results and the strength of our underlying business. We've been a solidly profitable company for several years now, and we expect the same thing this year. Although we're facing some headwinds with unit revenues, we're hitting our aggressive cost management objectives, and the decline in oil prices will help significantly. So overall, these excellent first quarter results put us in a good position for the rest of the year.","For the quarter, our pretax margin was 6.3%. This represents a 1.9-point improvement from the first quarter of last year and translates to a rolling 12-month ROIC of 13.4%, which compares to 11.6% at the end of last year's first quarter. Revenues grew 9% on an 8.7% increase in capacity. The capacity growth was driven by new Midcon and Transcon routes out of the Pacific Northwest in San Diego and by the annualization of California to Hawaii flying added last year.","For the quarter, PRASM grew 0.3% on a slightly higher load factor and flat yields. Looking at the 2 operating businesses, mainline PRASM grew 0.4% and regional PRASM increased 3.5%. The latter being largely the result of a 2.6-point jump in load factor.","Overall, we're generally pleased with our first quarter revenues. The mainline PRASM increase of 0.4% compares to an industry PRASM increase of 3%. However, Alaska's result was based on a 9.5% increase in capacity while the industry result was based on a one half percent decline.","Additionally, Alaska's average days linked grew by 3.2%. On a sequential basis, PRASM was up 2% in January, up 1.6% in February, and down 2.1% in March. We were disappointed with the March result, and it was impacted by 3 items. First, we had too much capacity in our California to Hawaii markets. We made schedule reductions that will be effective in the next few days and additional reductions that will be effective in the fall.","Second, new Transcon and Midcon routes are still in the developmental phase and are not yet producing system average revenues. And finally, we're seeing more competitive capacity in certain markets and some pricing actions by competitors that are negatively affecting close-in fares.","As we look forward today, we see advance book load factors down about 1 point in April and flat in both May and June. From a unit revenue standpoint, April is the most difficult comp of the year as PRASM in April 2012 was up about 7% from 2011. The factors I just mentioned pertaining to March, as well as potential demand impact from government sequestration, ATC-caused flight delays and the shift in the timing of Easter, are all pressuring April unit revenues and will result in negative comps for the month, likely at levels exceeding the March decline.","We're taking steps now to improve yields, and we're evaluating whether more changes to fall capacity is needed. While we have a history of reacting appropriately to changes in demand and adjusting capacity, our size allows us to be flexible and adapt quickly.","We have a very good cost story this quarter. Brandon will get into the details, but overall, CASM x fuel was down over 2%. The mainline business had notable performance, with CASM x fuel down 4%. I want to specifically thank all of our folks in our operating divisions at Alaska who are led by Chief Operating Officer, Ben Minicucci, who've done a great job managing their aggressive cost and productivity goals. In fact, across Air Group, productivity, as measured by passengers per employee, improved by 4.3% from last year.","On Tuesday, we announced a major initiative to upgrade the cabins of the majority of our airplanes. We'll be retrofitting our 737-800 and 900 aircraft with the new slimmer Recaro seats that are already being used on our 900 ERs and which are receiving great customer feedback. We're also adding 110-volt and USB power at every seat, and we'll be investing in an improved in-flight entertainment system.","The new seats, power, in-flight entertainment and other cabin enhancements will help Alaska differentiate itself even further from our competitors.","With the new space-saving design of the seat, we'll be able to add 6 seats on our 800s and 9 seats on our 900s without sacrificing passenger comfort. This will drive additional revenue, especially in our high-demand, high-density markets, and it will lower unit cost.","When we're through with the upgrade in late 2014, we will have increased the number of seats in our fleet by 2.4%. We know that to grow successfully and compete with the LCCs, we need to keep bringing costs down. This investment will help us do that.","During the quarter, for the third consecutive year, we won the FlightStats.com award for the best on-time performance in the United States, and this highlights the incredible performance of the Alaska and Horizon operations teams. One of the biggest drivers in customer preference is the safe and reliable operations, and our people are providing this consistently.","And speaking of customer preference, you may have seen our announcement last week that Curtis Kopf has been promoted to the new position of Vice President of Customer Innovation. Many of you have heard us discuss our strategic plan, which we summarized as our 5 focus areas. One of these includes the goal to be the easiest airline to fly by 2017. The customer innovation team, which will consolidate and streamline many of the activities and functions that are underway today, will help make this a reality. I am really looking forward to some of the new ideas that will be coming from this group and to seeing Alaska extend our leadership position with respect to customer-facing technology.","Before I turn the call over to Brandon, I want to share my view that despite near-term pressure on revenues, 2013 should be a very good year for Air Group. We're confident in the strength of our brand and our network, a position that will only get stronger with the cabin upgrade project. And we're looking forward to another very good year in 2013.","I want to thank our employees for their incredible work this quarter to help us achieve these record results, and I want to -- I also want to ask them for their continued focus and flexibility as we work together to deal with the increased competition in our markets.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everyone. I'm finding it cold, so I apologize if I sound a little nasally today. Air Group reported an adjusted net profit of $44 million compared to $28 million last year. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings improved by 59% on a 57% increase in net income and a 2% reduction in diluted shares. And as Brad mentioned, this result brings our trailing 12-month after tax return on invested capital to 13.4%, a 1.9-point improvement over the 12 months ended Q1 of last year and well above our weighted average cost of capital.","On an adjusted pretax basis, we reported a $71 million profit, which is $25 million or 54% better than last year. The $94 million improvement in revenues more than offset a $40 million increase in nonfuel operating costs and a $30 million increase in economic fuel costs. Brad spent a fair amount of time talking about the revenue environment, so I'll jump right into costs.","Nonfuel operating costs increased 6% on the 8.7% increase in capacity. As a result, CASM x fuel declined by 2.3% to 8.62 cents, quite a bit lower than our initial guidance at the start of the quarter.","We were very pleased with our cost performance, and our leaders across the company are doing a very good job managing the budgets. We did, however, also benefit from the deferral of certain projects, both IT and non-IT, to later this year. We saw a significant increase in maintenance expense with roughly half of the increase attributable to a high number of engine events at Horizon which we expect to subside in the second half of the year.","Looking to the second quarter, we're expecting unit costs x fuel to be about flat on a 7.5% increase in ASMs. Maintenance, contracted services and other expenses are expected to increase more than capacity, accounting for much of the flat cost performance.","In our investor update this morning, we lowered our full year guidance for CASM x fuel from down 1% to now down 1.5%, given the solid cost performance in the first quarter. However, as we've stated previously, our unit cost guidance does not include provisions for new contracts with several work groups. There's also growing uncertainty about our airport costs in Seattle, given where we are with lease negotiations, that could negatively impact our second quarter and full year costs.","Our goal, however, is to get to a place where Air Group's costs are lower in the long run, but we may have some short-term increases in our airport costs to get there.","Economic fuel costs were up $30 million or 9% on a 7% increase in consumption and a 2% increase in economic price per gallon. We've seen a steady decline in jet fuel prices recently, which is reflected in our $3.27 guidance for the quarter compared to $3.40 per gallon in last year's second quarter and $3.48 in the first quarter of this year. The lower fuel prices should help offset some of the unit revenue pressure Brad discussed.","The cost of hedges that settled in the first quarter was $12 million or about $0.11 a gallon. But it's notable that we only spent $4 million on new positions this past quarter, the lowest level in recent history. This reflects our shift last year to purchasing call options that are up to 20% out of the money.","Moving to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with nearly $1.27 billion in cash and short-term investments, about equal to the year-end total. We generated $212 million of operating cash flow on the first quarter compared to $183 million last year. Capital spending was approximately $100 million as we took delivery of three 737-900 ERs and made advance payments on future deliveries, resulting in over $100 million of free cash flow.","We repurchased 373,000 shares of our stock for $19 million, bringing our total purchases under our current $250 million authorization to $28 million at quarter end. And when you include repurchase activity since the end of the quarter, we're now at $37 million under this facility.","We also paid off approximately $88 million of debt, bringing our debt-to-cap ratio adjusted for leases down to 53%, which puts us on pace to hit or fall below 50% by the end of the third quarter. This is 28 points lower than where we were at the end of 2008 and reflects the very strong financial performance we've seen in the last 4.5 -- 4-plus years.","It's worth reminding folks that since that time, we've generated $2.5 billion of operating cash flow, made significant investments in our business while expanding ROIC, produced $870 million of free cash flow, lowered on and off balance sheet debt by $1.2 billion and repurchased $227 million of our common stock.","We currently expect full year CapEx to be approximately $450 million based on our firm order book. That may increase somewhat, depending on what we do with our options later this year. We'll take one 900 ER in the second quarter and then 3 more in the fourth quarter, bringing our total 900 ER fleet to 13 by year end. As a reminder, the 900 ER has unit costs that are 8% to 10% better than our 800s.","Today's CapEx guidance includes the enhancements we're making to the cabin, with the Recaro seats and the installation of power, which is expected to cost approximately $100 million. We expect $20 million of that to fall into 2013 and the balance into 2014. Because of the design of the Recaro seat, we'll be able to add about 475 seats to our 800 and 900 fleets, or the equivalent of about three 800s. This is a cost-effective way to grow seat capacity, lower unit costs by more than 2% and generate additional revenue. It will also give us the ability to slow capital investment to something less than what our option book would otherwise allow. We expect the cabin investment to have a 2 to 2.5-year payback.","We again expect to generate free cash flow for our fourth consecutive year, and we also expect to return a significant percentage of that to our shareholders as we continue to execute on our current buyback program.","Overall, we're very pleased with the quarter but mindful of the challenges ahead. We remain committed to delivering returns well in excess of our cost of capital and being good stewards of our owner's money.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Brad to kick off the Q&A.","Bradley D. Tilden","Thanks very much, Brandon. And operator, we are now ready for questions from the analysts.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask sort of a question on CapEx longer-term and your thought process there. I couldn't help but notice in all the prepared remarks, the focus on sort of product enhancements and things of that nature. And of course, you've \tgone through a re-fleeting program, and you've always been sort of a very product-focused company. And where I'm going with this is, as you all know, sometimes investors like to try to parallel airlines to rails, and I've admittedly been a bit skeptical of that parallel but I'm open-minded. And if there's any airline that I feel like is closest to having those sort of economics or that trend, it's you guys. And one of the things that we've seen in rail land over time is that as the rails drove prices higher, actually, their CapEx as a percent of sales continued to sort of stay stable or go up because as they drive price higher, they need to kind of increasingly make customer-focused enhancements to their product or service to justify in part those higher prices. And when I take a step back, I sort of feel like I'm seeing a similar pattern with you guys, and it's working. This sort of virtuous cycle, it's very helpful to you. But I'm curious, do you think of it that way? If we envision a world where consolidation leads to higher fares over the next few years, do we need to even step up our game further in terms of product and service as fares go higher and the CapEx associated with that? How do you think about that?","Bradley D. Tilden","Yes, John, great question. Here's a couple of thoughts about it. This upgrade that we're doing now is a $100 million upgrade, and that's not a fleet that's got a value of $4 billion or something like that. And this is the first time I can remember us making a cabin upgrade in 10, 15, maybe 20 years. So I don't think this is the first of many things to come. I think this is something that's due, and it's time for it. It's going to really benefit our customers. The NC power in particular is going to be great. And I think it's really important to keep in mind that this is going to enable us to increase seat density and get us closer to some of the low-cost competition. So on the 800s, we're at the 157 seats today, we go to 163. And that's maybe more than a couple of the airlines, but Southwest has 175 seats on an 800. So I think that's kind of how we're thinking of this. I don't think we're thinking of this as the first of many investments but is something we do need to do right now. To your broader question, I mean, an objective we've had for many, many years was to begin to produce significant free cash flow, and we're doing that. I think Brandon shared some numbers earlier. And so, I don't know, we're excited about doing that. I don't know if we're getting to your question exactly, but I don't -- I think our mindset is that, as we are able to invest and produce revenues and produce profits, to let some of that come through as free cash flow, to not be reinvesting at all. Is that getting to your question or are you asking something different?","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. I mean, what I'm getting at, I think a little bit more is, as fares -- as the fare environment goes up, if that's the case, if that's the future that we should be predicting, to what extent does that force the airlines to make sort of commensurate improvements in their products? Or do you think that product and service and -- improvements in product and service and price are just sort of disconnected enough that fares can go up for multiple years without that?","Bradley D. Tilden","John, I may need to think about it more but my initial guess is the latter. I don't really see a connection. I think that as the industry does a better job with capacity, hopefully, we have more pricing power. But I think, these changes to our products are good, but I don't -- I'm not sort of sitting here seeing repeated improvements or upgrades to the product.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like it's more of a cost-centric decision, and maybe that can lead me to a second question, which is, when I think about your cost profile over the last few years, you guys have done an incredible job of outperforming inflation. And it sounds like from your go-forward cost commentary, that you'd like to continue to do that for the next few years. I know that up-gauging has played a big role here. But outside of up-gauging, how should we think about your normalized sort of CASM x fuel, and what levers do you have outside of up-gauging to keep that below inflation?","Brandon S. Pedersen","John, it's Brandon. Maybe I'll take that one. You're right, up-gauging has been important to us, but I think the story goes beyond that. Bigger picture, we know that getting our cost lower is an important part of our success going forward. We're really proud of the work that we've done over the last decade or so. We've been able to reduce cost 10 out of the last 11 years, and if we do it again this year, it will be 11 out of 12. Productivity enhancements continue to be an important part of the strategy going forward. We've shared with you over the last couple of calls some of the things we're doing with kiosks that -- or self-service kiosks, for example. We have web bag tags that are coming. There's lots of things going on that are both preferred by our customer -- not necessarily preferred, but that our customers like, and help productivity. And so the idea is to leverage growth in airplane size, leverage growth in stage length, but also couple that with really tight control over overhead and continued focus on productivity to continue to manage costs down.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Trahan.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","I'm going to be candid here, Brandon. The cost per gallon that you're paying for fuel on a percentage basis above your unhedged competitors, going forward into the second quarter, is actually increasing. It's getting worse, and it's actually twice as much as it has been in the last 3 years, basing on what I've seen from your guidance so far. If you're hedging to reduce volatility, it's not working. Fuel cost is just as volatile as it's ever been. And if you're hedging against sort of temporary exogenous shocks, I don't see the point of why you need to hedge into 2016. So as you talked about the competitive capacity challenges that you're facing? It just feels like you're trying to run a race now with a weight around your neck. And it's becoming such a drag on your ability to drive margins. And I feel like you're really kind of handicapping your URM guys to drive yields high enough till they get to a point where they are expanding margins on a year-over-year basis. So I mean, what does it take, really, what does it take to reevaluate the strategy? The net cash position on the balance sheet, you've got billions of dollars of unencumbered assets. What does it take to really just liquidate the hedge book at this point?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Well, Hunter, I appreciate your candid comments. Maybe I'll let Mark Eliasen, our Treasurer, handle that one.","Mark Eliasen","So I guess you know that the fundamental problem we have as an airline is customers buy tickets in advance and we buy fuel today. So while I respect your position, we look at hedging as insurance, and it has worked for us. I mean, if you look at the current quarter, you're right, we haven't used our hedging program. But if you look at the last 11 years, it's paid off 9 out of those 11 years. And it saved our shareholders and investors $367 million. So I think, looking at it 1 quarter at a time, while we do calculate that and we are just as focused on fuel as anyone, we do take more of a long-term view of our program.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","But comparing this industry to the prior -- 5 years ago, I think, is pointless to some extent. And I understand that your tickets -- your customers buy tickets in advance, but no one is buying air tickets for 2016 right now. So I mean at the very least, as your balance sheet, Brandon said it himself, your balance sheet has come in 40 percentage points on a debt-to-cap basis your net cash. There's no reason you should have the same risk profile from a cost management perspective now that you did 8 years ago. So I'm not telling you to stop hedging, let's drop that for a second. Why don't you just only hedge for like 4 months out, 6 months out, even 9 months out, because that's when your customers are buying your tickets. That's really what it's about. Hedging into 2016 just, conceptually, just doesn't jive with that.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Yes, I think there's merit to what you're saying in terms of the industry changes, the dynamics of fundamentals being different. That's something that we are certainly starting to think about. But as you know, we like to be a little bit thoughtful and deliberate on how we evaluate these kinds of changes, and -- but I think your point has merit. The one thing I will say is if you look at the breakdown of our fuel cost, you probably noted in our investor update that our cost of hedging is $0.18 in the guidance. Well, $0.12 of that is hedges coming through, which is at some cost because we bought those a couple of years ago, and $0.06 of it is because we just swapped into the crack spread. And to the extent that we have $0.06 because we've swapped into the crack spread, what we've done is moved on the downside. But to the extent cracks go back up, we'll also be leading the industry -- or excuse me, we'll have a better position in the industry as we go back up. So $0.06 of it is just the swapped piece. But it is notable that we've only spent $4 million in the quarter on go-forward positions, which is much, much, much less than we've ever spent before. And that's because we've changed our policy with the out of the money in the last 6 months.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Yes, no, I appreciate that. I mean, you guys are doing a good job, there's no doubt about it. It's just -- your stock is so cheap, you have phenomenal cash flows, a great balance sheet, there's just so much low-hanging fruit lying around there. It feels like to me that if you really wanted to, you could really compete with the big boys. I'm talking the S&P 500 here in terms of the multiple that you've got. I'm just not -- I'm trying to figure out what's holding you guys back, that's all.","Brandon S. Pedersen","No, we appreciate your candor.","Bradley D. Tilden","Hunter, this is Brad. Maybe just to make a long answer a little bit longer, I think you and some of the other analysts have been helpful pushing us on this fuel hedging, and that's where we've gone to 20% out of the many calls. But I think the point you're making now really is about with consolidation and better control of capacity, the industry's ability to pass on cost increases in the form of higher fares. And that's worth us thinking about. And do we need to be hedging as far out as we do? But we're not the type to announce the change on a conference call, but it's a good challenge for this leadership team. It's something we should think about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen Securities.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. Given the comments that I think you made, Brad, about March and having maybe more competitive capacity in some of your markets, or too much capacity in California-Hawaii, would you consider at all slowing your capacity growth? I think you've talked about 6% to 8% annually going forward, but would you consider bringing that down further?","Andrew Harrison","Helane, this is Andrew. Right now, we're taking a hard look, given the industry conditions, about the fall. There is real strength as there always is in the summer. And we believe we have very decent Hawaii capacity cuts in the summer to take care of some challenges there. In the near term, our profiles are dying, we're selling them, the planes are filling up. There does not appear to be any demand weakness in the next few months for sure. We have more of a yield challenge. So absolutely, we'll be looking at capacity. But at this point, it's the fall. That's where we're focused on right now.","Bradley D. Tilden","And Helane, the 48% was always profit permitting. So absolutely, if we can't grow profitably, we shouldn't be growing. And so that's another answer to your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth from Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just on the competitive issues that you're seeing, I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail, at least some color on how much of your capacity is exposed to this action?","Andrew Harrison","Sorry, Savi, which action were you referring to?","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just the unusual fare discounting and pressure you mentioned that was causing unit revenue pressure.","Andrew Harrison","Got it. So just in March alone, 1\/3 of our network was subject to a 3% to 4% reduction in selling structured fares in the mid to lower buckets. And really, there's 2 drivers for that. Firstly is Hawaii. The industry right now, especially out of California, has fares $50 to $60 lower year-over-year. And at this point, that continues. So that's the first challenge. And Hawaii is probably about 20% of our network. And then the other area is California. And what we're seeing there is a number of low-cost carriers having fares that are anywhere from $10 to $20 lower year-over-year in bookings that occur anywhere from 7 to 13 days in advance of departure, which is a key booking period. So we're not seeing issues with demand but the industry has some low fares in the marketplace that is putting pressure on our yields.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Understood. Are you seeing that letting up as you look forward or is that continuing?","Andrew Harrison","What we're doing right now is we're actively managing it from a revenue management perspective, calling on our strengths, we're using the strength of our regional network, our feed, our O&Ds, we're doing a lot of things to make sure that we come out in a solid place, so -- but there is some pricing pressures.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one last question. Regarding the $100 million investment, is it possible to segregate how much of that is for adding seats versus just the other upgrades that you're doing in the cabin?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Savi, it's Brandon. We're not going to break out specifically, but it's fair to say that the majority of that is related to the seats.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Fintzen with Barclays.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just quick on the $100 million CapEx for the seats, with $20 million this year, I think that's what you said, Brandon, is that fairly proportional to sort of what's going in, in terms of ASM and how that might be flowing through CASM guidance, or is that sort of you catching like the last couple of days of the year with the seats where it doesn't really affect your guidance in terms of ASMs or costs?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Yes, I think it's more the latter. $20 million this year, as I said, $80 million next. But in terms of the new ASMs that will come in or the impact on costs, I think, very little of it actually gets into 2013. It's probably more rounding than anything else. We really start to see the benefit in 2014. And so you see some in '14, and then just as you lap into '15, we'll see some benefit there, too.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Then as we start to think about '14 and the pacing of that, I mean, is that something you're going to try to do in off-peaks and...","Brandon S. Pedersen","No, no, not necessarily. When we get this thing going later this year, we're going to work hard and just at a constant speed and get that fleet through as quickly as we absolutely can because this is an important investment both from a customer standpoint and from a cost standpoint.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So sort of straight-lining it through next year, the bulk of it through next year will make sense. Okay. And that's very helpful. And then just coming back to the new markets that are developing, particularly the non-Hawaii new markets. You kind of mentioned, obviously, how's that school upgoing versus your expectations, is that sort of tracking the sort of normal 1 to 2 year sort of industry experience? Or just a little color on how those markets are developing relative.","Andrew Harrison","Yes, most of those, David, is the Transcon markets and where we are today. Many of those started over the past 6 months, some of them in the bad, down periods. But on the whole, when I was just looking at March results just the last couple of days, and I have an air of confidence about how they're starting to build and going into the summer. So they are maturing, that I can tell you. They're at lower yields than the rest of our network. But that's it, they're maturing and getting stronger and stronger each month. So we feel pretty good about them.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And when you mentioned some of the lower pricing you're seeing out of the low-cost carriers, do those -- is that a response to some of those new markets, or is that something you're seeing in your broader Southern California network?","Andrew Harrison","Yes, most of those markets are Transcon, which both the pricing structure and capacity is fairly stable year-over-year. Where we're seeing this elevated pressure is on the California West Coast markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Great. Just a couple of questions. I guess, Andrew, to you, how does the competitive capacity outlook look over the next few quarters? I know on one hand, you've had, it looks like maybe there's some seasonal reductions by Allegiant and maybe they're not necessarily head-to-head markets with you, but they'd probably did have some additional capacity on the West Coast Hawaii that goes away, so maybe that's a plus. But then, just watching Delta put some moves in some markets, I think the markets are being characterized as seasonal or utilization flying, but it is nonetheless seats going into your market. There's some stuff where you have JetBlue coming up the coast to Alaska, Virgin America, et cetera. Pluses and minuses, what do you see, and maybe some regions are different, second, third quarter?","Andrew Harrison","Sure. I think net-net, it's somewhat of a high-level wash, but there's really 2 capacity stories. The first one is Hawaii. And going into the third quarter, obviously, which is really important, the industry off the West Coast where we fly is going to be down about 1 point. We're going to be down 6%. And the same for the fourth quarter. So on the Hawaii front, the actual number of seats or ASMs that are going there is actually going to be down. On the other hand, the State of Alaska is our big challenge. In the second quarter, other airlines have increased their capacity by 22%. That grows to 35% in the third quarter. So we're seeing a lot of carriers bring their metal into the State of Alaska this summer, which is going to be our challenge. Some of the others you mentioned, they're up and down the West Coast, which we deal with every day. But the main story really is the State of Alaska, as we head into the peak season.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just my second question, I think, Brad, you gave the number out when you started talking about your characterizing the revenue, what the situation was and what the outlook was. And you mentioned that March PRASM, I think you said, it was down 2.1%. Was that consolidated or mainline? And I know you mentioned that April would be worse, then I think in a sense that you hadn't provided any sort of look on May and June other than things tend to pick up as we move into the summer. Additional color on that?","Bradley D. Tilden","Mike, I don't know if we can provide a lot of color that we haven't said already. We just say it was consolidated RASM for March was down. So sequentially, what we said was first quarter revenues were fine, March was not. March was down a little over 2%. April, we said we do expect it to be worse. May, June, we're not as booked out. Well, I think kind of our thinking here is we are in for kind of a tougher second quarter. But summertime, most of the years I've had here, there's almost always been more demand than supplies. So summer should be okay. And then fall, we're starting to turn our attention. We're starting to think carefully about the fall capacity. So we didn't give guidance for May or June, but maybe you're getting a sense for how we're thinking about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore Partners.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So you've been buying back stock for a while, which is positive, as you see moderation in yields and perhaps some less capacity required in the near term, I'm wondering does it cause you to evaluate your longer-term capital plans? How do you think about taking the next aircraft from Boeing versus perhaps beginning to pay a dividend? It feels like with your debt reduction that you've already got in the bag and very positive free cash flow, a dividend would be really a layup for you.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Duane, it's Brandon. I'm not sure I get the question. It almost felt like there were 2 or 3 questions in there. Is it a question about would we do a dividend? Is it a question about would we slow CapEx in the face of softening demand?","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just use of capital.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Just use of capital, generally? I guess, maybe bigger picture is that we're trying to be good stewards of shareholders' money. We're trying to do the right thing from a capital allocation standpoint. I guess, well, divorce a little bit the weakness that we're seeing in the second quarter and stay at the full year level, as Brad said, I think we're going to have a really good year. And as we think about our current repurchase authorization, we've got a lot left on it, but we're still sticking with our commitment to exhaust that by the end of 2014, which would suggest about $120 million of repurchase activity this year. Of course, as we get to the point where we're exercising -- where we have the option to exercise -- or excuse me, as we have the decisions around exercising new options, we'll consider all the facts that are available at the time. Certainly, the seat project works into the equation. And then, the question about a dividend is, we'll see. We know that capital -- returning capital to shareholders is important. We know there are several tools at our disposal. To date, we've preferred the repurchase path, but that doesn't say that we wouldn't do something different in the future after consideration of the environment that we're in, the cash flow forecast that we have and what the board wants to do.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Appreciate that answer. You know there's a larger competitor that's been alluding to capital return, and we'll see what they announce next month, and if it's material and how soon it is, but I think you've quietly lead the industry from this perspective. Perhaps over time, the industry moves closer to it, but I think you have a real opportunity to maintain your leadership in that regard.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Well, we appreciate that. We are certainly mindful of what others are talking about, although we wouldn't view this as a race. We need to do what's best for our company, and I think we've demonstrated going back to 2007 that we do think that this is important.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Engel with Bank of America.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. One is, looking at your -- I think you might have answered it, but the cost of settled hedges was $0.11 in the first quarter and your update says $0.18 in the second quarter. Was that the $0.06 you mentioned about the refining, or is that something else?","Brandon S. Pedersen","No, that's basically it. It was $0.11 in the first quarter. The guidance that we provided today had a cost of settled hedges of $0.18. Roughly $0.12 of that was the cost of the crude options that settled and another $0.06 of that is just the swaps coming through. So that's the differential.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And will that come back down to $0.11 or $0.12 back again in the second half, probably?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Yes, I think so. The swaps that we do are really, really close-in. And so as those swaps burn off, we should get back to what would be \"normal\". And then longer term, as we minimize the cash outflow related to new options, you'll see that come down even further.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The interest expense was actually slightly higher than the second half, not much, but you've been paying down debt, so why is that?","Bradley D. Tilden","It's Brandon, maybe I'll jump in on that. Part of it is the accounting around Terminal 6 in L.A. From an accounting perspective, that is get on our books, even though it's a typical lease arrangement. But since we funded the construction of the terminal, from an accounting perspective, it's a big asset on our books, and what looks like debt, and so we're required under the accounting rules to call some of the rent payments as interest expense, almost as if we're amortizing a capital lease. Think about it that way. It's not much but it does drive maybe, George, $1 million or so on the quarter?","George Newman","$1 million, yes.","Mark Eliasen","The overall -- this is Mark. The overall story is very good though. We're reducing debt, which is causing us about 5%, so that's a good story. The yield has gone down a little bit on our temporary cash portfolio, though.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And finally, can you give us an update on San Diego, how is it doing and what's the plans over the next few quarters?","Andrew Harrison","Glenn, this is Andrew. As you know, we've had some niche growth there with Hawaii. I think we're running now about 12 cities, 24 departures a day. And so we're watching some of the new regional markets, as well as the San Diego-Orlandos and the Bostons, and we're going to be starting San Diego-Lihue for summer here in June. We've been very pleased. It's not easy-going, but we're seeing good promising signs, and we're just very pleased right now.","Joseph A. Sprague","And Glenn, this is Joe from Marketing. If I might just add on the San Diego question. We have a lot of marketing and advertising focus there right now, both to grow awareness of our new service from that market but also to bring in new customers to our customer base there. We've seen some great success on that front. Our mileage plan membership in San Diego is up 10% year-over-year. And we're also, when we do a geographic focus from our alaskaair.com, both shoppers and bookers, we're seeing big increases in terms of our alaskaair.com bookings from San Diego.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob McAdoo with Imperial Capital.","Bob McAdoo - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question. Early on in the discussion today, you've made some comments about Hawaii capacity changing, and you made some reference to in the next few days or something. What was that? Could you go back -- I didn't understand what you're doing in the next few days.","Andrew Harrison","Well, Bob, the reference there was that on the 29th, which is in the next few days, we will reduce our California Hawaii capacity by the equivalent of 2 airplanes. So Kona and Lihue will be going instead of daily to basically 4x a week. And then that's permanent going forward. So the only point there is we've had too much capacity there, and it's coming out in a couple of days.","Bradley D. Tilden","And Andrew, that service out of San Jose and Oakland, so Kona and Lihue goes from daily to half daily.","Bob McAdoo - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","That's not something new. That's something that's been in the system for a while. It just happens to be -- actually, you're just starting up this way is what you're saying?","Andrew Harrison","Exactly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve O'Hara with Sidoti & Company.","Stephen O'Hara - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Could you just talk about -- on one of your other conference calls, there was talk about, I guess, what I'd call the fruits of consolidation in the industry. Where do you see the industry now versus the benefits of consolidation or kind of how you see consolidation playing out? And I mean it seems like there are a couple of companies that are still kind of mired in the process. I mean, do you see that helping the industry and maybe Alaska longer-term more so than it already has?","Bradley D. Tilden","Steve, we've talked about this on other calls. I think that net-net consolidation has been a really good thing for the industry, and it will be better. I mean, if you just go back to a different time when the industry was a lot more fragmented with different players and everybody kind of more in a market share battle than actually trying to make their businesses successful and produce returns for owners, we many, many times have way too much capacity in the given market. And now we've got 4 airlines that have in excess of an 80% share of the industry or something like that. And I think across-the-board, much more kind of responsible decisions that are being made by the airlines. So I think it's good for the industry. Hopefully, it's kind of us kind of getting through another cycle or 2 of deregulation and becoming a more mature industry. Candidly, I think it makes us, at Alaska, it makes us optimistic about the future for the industry and about our own future.","Stephen O'Hara - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And then second, in terms of the seat additions and the power option that you're adding. I mean, do you see yourselves, I mean, I guess do you see yourselves moving away from maybe trying to emulate more of a low-cost carrier or maybe some of the bigger guys that don't focus as highly on cost, I guess. I mean, where do you see that, the trend going over the long term? I mean, do you want to try and get closer to the low-cost guys, or do you think they kind of maybe move up towards the industry average over time?","Bradley D. Tilden","Steve, you know us. We're in an interesting spot out here on the West Coast, flying up and down the West Coast of the United States. The fares have always been really low, yet Alaska has always had a differentiated product, and we cater to business travel and just sort of that part of the market. So we have always straddled this a little bit. I don't -- if we wanted to be an LCC, we'd make a lot of changes and add a lot of seats. If we wanted to be just like the big trunk carriers, the network airlines, we go a different place. So I don't -- this is an incremental move that I think is going to give our customers terrific seats, in-seat power, great in-flight entertainment system, maybe some other changes to the cabin as we go forward. But it is also going to make the company -- it's going to put us in a position where we compete a little bit more effectively with the LCCs. So it's hard -- I reckon, it's hard to give you an absolute answer but that's how we think about it. And that's the space we've been in for 10, 15, 20 years now, out here on the West Coast.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Banse with KUOW Public Radio.","Tom Banse","I've got a quick question about this week's FAA controller furloughs, and I wondered if that has any operational effects so far, any adjustments you see the airline making in the short term? Can you can respond to that?","Benito Minicucci","Tom, Ben Minicucci here. Yes, the FAA furloughs definitely had an impact on us across the country, but -- where we operate a lot of flights into Los Angeles, so we've seen a daily impact into Los Angeles, I would say, one cancel per day on a Horizon flight as well as 5 to 6 delays ranging anywhere up to 3 hours. We've done a lot to take care of our customers, we communicated a lot, we've diverted a couple of flights into Ontario when the delays have been excessive. We had buses waiting to take customers back to Los Angeles. So we're doing everything we can. We were on ATC calls constantly monitoring arrival rates, and we adjust on the fly. Really proud of our ops team in the way they are dealing with this, and we are going to do the best that we can to mitigate it for customers, but we hope there's a solution from D.C. that put some end to this and we can get to more normal operations.","Tom Banse","And if you could just wrap that up. How much advance word or planning ability do you have based on what the FAA is communicating to you?","Benito Minicucci","They probably, they give us -- they don't give us a lot of words since, Tom, just to be honest. You maybe have an 1 hour to 2 hours when they change the arrival rate. What we've done in our planning process is we worked the arrival rates to an operational plan. So if the arrival rate in Los Angeles drops by 30%, we know exactly which flights to move, to divert, to perhaps cancel, consolidate, do whatever we can so we can take excessive delays and bring them shorter. So we've actually developed a pretty quick playbook to manage this inconvenience.","Bradley D. Tilden","And, Tom, this is Brad. I might just add that in a time when our country sort of desperately needs to get our economy moving again and we need to move more closer -- we need to move closer to a balanced budget, it's kind of difficult to imagine and it's a little bit unfathomable that we are kind of impairing this critical part of our infrastructure. So I don't know, there's encouraging things the last day or 2. I think there's cause to be optimistic that we're going to get this problem behind it -- behind us. But the sooner, the better, from our perspective. This is something we desperately need fixed.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Trahan.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","The -- let's talk about change fees. You guys did about $26 million in change fees last year, and JetBlue did $135 million of change fees despite the fact that your revenues were about the same. I'm not asking if you're going to adjust those change fees, I know you can't comment on that stuff, but can you explain to me at least why it was so much lower? It's about $0.90 a share, that you're leaving, I think, off your P&L for that. Is this an enforcement issue? Are there -- the restrictions need to be tightened? I'm just wondering sort of why that discrepancy exists?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Hunter, it's Brandon. Maybe Joe can answer the question in terms of the policy, but what were the numbers you threw out again?","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So I had you guys, according to DOT data, and we had to estimate the fourth quarter, but we had you guys at $26 million of change fees and we had JetBlue at $135 million of change fees. If you assume that's pure margin, not to mention pure numerator in ROIC, but if you assume this as pure margin, it's like $0.90 a share in earnings roughly. But either way, those are the revenue numbers, $26 million versus $135 million.","Brandon S. Pedersen","$26 million for the quarter?","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","No, for the full year. That's DOT data. Is that wrong?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Yes, that is wrong.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","DOT data, wrong? No. Okay, so what was your change fee revenue then? Maybe that's the better question.","Brandon S. Pedersen","I don't know that we really have broken that out. What we have talked about is just big picture, change fee revenue on a per passenger basis is more like $12, just to use round numbers .","Andrew Harrison","Just total ancillaries.","Brandon S. Pedersen","$12 per passenger, total ancillaries. And Andrew, we've talked about the amount of revenue that's first bag fee revenue, which is about $125 million a year or so. But we haven't really given much color on the rest. Why don't we take it up a few thousand feet? Joe, do you want to talk about generally how we think about that?","Joseph A. Sprague","Well, Hunter, as Brandon said, our overall ancillary revenue for the first quarter was up. Even on a per passenger basis, it was up slightly, about $11.68. Bag fees, which have been actually trending down the last 3 or 4 quarters, reversed and were actually up 8% in the first quarter. So those are okay trends. They're not great in terms of growth, but at least, it's keeping pace with the rest of our growth. I think beyond that, United announced a pretty interesting change to their change fees this week. At $75 per change for our change fees, we think that's, again, a good value proposition. We have, we're trying to look at each of those different fees that we charge, make sure that they make sense for the customer, that they're simple to understand and yet they reflect the cost of what it does to make a change. And in some of these change fees, where the actual change fee itself is much higher, I think it's pretty tough to make that argument to the customer that it actually reflects the cost to the airlines. So I think we're feeling okay about that area, but as Brad and Brandon have said, these are things that we do spend a lot of time looking at and looking at the trends and making sure we're where we need to be.","Operator","And as we have no further questions, I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Brad Tilden.","Bradley D.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Alaska Air Group's Managing Director of Investor Relations, Chris Berry.","Chris Berry","Thanks, Megan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for Alaska Air Group's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Call.","I know it's been just a couple of weeks since we spoke to you last, so today's prepared remarks will be a bit briefer than usual.","On the call today, Brad Tilden, our CEO; and Brandon Pedersen, our CFO, will provide some highlights from the quarter and our outlook for the third quarter and the full year. Several members of our senior management team are also here to help answer your questions.","As usual, today's comments will include forward-looking statements regarding our future expectations, which may differ significantly from actual results. Information on risk factors that could affect our business can be found in our SEC filings available on our website. We will refer often to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings or unit costs, excluding fuel. And we have provided a reconciliation between the most directly comparable GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our earnings release.","This morning, Alaska Air Group reported a second quarter GAAP profit of $104 million. Excluding the impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our fuel hedge portfolio, Air Group reported an adjusted net income of $105 million or $1.47 per share. This compares to a first call mean estimate of $1.51 per share, and to last year's adjusted net income of $111 million or $1.53 per share.","Additional information about cost expectations, our capacity plans, fuel hedging, capital expenditures and other items can be found in our investor update included in our Form 8-K issued this morning and available on our website at alaskaair.com.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Brad.","Bradley D. Tilden","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everybody. It's good to be talking with you again. Things are tracking along really well at Alaska as we had a solid second quarter. We reported adjusted earnings of $105 million or $1.47 per share, as Chris said, and that represented a 13.5% pre-tax profit margin. This was our 17th consecutive quarterly profit. We continue to produce very solid cash flows from operations and industry-leading returns on invested capital.","We have a long record of quarterly profits and our belief in the sustainability of these profits provided the foundation for our announcement 2 weeks ago that we will begin paying a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share on August 22. This dividend represents a yield of 1.3%, and it's an affirmation of our commitment to providing shareholders with appropriate returns. The dividend is in addition to our $250 million share repurchase program.","Our adjusted profit fell from last year by $6 million due to the negative impact on unit revenues from some additional capacity in our markets. Our capacity increased 7.5% this quarter while total revenues increased 3%. Much of the unit revenue shortfall came in the State of Alaska where, over the years, we've seen airlines and flights come and go. Given the importance of the state, we obviously plan to staunchly defend our turf there. And given industry dynamics, with respect to supply and demand which are generally quite positive, we expect this capacity to normalize in the years ahead. We also have additional capacity in some of our North-South markets on the West Coast and, again, given the industry's more rational approach to supply and demand, we're optimistic that this will stabilize as we move forward.","Our profit was also impacted by several unusual items that Brand -- on the cost side that Brandon will talk more about in just a couple of minutes.","In addition to capacity changes, we believe the changes we either announced or highlighted on our call 2 weeks ago will drive new revenue. Changes to our bag fees and ticket change fees, which will be effective October 30, should bring in approximately $50 million per year of new revenue. Our new agreement with Bank of America for our affinity credit card will result in an additional $55 million of cash flow per year.","And as you know, we're also upgrading the cabins of our 800 and 900 aircraft by adding Recaro seats with power. Because of the way these seats are designed, we'll be able to add 6 new seats in the -- on the 800s and 9 new seats on the 900s, while also enhancing the onboard experience for our customers. Everything else being equal, we expect these seats will add approximately $47 million in revenue annually. Viewed differently, they'll lower unit cost by 3.5% on the reconfigured airplanes or by 2.5% fleet wide. Taken together, and once fully implemented, we expect the annual cash flows from these 3 initiatives to be $150 million or more.","This quarter's results were also impacted by higher rates at Sea-Tac Airport that were retroactive to January 1, and that were imposed on the airlines by the Port of Seattle. Subsequent to our quarter-end close and our last call, we reached an agreement in principle with the port on the major elements of a new long-term lease agreement. Along with the other airlines, we need to convert this agreement to a final lease, and once we do, we'll have lower rates than those imposed.","One positive result of the long negotiation is that we have a much better understanding of the airport rate-making process and are much better at influencing that process. This is important considering that airport costs have risen from","5.5% of our non-fuel cost in 2000 to almost 10% today. I want to specifically thank Karen Gruen and her team in Corporate Real Estate for their diligence in achieving this new agreement in principle.","We also recently reported 2 other pieces of very good news. Our pilots at Alaska and our flight attendants at Horizon have each ratified new 5-year agreements. Having long-term agreements puts us in a position to focus on running a great operation, taking care of our customers and beating the competition. I want to thank everyone involved, both union and management folks, for their hard work in reaching these mutually beneficial deals.","The one group we have that has currently passed their contract amendable date is the Alaska flight attendants, and we're in active negotiations there.","Finally, before I turn the call over to Brandon, I want to thank all of our people for running an excellent operation and for starting our busy summer season off with such strong results. For the sixth year in a row, our customers honored us with a J.D. Power and Associates award for the highest in customer satisfaction among traditional North American carriers. We're very proud of this honor and the credit for the award goes to our people at Alaska and Horizon. We still have some work to do to reach our goal of having the best score of any carrier, traditional or low-cost, but we feel very good about the progress we've made this year after posting the largest point increase of any carrier.","As I think you all know, our goal here has been to build a fundamentally strong business that's good for all of our stakeholders. We want to be safe, we want to operate well, we want to provide excellent service and good value to our customers and we want to be a great place to work.","Finally, we want Alaska Air Group to be a good place to invest, creating a long-term, real value for our shareholders. The concept is simple, the execution is not. We're working hard every day to get better at it.","Thank you for your attention to us and with that, I'll now turn the call over to Brandon.","Brandon S. Pedersen","Thanks, Brad, and good morning, everybody.","As Chris said, Air Group reported an adjusted net profit of $105 million, down slightly from the $111 million profit last year. However, our trailing 12-month after tax return on invested capital improved to 13%, up from 12.3% at the end of the second quarter last year. On an adjusted pre-tax basis, we earned $170 million for the quarter compared to $179 million last year. The $9 million decline was the product of a $42 million increase in revenue, offset by a $45 million increase in nonfuel costs and an $8 million increase in economic fuel costs.","Revenues increased only 3% even though capacity increased 7.6%. PRASM declined 3.8%, largely on the well-advertised increase in competitive capacity in long-haul Alaska flying, which represented about 12% of our ASMs. Yield fell 10% in those markets. System PRASM was also pressured by the 43% increase in transcon capacity in markets such as Seattle, Philadelphia and Seattle -- or excuse me, San Diego, Boston. These new markets have longer than average trip lengths and are still in the development stage.","Many of the factors that caused the second quarter unit revenues to be negative will still exist in the third. As a result, we expect unit revenues to decline again in Q3 on a year-over-year basis, although at a rate less than the 3.8% decline in Q2.","I do want to quickly elaborate on the modified Bank of America affinity card deal. We'll be required to apply some new accounting that is complex and we expect to record a very large one-time favorable revenue item, perhaps in the neighborhood of $150 million to $200 million in the third quarter that we're planning to call out as special. We're also finalizing our estimate of how much of the improved affinity card deal will impact Q3 and Q4. We'll provide more information in our next investor update and in our 10-Q, although we don't expect the P&L benefit to be significantly different from the additional cash flow.","On the cost side, we did record the 6-month impact of the port imposed rates at Sea-Tac that Brad talked about. The $11.5 million charge that we recorded in June resulted in an uptick to our cost guidance in our final Q2 investor update. We do expect, however, a favorable true up in Q3 based on the agreement reached, subsequent to the end of the quarter. Maintenance costs increased by $13 million or 24%, largely on the timing of planned activities, higher than expected cost at Horizon and costs associated with leased aircraft that will be returned in the next 3 quarters. We expect maintenance costs to moderate considerably in the second half of the year.","Despite the increase in airport and maintenance costs, our overall cost performance continues to be very good in nearly every operating division and reflects the commitment by all of our people to achieve lower costs through higher productivity and a tight focus on controlling the growth in overhead. It's notable that productivity improved by 5.5% this quarter and 6.7% in June.","In our investor update, we've provided guidance that reflects our 2 new labor contracts as well as the higher rates at Sea-Tac. Based on what we see today, we expect full year mainline nonfuel unit cost to be about flat and consolidated costs to be down slightly. We're working to manage costs down further though, so that we can maintain our multiyear track record of mainline unit cost reductions.","Moving to fuel. Economic fuel was up $8 million or 2.2% on the 6.6% increase in consumption. The bigger news is the change we recently announced to our hedging program. We're now buying options 18 months before planned consumption, down from 36 months. The shorter tenor will significantly reduce the amount we pay for hedges, yet remains true to our commitment to use a simple, insurance-like program to protect our balance sheet from spikes in oil prices, and provide some additional certainty to our cash flows.","Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. So far this year, we've generated $590 million of operating cash flow compared to $455 million last year. Capital spending was $260 million as we took delivery of 4 737-900ERs and made predelivery payments on future 737s and the 3 Q400s that we'll take later this year. As a result, we generated roughly $330 million of free cash flow during the first half of the year.","We used that free cash flow to pay off $109 million of long-term debt, improving our debt-to-cap ratio to 52% and bringing our adjusted net debt to just over $300 million. We also repurchased over 900,000 shares of our common stock for $51 million. As of June 30, we were $60 million into our $250 million repurchase program, which we still expect to be completed by the end of 2014.","We spent some time on the call, a couple of weeks ago, reviewing the powerful cash flow generation of this company over the past several years. Let me recap that using second quarter numbers.","We've generated nearly $2.9 billion of operating cash flow since the beginning of 2009, and we've used that capital in a thoughtful and balanced way. First, we invested $1.8 billion building one of the youngest and fuel-efficient fleets in the industry. Second, we deleveraged the business by reducing debt and lease obligations by $1.2 billion. Third, we contributed $560 million to our pension plans even though no funding was required. Our plans are now well-funded and they have no immediate funding requirement. And finally, we returned $260 million to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases. As I said a couple of weeks ago, a dividend was the next logical step in our balanced capital allocation strategy.","With that, we'd like to now open it up to questions that you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Let's talk about your codeshare. As much as you can, I'm curious to know what the -- how the decision-making process kind of unfolded. And when you announced service from Portland to DFW in Atlanta, when you make a decision like that, do you do it with the intention of sort of how can we be complementary to our existing codeshare partners into their fortress hubs? Or is it more just simply a matter of, we think we can make money on this, and if we happen to have a codeshare benefit down the line, then that's great. So how do you think about those specific routes to use? Maybe we can extrapolate how to think about that for future decisions like this.","Andrew Harrison","Hunter, it's Andrew. A couple of things, we look at our network and we make decisions about it like a Portland, Dallas as it stands alone on that route. I cannot -- don't have discussions with any partner prior to making those decisions. Once we've made those decisions, we then go and talk to our partners to see if they would like to participate where we think it might be mutually beneficial. The big thing with American, as you know, is adjustments to their scope language has allowed us to, with confidence, look at additional markets that before, we knew full well, they weren't going to be able to work with us on. So big picture we look at, is it complementary to our network? Is it going to help build our hubs on the West Coast? Is it going to help us, our partners, and overall, mostly our customers? And if the answers to those are yes, and it's economically healthy for us, then we'll go do it.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","And how does it work with the codeshare? I mean, you start flying and then the code goes on the flight? I mean, when can you start talking about that process with the partners?","Andrew Harrison","We will publicly announce a flight, get it in the schedule, start selling it and then go ask for code.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, great. Another question for you, maybe a little bit obscure, but the $50 million benefit from the bag and change fees. First, I'm curious with the breakdown as between bag and change, and also have you guys done any analysis or any work on the associated fuel savings? Because we think it can be material, not just for you guys but bag fees in general, in terms of the weight savings that you get. And I realize that some people just pack heavier on carry-ons, but have you done any analysis as part of that $50 million for sort of unintended cost savings from those things, or is that just a revenue number?","Bradley D. Tilden","Hunter, just on the fuel savings, what I can tell you, ever since the industry started charging for bags, we've seen a considerable number of lesser checked bags below a significant amount, 30% to 40% less. What I can tell you is. upstairs when you fly, we have a very intricate process to manage carry-ons like we've never had before. Every space in the bin and under seat is taken up, so when I look at payloads, for example, on our flights, payloads are pretty much the same as they were before. In fact, we've had to increase the ratio of a passenger and a carry-on upstairs relative to the total payload of the airplane, so I'm not sure it's that significant.","Andrew Harrison","And how does it split? For your modeling purposes, I'd say, $35 million for bag and $15 million for the change.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Savi Syth with Raymond James.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","On your last call, the update call, you mentioned having opened 19 markets and 16 markets over the last 2 years, and then that maybe you're slowing down that opening as we move forward. Just wondering what drove the number of new markets over the last couple of years, and why -- what's the thinking about slowing down going forward here?","Andrew Harrison","Savi, it's Andrew. As you've seen, I think for the last -- in fact, in the last 3 years, we've started 30 new markets. And you'll see a lot of them at transcon and midcon and, obviously, a lot of Hawaii filling in capacity that was no longer there. I think in the second quarter, we have 21 new markets that we -- are in our unit revenues this quarter, if you go back to the beginning of the second quarter of last year. Going forward, you're going to see that significantly come down. We're going to get about 2 new airplanes next year. That's about 6% growth, give or take. And we may not start any new markets next year. We are going to digest and do better things with what we have. I will tell you, on the Hawaii front for instance, we've seen unit revenues stabilize. In fact, Hawaii now is in positive unit revenue situation and, in fact, in the third and fourth quarter, we continue to reduce capacity while not having exited 1 single market since we started this journey in 2007. So in short, we feel very confident about our new markets, the upside that is continuing to occur and more of a dialing back of new market growth over the next 12-or-so months.","Bradley D. Tilden","Savi, it's Brad, and I'll just jump on there a little bit. I think if you look at -- and I think the analysts that follow us like you know this, but if you look at us over a longer time period, Alaska has been really contrary. And if you go back to 9\/11, that was when a lot of the industry was contracting. That was the opportunity we found to supply to New York and Washington, D.C., and Boston and the East Coast. 2008 and 2009 is when we had another recession, [indiscernible] and Aloha had pulled out of Hawaii, that was the moment this company chose to sort of open up our growth into Hawaii. If you -- and those were -- in Hawaii, as you know, we've put in maybe 22% of our -- the flying we have today. Those 2 regions together are 40% of the flying for Alaska. So I kind of think this notion of not pushing it when it's not there, but going forward in a big way when the opportunities are there has really served the company and our owners well, and that's how we're thinking. And so right now, we've done terrific with Hawaii. Andrew and his team have done some great adjustments to sort of refine Hawaii and get it working better. But we don't have to push something that's not evident to us that it's going to work out of the gate. So that's maybe sort of a longer-term perspective of how we think about capacity growth.","Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, that makes sense. Just one follow-up then on just you're moving to Q400s in the State of Alaska. Just wondering what the potential cost savings or positive impact to earnings could be from that change in fleet?","Andrew Harrison","So Savi right now, as you know, we're putting about 3 planes up there, which is small in the scheme of Air Group. That said, getting the right airplane in the right markets, the cost per departure for the routes we're going to fly is down 30%, and we will accommodate all the same passengers. So our plan is to continue to work this and grow this, so I think in short, this will be very positive for Alaska Air Group as we continue to grow. And we are also doing this by increasing frequency. So I think it's a win-win for customers, lower air fares, lower operating costs, right airplane in the right market, and we can redeploy mainline, I mean, the growth markets and not have to maybe buy another airplane or so as we do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I don't normally ask a lot of RASM questions on these calls, but in fairness to every other cylinder in the Alaska engine seems to be firing with the exception of that one. I guess, I'll leave it to you whether you describe your operations as a V8 or a V12, or maybe a V6 with Ecoboost. But you cited better RASM in the third quarter than in the second. That's consistent with what other carriers are saying. Is it simply an improved -- is it a rising tide phenomenon or are there some specific shifts in the markets where competitive dynamics have proved more aggressive?","Andrew Harrison","Jamie, we like to think of ourselves as V12s but that may not be the reality. Anyway, that's coming from the 3% carrier here. So what I would say is that, as Brandon has mentioned, unit revenues in Alaska long-haul were down and our yield was down 10%, so competitive pressure there to be certain. We also had 13% unit revenue increase last year in Alaska because there was something like 3,000 military during this period who came back into the state with their families, so we had very strong unit revenues last year. The unit -- the competition going forward, there's 7.5 extra flights this summer. By November, there will only be one. So we see that abating significantly. But I think the core of your question is that I personally believe we are going to see continued material improvement in the many, many new markets that we've started that right now, the industry just doesn't have. And so the challenge for my team and our team is to get those markets matured, and we'll be way back on par with the industry, I believe, sooner rather than later.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And the second, just a question on consolidation. If you were to ever look at another airline, what would be on the shortlist in assessing the attractiveness of the dance partner? And look, I'm setting aside, okay, it needs to be accretive. You're going to be what's in the best interest of shareholders and all that. But I'm just thinking kind of size and shape, would you rather look at a larger carrier or a smaller one than Alaska? Would you want to look at one that's already in an alliance or, all else equal, an unaligned carrier? One with a modern fleet or perhaps one where you could do the refleeting and create some value? Just wondering what might make that attractive dance partner, if ever, was to sashay past you.","Bradley D. Tilden","There are a lot of folks smiling around the table. We're wondering how we're going to handle this question.","Jamie N. Baker - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Look, in fairness, I'm deliberately asking it this way because I don't want to name names, and I don't want to put you in a position where you think I'm trying to extract a name that you might be attracted to.","Bradley D. Tilden","I think it's a good question. It's obviously one that we're probably not going to talk a lot about. The -- I mean, what we would say is that this company is very focused on producing returns on invested capital, and that's what we want to do. We want to be known for kind of building a great business that's safe, that operates well, that does good things for customer, brings them value and kind of helping the industry move to a place where we begin to produce honest to gosh returns on invested capital for owners. So that would be a big factor in anything that we might ever look at. It's not -- this is -- isn't an area where we'd never say never. The company did 2 acquisitions in the mid-to-late '80s, an important part of who the company is today, this is Jet America and Horizon Air. But I think by our actions over the last -- what is that? 10, 30 years, or something like that, it's -- you can see that we haven't seen anything that quite meets our criteria. So it's a good question, probably not one that we can provide a lot of detail on, but I think I have shared with you what we -- what our primary objectives are and where our primary focus is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Helane Becker with Cowen Securities.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","I think -- I have phone issues so I think one of the questions might have been answered. On the Q400s, did you say what you're going to do with the cargo [indiscernible] between the markets that they're going to fly?","Andrew Harrison","Helane, this is Andrew. Did you just say cargo in the markets?","Helane R. Becker - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Yes, because I think the -- right, I think the issue with having the larger planes was to handle the cargo, so you're going to smaller planes. So I didn't hear if you responded to that question.","Andrew Harrison","Right. So where we're putting them mainly obviously Anchorage, Fairbanks where we still have mainline metal [ph]. I will tell you cargo has been front and center of the overall Q4 analysis going forward and how we can grow. And we also -- the Q400, has also seasonal bins that can add 800 pounds worth of baggage and cargo baggage that we're looking at. So we feel very good about increasing the cargo capacity of the Q400 going forward while utilizing the mainline fleet, our freighters and our mainline frequency. So it is a little bit of challenge, but we think we have a path to making that successful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a few here. I want to go back to the seating reconfiguration, where I think you get the benefit of like a 2% CASM across the fleet. When -- and the $47 million on the revenue, when is that completed? How does that phase in? Like do we see that by the end of this year? Is that 2014? What's the timing on that?","Benito Minicucci","Mike, it's Ben. We begin the reconfigurations this fall and they'll run to the end of 2015, '14 -- sorry, 2014. So it will take this almost 18 months to get through the fleet. Two lines of mods working, and we're pretty excited about where we're going to be at the end of that.","Andrew Harrison","And Mike we'll have half of them done before the summer and we think we're going to get about 27 million plus dollars of benefit in 2014. And then, at the run rate, you've heard Brandon say $47 million. So we're going to be halfway done before summer and selling those this coming summer in 2014.","Michael Linenberg - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just my second question, I want to go back to the point, I think, Brad, you mentioned about airport costs going from 5% to 10%. And I guess the question is, I mean, what's going on here? I mean, are we seeing airports exercise their ability to monopoly price, or is there just other areas of cost inflation? Maybe they're just not being -- they're just not running these businesses like they should, or maybe they're not being run like businesses? And I would say that when you think about a big cost for an airport, financing cost is a big chunk, but when you look at what they're financing at -- what their financing rates are today and what they've been over the last few years versus 10 or 15 years ago, it seems like that those numbers have come down significantly. So what's going on here?","Benito Minicucci","Mike, it's Ben. I'll be really honest. We learned a lot about airports and where costs get created in the airport world. And essentially, there's 2 big areas. One is how much money they borrow to build big capital projects, and the second is their own internal cost. And so it varies airport by airport. But when they build terminals and add runways, somebody has to pay for it and it ends up on the backs of the airlines. So part of what you're seeing costs go up is infrastructure being put in. And in Sea-Tac, we saw the third runway, we're looking at expansions and a new international FIS. We're looking at improvements on our side. So all these capital costs plus what they spent in the past are coming to catch up at least with us at Sea-Tac. And that's part of the problem. Now we've learned a lot. So I mean there's a bunch of other elements in the lease that can benefit us, and we've worked hard with the Port of Seattle. And I think we have -- our costs are going up. There was no way to get around it because of the capital spending that was done and what's going to happen. But we have a lease structure that has some provisions that protect the airlines going forward, and it's our problem [ph]. We've got to make it work and we're pretty happy with, like Brad said, we're happy with the team and the lease we have. And with every airport we have, we're going to make sure that we understand the capital projects that are being done and we're going to make sure that we understand their O&M costs, so that we can contain these costs as best as we can.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I may have missed it. You sounded pretty upbeat about demand improvement on your last call before earnings. What have you said about kind of the demand environment into the third quarter here? And should we be thinking about kind of the same level of pressure on unit revenue near term?","Andrew Harrison","Duane, it's Andrew. I think in Brandon's prepared remarks, we're still expecting unit revenues to be down in the third quarter, but certainly less than what you just saw in the second quarter. And then, September is September obviously, and it's a little ways out. So we're not -- we can't really comment good or bad. But what I can say is that July and August, we continue to see yield improvement as we bring in summer, and the demand is very good for summer. So we feel very good right now about how summer is shaping up.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then just on your response to the capacity in your markets. I mean I understand you're going to defend your turf, specifically State of Alaska. But as you look across your entire network, has there been anything that you've pulled back on and to what degree has what's occurring made you kind of reconsider the growth rate of the airline longer term?","Andrew Harrison","So most of our pullbacks have been within our own supply and demand world, if you will, so Hawaii, transcon and those sorts of things. Honestly, with the State of Alaska, already in June, I can personally see where we took the yield hits, where the passengers disappeared, which markets work from all over the country. So we're going to be very well-positioned, if this occurs again next summer, to do a much better job. So I think there's only upside from there. The rest of that, you've seen some West Coast actions, but again, we feel really good with our core network running high load factors, and again with the changes to our business, that $150 million of undergirding of our economic model coming forward and all the things we're doing, we're just feeling quite optimistic looking out about our network and the competition we're dealing with.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And then I guess just the longer-term question. Has this series of events caused you to kind of reconsider the growth rate of the airline longer term?","Bradley D. Tilden","Duane, the only thing we might add to what Andrew has already said is that, one of the phenomenas is that we are dealing with right now is I think Hawaii is getting kind of built out in terms of what we're -- the capacity we're capable of putting in Hawaii. If you look at the Pacific -- the Anchorage, Bellingham, Seattle, Portland, Hawaii is fully served and California, I think it's the needs, the market needs, are largely satisfied. So that has been a big growth driver for this company for 5 years now. And so not having the Hawaii opportunity probably says growth is going to be a little bit slower in the next couple of years than it has been in the last 3 or 4 years. And as we kind of said in response to an earlier question, I think we just kind of keep our head down, keep focusing on being safe and running a good operation, a compelling proposition for customers and low-cost and more opportunities will come our way. When they do, we'll pounce on them. But for now, maybe not for the near term, the next 1, 2, 3 years, maybe not the same level of opportunity that we saw in the last couple of years.","Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","And I'll just sneak one more in. I mean, to the extent that you're done with deleveraging in '14, does the initial dividend that you've put forth -- I mean, should we view that as a starting position or did that already contemplate you sort of being done with paying down debt?","Brandon S. Pedersen","It's Brandon. We said 2 weeks ago that we wanted to first, do a dividend, and we're almost there a couple weeks now until we make the payment, but we said that we had an interest in growing the dividend on some regular basis. And we want to design our business in a way that we can do that. You're right, we are getting to a point where we're probably done deleveraging and that further positions us to change our capital allocation strategy and return more to shareholders, whether it be through repurchase or dividend, that's our option.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to also follow-up on this idea of fewer new routes next year. I don't think the stretch to imagine that, the more mature markets operate at significantly higher profitability. It sounds like simplistically holding macro constant, fuel, interest rates, we should be expecting a nice bump in margins in 2014 just based on that factor alone. Is that the right framework? Is that logical? Or am I missing something?","Andrew Harrison","John, I love the thought process and I would embrace that answer. I think, at the end of the day, you have actually capsulated ultimately the macro plan. There's a lot of things that are outside of our control, obviously, and we're going to work it hard. But on a pure theoretical basis, that would be the direction that I think we would like to head with this.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, excellent. And then maybe more practical, less theoretical, is there anything you can tell us about what -- how the profitability of an immature route or how the slope might look like a year out or something like that versus a mature route? Is there anything you can help us think about the differential there?","Andrew Harrison","A couple of things I can tell you. And if you take a Fort Lauderdale and a San Diego, Orlando in the second quarter, they both ran about 88%, 89% load factor and we're moving both of those red eyes to primetime daytime flights. And we've seen continuing improvement there and I expect that to accelerate. As far as the new markets goes, what we're seeing is that, especially in the first year, very significant profitability or let's just say moving towards profitability in those first years. So I think by year 2, we should have in many of these markets, good results contributing to the business. And by year 3, those that are not, or even before that, they will be gone.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And just one more follow-up on the topic. I can go and calculate this, but I'm not sure if you have the number sort of available. What percentage of your capacity approximately today is the new routes or that you would consider new?","Bradley D. Tilden","That's a hard one.","Brandon S. Pedersen","I can probably get back to you on that John.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Even if it's a general number.","Andrew Harrison","You stumped me there. It's depending on what's new, to be honest, and then a number of these new routes are like regional routes, so they're in the scheme of the economics, much smaller.","Bradley D. Tilden","Yes, we could run it, but all new transcons like a San Diego, Boston or a San Diego, Orlando or a Seattle, Philly, it's 4%, 5%, or 3%, 4%, something like that. But it's an easy number to run, we should do that.","Andrew Harrison","Basically, the ASM growth or another way to look at it is essentially new markets, give or take, so.","Bradley D. Tilden","Hawaii is actually down, you were telling me for the fourth quarter.","Andrew Harrison","Yes, Hawaii will be down 5.5% in Q3 and 11.5% in Q4.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Fintzen with Barclays.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Question, I think for Andrew, if I recall, I think it was you Andrew, a couple of weeks ago you said competitors come and competitors go in the State of Alaska. And I mean, obviously you see sort of Seattle to Anchorage type stuff. I'm curious when you look out beyond the sort of Anchorages of the world, into like the Juneau, into the smaller cities or the intra-Alaska, is there something about airport facilities or the difference in operating in a place like Alaska or operating year-round in Alaska. Are there things that are different that we should be thinking about that would mean sort of if somebody wanted to come trying to replicate something more similar, it would be tougher than say replicating something in a city in the lower 48? I'm just curious how to think about that.","Joseph A. Sprague","David, this is Joe Sprague from marketing. And I might take that one. It's a great question. I'm not sure if you've been around to some of those other communities or not. It's -- they're pretty unique places, obviously. We serve 19 cities in the State of Alaska with 737s, only 3 of which are actually connected to any sort of road system. So that the -- it's a real sort of unique setup in terms of the way we serve the State of Alaska and the reason we're flying though to those communities is because they are so isolated. They need air service to get just basic goods and services in and out of the community and then just if somebody's got to go to the doctor or the dentist, they pretty much fly us to get into the major city for that service. But as a result, those communities are pretty small. Much smaller than you'd normally see for commercial service in the lower 48 for instance. They don't have facilities. I mean a Juneau, or a Fairbanks would have more of a traditional municipal airport terminal building. But in a lot of the other communities, we are the terminal building. It's an Alaska Airlines building that serves as the sort of the city airport terminal. So that's different. We've also invested a lot in those communities. You mentioned Juneau specifically, that's one that definitely stands out in terms of our investment in the flight operations technology that allows us to effectively serve those communities. So we have the special R&P approaches for Juneau and several other communities in Alaska. And they're not proprietary necessarily, but we're far and ahead of anyone else in terms of being able to operate those kind of approaches. And given the weather and the terrain and so forth, that's a pretty unique advantage that Alaska Airlines has in serving those communities. So it's different and we've spent 80 years sort of perfecting how we serve those communities and we've got improvement yet to make. And that's why you see us doing things like bringing the Q400 to the State of Alaska. But I think overall, we feel good about our position in the State of Alaska. We have Club 49, which helps to reinforce our loyalty with the residents of the State of Alaska. So on the customer front, the operations front and even the facilities front, it's a lot of unique things that we do to set ourselves apart.","David E. Fintzen - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And just to quickly follow up. In that sort of next tier down from an Anchorage like a Juneau or a Fairbanks, are there -- it's been a while since I've been to, say, Fairbanks, but I know it didn't seem like it was an airport that was sort of chock full. I mean is that -- is it fair to think that they're fairly full airports, but there's some space if somebody wanted it, or are they -- is it you like you were struggling to find some space particularly as you're ramping up frequency yourself?","Joseph A. Sprague","I think that just from a facility standpoint, they do not have a lot of extra space. I think we've seen in the case of Fairbanks, in particular, there's been some other airlines that have dipped their toe in the Fairbanks water during the busy summer tourist season and then when the temperature goes below 0, they retreat pretty quickly. So I think if somebody wanted to come, I'm sure the airports would try and find space for them but that's sort of the way the setup has worked.","Bradley D. Tilden","It's a great question, David. The other thing about the Alaska market is that a lot of those folks do connect. So like Seattle, Anchorage is a huge market for us, but the last number I remember is something like 65% of the customers on that route are connecting on either the Alaska end or the Seattle end. So having this network into the smaller communities in Alaska really helps you make these flights work.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve O'Hara with Sidoti.","Stephen O'Hara - Sidoti & Company, LLC","I was wondering in terms of the impact from the seats. I didn't quite catch that. When do you start seeing that impact from the seats and it seems like the ASMs per gallon is up or improving fairly well in the third quarter? Is that part of that or not?","Bradley D. Tilden","The mod lines start in October, Steve. So it will be 2 airplanes at a time and once we have the prototypes, you'll see them pop out a week at a time. So you'll start seeing airplanes, the extra seats starting in November and then increasing from there. So by the end of '14, Andrew just mentioned by the summer, we'll have half our fleet reconfigured and then the rest will be by the end of '14. Just to give you a sense.","Stephen O'Hara - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And then what's the -- I think you'd mentioned the x-fuel impact. What's the CASM impact? I mean is some of that offset by weight and depreciation, or what's the full CASM impact?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Steve, it's Brandon. On the CASM impact, it's basically the same as the CASM x-fuel impact. Brad used the number, 2.5% on a fleet wide basis, about 3.3%, 3.5% on the airplanes that are being modified. You do get some incremental passenger related costs when you fill the extra seats. There is the depreciation as you point out. You have a little bit of weight on the fuel. But in the grand scheme of things as you think about those costs in relation to the $47 million of annual benefit that we're going to see once we get the thing fully implemented, it's really, really small. And so I think those are probably fair percentages to apply on a CASM basis or a CASM x fuel basis.","Stephen O'Hara - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And then just as a follow-up on the Q400s, I mean do you see other opportunities for that type of move in other areas? I mean is there any desire to maybe increase the size of that fleet for that reason?","Andrew Harrison","Steve, for start, in the State of Alaska, we absolutely see more opportunities. And for now, we are very, very happy with the lower 48 deployment. If you look at our unit revenues in our regional business, you'll see the very impressive increases year-over-year and has been. And for now, we're looking at the State of Alaska and how we can maximize the use of these Q400s. And as the Alaska fleet gauge increases, the 400s and the 700s leave, the ERs come in, we need the Q400s to help feed these markets out of the Pacific Northwest and we'll use them for that.","Brandon S. Pedersen","It's Brandon. One other thing I might add to that as we think about long-term Alaska fleet plan, we have a specific need in that we have to replace the 5 737-400 combi aircraft that we operate. That's slated to happen in a few years. But ultimately, the Q400 might be a very important part of that solution because those combi airplanes fly into some of the smaller markets in the State of Alaska.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A couple of questions here. I guess the first is really housecleaning, very simple. The Recaro seats, are those -- is that going to be expensed or capitalized?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Dan, it's Brandon. Welcome back. The Recaro seats will be capitalized.","Daniel McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Got it, okay. And then second here, you guys have all done a great job of keeping your codeshare partners happy. But as Delta continues to expand out of Seattle, looks like it's increasingly bumping up against one world. So I guess, it looks like there could be a little friction. From your perspective, what's the trick to keeping both partners happy longer term? And what do you -- do you think you can keep them happy longer-term? And I guess what I'm really getting at here is does it possibly require further investment at Seattle to perhaps bring even more value to both members?","Bradley D. Tilden","Yes, Dan this is Brad. As Brandon said, welcome back, it's good to have you covering us again. I think absolutely. I think both partners, both Delta and American, understand our strategy of having alliance relationships with both Delta and American, and both are okay with that. I do think that these alliances are complicated and that once in a while, there are little skirmishes, or little frictions that arise. What you need to have is a couple of things. One, you need to have a relationship where you sit down and you talk and you understand each other's needs and you work them out. And you also need to have a natural reason for the relationship to exist. And we have that with both American and Delta. If you take Delta as an example. They really want to grow international widebody flights out of Seattle and they've gone from 4 or 5 widebodies a few years ago. I think they announced Seattle, Heathrow this week and they're at 10 today maybe going to 11 or something like that. So anyway, so there's -- and that's a relationship where we do have natural opportunity to help Delta and I think helping Delta will help Alaska as well. So I don't see any -- I think it's a good strategy for Alaska Air Group to be -- to have deep relationships with both American and Delta. And I think that we're going to have to pay attention to this over time and make sure that we're doing things that are kind of supporting both folks and helping us grow the revenue pie. And that's going to take some work. But I'm confident that we're going to get the work done and that this is going to work out and this is a good, stable long-term strategy for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Engel with Bank of America.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Questions on fuel. When I look at your hedge book, I guess 2 things stand out to me. One, your WTI hedges, which looked dumb earlier in the year now look brilliant. And I don't really seem to see that in your fuel guidance. Given at $101, I would have thought you'd see a bigger drop. And two, your refining crack spreads at $0.52 third quarter look relatively high and I want to know when those stop hurting you?","Mark Eliasen","Glenn, this is Mark Eliasen. And your observation, we have changed our hedging program over the last few years actually, and we're confident in the long term, like you said. Some months it looks bad, some months it looks brilliant, but over the long term, it served us very well. In terms of specifics, yes, we are starting to get in the money with the WTI hedges that we had in place. Those are performing just as expected. And on the crack side, we're benefiting actually the airline is benefiting a lot from LA jet prices coming down. So that's working the way we would expect it to as well [ph].","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But you're using the $106 average Brent for the -- or fuel for the third quarter and yet half of your hedges are at $101, so I'm curious why you use such a high number for your jet fuel for the third quarter?","Mark Eliasen","Yes, well the -- say that again?","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I thought you're 50% hedged at $101 WTI in the third quarter, and yet implicit in your third quarter estimates that the update says you're using $106 per barrel to get to the $325 forecast.","Mark Eliasen","Yes. We got $0.08 basically in as hedge cost. So the hedges are benefiting us somewhat.","Chris Berry","That $106, Glenn -- this is Chris, that $106 in the guidance on the fuel, that's a raw WTI. And then we split out that the hedge benefit or costs separately. So that when you see what our guidance is, when we break out the components, it's always the raw cost and then we put the hedge in sort of that separate $0.08 cost for the quarter.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I guess that still seems somewhat surprising to me given that at $101, you would think that the benefits of the hedge would be now more than offsetting the cost.","Mark Eliasen","Yes, they're in the money, but they're not totally offsetting it.","Bradley D. Tilden","So what's going on? Is there a benefit from the crude oil hedge in the cost of the refining hedge?","Mark Eliasen","Yes, there is a benefit in the crude oil but it's not totally offsetting the cost.","Bradley D. Tilden","The cost of the refining hedge?","Mark Eliasen","Yes. And the refining hedges...","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And the refining hedges hurt you how long? How much longer?","Mark Eliasen","We just go out one quarter with those. So those are working their way through very rapidly.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And while you said that third quarter Alaska -- this is on the revenue side, the third quarter PRASM on Alaska should I guess hopefully get better in the fourth quarter the impact is as the capacity comes out. Does the Seattle markets that you're seeing pressure on, do those get worse in the fourth quarter when you start moving in the off-peak?","Andrew Harrison","As you know, we're always a little seasonal here. But we believe we've taken action to implement new, never been done before by us cuts. A decent part of our capacity in transcon and Hawaii as we move into the fourth quarter, that should help us going forward. I can't comment on what unit revenues are going to be in the fourth quarter, but we have actions that we've put in place for the fourth quarter that we didn't have last year, and I think they're going to be good.","Glenn D. Engel - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But your full year capacity really hasn't changed much with those cuts?","Brandon S. Pedersen","Glenn, it's Brandon. It came down a little bit, if you look at our annual guidance on a consolidated basis I think it came down from 7.5 to 7 or so.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.","Bradley D. Tilden","Thanks, Megan.
