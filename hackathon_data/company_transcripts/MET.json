Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to the trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the risk factor section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise. With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hall, head of Investor Relations.","[05LC2Y-E John Hall]","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's first quarter 2018 earnings call. On this call we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and on our quarterly financial supplement. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.","Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management. Last night we released an expanded set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. After prepared remarks, we will have a q-and-a session that, given the busy earnings call schedule this morning, will extend no longer than the top of the hour. So in fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that I will turn the call over to Steve.","Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As you know, we announced on Tuesday that John Hele is retiring from MetLife and has been succeeded as CFO by John McCallion. I want to thank John Hele for his service and for being a strategic partner on MetLife's refreshed enterprise strategy which has made us a simpler company and strengthened our free cash flow generation. I also want to welcome John McCallion to the CFO role. I have worked closely with John for over 10 years and I have every confidence that he will bring the skill, energy, and leadership needed to help MetLife create significant value for our shareholders.","Moving to financial results, last night we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.36, up from $1.20 per share a year ago. Tax reform added roughly $0.10 per share to adjusted earnings year-over-year. Overall, it was a very strong quarter with particularly good underwriting. Variable investment income came in above expectations and foreign currency also provided some lift. Despite rising in the quarter, current interest rate levels continued to pressure recurring investment yields.","Equity markets had limited impact on consolidated adjusted results. Adjusted return on equity in the quarter was 12.8%, the highest adjusted ROE for MetLife since the third quarter of 2014. After notable items, adjusted earnings were $1.34 per share, the net difference of $0.02 per share included a positive $0.06 per share from the final portion of a Japanese variable annuity reserve release that we elected to recognize in the first quarter. This was partially offset by costs to achieve our target of $800 million in pre-tax annual run-rate savings by 2020.","Net income for the quarter was $1.2 billion compared to $867 million a year ago. We've been working to reduce the sensitivity of net income to capital markets and narrow the gap between net income and adjusted earnings. In a volatile first quarter for the capital markets, we reported adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion, only moderately above net income. This points to the progress we are making to lower our sensitivity to the capital markets following the spin of Brighthouse and the repositioning of some of our hedge programs.","Moving to business highlights, within the U.S. business segment, Group Benefits reported another quarter of strong underwriting results notwithstanding seasonally high flu claims. Volume growth and underwriting contributed to strong adjusted earnings within Retirement and Income Solutions. We are working hard and making meaningful progress on our group annuity remediation plan. John McCallion will provide more details in his prepared remarks. Driven by good auto insurance results, Property & Casualty adjusted earnings were strong despite industry-wide catastrophe activity in the quarter.","For Asia, our largest international segment, adjusted earnings benefited from volume growth due to higher premiums, fees, and other revenues and higher assets. In Latin America, a one-time tax adjustment in Chile and lower encaje (06:54) contribution held adjusted earnings below our expectations. EMEA adjusted earnings reflected sustained expense management efforts in volume growth in Europe and Turkey. Finally, MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings benefited from tax reform and good underwriting, offset in part by lower recurring interest margins.","Turning to investments, recurring investment income was up 1.3 % from a year ago, aided by asset growth which outweighed the drag from low interest rates. In the quarter our global new money yield stood at 3.37%, compared to an average roll-off rate of 4.38%. Pre-tax variable investment income totaled $268 million in the quarter, which is above our quarterly guidance range of $200 million to $250 million. Private equity returns continued to be the largest contributor to performance, particularly leveraged buyout and venture capital funds.","Moving on to capital management, we repurchased $1 billion of our common stock during the first quarter. Combined with our common dividend, this brought our total capital return in the quarter to $1.5 billion. We continued buying back shares in the second quarter, repurchasing another $350 million of common stock. We have $370 million remaining on our current $2 billion authorization. As a reminder, last week, we also announced a 5% increase in our annual common dividend to $1.68 per share.","We expect to divest our remaining stake in Brighthouse Financial before the end of 2018. Since we announced our intention to execute an equity exchange offer late last year, capital market conditions have changed and volatility is up. In addition to an equity exchange offer, we are now exploring other transactions that may provide better economics, including a direct sale of our Brighthouse Financial shares or an exchange offer for MetLife debt securities. The timeframe and the primary objective \u2013 divest our Brighthouse shares and buy back MetLife shares \u2013 remain the same, regardless of the form of the transaction.","Turning to the external environment, our business continues to benefit from a number of tailwinds. Tax reform remains broadly favorable for MetLife, both in terms of its direct earnings impact and the boost it provides to jobs and growth. As is always the case, the benefits of lower taxes will be shared among our key constituencies. As we announced in February, MetLife will invest a portion of the proceeds to strengthen the financial security of its employees. We also expect that, over time, a portion of the tax savings will be competed away, resulting in more affordable financial protection for consumers.","Finally, we expect a meaningful portion of the tax savings will be returned to shareholders. Those shareholders, in turn, will reallocate capital to other productive investments or will drive economic growth through increased consumer spending. Another tailwind for MetLife is the overall strength of the economy. The U.S. unemployment rate has held constant at 4.1% for six months and a record 148 million Americans are now employed. There's additional upside if robust economic growth results in a higher labor force participation rate. A strong U.S. labor market is always positive for our market-leading U.S. Group Benefits business.","We are also seeing positive trends with regard to interest rates. From the 2017 low of 2.06%, the 10-year Treasury rate has risen approximately 90 basis points and is now at its highest level in over three years. While geopolitical uncertainty and the prospect of a trade war could (11:33) that drives down interest rates, we believe the economic fundamentals point toward rising rates, although not to pre financial crisis levels. With U.S. budget deficits rising and the Federal Reserve unwinding its balance sheet, we see the supply of Treasuries outstripping demand which, all else being equal, should push prices down and yields up.","I would like to close this morning with some comments on MetLife's commitment to building a culture of operational excellence, which is one of the four cornerstones of our refreshed enterprise strategy. After some negative surprises, we are pleased that MetLife delivered a clean quarter that exceeded consensus. However, we also recognize that this is merely a down payment on the improved performance investors expect at MetLife. While issues can always arise in a company the size of MetLife, we have significantly strengthened our focus on execution. We are escalating issues sooner and insisting on a greater degree of management rigor.","A case in point is our unit cost improvement program, or UCI. As you know, our target is $1.05 billion in pre-tax run rate savings by 2020. Net of $250 million in stranded overhead from the separation of Brighthouse Financial, that translates into $800 million to the bottom line. This quarter, for the first time, we are publishing our expense ratio in a way that will allow you to track our progress on UCI. We have already achieved more than $400 million of gross savings toward our target and while our progress will not always be linear, we are fully committed to delivering on this commitment.","As I noted in my annual letter to shareholders, we've overcome our most significant regulatory challenge with the victory in our SIFI litigation. We have overcome our major macroeconomic challenge with a refreshed strategy that makes us a less market-sensitive company. And we will also overcome our operational challenges by resolving our material weaknesses, achieving the cost savings we have promised and delivering more predictable earnings and strong free cash flow. With that, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our quarterly financial results in detail.","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Let me start by acknowledging what a great honor it is to be named MetLife's Chief Financial Officer. I look forward to working with all of you in the future.","Now let's get to the highlights in the quarter. I will begin by discussing the 1Q18 Supplemental Slides that we released last evening, along with our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. These slides address several key areas of focus for investors: first quarter 2018 financial results and business highlights; the impact from U.S. tax reform; our unit cost initiative or UCI; and an update on our remediation plans.","Starting on page 4, this schedule provides a reconciliation of net income and adjusted earnings in the first quarter. Net income was $1.2 billion and roughly $200 million lower than adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion due to the results in our investment portfolio and hedging program. Net investment losses were $263 million, which included a loss of $168 million related to mark-to-market impact on our holdings in Brighthouse Financial. Net derivative gains were $276 million after tax, primarily driven by changes in foreign currencies.","Overall, the relatively modest net income volatility in the quarter reflects MetLife's post-separation product mix and refined hedging program. Book value per share excluding AOCI other than FCTA was $43.36 as of March 31, up 1% versus the sequential quarter and up 3% after adjusting for the adoption of certain new accounting rules in the quarter related to tax reform. Year-over-year book value per share is down 15% but up 8% after adjusting for the spinoff of Brighthouse Financial and related financial impacts. This growth was driven by strong earnings over the prior four quarters.","Our two notable items on the quarter are shown on page 5 and highlighted in our news release and quarterly financial supplement. First, we had a release of reinsurance reserves related to variable annuity guarantees assumed from a former operating joint venture in Japan. Our assumed Japan JV (sic) [VA] reserves are accounted for under two methods. The error leading to the material weakness that was discovered and corrected in the 2017 10-K was on a larger portion of the reserve, which utilizes the derivative accounting model. There is a smaller part of the assumed reserve accounted for under the insurance model, which also required an adjustment. Given the size of this adjustment, we elected to process a cumulative catch-up for this part of the assumed reserve in the first quarter. This reserve refinement benefited adjusted earnings in MetLife Holdings by $52 million after tax, or $0.06 per share.","Second, expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings by $34 million after tax or $0.03 per share. In total, notable items in the quarter increased adjusted earnings by $28 million. Adjusted earnings excluding notable items were $1.4 billion or $1.34 per share. On page 6, you can see the year-over-year adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 6% year-over-year and up 3% on a constant currency basis. On a per-share basis, adjusted earnings were up 12% and up 9% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases.","Positive year-over-year drivers in the quarter included favorable underwriting, solid volume growth, and lower taxes due to tax reform which I will discuss in more detail shortly. These were partially offset by weaker investment margins and a flatter yield curve. However, we are encouraged by the recent rise in interest rates and would expect our average new money rate and roll-off rate to converge when we have a sustained 10- year U.S. Treasury in the range of 3% to 3.25%. Pre-tax variable investment income was $268 million, essentially flat to the prior-year quarter. VII continues to benefit from strong private equity returns.","In regards to business performance, Group Benefits adjusted earnings excluding notable items were up 14% quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by the impact of U.S. tax reform. Excluding the impact of tax reform and notable items, adjusted earnings were down 6%. Group Benefits had solid volume growth and favorable underwriting, most notably in non-medical health. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for non-medical health was 75.9%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 79.9% and at the low end of its targeted range of 75% to 80%.","Non-medical health underwriting experience was strong across all product lines. It should be noted that some of the improvement in non-medical health loss ratio is driven by the reinstatement of the health insurer tax in the Affordable Care Act. Although neutral to earnings, this increases our expense ratio and reduces our loss ratio. The group life mortality ratio was 88%, which was within its targeted range of 85% to 90% but higher than the prior year quarter of 86.9%, primarily due to elevated flu-related deaths. In addition, Group Benefits adjusted earnings were dampened by lower investment margin and higher expenses, primarily due to technology investments supporting our growth initiatives.","Group Benefits had another strong sales quarter. Year-over-year sales were down 1% versus first quarter 2017 which included record jumbo case sales. Group Benefits saw continued momentum in its strategy to grow downmarket and involuntary products. Regional and small market sales were above our expectations year-over-year and voluntary sales were up double digits versus the prior year quarter. Adjusted earnings excluding notable items and retirement income solutions or RIS, were up 32% and up 8% when also adjusting for the impact from tax reform. The key drivers were favorable underwriting and volume growth. This was partially offset by weaker interest margins from lower VII for this segment and the impact of continued spread of compression. RIS adjusted PFOs were $371 million, down 23% from the prior-year period, driven by lower pension risk transfer and structured settlement sales.","On PRT, as we have noted in prior calls, sales can be lumpy. And the first quarter tends to be the slowest for transactions. We continue to see a good PRT pipeline of all sizes and structures. Our approach will continue to balance growth with an efficient use of capital.","Property and casualty or P&C had a strong quarter as adjusted earnings excluding notable items were up 33% year-over-year driven by favorable auto underwriting and lower catastrophes. The auto combined ratio was 91.3%, down 6.5 points versus 1Q 2017, due to increased average premiums and lower costs. Auto results have benefited from targeted rate increases and management actions to create value. Pre-tax catastrophe losses were $58 million in the quarter but $54 million lower than the prior-year quarter. In regards to the top line, P&C PFOs were up 1% while sales were up 16% versus 1Q 2017.","Asia adjusted earnings excluding notable items were up 10% and up 6% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were volume growth and lower taxes, partially offset by higher one-time expenses. Asia sales were down 10% on a constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were up 9%, driven by strong FX annuity sales. This was partially offset by lower life and A&H sales relative to strong sales in 1Q 2017. Other Asia sales were down 31% compared to very strong sales in the prior year quarter which included a large group case in Australia.","Latin America adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were down 3% and down 11% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were higher taxes due to U.S. tax reform and a one-time tax item in Chile as well as a lower encaje (24:05) return versus a year ago. Higher taxes in the quarter masked good underlying business fundamentals for Latin America, highlighted by volume growth and lower claims. Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 8% and up 2% on a constant currency basis. Latin America sales were down 4% on a constant currency basis as growth across the region was more than offset by lower Mexico group sales.","EMEA adjusted earnings were up 8% and down 5% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to impacts from U.S. tax reform, Excluding tax reform, adjusted earnings were up 19% and up 4% on a constant currency basis driven by volume growth and lower expenses. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 11% and up 2% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth in Europe and Turkey.","MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings excluding notable items were up 17% year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of U.S. tax reform and favorable underwriting results in life, annuities, and long-term care. If tax reform would have passed prior to our December outlook call, we would have guided to adjusted earnings of up 7% in 2018, rather than down 10%. And given favorable underwriting results in the first quarter, we now expect adjusted earnings to be up approximately 10% in 2018. Corporate and other adjusted loss excluding notable items was $169 million compared to an adjusted loss of $30 million in 1Q 2017. The primary driver of the year-over-year variance was the impact of U.S. tax reform.","With regards to U.S. tax reform, page 7 provides a table showing the 1Q 2018 adjusted earnings impact from U.S. tax reform by segment. The column on the far right reflects the 1Q 2018 tax rate for each of the segments. While these tax rates can be simply calculated from the business segment income statements in the QFS, we felt it would be a helpful aid as you think about modeling after-tax earnings in 2018. As shown, the 1Q 2018 benefit to adjusted earnings from U.S. tax reform was $101 million in total. The vast majority of the benefit, as you would expect, is in the U.S. and MetLife Holdings segments. Property & Casualty did not receive much benefit as the business was already at a very low tax rate which did not change.","For our international regions, the results vary. Asia, Latin America, and EMEA all receive a smaller tax benefit related to the allocation of corporate overhead expenses. Previously, this benefit was calculated on a 35% tax rate and now 21% due to tax reform. This is the reason that Latin America and EMEA show a negative U.S. tax reform related impact to 1Q 2018 adjusted earnings of $10 million and $7 million respectively. For Asia there is an offsetting benefit from tax reform as Japan's earnings are no longer taxed or topped off at a higher U.S. tax rate, previously 35%.","In corporate and other, the negative $67 million impact is primarily due to the results now being taxed at 21%, and therefore receiving a lesser benefit. In regards to modeling for 2018, the 1Q 2018 tax rates as shown in the table are a good run rate for each of the segments with the exception of Latin America. As previously noted, Latin America had a one-time tax item in Chile which resulted in an unusually high tax rate of 35% in 1Q 2018. Adjusting for that item, we would expect Latin America's tax rate to be in the mid to high 20s for the remainder of 2018. Finally, we are reaffirming our prior guidance for the company's effective tax rate of 18% to 20% in 2018.","Let me turn to page 8. As Steve mentioned, our unit cost initiative is a critical element of the transformation underway at MetLife. Our goal is to reduce expenses by $800 million pre-tax net of stranded overhead by 2020. This slide shows the adjusted expense ratio and our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2017, as well as 1Q 2018. Adjusted expenses include direct expenses as well as pension, premium taxes, and commissions net of capitalized DAC among other costs. Direct expenses include the cost of labor and other general and administrative costs.","You can see from the slide that we have made progress on an annual basis through 2017 in reducing our adjusted expense ratio, which has fallen 250 basis points since the baseline year of 2015, while the direct expense ratio has fallen 100 basis points over the same timeframe. We are measuring expense improvement on an annual basis, since the expense ratio can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We believe the direct expense ratio on an annual basis is the best measure of our UCI progress, since it reflects expenses over which we have the most control and best reflects the impact on profit margins.","Turning to page 9, this is a summary of the new expense disclosure now included on page 7 in our quarterly financial supplement. In calculating our expense ratios, we seek consistency by adjusting for two items. First, we back out revenue associated with pension risk transfer deposits since PRT revenues can be lumpy and have few associated direct costs. We believe they can distort the expense ratio and make it look better than it actually is. Second, we adjust for notable items related to other expenses.","In addition to the expense ratios, you will be able to see how the ratios are calculated, as well as the split among the various cost components, including employee-related costs. While the adjusted expense ratio and direct expense ratio increased in comparison to the first quarter of 2017, which had unusually low general and administrative expenses, they both showed sequential improvement from the fourth quarter.","To the point I made earlier, while the expense ratios for each quarter during 2017 varied, we see improvement on an annual basis. Going forward, we aim to be transparent and accountable as we execute toward achieving our expense target.","Now I will provide an update on our progress for remediation of the 4Q 2017 material weaknesses as shown on page 10. We are executing on our plan to remediate the material weaknesses and have developed steering committees, project teams, and working groups to lead the remediation efforts.","First, as it relates to the RIS group annuity issue, we have taken the following three actions. One, implemented immediate changes to improve administrative and accounting procedures and search practices to identify, contact, and record responses from unresponsive and missing plan annuitants and to otherwise locate missing annuitants. Two, instituted additional procedures to help address the timely communication and escalation of issues throughout the company. And, three, engaged third-party advisors who have commenced procedures associated with the comprehensive examination and analysis of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the material weakness, under the supervision of MetLife's Chief Risk Officer, Ramy Tadros.","Next as it relates to the MetLife Holdings assumed variable annuity guaranteed reserves, we have taken the following two actions. One, implemented immediate changes to the data flows and input controls into the valuation process. These changes included enhanced reconciliation and analytics. Two, we engaged third-party advisors who have commenced procedures associated with the comprehensive examination and analysis of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the material weakness under the supervision of the general auditor.","We believe these remediation steps will further strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. We will test the ongoing operating effectiveness of all new controls subsequent to implementation and will consider the material weaknesses remediated after the applicable controls operate effectively for a sufficient period of time. The company will continue to evaluate, update, and improve its internal control over financial reporting as we execute on our remediation plans.","I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding company were approximately $5.1 billion at March 31, which is down from $5.7 billion at December 31. The $600 million decrease in cash in the quarter reflect the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend, and holding company expenses.","Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Our combined risk-based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies, excluding ALICO, was 423% on an NAIC basis at year-end 2017. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter 2018 statutory operating earnings were approximately $600 million. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was $17.8 billion as of March 31, down 4% from December 31. Net earnings were more than offset by subsidiary dividends paid to the holding company of $1 billion. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 892% as of December 31, which is the latest public data.","Overall, MetLife had a strong first quarter in 2018, highlighted by favorable underwriting and solid volume growth. In addition, our cash and capital positions remain strong and we remain confident that the actions we are taking to implement our strategy will drive free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value to our shareholders.","And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, I had a couple of questions. First on the Brighthouse disposition, obviously you're exploring an exchange offer. Initially you mentioned a couple other options. Where are you in the process of evaluating those? And based on where you stand, is it possible that you could do something in the first half or is it more likely going to be the second half of the year?","Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","Hi, Jimmy, it's Steve. We're looking at different options. As we said in the prepared remarks, we're just trying to find the best transaction form to derive the greatest benefit for the company overall. Increased volatility in the marketplace impacts, in an exchange offer, equity for equity, the discount you have to give to get enough people to come forward to transact with you to make it a successful exchange offer. So, that's a factor now because the change in volatility from the time we first thought about the form of transaction.","But nothing has changed regarding our intent, which is to transact this year. And I think we said before kind of the May-June timeframe is as early as we can start, because of filing requirements that have to come into place, driven out of Brighthouse. So the timeframe hasn't changed and the intent in terms of retiring MetLife shares and disposing of Brighthouse shares has not changed.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, any color on your long-term care block? Just if you could frame the size, annual premiums, your GAAP and stat reserves, and specifically, on your assumptions, what are your interest rate assumptions over the next few years relative to where rates are right now?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, hey, Jimmy, it's John. Yeah, I would just refer you back. I think the statistics we gave back in the fourth quarter hold today. We have roughly $2.5 billion more stat reserves than we do GAAP. So, it's $14.3 billion in stat and $11.7 billion in GAAP. I think we've talked about the rate actions that we've taken. I'd just reference back to the rate actions. We've been fairly successful getting approval over the course of the years. We referenced 7% over the $750 million of premium we get annually. So, all those things were a factor into the good results. I don't know if, Marty, you want to add any color.","Martin J. Lippert - MetLife, Inc.","I guess I would just add that from both the underwriting results as well as expense control that we're seeing there, as well as the rate actions, all of those are moving in a very positive direction. As John mentioned in his opening comments, that's resulting in us feeling much more comfortable about 2018. And relative to the guidance that we gave at the outlook call last year is what's contributed to us moving that guidance up. So all in all, I think, across MetLife Holdings and specifically with respect to long-term care, we're seeing very positive results.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just following up, do you have an assumption of a steep increase in rates over the next several years in your reserving?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, for stat, we only include what's been approved.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, no, I meant interest rates.","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","So, yeah, we assume a forward rate increase in ultimately getting to our long-term rate of 4.5% \u2013 in testing. In the reserves, there's no increase. So, for loss recognition testing, cash flow testing, we would assume that, but for reserving, there's no increase.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, thanks, good morning. First question on share repurchase, you're clearly on a pace to finish the $2 billion pretty quickly this year. Is that more of a timing issue or should we consider a potential increase to your share repurchase plans relative to the initial guidance?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, it's John, Ryan. I think that's more timing. There's no change to our capital management plans for 2018.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Got it. And then I just wanted to clarify one thing on the unit cost initiative plan. The $800 million net cost save guidance, just to be sure, that is already net of all the TSA payments from Brighthouse that would be running off, that's netted out of that number already?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, that's all-in, right? We said it's a $1.050 billion on a gross basis and then net of strand gets us down to the $800 million.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Got it, okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. If I could just go back to Steve's comments about the alternatives to the exchange offer. I think he mentioned a debt exchange. So would that be going to MET bondholders and offering to give them Brighthouse common stock in exchange for their debt holdings?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, hey, Sean, it's John. Look, I think what Steve talked about is there are alternatives, right? And a debt for equity would be one. I think right now we wouldn't want to get into too much details. We want to maintain flexibility here. And there's a number of other reasons why we can't get into how we might do it. But as Steve said, there's a few options for us to pursue and we'll pursue the most economically beneficial one of those.","Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. And then I guess, John, a question for you, I don't want to beat a dead horse, but you're new in the role and I think investors were concerned that maybe MET would be backing off the net $800 million expense save target from UCI. So just to be clear, that policy is still in place and that's still the goal and you still think that's attainable.","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","I would reiterate what Steve said. We are fully committed to our commitment.","Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning. John, just can you make a few comments about the remediation in the accounting controls issue? I heard your prepared remarks, but just like, I guess cutting to the chase, can you provide a little more clarity around when, timing and process that's left here and when you believe you'll be at the end of this.","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, hey, Tom, it's John. Look, I think we are, as we've said before, there's a lot of work to do. First thing is to identify the root cause. Then we need to implement the full set of procedures. We've done some things, as I articulated in my prepared remarks. But we need to implement the full set of controls and then we need to observe those for a sufficient period of time and usually that's at least two quarters. So but our target for clearing the material weaknesses is still 2018.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Got you. And then just back on long-term care. So you have a lot of margin between GAAP and stat. You had favorable results this year. I think from looking at the long-term care exhibits that came out for 2017 your results seem to be fairly well behaved certainly on a relative basis. Taking all that together, should we feel pretty confident heading into balance sheet review season that long-term care from your starting point now looks like it's fine? Or any color you can give there as we think about balance sheet review season and if that's an area to watch?","Martin J. Lippert - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, so it's Marty Lippert. We still are very comfortable with our reserve adequacy and our experience continues to emerge consistent with our reserving assumptions. We test our GAAP and stat reserves annually and are comfortable with the reserve margins that are indicated in those tests. So, yeah, we continue to feel good about it.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, good morning. First question, could you give a little more color about the kind of sudden departure of John Hele and what the thinking was behind it because it just seemed very sudden.","Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","Andrew, it's Steve. Look, we're \u2013 any company decides, at MetLife there's always some change in management from time to time. One of the questions that came up to us after this announcement was why the timing and so on and so forth, but once a decision on John Hele's retirement was made, we decided it was important for the incoming CFO, John McCallion, to oversee the filing of our financial statements for this quarter, and to present on this earnings call to all of you. So you may or may not know but under SEC rules, once a decision is made at this level of an executive, you have to file with the SEC a disclosure within four days. So it's not like there's a great deal of flexibility about timing of announcements. So that's drives a lot of it.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So in the quarter, like, there were a lot of positive strides. I shouldn't be concerned then because of this event something might be an issue with the financials?","Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","No. So there were two separate tracks, think of it that way. One was John's retirement and the other was we had a quarter coming up to announce. And look, in any big company, there's never a great or perfect time for an announcement of a major change at senior executive levels. I can say a whole bunch of other things besides just the quarter that come up over the course of the year in terms of important points in time in terms of when a Chief Financial Officer would be presenting. So there's never a perfect time. And these two separate tracks were going on. And once the retirement decision was made, then we have to announce.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then just a detail question on the Group Benefits business. The underwriting ratios were quite strong, right in line with your guidance, but you had an other expense line. I think John talked about spending on technology and so forth. The other expense line was up, I think, north of 10% in the quarter. Could you give a sense of whether that line item is sort of a run rate from the first quarter or maybe that comes down a bit?","Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, hi, Andrew, this is Michel. So three factors influencing the increase in the expense item. One is the reinstatement of the health insurance tax. So that drives the expense ratio up, it benefits our loss ratio in non-medical health. And the other two factors were \u2013 one was the timing of some technology investments that we're making. We had announced in the second half of last year a major initiative in partnership with IBM, additional platform that would help drive our growth in the small market segment, which we feel is an attractive segment for us. So we're seeing some of that investment flow through. And then, as we continue to emphasize voluntary business and we continue to grow that component in terms of our overall sales, that's also having an impact on our acquisition cost. But, as a reminder, again, voluntary is a very attractive segment and it's very consistent with our strategy to grow in that area.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Hi, thank you. Was hoping you could provide some more color on the underwriting results in RIS in MetLife Holdings this quarter and how they would compare to your normal expectations?","Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.","Let me start with RIS, Erik. So, we had favorable underwriting in particular in our U.S. pensions business. I would also point out that in the first quarter of 2017, we had also some reserve adjustments which impacted our underwriting in that quarter so that's what you're seeing here. Obviously underwriting can vary quarter to quarter.","Martin J. Lippert - MetLife, Inc.","It's Marty Lippert. In MetLife Holdings business we actually had a very good quarter with respect to underwriting across the board. We would expect that to move back into our normal range that we've communicated to you in the past of between 50% and 55% for the quarter that was in the 47.5% range.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Thank you. And then on the pension risk transfer outlook, you commented that the pipeline for the business is looking good given move in rates and I guess other favorable macro dynamics. Just wondering if you're seeing any implications on your competitive position in that market as a result of the recent issues?","Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.","No, just to re-emphasize what John mentioned, we think the opportunity in the market will be attractive in terms of flows this year. We've had constructive engagements with the key intermediaries and brokers for this business and we have no indication that our competitive position would be negatively impacted by the RIS issue.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from UBS. Please go ahead.","John M. Nadel - UBS","Hey, good morning. So just a question on cost initiative. The $800 million of expenses through 2020, do we know yet, have you told us whether all of that would be expected to drop to the bottom line or would some of that be expected to be reinvested into the business? And how much of that $800 million is in the numbers today?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Hey, John, it's John.","John M. Nadel - UBS","Hey, John.","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","How you doing? I would go back to that slide that we put in the supplemental deck, right, where we showed the ratios, and let's start there. So, remember, we think, as I emphasized, we think the annual expense ratio is the best metric. If you look over 2015 to 2017, we're down about 100 basis points and you think that we have roughly $45 billion in revenue, we have about $400 million of savings. And that effectively goes to the bottom line. That's pre-tax, but that's the improvement in our profit margin, as I said. So, yeah, the short answer to your question on the $800 million is, yes, we'd expect that to be an improvement in profit margin post all the actions being taken 2020 on.","John M. Nadel - UBS","Got it, thank you. And then I have a question on allocated equity for two of the segments. For Holdings, allocated equity is down pretty significantly in the first quarter versus the level you guys were allocating last year. And I think that makes some sense, right? That should track reasonably similar, I assume, to revenues declining. You can affirm that or not. But then what was surprising to me was Asia, where allocated equity was up pretty significantly and it doesn't \u2013 and I think you've got two things going on in Asia: One, you've been moving more toward fee-based businesses, I believe, and, two, the risk-oriented business there, the higher capital required business there I thought was shrinking.","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","John, I'm going to take my 48-hour pass go card on this one, if that's all right. But, yeah, we'll get back to you on that in more detail.","John M. Nadel - UBS","Appreciate it. I'll look forward to talking to you offline.","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","All right, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Just a question on the TSA fees and thanks for breaking that out. That $79 million that you booked this quarter, I was just curious why we didn't see any of that in the fourth quarter and then how would you expect that $79 million to kind of trend over the next year or so?","Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","Sorry, Suneet, can you say that one more time.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes, $79 million of TSA fees in your supplement, right? And so I assume that's related to the Brighthouse TSA arrangement that you have. Since the thing was spun out in August, I would have expected some in the fourth quarter, but there weren't any. So curious about that, but then also how do you expect those TSA fees to kind of trend over the course of 2018? I know Brighthouse has talked about really trying to clamp down on those as quickly as possible.","Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, I'd say a year from now, there's probably a decline in $30 million to $40 million of TSA fees is expected. But I think it depends on how fast the exits occur and that's not a real precise number, but give or take.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And is that what's captured in that original Investor Day slide when you show the cost savings and you went from, like, 2018 to 2019 and there was actually a $100 million pickup in stranded overhead; is that essentially capturing the loss of these TSA fees?","Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, there was a separate line on strand and you saw that uptick and that is effectively the roll-off of the TSA fees.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then the last one is just on the expense initiative costs. I thought that maybe last quarter you'd told us $275 million would be expected to hit the operating results in 2018. Seems like first quarter, you're running a little bit less than that, the annualized rate. Should we expect that $275 million is still kind of a good number for 2018 and so we'll see a pickup in that over the subsequent quarters?","Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, so we're still aligned to what we provided at Investor Day in 2016. So like you said, we said we'd get gross saves of $400 million in 2017. I think you can see the math is there. And then, we're expecting to get another $300 million -$275 million or whatever, roughly, during the course of 2018. And then, I'd just say on the quarter, as I said in my prepared remarks, we think it's very important to focus on the annual expense ratio. Now, we gave you Q1 2018 as a reference, but even 2017 you saw varying quarter-to-quarter expense ratios, so we really think looking at the trend of the annual rate is probably the best way to think about it.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. All my questions have been answered.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. First question I had was just on RIS. Could you discuss the headwind you'd expect from three-month LIBOR increasing? Like would the costs of crediting be expected to go up? And it looked like the NII yield there was a bit higher this quarter. Is there any floating rate I should be thinking about or should that continue to trend down as it has the last few quarters?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, hey, Alex, it's John. I think the simple answer at this time is probably just to put you back to the outlook call. We gave you those sensitivities. We think they're holding well, and if you were to use those relative to what happened in the quarter, I think you'll see that they still hold so.","John A. Hall - MetLife, Inc.","And that brings us to the top of the hour. We're going to have to shut the call down to let everybody move on to the next one. Thanks, everybody, for your participation and we'll talk to you throughout the quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Welcome to the MetLife Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and products of the company and its subsidiaries. ","MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to John McCallion, Head of Investor Relations.","John McCallion","Great. Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife Fourth Quarter 2011 Earning Call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings press release, our Quarterly Financial Supplements and in the Other Financial Information section. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investments and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.","I would also like to bring your attention to one item. As noted in our press release, during the fourth quarter of 2011, MetLife began reporting certain operations of MetLife Bank and Insurance operations in the Caribbean Region, Panama and Costa Rica as divested businesses. As a result, we have modified our definition of operating earnings to exclude the impact of these divested businesses, and prior periods have been reclassified to confirm -- conform to the current period segment presentation.","Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Eric Steigerwalt, Interim Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; and Bill Toppeta, Vice Chairman of EMEA and Asia. ","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.","Steven A. Kandarian","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin this morning with by an overview of MetLife's performance for the full year 2011. Overall, MetLife had a solid year. We generated operating earnings per share of $5.02, up 16% from 2010, and our operating return on shareholders' equity was 11%, up 100 basis points from 10% in 2010. These results are even more noteworthy in light of a challenging external environment the insurance industry faced in 2011. The global macroeconomic environment remain volatile. Interest rates declined, equity markets were flat and several natural disasters in both the United States and Japan drove up claims. Adjusting for certain onetime items, which we discussed at our December investor call, MetLife's 2011 operatings -- operating earnings would have been $5.25 per share.","Capping a solid 2011 was a strong fourth quarter. MetLife delivered operating earnings per share of $1.31, up 11% year-over-year. In our U.S. Businesses, underwriting discipline continue to produce favorable results in Group Life, with a loss ratio of 85.2%, as well as in Dental. In addition, core spreads held relatively stable despite the low interest rate environment, largely as a result of our disciplined asset liability management, our hedging strategies and our private asset origination capabilities.","Outside the United States, we continue to be pleased with our financial results and our progress in integrating Alico. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, sales increased by 12% on a combined basis while premiums, fees and other revenue rose by 1%. We generated $570 million in operating earnings on $3.8 billion of premiums, fees and other revenues. Top line growth was negatively impacted by the disposition of noncore businesses, nonrenewals of certain large group accounts and the accounting impact of a shift towards savings products.","In Japan, sales increased in the Bank and Independent channels. In other international regions, we benefited from our acquisition in Turkey and in leveraging of our accident health capabilities in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Total sales of A&H, a low capital, high-ROE product, increased roughly 25% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we remain confident in the growth of our non-U.S. businesses. As we said on our December investor call, we expect to grow operating earnings by roughly 14% outside of the United States in 2012, after adjusting for the new accounting treatment of deferred acquisition costs.","One final note from the quarter concerns variable annuity sales. As we discussed on our last call, we sold $8.6 billion of VAs in the third quarter of 2011. In the fourth quarter, VA sales declined 16% to $7.2 billion in line with our expectations. As I have said previously, one of our guiding principles at MetLife is to strike the right balance between growth, profitability and risk. Consistent with that principle, we are committed to actively managing the level of our VA sales.","In January, we once again reduced the roll-up rate on our GMIB Max product, from 5.5% to 5%. This change is having the desired effect. VA sales in the early part of the year are tracking with our 2012 guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion, consistent with the level of VA sales prior to 2011. With the management actions we are taking, we are confident that VA sales will remain an important part of our overall product mix.","Despite the low interest rate environment in which we are operating, MetLife's businesses continue to generate excess capital. We finished 2011 where we expected, with $3.5 billion of deployable capital. By the end of 2012, we anticipate deployable capital to grow to $6 billion to $7 billion before any deployments. As I previously mentioned, it is our intention to begin returning excess capital to shareholders this year pending regulatory approval. ","In January, we submitted our 2012 capital plan to the Federal Reserve and expect to receive a response before the end of the first quarter. Qualitatively, we believe we have developed a robust, forward-looking capital planning process, consistent with the Fed's guidelines. Quantitatively, we specifically designed our capital plan to meet the Fed's requirement that we have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial stress. Finally, we believe that approval of our capital plan is consistent with the Fed's mandate to promote maximum employment as MetLife shareholders would redeploy idle capital in a more productive manner.","At the same time, we continue to move forward with our plans to seize being a bank holding company. On December 27, 2011, we announced the sale of our depository business GE Capital, which we expect to close during the second quarter. In addition, we are writing -- we are winding down our forward mortgage business and exiting our Warehouse Finance business through an asset sale to EverBank.","Further down the road, a number of insurance companies face the possibility of being named nonbank systemically important financial institutions. To be clear, we do not believe the life insurance business poses a systemic risk to the U.S. economy, and we look forward to continuing to meet with policymakers to convey our position. ","The business of life insurance is highly regulated with strict capital reserve and derivative use requirements. With regard to derivatives, we are -- which are one of the key aspects of our business that regulators will examine, we are well collateralized and our counterparty exposure is well diversified, providing protection to policy holders and shareholders alike.","Just as our decision to reduce VA sales as part of our commitment to managing our portfolio of products, MetLife also continues to manage its portfolio of markets. In November, we announced that we were divesting our businesses in the Caribbean, Panama and Costa Rica. And last month, we announced our plans to acquire from Aviva plc its Life Insurance businesses in Eastern Europe, which will expand MetLife's presence in growth markets. As I said on our December investor call, we are going to invest in those markets that we consider core and divest from those that do not meet our strategic priorities or financial requirements.","Now let me turn to strategy and our recent organizational changes. As CEO of MetLife, I believe it is important for us to continuously reassess our strategy, especially in light of the uncertain external environment. We'll provide the details of our current strategic review at our next investor event on May 23. You've already heard me say that capital is precious and that we must limit its use to those activities that can best create long-term shareholder value.","Of course, having the right strategy is not sufficient. On our earnings call last July, I outlined some of my key priorities to ensure that MetLife is equipped to deliver strong business results. I spoke of the importance of maximizing the value of our brand, which we have done with the naming rights to MetLife Stadium, our extensive rebranding efforts in key Alico markets, such as Japan, and our new U.S. advertising campaign launched during the Super Bowl.","I discussed sharpening our focus on value creation and have emphasized to our senior leaders that we must pursue profitable growth, with returns that exceed our cost to capital, and I described MetLife's commitment to recruiting top talent, which is our guiding principle in selecting a new CFO and President of Asia.","Last November, I also announced that MetLife was reorganizing from a U.S. and international structure, into 3 broad geographic regions: the Americas, EMEA and Asia and creating a global employee benefits business. We are continuing to implement that reorganization plan and have taken a number of additional steps to enhance our operating model.","Today, I like to give you a high-level overview of our Americas division. Under the leadership of Bill Wheeler, the Americas is comprised of the following 6 core businesses: Retail, Corporate Benefit Funding, Group, Voluntary and Worksite, Latin America and Direct. Once we have named a new CFO, Eric Steigerwalt will lead the Retail business, which includes Individual Life and VAs. ","What will not change as a result of our new structure is MetLife's commitment to ensuring that customers can do business with us through a variety of channels. For example, even as we were to develop our direct-to-consumer business, we recognize the face-to-face distribution through agents and advisors is critical to our success. Having a diversity of channels is a competitive advantage that enables us to pursue growth in multiple markets simultaneously.","The final topic I want to address this morning is the impact of interest rates on MetLife's financial performance. We discussed this topic at length last fall, and since that time the shares of MetLife have traded with less correlation to the 10-year treasury. Even so, when the Fed announced its decision to keep short-term interest rates low through 2014, the shares of life insurers fell sharply that day.","One question we have been asked is whether MetLife's 2012 earnings would be impacted by low interest rates over the entire year, especially since our guidance assumed that 10-year treasury would rise from about 2% last fall to 3% by the end of 2012. The short answer is no. We reran our 2012 projections assuming the 10-year treasury holds constant during the year. The decline in investment income will be offset by income generated by our interest rate floors. ","Over the longer term, low interest rates would have impacted MetLife's earnings, as we explained in detail last fall. Under the scenario we used at that time, we held a 10-year treasury flat at 2% over 5 years. MetLife's operating earnings still grew over the 5-year period but at a slower rate. It's important to note that we assume no extraordinary management actions under that scenario. In reality, we have a number of tools that can and would be used to mitigate the impact of sustained low rates, including pricing, crediting rates and expense management.","To sum up, MetLife had a solid 2011 and a strong fourth quarter, even in the face of some significant market pressures. Our capital position is strong and getting stronger, and our ability to grow operating earnings in the face of low interest rates remains intact. In short, we think we're the best-positioned company in the life insurance sector to deliver shareholder value.","Thank you again for joining us this morning. And with that, I will turn the call over to Eric Steigerwalt.","Eric T. Steigerwalt","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.31 per share for the fourth quarter. When adjusting for a few nonrecurring items, which I will discuss shortly, normalized operating earnings were $1.30 per share. You will note this result is comfortably higher than our fourth quarter guidance range of $1.16 to $1.26 provided to you during our Investor call on December 5. The primary drivers for this outperformance were higher-than-expected variable investment income, lower expenses and stock market performance in December coming in better than expected. Overall, I would characterize this as a very good quarter driven by solid underwriting margins, strong and stable core investment spreads, which reflect how well we have managed the business despite the low-rate environment, and continuing expense control.","Underwriting margins were healthy due to our ongoing pricing discipline. This was most evident this quarter on our group insurance operations, with a very favorable mortality ratio in Group Life and in improving benefit ratio in our non-medical health businesses. In Japan, accident and health underwriting margins continue to be quite attractive. ","And finally, expenses remain very much under control. Our overall expense ratio was 22.3% in the quarter, after recasting for the divested businesses in the bank and the Caribbean, as John indicated earlier.","Now let me walk you through our financial results and point out some of the highlights. First, let me discuss some normalizing items, which occurred during the fourth quarter. As part of our annual review of DAC assumptions, we had net positive DAC unlocking and other net adjustments of $27 million after tax in our U.S. Businesses. ","In our Insurance Products segment, Individual Life had a net positive unlocking and other reserve adjustments of $65 million after tax. The favorable unlocking was driven by a policyholder dividend scale reduction on a portion of our Individual Life business and updates to our SOP reserving model in our Universal Life business.","In Retirement Products, we had negative DAC unlockings and reserve adjustments of $38 million after tax, primarily as a result of a reduction in the long-term assumption for our separate account returns. This change was due to the higher allocation to bonds that we are seeing in our separate accounts, which is causing the blended return to be slightly lower.","Next, our Auto & Home business had favorable prior year development reserve release in its Auto business of $14 million after tax. This was partially offset by incurred catastrophe losses of $18 million after tax in the quarter, which was $6 million above our fourth quarter planned provision of $12 million after tax. The net impact of these 2 items benefited Auto & Home's operating earnings by $8 million after tax.","And finally, Alico integration expenses in the quarter were $20 million after tax. We have recorded these expenses in our Corporate & Other segment.","Now let's take a look at the results in the quarter by line of business. In U.S. business, we reported operating earnings of $932 million for the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of onetime items that I mentioned, normalized operating earnings were $897 million. This reflects solid operating earnings growth of 4% on a reported basis as compared to the prior year period of $894 million and 9% higher on a normalized basis. The primary drivers of this normalized earnings growth were strong underwriting results in Group Life and Dental, as well as strong separate account fee growth in our Retirement Products segment. Premiums, fees and other revenue were $7.6 billion, up 7% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher U.K. pension closeouts in our Corporate Benefit Funding segment and higher premiums and fees in Retirement Products.","While Insurance Products\u2019 top line was essentially flat this quarter, we do expect to see a pickup in 2012 revenue growth consistent with our plan, as we are experiencing a nice rebound in 2012 Group Life sales and persistency and continued growth on our Dental business, primarily driven by the addition of the TRICARE Dental account. Auto & Home had solid growth in the quarter as net written premiums were up 2% year-over-year. Insurance Products normalized earnings of $346 million were up 7% over the prior year quarter. This strong performance is mainly driven by improved Group Life and Nonmedical Health underwriting margins. ","The Group Life mortality ratio for the quarter was a very favorable 85.2%, below both the prior year quarter of 89.7% and our 2011 guidance range of 88% to 93%. Overall, we are pleased with Group Life's steady underwriting results, reflecting our ongoing pricing discipline.","The Nonmedical Health total benefits ratio for the quarter was 88.9%, which was down from the prior year quarter of 89.7% and within our 2011 guidance of 86% to 90%. Underwriting trends in Dental remain favorable due to more stable utilization and pricing trends. However, disability results were less favorable than recent quarters. Although claims incidents improved in the quarter, we did see higher average claims\u2019 size and weaker recovery experience.","Our Individual Life mortality ratio for the quarter was 81.1% compared to 82.9% in the prior year quarter. While direct mortality was good, we did have weaker reinsurance recoverables on some high-face amount claims.","Turning to our Auto & Home business. Normalized operating earnings for the quarter were $73 million, up 4% versus the year-ago quarter. The combined ratio including catastrophes was 93.8% for the fourth quarter, favorable to the prior year quarter's result of 95.2%. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 90.2% in the fourth quarter, generally in line with the prior year quarter of 90%. Overall, this was a good bounce-back quarter for Auto & Home to close out a year that was materially impacted by record catastrophes and adverse weather.","Retirement Products normalized operating earnings of $254 million were up 16% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Earnings growth was primarily driven by higher fees from growth in the separate accounts balances of 12% year-over-year.","Corporate Benefit Funding operating earnings of $224 million were up 8% over the prior year quarter on a normalized basis, largely reflecting increased net investment income from growth in the general account, which was up 4% year-over-year.","Now let's discuss our businesses in Japan and Other International Regions. Focusing on Japan first. Our Japan operation produced good results for the quarter. Japan's operating earnings for the fourth quarter were a strong $326 million, up 3% over third quarter 2011, driven by solid Accident and Health underwriting results, improvements in persistency, as well as higher net investment income.  ","Japan sales grew 16% in the quarter as compared with the combined MetLife and Alico results for the fourth quarter of 2010. We continue to experience strong sales growth in the agency and bank channels. Our expectation is that sales growth will continue to be solid in 2012, but perhaps at more modest growth rates due to prior year recovery from the financial crisis, causing tougher comparisons from our 2011 sales.","The year-over-year increase in fourth quarter revenues on a combined basis was approximately 5%, driven largely by the favorable exchange rate of the yen versus the U.S. dollar. On a constant rate basis, revenues were down 2%, on a combined basis, as GAAP revenue growth has been dampened by the shift towards FAS 97 savings products. While the revenue for these products is accounted for differently than the risk protection products sold in Japan, resulting in incrementally lower PFOs and higher net investment income, their margins and earnings are comparable.","In our Other International Regions segment, operating earnings were $244 million, down 6% from the third quarter 2011, due to foreign exchange rates and the challenging European market conditions. However, our Latin America and Middle East businesses continue to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth.","OIR sales grew 9% in the quarter as compared with the combined MetLife and Alico results in the fourth quarter of 2010, driven by strong sales in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Sales growth was negatively impacted by the challenging market conditions in Western Europe and Asia Pacific regions.","The year-over-year revenues decreased on a combined basis by approximately 2%, reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar. On a constant rate basis, revenues were up 2%. Revenue growth within OIR was relatively soft due to our strategic pruning of noncore businesses, non-renewal of some large institutional cases that did not meet our profitability targets and the annual resumption -- annual assumption review in our Korea business, which actually has a revenue effect. Offsetting for these factors, OIR revenue growth would've been approximately 8% on a combined basis.","Despite the tragic events in Japan, ongoing unrest in the Middle East and adverse market conditions in Europe, our businesses outside of the United States, taken as a whole, were within their full-year plan range for sales, premiums, fees and other revenue. We have made significant progress in leveraging our accident and health product portfolio by expanding our capabilities into Asia Pacific and Latin America. As Steve mentioned, total Accident and Health sales increased by approximately 25%, a strong result. These products have low capital requirements, attractive returns and high customer demand in emerging economies, which fits nicely into the guiding principles that Steve has already outlined.","Now let me turn to investments. I'll begin with variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income was $247 million and within our 2011 quarterly guidance range of $225 million to $325 million. After taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $162 million. While results were in the planned range, variable investment income is lower sequentially and compared to the prior year driven by lower private equity income, reflective of the third quarter market decline, and volatility that we've said can occur within these asset classes.","Next, let me briefly mention realized investment gains and losses. In the fourth quarter, we had after-tax investment portfolio net losses, excluding divested businesses, of $213 million. Included in this net loss are impairments of $163 million after-tax, of which $123 million relate to our Greek sovereign debt holdings.","Moving to our commercial mortgage holdings. This portfolio continues to perform extremely well. As of December 31, our valuation allowance is $398 million, down from $428 million at the end of September. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again in this quarter to 61% from 62%, as valuations continue to improve in the markets where we invest. Additionally, our delinquency rate remains very low, and more importantly, our losses recorded during 2011 were only $12 million on a $40 billion portfolio. With respect to our derivatives portfolio, we had after-tax gains excluding divested businesses of $351 million that were driven primarily by lower interest rates and gains in our variable annuity hedging programs.","Lastly, I\u2019d like to update you on certain European exposures. During the fourth quarter, we continued to manage down our exposure to peripheral European sovereign debt. As a result of targeted sales and the recognition of impairments, we have reduced our GAAP book value to $254 million, a relatively modest level given the size of our overall investment portfolio. We continue to reduce our exposure to European banks as well. We sold approximately $250 million of GAAP book value in the fourth quarter for a loss of $18 million, bringing the full-year 2011 sales total to $3.2 billion. The sales were focused on those institutions with exposure to peripheral Europe, securities with a lower preference in the capital structure and larger absolute exposures. Looking forward, we believe our remaining European exposure is quite manageable given the size and diversification of our overall investment portfolio.","Now let me discuss our balance sheet and capital position. First, our book value per share excluding AOCI is $49.02 as of year-end, reflecting strong year-over-year growth of 13%. Steve referenced earlier how well protected the income statement is in a sustained low interest rate environment. I would add that our balance sheet remains quite strong and is well positioned to remain so, even if -- even in a sustained low rate environment. As we have previously stated, even if rates stay low for the next 5 years, our balance sheet, both on a GAAP and stat basis, would only be modestly impacted. This is the result of managing for the long term, utilizing prudent risk management techniques and taking actions prior to the crisis, not waiting until it was upon us.","Let me also provide you with an update on our statutory earnings and capital position. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the fourth quarter of 2011 were approximately $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. As you may recall, our third quarter statutory operating earnings were impacted by an increase in reserves. Primarily related to the weakness in the equity markets. Included in our fourth quarter results is the reversal of a portion of that position due to the strong equity market performance in the fourth quarter. ","For full year 2011, our preliminary statutory operating earnings and net income were each approximately $2.6 billion. These results were negatively impacted by catastrophes, similar to GAAP and market-related reserve items in 2011. Our total adjusted capital is at $27.7 billion as of December 31, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8%. ","While we have not completely finished our RBC calculations for 2011, based on our work to date, we are estimating that our consolidated RBC ratio will end the year at the upper end of our guidance range of 420% to 445% that we gave you during our December 5 call. Also, we are estimating that our Japan solvency margin ratio on the new basis will be within our guidance range of 850% to 950%.","Consistent with our guidance, cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at December 31 were approximately $4.5 billion, giving us deployable capital of $3.5 billion, $1 billion above our holding company cushion. In addition, we are projecting that deployable capital will be within the guidance range we gave of $6 billion to $7 billion at year-end 2012 prior to any capital management actions.","In conclusion, MetLife had a very good fourth quarter, completing a strong 2011 despite the ongoing challenging environment. Our margins remain strong as we continue to focus on generating profitable growth. Our financial strength is intact. Our balance sheet is positioned to withstand a sustained low rate environment, and our capital position remains robust.","And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator so we may take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Sanford Bernstein.","Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","My first question is on the variable annuity business. Obviously, you guys have added a lot of business second half of the year, but even as we go back to the earlier part of 2011. At -- this business had guarantees that were richer than what you're currently comfortable with. So if I think back to the last quarter, I think you talked about ROAs of kind of 14% to 15% -- ROIs, excuse me, of 14% to 15%. And I'm just wondering, kind of given the environment that we're in, how are you feeling about those returns on a go-forward basis.","William J. Wheeler","Suneet, it's Bill Wheeler. The -- I think the ROIs that we talked about on the previous call, I think those are still consistent even in the fourth quarter. Obviously, we had, I would say, a little bit lower than 15% ROI on our VA sales. The cost of hedging is still relatively high, and so that obviously depressed the number a little bit. We don't consider those returns adequate. And so obviously that's why we changed the roll-up rate at the beginning of January back down to 5%, and we've also changed a number of other features. I guess I would say by the way, just keep in mind when we talk about ROIs, we're talking about fully allocated expenses here, not marginal expenses, and that's always important. That's how we look at it, and we think that's the right way to look at it. And so we feel the sales, clearly, we had in the fourth quarter and in the latter part of the year were above our cost of capital. We created value through those sales, but we think we need to improve. And so therefore, that's why we've changed our pricing.","Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I guess I'm a little surprised to hear you say that they're not adequate. So where should we -- or where do you think the ROIs on the 5% product would put you?","William J. Wheeler","Well, obviously, it depends on market conditions, but we want to be 15%-plus in terms of ROIs. The risk profile of that product is such that we think we need to earn 15%-plus.","Suneet Kamath - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then my last question, also on VAs, is at your -- during your interest rate call, you talked about perhaps using the strategy of going back to your legacy book and using some of the asset allocation techniques in the GMIB Max and sort of rolling those out. And I guess I'm wondering, if you're successful in doing that, could that have a significant impact on the ROIs of that back book?","William J. Wheeler","We're still pursuing that strategy, but it's one of, I would say, a group of strategies we're doing to improve the performance of the in-force book. And so as a whole, I think they will have -- as a group, I think they'll have an impact that is measurable. But that one technique is -- it'll depend on the adoption and the investment in that -- in those new funds, which, by the way, have performed very well. So it's nothing to do with how the funds have performed. But you got to change policyholder behavior a little bit to want to invest in those new funds under existing annuities. So I would say that we\u2019re pursuing a number of strategies to improve the profitability of the in-force block, and that's one of them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from UBS.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","With regard to the international business, so OIR was up 2% in premium, fees and other; Japan was down 2%. Could you give us a sense of where you expect that PFO to go in 2012. And then secondly, why do you think the margins are comparable as you increase your allocation of sales to investment products. I understand with Aflac, their margins are about 2\/3 or less, the more traditional medical-type products that they're selling.","William J. Toppeta","Andrew, it's Bill Toppeta. In terms of where we think the PFOs will go next year, the total for international, as we gave you on the investor call in December, would be approximately 6%. And the breakdown on that is Japan would be a little bit above 5%, and then the other regions would be about 6.7%. So I think that there are a couple of things that will drive that going forward. The first thing I would say is a big emphasis, pretty much, in all regions on the Accident and Health business. We expect that there's going to be a strong emphasis on A&H growth in all regions. In fact, we just came back from Latin America, where there's very strong growth in A&H in a number of countries. We're seeing very strong A&H growth in Korea. So I think the trend is very good. Another point I think would be related to persistency. There are number of management actions being taken around persistency, particularly in Japan but also in other places. I think what we saw this year was a little bit of a delay in getting that started, and that was related to the earthquake. So we're probably -- and I've mentioned this before, we're probably about 3 to 4 months late on the persistency initiatives. Nonetheless, the trend is very good. The trend this year in Japan has improved persistency by about a percentage point, and that's going to benefit premiums and fees next year, of course. And we expect that there's going to be continued growth with that. So I think those are a couple of the factors that make us confident that we can achieve the premium fee growth that I outlined going forward.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then to that second question, Bill, about the margins.","William J. Toppeta","Yes.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Will the earnings go -- move in sync with these revenues?","William J. Toppeta","Yes. The margins -- actually, the margins -- this is related to the shift between FAS 60 products and FAS 97 products. The margins -- and we've looked at several of these products, the margins are every bit as good on FAS 97 products. So while you may get a lower PFO number, your profitability is going to hold.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just to give a little more color on that persistency number. You got one point in Japan. How many more points do you think you can get going forward?","William J. Toppeta","Well, I think we probably will be looking at something like that for next year, something between say 0.5 to 0.7, maybe up to a full point of improvement depending upon how successful we are. But I think it's in that range.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just one last point. On Japan, the A&H business, do you expect some growth in that area as well, or is it more in other regions?","William J. Toppeta","No, we absolutely expect growth. In fact, I think that A&H sales growth in Japan is expected to be strong. And I think the reason for that is a focus on distribution. So there's going to be a lot of focus on A&H in both -- well, all 3 channels. I would say, in face-to-face, we certainly are doing very well with respect to the independent agency in Japan. I think we'll get good strength there, but we'll get even bigger emphasis in the career agent force. Sale of A&H through the banks is another emphasis. And then in DM, but DM with sponsors. So I think that we're going to -- in all those channels, we expect to get good -- very good growth in A&H sales in Japan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Smith from Scotiabank.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","Yes, a couple of questions. One is with respect to the guidance and the change -- and their changing guidance, given a different scenario of interest rates staying at current level for the full year. What factors, in your assumptions, changed that allowed you to maintain the guidance in that type of a scenario?","Eric T. Steigerwalt","You're talking about our EPS guidance for 2012?","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","Yes.","Eric T. Steigerwalt","So as we went through on the interest rate presentation, we have interest rate floors not only helping us, given the level of interest rates, but we had some deferred start interest rate floors that kick in, in July, and that's going to help 2012. In addition, in both our Retirement Product and our Life Insurance -- Individual Life Insurance businesses, we still have crediting rate flexibility, and you'll see that play itself out depending on what happens with interest rates during the next 4 quarters. So as we project out and as Steve said, we have done these projections, we think that the impact in 2012 will be very modest.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then just as a separate question. On the VAs, with respect to the lapse rates, they're really low. And I'm wondering if at this level of lapse rate, it's really within the range of your expectations, then what type of utilization rates you're expecting?","William J. Wheeler","Well, our whole product is designed with a series of assumptions about -- we use this phrase dynamic lapse rate assumptions, which means as the products get more in the money, and they're relatively in the money now even though we've had a nice rally of the stock market, just mainly because they're in low interest rates, they're in the money, or the guarantees are in the money, is that -- therefore, we assume that lapse rates will go down. And that's how the businesses -- and therefore, the accounting adjusts for that. I think utilization rates -- we assume that consumers are going to utilize or annuitize fairly efficiently. That means if they are in the money and the guarantee is valuable, they will take advantage of that. That's what -- and then we hedge accordingly. So we assume that they'll act appropriately. As a matter of real experience, I'm not sure. I think that's a very conservative assumption.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","Okay. So you would say that 6 or so percent lapse rate at this point are within your range of expectations and that you're factoring in a further decline on that?","William J. Wheeler","Yes, absolutely. So we're -- well, so the lapse rates where they are today, we think is -- we're not surprised by that and that' sort of what -- how the product is designed and how the accounting works. And in terms of actually annuitizing, we're not seeing a lot of people at -- the very first policy holders are able now to annuitize, and it's not a big enough sample to really draw any conclusions from -- remember, because they have to wait 10 years. And the level of annuitization is very modest, and we're assuming a lot more -- well, the way we hedge, we assume more will annuitize.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I had a few questions. First, on the group disability business. Your margins were weak. I just wanted to get an idea on what your expectation is for clean recovery rates given the economy, and what you've seen in terms of competitor behavior on pricing in the disability market. And then secondly, on capital deployment, you mentioned that it could begin once you get fed approval, assuming you're referring to share buybacks. But maybe if you could discuss where acquisitions fit into your capital plans. Would you consider additional deals in the near term? And if yes, which products or markets are you most interested in? And then lastly, in the past, I think, Bill, you have mentioned hedging cost for the GMIB feature were higher through 2011 versus the fee that you were charging. Where that stands now that the market volatilities declined a little bit?","William J. Wheeler","Okay. So I'll try to do these. So I'm in a new job, Jimmy, so don't put too much pressure on me.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, Steve can answer some of these.","William J. Wheeler","Okay. With regard to group disability, I thought Eric explained it pretty well. Incidence rates are actually down, which is a good sign. And the claim closure rates are below plan and below expectations and actually ticked down a little bit in the fourth quarter, which is not good, and that's all about getting people back to work. And so that's very much driven by the macro factor. Where that goes from here? We hope it improves. We're not sure. What -- the way we're dealing with that, of course, is -- and the other final thing, by the way, which is just unusual, is we had some fairly high severity in our disability claims, and that's just a blip. We suspect that'll come back down to a normal level of severity, probably in the next quarter. But you never can be sure. The way we're dealing with this is obviously through pricing and obviously making sure we manage claims appropriately. We're -- because the environment is still difficult, we've been raising prices in our group disability business for a while. So that leads to the competitive environment question. Clearly, we've seen a shift in terms of group competitors, in terms of how aggressive they've been to obtain business, and that's good. We've seen that both in Group Life and in Group Disability, and I think -- so the environment is clearly from a pricing -- but getting better. Okay. Just -- I'll do the last one on hedging. As I just, I think, mentioned a few minutes ago, so our hedging costs in the fourth quarter were relatively flat with where they were in the third quarter, which means that they're higher than the fee we're charging on the rider, a little bit higher. Now that's obviously not great. But you have to always remember that we're earning a substantial fee on the base contract, and that's very important. So that's why we still make a return that's just a little south of 15% in the fourth quarter, even though these hedging costs are higher.","Steven A. Kandarian","So, Jimmy, on the capital deployment issue. As I mentioned in my remarks, we have submitted our plan to the Fed earlier this year. We expect to hear back before the end of this quarter. We feel very good about our submission. We feel very good about our capital position, and we are hopeful that we'll be able to return capital to our shareholders this year. But we must await a response from the Federal Reserve. As to what we will do with that capital, obviously, we're looking at all the possible avenues there, dividends, share buybacks, opportunistic M&A that fits our strategic direction and which provides shareholder value and which provides accretion to our earnings and markets that we think are desirable. All those things are on the table.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I'd like to follow up on that last question. So with the CCAR submission or the submission that you've given to the Fed, that would contemplate a level of capital management that would be considerably below kind of the $6 billion to $7 billion level. So I just want to clarify the timing, and I think that it's right that you would go through the CCAR process to the extent you're still a bank holding company. And then if you can shed the bank holding company status later in the year that would open the door for more material capital management. So it's kind of a 2-step process. Is that the right way to think of it?","Steven A. Kandarian","Well, let me say this, the -- we've submitted what we're comfortable doing in terms of capital redeployment for 2012 to the Fed. And again, we can't prejudge things, but we feel good about our submission, and we are hopeful that we'll be able to execute it here over the course of the year. The numbers that we talked to you about, $6 billion to $7 billion by year end, of course, that builds over time. So that capital will be there by year end absent any deployment, well, to see what happens over the course of this year in terms of we do run the areas of dividends and share buybacks, again based upon what we hear back from the fed, and, well, to see what happens in the M&A arena over the course of the year. We look at most any property that's put up for sale. We have very strict criteria in terms of what we will pursue and what price. But as we mentioned, we have done some deals recently in Turkey, in Eastern Europe, and we'll be looking at other opportunities over the course of this year. So I can't really say exactly what we'll be doing with that full $6 billion to $7 billion we anticipate having by year end over -- I'd say it'll be a 2-year process, because a lot of this depends upon what happens in the marketplace in the M&A arena and also depends upon what kind of reaction we get from the Federal Reserve to our submission. And as you point out, we are de-banking. Process is under way. We're hopeful that will conclude sometime midyear this year. And that would put us in a different status at that point in time, and that will be taken into account in terms of how we deploy our capital as well.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","All right, understood. And one more, if I could, real quick. The strategic review is on everyone's mind, and you've been, I think, clear that May 23 is when that's going to be covered in depth. But is there any other commentary you can give? It seems like the non-U.S. A&H products are favorably mentioned here a couple of times, maybe spread-based products domestically are less in favor. Anything else you could provide there would be appreciated.","Steven A. Kandarian","We will talk at much greater length at our May call. But let me go through the -- some guiding principles. I'll give you some insights into our thinking here. So first, let me start by saying, obviously, the acquisition of Alico, $16.3 billion acquisition, transformed MetLife. We went from being a largely domestic-focused life insurance company to being a truly global business. Now a lot has to happen to catch up with that business in terms of culture, organization, and we've been doing quite a bit in that arena as you've heard from us. So that's one issue that we'll be talking more about. We've talked about how easy it is to do business with us and being more customer-centric going forward and in allowing people to interact with us on the basis that they want to. That doesn't mean excluding channels we're in now. It means, really, in addition here in terms of allowing people to interact with us on a number of different bases. Let me add also talent. We talked a lot about our talent here. You've already heard about some high-level hires to MetLife and more coming in the area of the CFO and President of Asia positions. Another issue to talk about is how we look at our businesses overall as a portfolio, both in terms of products and geographies, and making sure there's a balance there, especially when you take into account risk. So your question allude to A&H, lower capital charge kind of product, strong ROE kind of product, so obviously we want a good balance between the different products we sell. We've told you today that our guidance around VAs for 2012 is roughly $18 billion. That is down from 2011. That's related to our way of looking at risk and making sure we balance this portfolio of products that we offer to the marketplace. And finally, I'll just say in terms of guiding principles, all these things I just mentioned that are heretofore is because we're trying to drive shareholder value. That's the bottom line. And if we do all those things well, we will drive shareholder value, and we're confident we can do that.","John McCallion","Great. Well, thank you, everyone for joining us today, and enjoy the rest of your day. And I'll turn it back to Greg. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from results anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factor section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.","John A. Hall - MetLife, Inc.","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. On this call we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible, because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period-to-period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.","Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management. You may have noticed that last night we released an expanded set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John Hele will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along.","After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. Understanding there is a lot to unpack today, if need be, we will extend our Q&A session beyond the top of the hour. Still, in fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.","Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Most of my comments this morning will focus on the issue within our Retirement and Income Solutions business that caused us to delay earnings and take an after-tax charge of $331 million or $510 million pre-tax. Simply put, this is not our finest hour. We had an operational failure that never should have happened and it is deeply embarrassing. We are undertaking a thorough review of our practices, processes and people to understand where we fell short and how we can reset the bar at the high level people have come to expect from us over our 150-year history. The Board of Directors is fully engaged on this issue as well.","Let's start with MetLife's decision to postpone its earnings release by two weeks. The question we have been getting is, if you knew about this issue on December 15, why couldn't you report earnings as planned on January 31? What we did not know until late in the closing process is that we would have a material weakness and would need to make revisions to our financial statements going back five years. This created a significant amount of work. Rather than to rush the process and risk an error, we decided to take an extra two weeks to provide the most accurate information possible.","As you know, we preannounced our high-level financial results on January 29, and our underlying performance in the quarter was solid. We reported fourth quarter net income of $2.1 billion, which reflects the current period after-tax impact of $70 million for the group annuity reserve addition. The remainder of the charge is accounted for as revisions to prior period financial statements. John Hele will discuss the impact and geography of the reserve addition and cover our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance in greater detail","Let me describe what happened and how this came to light. MetLife has been in the group annuity business for a very long time. The charge we took relates to a business we wrote going back decades. All the people in pension plans whose obligations we now assume are already retired and in pay status. By contrast, in earlier periods, some of them were not yet in pay. They had earned the benefit, but were years or even decades away from retirement and often had left their companies. These type of annuitants are not always easy to find.","What became clear to us is that what had been standard protocol for finding retirees who were owed benefits was no longer sufficient. Recently, the Department of Labor has been urging companies that sponsor pension plans to do a better job of finding their own unresponsive and missing participants. A pilot program MetLife conducted in 2016 and 2017 to affirm that with better outreach we could establish contact with more people.","In the 1990s, MetLife established a practice of releasing reserves when the company could not establish contact with an annuitant. In retrospect, based on the process we had in place, this was an error. The reserves released in any single period were not material to MetLife's financial statements. But over time, it led to the charge we announced two weeks ago.","In October, when this issue was brought to the attention of the new head of our U.S. business, Michel Khalaf, and me, we moved with a strong sense of urgency to make it right. This has not excused the organizational failure to escalate the issue sooner. We needed to do three things: establish what happened; improve our processes to do a better job locating retirees; and assure that we pay everyone we find, as we always do.","As we noted publicly in December, we launched an assessment into what happened. While I can report that to-date MetLife has not found any evidence of intentional wrongdoing, I can also tell you that we are taking action to hold people accountable. In addition, we have taken steps to strengthen our processes for finding unresponsive and missing annuitants. These include additional mailings, certified mailings, phone calls and the use of additional third-party firms specializing in locating missing participants.","For everyone we find, we will commence payments as soon as they elect to start their benefits. We'll also pay interest on back payments for those we find. The interest rate will be comparable to that used by the Federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and this amount is already reflected in the $331 million reserve charge we took. For context, MetLife's group annuity reserves in the RIS business are roughly $40 billion.","MetLife's core purpose is providing financial protection to our customers. Central to that purpose is the timely payment of benefits, which makes this issue especially distressing to me. I am deeply disappointed that we fell short of our own high standards. Our customers deserve our best efforts to find and pay them. We will do better. I wish this issue have been escalated earlier for remediation, MetLife discover the issue itself, self-reported it to our primary regulator, publicly disclosed it, and is taking all necessary steps to fix it.","I will now discuss some of the ramifications of the group annuity issue. As mentioned, we took a charge to restore reserves previously released as well as accrued interest. Most of the charge is associated with periods prior to 2017. Given the size and nature of the issue, management has identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. This deficiency is only related to group annuity reserves.","The material weakness we identified had two components. First, we had a lack of adequate controls over the administrative and accounting practices that led to the release of the reserves. Historically, MetLife would try to reach annuitants twice \u2013 once when they approached the normal retirement age of 65 and a second time when they approached the required minimum distribution age of 70.5. As noted, we improperly released reserves for those annuitants who were unresponsive after the second attempt.","The second component was failure to escalate sooner. The reserve release process issues were not communicated or escalated on a timely basis throughout MetLife, which hindered our ability to identify and address them. We are working hard to remediate the material weakness and expect to make progress in 2018. John Hele will discuss the material weakness further.","Once the scope of the group annuity issue became clear, prudence dictated a global review of similar administrative and accounting processes across the company. This review, which was started in December 2017, is now complete. The review did not identify any additional material issues. And the amount of the charge fall slightly below our preannounced range.","We are also cooperating with our regulators on this matter, including the New York Department of Financial Services as our primary insurance regulator as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission as our securities regulator. I would reiterate that this is an issue MetLife self-identified and self-reported.","The group annuity business is an important business to MetLife that leverages many of the company's core competencies, including asset management, liability management and underwriting. We have been among the industry leaders in this business for decades and expect to remain so. We take seriously the responsibilities we bear. Enhancing our administrative procedures in this business will position us to better serve our customers.","Before I close, I want to update you on our capital management activities. During the fourth quarter, we completed repurchases on our prior $3 billion authorization and began repurchases on our most recent $2 billion authorization. All told, we repurchased $621 million of shares in the fourth quarter and returned more than $1 billion to shareholders overall, including dividends. We've continued buying in the market in 2018, repurchasing $391 million of our shares and have $1.4 billion remaining on our current authorization. To be clear, the capital management plan that we discussed on our outlook call remains in effect. We intend to complete our $2 billion authorization and execute the exchange offer for our remaining stake in Brighthouse before the end of 2018.","In conclusion, I want to reiterate how committed we are to making the necessary changes at MetLife. I am well aware of our recent history. We have had a number of charges that took the market by surprise. At the same time, I believe the strategy we have put in place for MetLife is correct. My goal for the company and the goal of this entire management team is to leave MetLife better than we found it. In our view, that means simpler, less capital-intensive and with more predictable free cash flow.","We are confident that MetLife's strict capital budgeting process will position the company to perform well in any economic environment. Our task now is to insist on the same level of discipline in how we execute. It is not enough for MetLife to have the right strategy; operationally, we must have a culture of continuous improvement and we will.","With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele.","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I would like to begin my remarks today by reviewing the 4Q 2017 supplemental slides that we released last evening along with our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. These slides address several key areas of focus for investors: fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results; our group annuity reserve charge; Long Term Care; and the impacts from tax reform.","I will start with comments on our fourth quarter results and business highlights starting on page 3. This schedule provides a reconciliation of net income and adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter. Net income was $2.1 billion and was $1.4 billion higher than adjusted earnings of $678 million, primarily due to the benefits from tax reform. I will provide more details on tax reform later in this presentation. Net investment gains and net derivative losses were relatively modest and essentially offset in the quarter. Overall, the investment portfolio and hedging program performed as expected.","Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $42.24 as of December 31, up 4% versus the sequential quarter, primarily due to the impacts of tax reform. As of January 1, 2018, we expect this amount to decrease by approximately 2% with the adoption of certain new accounting rules. This is primarily driven by a one-time reclassification from retained earnings to AOCI due to the impacts of tax reform that are attributable to AOCI, but were required to be reported in net income in 2017.","Our notable items in the quarter are highlighted on page 4. We've quantified these notable items into five categories that we highlighted in our news release and quarterly financial supplement. First, we had a one-time negative impact of $298 million after-tax, or $0.28 per share, primarily due to the one-time repatriation transition tax on our unremitted overseas earnings and the revaluation of deferred taxes to the new tax rate of 21%","Second, various insurance adjustments, including $62 million after-tax or $0.06 per share due to the group annuity reserve charge, reduced adjusted earnings by $110 million after-tax or $0.10 per share. Third, litigation and other settlement costs, including the strengthening of asbestos reserves, reduced adjusted earnings by $55 million after-tax or $0.05 per share.","Fourth, expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings by $42 million after-tax $0.04 per share. And fifth, favorable prior-year developments increased adjusted earnings by $7 million after-tax or $0.01 per share. Catastrophe losses were $18 million after-tax, in line with plan. In total, notable items in the quarter reduced adjusted earnings by $498 million or $0.47 per share. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $1.2 billion or $1.11 per share.","On page 5, you can see the year-over-year adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items, by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were down 2% year-over-year. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were $1.11, up 3%, and up 2% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Positive year-over-year drivers in the quarter included solid volume growth, lower expenses and favorable underwriting as well as strong equity market results. These were offset by weaker investment margins and an unusually lower effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Recurring investment income was essentially flat from a year ago. In the quarter, our global new money yield stood at 3.23% compared to an average roll-off rate of 3.98%. We would expect our new money rate and roll-off rate to converge at roughly 3% on the 10-year U.S. Treasury. Pre-tax variable investment income was $216 million in the quarter, within our quarterly guidance range of $200 million to $250 million. As a large investor in the U.S. fixed income market, MetLife will benefit if higher economic growth leads to higher interest rates and an extension of the credit cycle","In regards to business performance, Group Benefits had another strong quarter, with adjusted earnings up 32% quarter-over-quarter. The primary drivers were strong non-medical health underwriting and good expense control. Group Benefits is a cornerstone franchise for MetLife and delivered stellar results in 2017, highlighted by adjusted earnings growth of 26%, sales rising 19%, and PFO growth of 5% excluding the impact from the loss of a large dental contract, as previously discussed.","Adjusted earnings in Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, continue to be pressured by the flatter yield curve. The 20% year-over-year decline, excluding notable items, was driven by lower interest and underwriting margin, including an $8 million after-tax in-quarter impact related to the group annuity reserve charge. This was partially offset by volume growth and lower expenses. Despite the recent challenges, RIS is an important business for the company, which aligns well with our strategy and insurance fundamentals , specifically the pension risk transfers, our view of the business has not changed. In 2017, we had record PRT sales of $3.3 billion and expect 2018 to be another active year.","Property & Casualty, or P&C, had a strong quarter as adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, doubled year-over-year, driven by favorable auto underwriting results. Auto results have benefited from targeted rate increases and management action to create value. For the full year 2017, P&C adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were 45% higher than 2016. The key driver was the auto combined ratio, which improved 5.8 percentage points in 2017.","Asia adjusted earnings were down 12% year-over-year, primarily due to tax items in Japan, the impact of the change in Japan's effective tax rate and the reversal of tax accrual in the fourth quarter 2016. Asia sales were up 1% on a constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were flat year-over-year as the shift to foreign currency whole life has proven successful. FX life sales were up 27%, while Yen life sales were down 77%. FX life sales accounted for 90% of total life sales in Japan this quarter. Emerging market sales in Asia were up 26%, driven by China, which continues to have strong agency growth.","Latin America adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter were up 2% and flat on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were volume growth and more favorable market impacts, offset by higher initiative and non-recurring expenses, the fee reduction in Provida and taxes. LatAm PFO growth was up 8% and up 5% on a constant currency basis. Growth has been tempered by the pension market in Chile and the large group market in Mexico. Business performance in Provida has been promising as net transfers in this business were positive during the fourth quarter for the first time in over a year.","EMEA adjusted earnings were up 10% and 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by volume growth in Turkey and Western Europe and favorable expense margins. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were down 17%, excluding notable items, primarily due to lower interest margin and higher expenses. While the quarters have been noisy as MetLife Holdings move through the separation, the year overall has produced solid results. Adjusting for notable items, earnings for the full year 2017 were down 6% from the previous year. Favorable equity markets and lower expenses were key contributors as well as solid life underwriting results.","Corporate & Other adjusted loss was $133 million, excluding notable items related to tax reform, our unit cost initiative and litigation expenses. This was within the quarterly range implied in our 2017 guidance and compares favorably to an adjusted loss of $152 million in the fourth quarter 2016. I will provide an update to our 2018 guidance for Corporate & Other shortly.","Now let me address the group annuity reserve charge and related material weakness identified by MetLife's management, which required a revision of our prior financial statements. Page 6 provides some background on our RIS group annuity business. The practice of releasing group annuity reserves that required correction go back approximately 25 years. The subgroup most impacted by the group annuity reserve charge is approximately 13,500 of the 600,000 annuitants, or approximately 2% of the overall population. To further size this business, total group annuity reserves are roughly $40 billion.","Page 7 provides a breakdown of the group annuity reserve charge. In total, the charge was $510 million pre-tax, which is below the bottom end of the guidance of $525 million to $575 million pre-tax estimated on our January 29 press release. On an after-tax basis, the charge was $331 million using the U.S. tax rate of 35% for all periods. In total, the correction for prior-year periods was $372 million pre-tax, or $241 million after-tax.","You will notice in our quarterly financial supplement that some of the historical quarterly and annual numbers for 2016 and 2017 have changed slightly. You can see the impact summarized in the revision to prior-period net income slide in the appendix. These changes are a function of the historical revisions that we performed during the fourth quarter. The small differences reflect the correction of minor prior-period errors, which was required in the U.S. GAAP accounting. For those who produce financial models of MetLife, this will unfortunately require some updating on your part.","Let me turn to page 8 to discuss the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting identified by management during the fourth quarter. As Steve described, the material weakness is only related to the group annuity business with respect to two elements: administrative practices and escalation.","On page 9, I will offer more detail on our efforts to remediate the material weakness. Relative to our group annuity administrative practices, we are correcting the reserve release practices to ensure improvements are made. These would include earlier, more frequent and simpler communication to annuitants as well as the use of certified mail, additional external databases and more locator services, among other things.","Relative to escalation, we are reviewing our practices regarding timely communication and knowledge-sharing throughout the company. We are hiring advisors to conduct a comprehensive analysis, which will be overseen by our Chief Risk Officer, Ramy Tadros. We believe these measures will strengthen MetLife's internal control over financial reporting. Our efforts to remediate the material weakness are ongoing and we expect to make progress throughout 2018.","Turning to page 10, let me address another topic that may be on your mind: Long Term Care. We announced our exit from Long Term Care in 2010. We were historically conservative in our policy provisions and conservative in new business underwriting. For example, only 16% of our policies offer lifetime benefit, and the vast majority reimburse actual incurred expenses as opposed to being cash plan. Our largest blocks were fully underwritten at issue for medical and cognitive impairments.","Beyond that, our Long Term Care book of business is around 40% group with generally lower ages, smaller policies and less generous provisions than individual. Our book of Long Term Care generates annual premium of roughly $750 million aided by consistent rate action. In 2017, these were 7% on average across the full LTC book. We have approximately $11.5 billion of GAAP LTC liabilities and $14 billion of statutory LTC liabilities. Collecting more premiums sooner makes a big difference in the economic performance of the block. We started that process early, making our first rate increase request with the states in 2008.","We will review updated assumptions each year for loss recognition in statutory and cash flow testing. Based on our 2017 results, we have a comfortable margin about current loss recognition. We also update claim reserve assumptions each year to reflect actual experience. As a New York-domiciled company, we are subject to New York state regulatory oversight. Among other things, this means we do not factor in future rate increases into our reserve calculations. Lastly, we do all of our own claims administration, which means we control the checkbook rather than a third-party administrator. While we no longer write this business, we've been involved for a long time and that experience has been reflected in our Long Term Care results.","Now let's talk about tax reform on page 11. We have a one-time net benefit of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter as a result of tax reform. The remeasurement of our deferred tax liability resulted in a benefit of $1.4 billion, which includes a $128 million negative impact to adjusted earnings. This was less than our guidance that we provided on the outlook call of $1.5 billion to $2 billion due to fourth quarter items and the group annuity reserve charge. In addition, we have a $170 million charge to adjusted earnings due to a one-time repatriation transition tax.","Looking ahead, we now expect the company's 2018 effective tax rate to be between 18% to 20%, which is lower than our prior guidance of 23% to 25%. In regards to cash taxes, we expect a modest reduction in our annual U.S. cash tax liability and consistent with the recent past, cash tax payments to the IRS will not be significant for at least six years.","Next, I would like to update you on some of the guidance we provided on our outlook call in December. Following tax reform, our guidance in 2018 for the Corporate & Other adjusted loss moves to $650 million to $850 million. This reflects the new lower 21% corporate tax rate. Relative to the prior guidance range, the increased Corporate & Other adjusted loss is expected to be more than offset by lower taxes and higher adjusted earnings in our U.S. businesses.","Other points of guidance provided on our outlook call such as interest rate and other sensitivities were also based on a 35% tax rate. For those, simple math can get you to the sensitivities associated with a 21% tax rate.","We are comfortable maintaining our target free cash flow ratio at 65% to 75% of adjusted earnings, on average, over 2018 and 2019. There are a couple considerations. Tax reform will impact the timing of our tax cash flows and separately, there's an impact from the group annuity reserve addition. Taken together, we expect the ratio to be at the lower end of the range over the two-year period. As Steve indicated earlier, we anticipate no change to our capital management plan, as articulated on our outlook call in December.","I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.7 billion at December 31, which is down from $6.5 billion at September 30. The $800 million decrease in holdco cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividends, holding company expenses as well as a $1 billion debt maturity in December. In addition, our 2017 free cash flow ratio was 75% of adjusted earnings, excluding notable items and cash flows related to Brighthouse.","Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. While we have not completed our risk-based capital calculations for 2017, we estimate our U.S. combined RBC ratio will remain above 400% on a NAIC basis. Preliminary full-year 2017 U.S. statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.4 billion and net earnings were approximately $2.4 billion. Statutory operating earnings reflects favorable underwriting, partially offset by higher reserves and higher taxes. Net earnings were also impacted by losses on derivatives.","We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.5 billion as at December 31, 2017. Statutory operating earnings were offset by dividends and derivative losses. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 863% as of September 30, which is the latest public data. Overall, while our group annuity issue presented challenges in the fourth quarter, our cash and capital position remains strong.","I would like to add my personal regret over the delay in reporting. I appreciate your patience and I look forward to your questions.","And, with that, I'd turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, and good morning. I just have a question about the guidance for higher Corporate after-tax losses. Just to be clear, there's no change in guidance at the enterprise level because the operating segments will produce higher earnings due to a lower tax rate, which will more than offset the higher after-tax loss in Corporate?","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","Hi, Sean. This is John. Yes, that's true. It's not intuitive, if you look at the net number that we talk about with the Corporate loss, and that's because the Corporate pre-tax loss is larger than you may think, and there's more tax credits than normal than the 35%. So, the total change, the increase in our range of $200 million is totally and only due to tax reform changes and this will be mitigated by better margins in the rest of our business.","Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then I have a question about the reviews that the New York Department and the SEC are doing regarding the group annuitants. Are they essentially doing competing reviews or are they taking the findings of your internal review? I'm just wondering if you can give us any context of your understanding of how their processes are working.","Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","Sean, it's Steve. Each has its own regulatory arena. The New York Department of Financial Services is obviously our primary insurance regulator and SEC is for securities matter, so each has its own arena, and we're cooperating with both fully. And we can't predict exactly how long this will play out. It's a process that will take its own course.","Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Hey. First question, Steve, just in terms of the internal global claims review you did across all your businesses, it seem to wrap up pretty quickly, considering just the timing here. Can you talk a bit about your confidence in the depth of the review and the fact that you're highly confident this is isolated \u2013 this situation is isolated to only the group annuity business?","Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","Sure, Tom. When this matter came to light, we made sure we had the resources within countries and regions to put all necessary people against this review to get to the right answers; meaning, determining exactly what might else be out there in the same arena. And people are working very, very long hours, evenings, weekends, et cetera. And as reported, we have found nothing material coming out of that review, which was encouraging.","To your point, there's always things in an insurance company, over the years, that you look at. You may change your estimates, change your actuarial assumptions and the like, or find new and better ways of doing things. But this was a very extensive and thorough review of our international operations.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Got you. And just my follow-up, John, you had mentioned you have a comfortable margin above loss recognition for Long Term Care. Can you help a little bit, at least directionally, on the quantification of that? Are we talking about a margin of 10%, closer to 50%? Just any directional help on that would be appreciated.","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","In U.S. GAAP, it's over 10% but not 50%. How's that for a range?","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. Somewhere above 10%, below 50%. Okay.","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, it's definitely above 10%. And it's all in the assumptions you make and how you think about it. So, it is complex, but we do a lot of work on this and we continue to work to have a better claims management as well as appropriate rate filings with the state. So, this is an ongoing effort we've had. We've had it for quite a long time on this. And don't forget, on a statutory basis, we tested more conservative assumptions than GAAP and you can see the statutory reserves are larger than the GAAP reserves.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore Group LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I had a few questions. First, on your Asia sales, I think they were up just overall around 1%. And if I look at Japan, obviously, there's a product mix shift going on. So, first question on that is what are the annuities that you're selling in Japan? Because that's the product that seem to grow a lot. And then secondly, if you look at non-Asia sales, those were actually up less than 2%, as well. So, what's going on, if you could give us some detail there?","Steven J. Goulart - MetLife, Inc.","Hi, Jimmy. It's Steve Goulart. Let me start and I'll ask Sachin Shah to comment a little bit more on Japan. But basically, when you look at all of Asia as a region, it was really some very strong performance and then some sort of flattish performance. But when you look at emerging markets, essentially our sales were up over 25% there on a year-over-year basis, and that was led by China where sales were up over 30%. Offsetting that a little bit were performances in Korea and Hong Kong on a quarterly basis, and those are just unusual events. The timing of a sales campaign in Korea was one impact. In Hong Kong, there were some regulatory changes that I think ended up with sort of a fire sale result when you look at the fourth quarter of last quarter. So, overall, again, very strong, we're very pleased with sales. I think Japan was flat and a lot of that had to do with change in mix. But let me ask Sachin if he wants to comment anymore on Japan.","Sachin N. Shah - Metlife Insurance KK","Can you hear me? Okay. Sorry, Jimmy, a little technical glitch there. In the Retirement segment, we sell predominantly fixed annuity products. These products are fixed-term products, typically 3 years, 5 years or 10 years in term and the customer is targeting a specific maturity period and looking for a target return. These products also have MVAs built into them, and so the customer is bearing the foreign currency and market risk in the product.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And are they primarily forex as opposed to Japanese yen products?","Sachin N. Shah - Metlife Insurance KK","All of our life insurance products, 90% of our life insurance sales and 100% of our annuities sales are foreign currency products.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. And then for John, on the Brighthouse sale, I realize you had been buying back stock through the whole review process. Can you give us just some color on the process that you have to go through for selling Brighthouse? I think there's a limited window given that you have to do a filing and then after that there's a little bit of a quiet period or so. So, what's the process that you'd need to go through and is it even feasible that you could do it in the first-by the end of the first quarter?","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","Hi, Jimmy. This is John. Let me follow up on your Asia question. You're right, the Other Asia wasn't up quite as much. Steve was referring to emerging markets were very strong, but in Korea and Hong Kong, there's some timing points of sales quarter-over-quarter. If you look at the full year, though, for Other Asia, the growth of sales is up 20%. So, there's some timing quarter-to-quarter, but we're very pleased with our Other Asia sales growth in the year.","And on BHF, you're right, we have to file with the SEC for some work for some no-action relief and we need a long enough open window, 20 days of trading days in order to walk through it. And sometimes it goes a few days beyond that, so we have to pick a window where we don't run afoul of various information. So, the timing we haven't exactly set on yet, but it will have to be in a long enough window and we will let you know when we get it filed and going.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then just lastly, have you disclosed or are you able to disclose what your interest rate assumption is for your Long Term Care reserves?","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","The interest rates in GAAP start at the current curve and slowly grade like all of our U.S. GAAP assumptions to a (42:55) 10-year Treasury out about 11 years from now and is statutory. It's tested at various different rates, including level rates forever.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I was just hoping you could touch upon if we should think about any real go-forward financial impact following the group annuity issue in terms of either elevated expenses related to the remediation efforts or if you think it will impact your growth in the RIS business?","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","Sure, why don't I take some expenses. We're doing these outreach programs and doing additional efforts there, we expect those costs would be absorbed by the business. There may be for the investigation we're doing led by the Chief Risk Officer could be some slightly higher expenses throughout the year, but we believe those would be still within the Corporate & Other range that we've given you for expenses for the overall year.","And I'll turn it over to Michel to speak about the business impacts.","Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.","So obviously, Ryan, our focus and energy will be on resolving the issue that we disclosed and finding as many of the missing annuitants as possible and initiating payments to them. Having said that, we have a lot of expertise, we're a leader in the PRT space. We have a lot of expertise in terms of asset management, underwriting, liability management. And last year, as a matter of fact, we had a record year in terms of new business in PRT. So we're going to continue to be active in this market and we believe that with our enhanced process, which will be a best-in-class, we will remain competitive and we'll continue to win new business.","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","Hey, Ryan. This is John again. I want to just add, on slide 7, we showed you the 4Q's in-quarter activity of minus $8 million after-tax. So, you should add that into future modeling that you have of that business, that amount would be roughly recurring.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Got it. And then, separately, can you discuss your view of the sustainability of tax reform benefits in your Group Benefits business versus passing through lower tax rates through pricing over time?","Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, this is Michel again. So, we're going to see a benefit, but we expect that returns will normalize over time. So, if we think about our group business, obviously, renewals are done for 2018. Typically, our Group Life business has a three to five-year rate guarantee; our disability business, typically two-year guarantees; and dental is renewed annually. So, tax is a factor that goes into our pricing, it's not the only factor. A lot will depend on the competitive environment. Again, we don't compete solely on price. But we expect that over time, as business renews, as we compete for new business, we'll have to give back some of the benefit that we're getting from the tax reform.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. I wanted to follow up on the reviews by the New York Department of Financial Services and the SEC. One of the large banks recently was surprised with the limitations on growth by their main regulator. Do either of those regulators have any jurisdiction on your kind of forward capital management plans or your ability to grow the business?","Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","Suneet, I think you're referring to the Federal Reserve, which does not have authority over us.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Right. I'm talking about the specific regulators that are reviewing your group annuity issues. I'm not talking about the Federal Reserve, I'm talking about the NYDFS and the SEC, do they have any jurisdiction on those plans?","Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","On the issue of what exactly you're asking?","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","In terms of your ability to return capital. Like, these reviews are ongoing, right? So, we don't know what the outcome is going to be, but I guess my question is, is there something that could surprise us in terms of what they ultimately decide related to your capital management plan, that's my question.","Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","Well, the DFS approves dividends, but I think the case you're referring to, I don't anticipate that being applicable to us.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just given the big move-up in rates that we saw in the first quarter, should we be expecting a stat impact in terms of your capital at the end of the first quarter as well as a GAAP book value impact?","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","Hi, Suneet. It's John. Well, as you know and as we announced last year, we have changed our hedging strategy to be less sensitive to changes in interest rates than we were historically. So, there will be some impact because it's never perfect, but it should be less muted than it has been in the past.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then just lastly on the capital management plan, are you still-is that liability management component that you guided to still kind of part of your expectations for 2018 in terms of debt reduction?","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","Yes.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Hi. Thank you. John, I was hoping you could walk through more of the dynamics around tax reform on your free cash flow. And, I guess, are there places where the actual dollar amount of free cash flow is expected to increase over time?","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","Well, let's remember, we talk about free cash flow as a percentage of cash we get from our subsidiaries and, well, the largest being the U.S. companies, which is on a statutory basis. And there's a delay, of course, you get the dividend approved for the following year based on your last year's earnings. And then the denominator is your GAAP earnings. So, our GAAP earnings are going to go up by the change in tax reform by about 5 points. So out of the get-go, even with the same dividend and as there's like a year delay in getting this all done, we also have the charge in stat that will impact dividend capacity slightly in 2018.","So, we expect, compared to where we were pre, to have some lower numbers in 2018, a little better \u2013 it will improve in 2019. So, there's a bit of timing going on. We're not currently a very large cash taxpayer in the U.S. and it will be some time before we are, so you have that dynamic going on. But we have reiterated we expect to be at the low end of the two-year average 65% to 75% over 2018 and 2019.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Okay, thanks. And then is there any impact from either the reserve review or the ongoing controls remediation efforts on the timing of other projects or investments that you had planned for 2018?","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","No, we will fund these additionally to what we have, and we are still working very hard on our unit cost initiative projects and all the other improvements we're making throughout the world.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Okay, thank you. And then, sorry, just last, Steve, you had commented that the board is involved in the review process. Can you just expand on your comment there and what capacity they're playing?","Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","They're playing their normal oversight role. The Audit Committee, in particular, and the full Board of Directors is quite involved in all the discussions that we've had internally in the company and we keep them updated on a regular basis.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. My first question is on the capital return expectations for 2018. It was sort of pointing to around the $5 billion range on the outlook call. Just want to make sure that that's still a reasonable expectation for 2018.","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","Yes, that would include the buybacks we plan, the remaining $1.4 billion we have outstanding under the $2 billion authorization, the exchange of the Brighthouse shares and the common dividend.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's what I thought. Thank you. Second, is there any potential put-back exposure from Brighthouse with regard to any pension risk transfer exposure they might have to MET?","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","When Brighthouse was spun and separated, we have a separation master agreement and anything prior to 1\/1\/2017, we have ours, they have theirs, and that's how it's set up.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, it's separate? MET has, in your view, fully addressed any potential exposure there?","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","Yes.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thanks. And then just a final question on tax. Should we just assume a 18% to 20% tax rate across all of MET's segments for simplicity sake or would there be different rates in different segments?","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","Well, there'll be different rates in different segments. Our overseas tax rate is 25%, 26-ish, and then we have the U.S. tax rate 21%, we get some tax credits from many of our investments, so you will see some changes.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. First one was just following the move-up in the 10-year and, I guess, there's a lot of changes that have been made since the last time you guys kind of opined on ROE, is there any update to thinking about the spread on the 10-year that you'll ultimately be able to achieve as you have the unit cost program phased in?","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","Well, I think you're referring to the ROE target relative to the 10-year and, as we've said, this is a longer-term target. When the 10-year spikes up in a quarter, our overall company ROE will not spike up and follow instantly in the quarter. It's meant to be a general average over time. We think it makes sense now that we're at slightly higher rates as they stay in. Our earnings power will increase over time and it will move towards that. But at any small period of time moving 30 basis points, 40 basis points, there won't be a direct-it takes time for the whole portfolio to change and move. Have I answered your question correctly?","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. But just in terms of like the spread piece of it above the 10-year, I mean, is the view sort of unchanged around where you can ultimately get to?","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","Yes. Over time, we're 800 basis points to 900 basis points and we expect to prove even beyond that as we improve our unit cost post 2020.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And the follow-up on just the TSAs with Brighthouse, could you quantify for us how that may be impacting either \u2013 whether it be MetLife Holdings or earnings in Corporate?","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah. Well, we will expect as TSAs go down, we do have higher strand that will increase slowly over time, and that's why we have this unit cost initiative to help offset that as it goes through. So, those two tend to offset each other. And as we announced, we're going to start giving you some expense ratios published with the sub details, so you can track us on a quarterly basis starting in the first quarter of 2018 and you'll be able to see how all this folds out over time.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg from Janney. Please go ahead.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning. Thank you. So, with the 10-year up over 40 bps since the beginning of the year, you had given us the fourth quarter new money versus roll-off rate. Can you give us some idea where that might stand today?","Steven J. Goulart - MetLife, Inc.","Probably not a lot of color, Larry. This is Steve Goulart, by the way. But it's hard when you look at the new money yield. It moves around a lot on a quarter-by-quarter basis, just given our overall activity for the quarter, how much we're reinvesting, whether that's coming off of roll-off and what sort of roll-off and where we're seeing relative value and what our needs are for portfolio investing strategies in that quarter. So really just looking at a quarter-to-quarter basis I think is probably not the best way to think about what's going on. You want to think about long-term trends. And, again, we like the fact that interest rates continue to move up. We think that's going to be good for the portfolio overall and good for our earnings on the portfolio. So I would expect that number in general to increase, but, again, on an actual quarter-to-quarter basis, it's really impacted by a lot of the intra-quarter activity.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. But in terms of the talking about convergence of the two at a 3% 10-year, assume that happened over a period of time, should we assume that there's kind of a linear relationship along that path in how that spread would compress?","Steven J. Goulart - MetLife, Inc.","Well, what John was referring to was what we call our sort of roll-off\/reinvest dilemma, i.e., the difference between where we're investing new money and what the roll-off yield is. And as we've said for several quarters, we do try and estimate what that would look like, at what point are we reinvesting at a breakeven level versus the roll-off securities from the portfolio, and John mentioned that's roughly 3%, probably a little bit above 3%, but there are also assumptions baked into that, too. Most importantly, that all spread relationships stay the same. Again, it's a positive trend.","I mean, interest rates are heading higher. We know that as we approach a 3% 10-year, the portfolio investment options start looking better, we start eliminating some of the negative roll-off that's been impacting our portfolio yield over time, and so it's all very positive. Is it exactly linear? Never exactly linear, but the trend is certainly positive. And, again, as we approach a 3% 10-year that that will persist over time, that will be very positive for us.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then just one kind of model housekeeping. Can you just tell us where the \u2013 for the expense initiatives, where the cumulative savings initiatives stood as of year-end 2017 and what your expectation is for the cumulative savings as of the end of 2018?","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","As of the end of 2017 cumulatively we're about $400 million in saves. And that was our \u2013 that's basically our target we had. Our one-time is running a little less than we had. We expect they'll get caught up, though, throughout the next two years.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","And then is there a number for year-end 2018?","John C. R. Hele - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, we're still basically on the original slide that we gave you for the guidance that we had and, again, we'll give you some more details of this in an easier way to follow this on an ongoing basis. The trouble of all these programs is you save money in one place, but you're growing as well, so how do you know whether it's really flowing through or not. And that's why the expense ratio will be really the key measure. That's what we check ourselves with, the board checks us with, because you have these trackings, but it's also not just saving the money in the UCI program, but making sure you're being efficient elsewhere and you're not losing margin elsewhere in your firm. And as I said, we'll give you good clarity on this during the first quarter and we'll have regular discussions on it each quarter for you.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Just want to follow on Ryan's question related to pension risk transfer. So I hear you loud and clear about your commitments to the business, but have your conversation with clients or brokers changed as a result of the incident?","Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.","Well, I mean, clearly \u2013 this is Michel. Clearly, Humphrey, we are engaging with our key brokers, intermediaries to bring them up to speed on the issue and also to go through what we are doing to address it and the urgency and the resources that we're putting behind addressing this issue. So we're having those conversations as we speak. And ultimately, the market will decide how it will react to this matter. I think from our standpoint, we're making sure that we do everything humanly possible to deal with this issue to find those missing annuitants and to initiate payments and to have a process in place that we believe will be best-in-class in the industry.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","So, in John's prepared remarks, he talked about the outlook for 2018 is still pretty strong compared to 2017, but given some of the discussions that you will have, should we expect some of the \u2013 I mean, the pipeline will be more back-end loaded in 2018?","Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.","Well, I mean, typically PRT tends to be back-end loaded. We see much more activity in the second half of the year compared to the first half. So, I mean, this 2018 could be different, but we expect it to be a typical year in this regard. I just want to also stress that PRT is one component of our RIS business. We have other components of this business that continue to perform strongly, stable value, for example, structured settlements, and our capital markets business as well. So, that's one component of our overall RIS business.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Got it. And then, so now with the review completed, are there still any risks that your auditors may issue a qualified opinion for your financial statement?","Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","No.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. I just want to confirm, with the regulatory inquiry from the SEC and the New York Department of Finance, will we receive notification at some point that their interest in the matter is concluded? Or could this be an open-ended sort of thing we never really know their position on the matter?","Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","Josh, they'll go through their process, and once they've felt like they've come to a conclusion, they'll let us know, and we'll certainly communicate that to the marketplace.","Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And do you have any reserve for legal costs associated with that or potential funds?","Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","We do not.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to John McCallion, Head of Investor Relations.","John McCallion","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's third quarter 2012 earnings call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings press release, our quarterly financial supplements and in the other Financial Information section.","A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period-to-period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.","Now, joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also, here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.","Steven A. Kandarian","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Before we discuss our financial results for the third quarter, I want to express my condolences to those who have suffered great loss as a result of Hurricane Sandy. At MetLife, we are doing everything we can to help our customers cope with the impact of the storm. Our claims associates are on the ground helping customers find shelter, facilitating temporary repairs and issuing advance payments for immediate expenses. We know there is still a tremendous amount of work to do before life returns to normal, and our thoughts are especially with those who are hardest hit by the storm. I also want to thank all of you for being on this call under these difficult circumstances.","Now let me turn to MetLife's financial performance. I would like to begin this morning by discussing the goodwill impairment we recorded in the third quarter of 2012. As we've indicated on previous earnings calls, as well as during our interest rate call last November, a prolonged low-rate environment might cause us to impair some or all of the goodwill in our U.S. retail annuity business. In the third quarter of 2012, we took a $1.6 billion after-tax goodwill impairment in this business to reflect the expected market impact of continued low interest rates, changes in the regulatory environment and other market and economic factors.","MetLife delivered another solid quarter with operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.32 per share, up 47% from the third quarter of 2011. Adjusting for certain onetime items that depressed the results in the prior year quarter, operating earnings still rose by 23%. John Hele will discuss our third quarter results in greater detail in a few moments.","I would like to highlight a few aspects of MetLife's performance that tie to our enterprise strategy, which we developed to address the external economic environment facing life insurers.","As you know, one of our strategic goals is to refocus the U.S. business by shifting our business mix from more capital-intensive and interest rate-sensitive products to simpler protection and fee-based products. Our results and activities in the third quarter were consistent with this strategy. Premiums, fees and other revenues rose by 9% in our Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefit business on strong sales and on revenues from the TRICARE Dental contract. Variable annuity sales in the United States declined by 46% from the prior year quarter to $4.6 billion, in line with our plan. We continued to manage the risk associated with this business.","During the quarter, we launched a new product with lower withdrawal and payout rates. In addition, we limited the ability to deposit new money into a number of our existing contracts that have more generous guarantees.","In our Corporate Benefit Funding business, sales of structured settlements and pension closeouts were both down, reflecting the lumpy nature of this business segment. We see tremendous opportunity in the pension closeout business, especially as interest rates rise over time. However, as with any use of capital, we are committed to ensuring that the new business in this segment clears our hurdle rate.","During the quarter, MetLife also announced the creation of our new third-party asset-management business. This fee-based business requires very little capital and leverages the strong investment expertise we've built up over the decades. We have well-established business platforms for originating commercial mortgages, investing in real estate equity and sourcing private placements. We also possess the talent, scale, reputation and in-market presence to acquire high-quality assets with the potential for strong returns.","Finally, I would point to our pilot project with Walmart to sell term life policies to the middle market. While we are in the very early days and do not have reportable results, we will continue to pursue these kinds of innovative approaches to selling simple protection products through new direct channels.","Another strategic imperative for MetLife is to grow our business in emerging markets. The third quarter saw progress on this goal as well. In Latin America, sales rose 28% year-over-year, led by large group life cases in Mexico. And in EMEA, sales rose 15% year-over-year, driven by our acquisition in Turkey and higher credit life sales in Russia.","Regarding the sale of MetLife Bank, 2 key developments occurred during the quarter: first, we amended the purchase agreement to sell the bank to GE Capital Retail Bank, which has submitted its application for approval to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The key terms of the agreement remain unchanged.","And second, MetLife received a letter from the Federal Reserve granting us an extension until January 5, 2013, to file a revised capital plan.","Until our debanking process is complete, we remain regulated by the Federal Reserve as a bank-holding company. After our debanking process is complete, we face the possibility of being named a non-bank systemically important financial institution, or SIFI, which would place us back under Federal Reserve supervision. As we have said many times, we do not believe regulated insurance activities pose systemic risk to the U.S. financial system. However, in the event that MetLife and other insurance companies are named SIFIs, the impact will depend on how the final prudential rules are written. It will be important that the prudential rules be tailored for the life insurance business model, which differs dramatically from that of banks.","Overall, I am pleased with the results MetLife delivered in the third quarter. Our continued solid operating earnings performance reflects the fundamental strength of our diverse global business. Our focus on pricing discipline and risk management is especially important in this challenging economic environment, which shows few signs of abating. We will continue to monitor the external factors impacting our business and respond accordingly.","In the coming weeks, we'll be finalizing our 2013 plan projections, which we will share with you on our next Investor Day call this December 13.","Before I conclude, I want to mention that this will be John McCallion's last earnings call as Head of Investor Relations. John is becoming the CFO of our EMEA region, and I want to thank him for his help in communicating our value proposition to MetLife's investors over the past 2 years. John will be handing the reins to Ed Spehar, who has covered the insurance industry for more than 20 years as an equity analyst.","It is now my pleasure to introduce John Hele, our new CFO. John has more than 30 years of experience in the financial services industry, having worked for Arch Capital Group, ING Group and Merrill Lynch, among others. His deep technical expertise of world markets -- knowledge of world markets and strong risk management skills are a welcome addition to our global leadership team.","With that, I will turn the call over to John.","John C. R. Hele","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I wish to add to Steve's comments of our concern for those still without power and\/or heat and for those who have had damages or losses in this historical storm. As for the potential financial impact to MetLife from Hurricane Sandy, at this time, it is too early to develop a reliable estimate.","Before I review our results in the quarter, let me provide some color on the key macro factors impacting our financial performance. Interest rates continue to remain low in the U.S., assisted by another round of quantitative easing and also in most countries in which we operate. While the 10-year Treasury yield was essentially flat in the quarter, closing at 1.63%, it is down nearly 30 basis points versus the year-ago period. In addition, and perhaps more significantly, U.S. corporate spreads further tightened in the quarter across most asset classes in which we invest, generally by 10 to 50 basis points. While asset spread tightening is not readily apparent in our product net spreads as provided in our quarterly financial supplement, they do impact our new money rates and will pressure product spreads over time.","On the plus side, the U.S. equity market performed well this quarter with the S&P 500 up 5.8%. By comparison, the S&P 500 was down 14.4% in the third quarter of 2011. This change in the S&P 500 performance resulted in a positive year-over-year variance of approximately $120 million of after-tax operating earnings in our retail annuities segment.","With that as a backdrop, let me now discuss our results for this quarter. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.32 per share, up 47% over the third quarter of 2011. This quarter's results included a few offsetting significant items. However, the prior year third quarter had several significant items, which had a net negative impact on operating earnings per share of $0.17. Adjusted for those items, operating earnings were up 23% year-over-year.","In addition, as noted in our 8-K filed on October 24, in the third quarter of 2012, we began to report all MetLife Bank operations as divested businesses. This change in reporting positively impacted operating earnings per share in the quarter by $0.02 while lowering operating earnings per share in the prior third quarter by $0.02.","On a U.S. GAAP basis, MetLife reported a net loss of $984 million or $0.92 per share, which includes a $1.6 billion after-tax goodwill impairment and net derivative losses of $467 million after tax.","As previously disclosed, we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the third quarter. This year, the testing indicated a full impairment of the goodwill associated with the U.S. retail annuities business, resulting in a noncash charge of $1.9 billion or $1.6 billion after tax. This includes $176 million of goodwill recorded in the Corporate & Other segment, representing tax benefits related to this annuity business.","Goodwill testing starts with the -- estimating the fair value of the business based on a market participant view. While interest rates have been low for some time, during the third quarter, U.S. Treasury rates hit their lowest point since World War II. Also, the Federal Reserve extended the time frame they see low interest rates being warranted until 2015 and also initiated Quantitative Easing 3. These factors indicated that an extended period of low interest rates needed to be reflected in the fair value estimate, particularly on the return to market buyer may assume associated with the fixed income portion of the separate accounts. We believe buyers of an annuity business, particularly a variable annuity block, will be looking for a capital-efficient structure, most likely one involving captive and\/or offshore strategies. Given the industry-wide inquiries on the use of affiliated captive reinsurers, buyers may now discount the ability to fully utilize these structures. These, and other market conditions, led to a significantly lower fair value for the business than in prior years.","And when you follow through to the measurement step in the goodwill accounting process, this lower value resulted in full impairment of the recorded goodwill. This charge does not have an impact on the bank holding company capital ratios, which exclude goodwill from the calculations nor on our U.S. statutory results.","As for the potential DAC and GAAP loss recognition impairments, while we review these each quarter, we conduct a comprehensive annual review of all the model assumptions in the fourth quarter, which include interest rates, equity returns, policyholder behavior, mortality, et cetera. We will need to complete our analysis before determining if there would be any impact in the fourth quarter.","As for the net derivative losses in the quarter, it was primarily due to: one, the impact on the value of embedded options in our VA hedging program as a result of MET's own credit spreads tightening in the quarter; two, the rise in long-term rates; and three, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against certain currency such as the euro, Canadian dollar and British pound in the quarter.","Next, I would like to discuss some of the key financial metrics we focus on each quarter. First, as I mentioned earlier, our investment spreads remain stable despite the low-rate environment and tighter corporate spreads. As stated on prior calls, there are several factors contributing to our stable spreads, including our ALM discipline, use of interest rate floors, private asset originations and the performance of our variable investment income.","In the quarter, pretax variable investment income was $260 million, just above the top of our 2012 quarterly guidance range. After taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $165 million.","Next, expenses remain well controlled. Operating expenses in the quarter were $2.8 billion, up only 0.4% over the prior-year period. While the operating expense ratio did increase 30 basis points to 24.4%, the increase was primarily driven by lower revenues as a result of pension closeout sales in the third quarter of 2012. Excluding closeouts, the expense ratio would have been unchanged at 24.8% between the 2 periods.","Turning to the top line revenue. Premiums, fees & other revenues, or PFOs, were $11.6 billion in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and lower pension closeouts, PFOs were up 2% year-over-year.","Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $47.70 as of 9\/30\/12. This reflects growth of 2.6% year-over-year despite the goodwill impairment and net derivative losses discussed earlier.","And finally, year-to-date 2012 operating ROE was 11.4%, up 140 basis points as compared to the comparable period for 2011. This improvement was driven primarily by higher operating earnings, up $880 million on a year-to-date basis.","Now let's discuss the business segments, starting with the Americas. The Americas operating earnings were $1.2 billion in the quarter, up 58% year-over-year with growth across all segments. Retail, life and other reported operating earnings of $204 million, up $83 million year-over-year due to higher net investment income. In addition, the prior year third quarter results of this business included $29 million after tax of catastrophes in excess of plan in our retail, property & casualty business and $27 million after-tax charge to increase reserves in connection with the company's use of the U.S. Social Security Administration's Death Master File to identify potential life insurance claims that had not been presented to the company.","Retail annuities reported operating earnings of $288 million, up $195 million year-over-year. As noted earlier, $120 million of the variance was due to the initial market impact related to the performance of the S&P 500 in their respective quarters. In addition, this business had an increase in separate account fees, improved interest margins due to wider spreads on the general account and lower expenses.","Also, I should note that variable annuity sales were $4.6 billion in the quarter, down 46% year-over-year. We continue to see sales trend down due to the pricing and derisking actions that we have taken this year. We would expect to see sales continue to decline in the fourth quarter, in line with our full 2012 guidance of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion.","Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits reported operating earnings of $283 million, up $130 million year-over-year, largely due to the segment's prior year third quarter results, which included an $82 million after-tax charge related to the aforementioned Social Security Death Master File and $20 million after-tax charge for catastrophes in excess of plan in our group P&C business. In addition, this segment had favorable claim cost trends for dental, favorable catastrophe and non-catastrophe experience in group P&C, as well as improved interest and expense margins and disability.","Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $303 million, up $31 million year-over-year due to higher interest margins as a result of general account asset growth and lower expenses. Spreads remained stable for this segment.","Latin America reported operating earnings of $152 million, up $11 million year-over-year and 15% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were growth in Mexico and direct marketing in the region; higher net investment income, driven by growth in the general account; and a onetime tax-related benefit.","Moving to the top line. The Americas' PFOs were $8.3 billion in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year, primarily due to lower pension closeouts and structured settlements. Excluding closeouts and structured settlements, PFOs would be up 3% year-over-year.","The next segment, Asia, reported operating earnings of $259 million in the quarter, up $37 million or 17% year-over-year, due to premium growth in Japan and Korea, as well as higher net investment income, driven by asset growth and higher yields. PFOs for the region were up 7% or 9% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, Japan PFOs were up 9% due to an increase in life and A&H sales and improved persistency, while Korea's PFOs were up 11% due to higher fee income.","In the third segment, EMEA, operating earnings were $62 million in the quarter, down $3 million year-over-year. However, on a constant currency basis, operating earnings would have been up $10 million, driven by our acquisition in Turkey and Russian credit insurance. PFOs were down 10% year-over-year and flat on a constant currency basis. The Turkey acquisition benefited the top line, which is offset by weakness in Western Europe and Greece.","Finally, let me discuss our capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at September 30 totaled approximately $5.7 billion. This includes proceeds from the issuance of $750 million of 30-year senior debt, which was completed in August, which will be used to pay off maturing debt next year. I should note the balance sheet excludes the $1 billion of proceeds received in October from the remarketing and settlement of our common equity units. We also have $400 million of senior debt maturing in December, which we would expect to repay at that time.","Lastly, as we announced last week, we will be paying approximately $800 million in common dividends in December.","Our preliminary U.S. statutory after-tax operating earnings and U.S. statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the third quarter of 2012 was approximately $1.1 billion and $1 billion, respectively. For the 9 months of 2012, U.S. statutory after-tax operating earnings and statutory net income were approximately $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, in line with our full year expectations.","With that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","These variable annuities, still seeing very strong sales and net flows. I think a lot of investors would've preferred to see the pace of sales decelerate at a faster pace. Appreciate the comments that you made with regards to some of the steps that you're taking, but why not get significantly more aggressive in putting in place quotas, rate and prices over using guarantee rates? And then, second on Corporate Benefit Funding, one of your competitors are continuing to land large pension closeout transactions. I think a lot of us have been surprised that MET hasn't been a participant as well. So perhaps if you can explain to us why that's been the case. These deals are not hitting your hurdle rate, or are there other factors at play?","William J. Wheeler","Nigel, it's Bill Wheeler. Okay. With regard to the VA business, sales this quarter were $4.6 billion and that's probably a little misleading because we, as both Steve and John alluded to, we changed our pricing and adjusted some of our features this quarter and that resulted, I would say, in some many fire sales for lack of a better term. And so sales were a little inflated. We're -- our run rate in the fourth quarter is meaningfully below the $4.6 billion that we recorded in the third. And so we are seeing changes in that number, and that's why we're confident that we'll be at $18 billion. With regard to Corporate Benefit Funding or the closeouts, as we've talked about on a number of calls, we are seeing more large closeout activity and I expect that to continue, though the deals are lumpy and there won't necessarily be one every quarter. We are competing for that business, but we are being very disciplined about achieving our hurdle rates, something that we're doing across-the-board in all our businesses, and this is no different.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just had, first, some unsolicited feedback. I think your disclosure changes, I don't know any large company that changes its disclosure as often as you guys have done, and no one really lumps P&C products with the life insurance, so they're actually making it difficult to analyze the performance of some of your business and track them over time because these are long-term businesses. But when the disclosure changes every 3, 4 quarters, it's just hard to keep track of stuff. But the question that I have is on the international business. The results obviously have been moving around by division. Europe hasn't been that great; Asia has been strong, weak in other quarters. But maybe you could talk about how the ALICO business has done since the acquisition and where it's done better than maybe what you would have expected and where it might have not done as well. Because if you look at -- look back a year or so ago, the Asian business seems like it's actually the earnings are emerging a little bit weaker than I would have thought. And I have another question after that.","Steven A. Kandarian","Jimmy, it's Steve. ALICO is tracking what we expected. Obviously, there are some pluses and minuses country-by-country, but overall, the transaction has come in very much on plan, and we're still very encouraged about the prospects of those business long term. It's now given us exposure to markets that obviously we weren't in before that have significant growth associated with them. It increases significantly our exposure to the emerging markets. We've mentioned before that we're now up to about 14% of our profits from emerging markets, and we anticipate by 2016 that number will exceed 20% given its growth trajectory and our likelihood of doing at least some small transactions in those kinds of countries.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then another one just on interest rates. You mentioned, obviously, overall, you've -- in the past year, you've mentioned or you've expressed comfort that you can -- your results can hold up despite the rate environment. But as you indicated, corporate bond spreads coming in, new money yields probably dropping faster than you would have thought a few months ago. How much of this do you expect overall to be offset by your hedges? And if you could just give us some details on when the hedges begin to run off, is it more beginning in 2014, beginning in 2015? And then if rates do remain low, just your level of comfort with the rest of the goodwill on the balance sheet. I think it's around $10 billion, and some of that relates to businesses that are interest rate-sensitive as well.","John C. R. Hele","This is John. The -- as you can see, our spreads have held up well this year even though rates have been lower than, say, projected a year ago and that's -- you've seen the impact of the floors and the other hedges that are in place, and that's helping quite a bit this year and our spreads are -- have been maintained. So that's the good news. As you point out over time, those hedges will slowly wear off, and I think there have been various projections in the past last year that tried to project that out at a level of 2% treasury rate. And that -- those projections still stand. The impact of the other side's thinner corporate spreads, as well as other economic factors, we'll have to take into account going forward. And Steve can probably add a little more on how these wear off over time.","Steven Jeffrey Goulart","Jimmy, it's Steve Goulart. A couple of things. One, just on spreads, let me add one thing. Remember, spreads are basically at their long-term averages right now. Yes, they've tightened significantly over the course of the year, but that's from very, very wide levels. So we're not surprised at all at the levels of spreads, and we continue to practice good ALM around that. Regarding hedges, also think back to the presentations that we made earlier this year and even last year where we did show you the fact that our protection runs out for a number of years, in fact, even into the next decade. So we have a lot of protection in place, and certainly for the next several years, we're very well protected.","John C. R. Hele","Lastly, you had a question on goodwill. In the third quarter, we test all of our units with goodwill and applied the same logic and thinking that we applied to the retail annuity segment to the other segments that were also interest rate-sensitive. The most sensitive one of all, though, is the retail annuity segment and that's why the market value or the fair value was most affected by it, and the other units we still have some buffer on before we would have any issues there on the remaining $10 billion.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to pick up on the goodwill question or issue again. Can you give us a sense of sort of where you had been valuing the goodwill in terms of a multiple -- maybe multiple on book or something and kind of where you're valuing the business now? I just want to get a sense -- I know the write-down was $1.6 billion after tax, but I just want to get a sense of how you're thinking about the valuation of that business.","John C. R. Hele","Right. Well, we don't -- It's John, Suneet. We don't give out the details of this. But in reviewing the prior year's goodwill analysis, it was passing, but not by a large amount, so the price-to-book was just above from a fair value perspective, and now, it is below. And in a goodwill test, it's an assessment or trying to come with a fair value, meaning what would a -- this block or this business transact in the current environment between a willing seller and a willing buyer. It doesn't have to be a distressed price, and it doesn't have to be literally at that month or even in that quarter. But as you factor forward and think about it over the course of a year or 2 years, you have to take into account reasonable transaction prices. Given there haven't been any variable annuity blocks sold is another key factor that there's pressure on prices clearly, even though there perhaps have been some willing sellers. So you have to take all these into account and when we came up in really many different measures of it and ways of thinking about it, really, as if you were thinking of buying a block of business, people use different techniques to value businesses, including multiples, price-to-book multiples, price-to-earnings multiples, actual appraisals. We did all those and came up with a fair value that was less than our carrying value, and thus, the goodwill had to be written off.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. I mean, I guess, to follow up on that, if you're valuing the business below book value now, which is I think what you said, kind of getting back to what Nigel's line of questioning was, I mean, what does this say about your commitment to the variable annuity business and your willingness to put more capital in the business for growth when clearly the valuation of that business is not being recognized by the market?","John C. R. Hele","Well, this is John again. Let me just stress that the goodwill test is a market view. It's a fair value and it's what we believe if we tried to sell that business today, that you would be able to transact in the business today. That can be different from our long-term assumptions and how we see value over a longer period of time. There are 2 different tests. They're somewhat related. You have to make sense between the 2, but markets can over and under price true value, which is, I guess, why we all buy stocks.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then just on capital management, I realize that there's not a whole lot you can say on that, but the converts that, I guess, converted earlier this quarter, in the fourth quarter, I think there was an expectation at some point that you'd be able to repurchase those or offset that dilution. I just want to clarify, I'm assuming that, that potential is essentially the same as normal share repurchases, so we should think about your not being able to offset that dilution unless you get out of bank holding company status and get permission from the Fed. Is that a fair read?","John C. R. Hele","This is John. Until we have clarification on the future as a bank and the future being a non-bank or debanking and the future of a non-bank SIFI as well as what the rules would be under that, we can't give any guidance on capital.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Two questions, if you will. So following this goodwill impairment, how much equity are you now allocating to the annuity segment, and more specifically, to the VA business?","John C. R. Hele","We don't give out equity by business line.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the second question is one more for Steve. A few months ago, I think most insurance executives, including yourselves, were getting perhaps more hopeful, if I can characterize it that way, that Fed officials and other key folks in Washington were recognizing some of these key differences between insurance companies and banks, and thus, it was looking like the stress testing for insurance companies, SIFIs might be under a different methodology than what's been applied to banks and what's been applied to you as a bank holding company. Steve, just do you have any incremental thoughts as a couple of months have passed or on any sort of more recent observations that you can share around that?","Steven A. Kandarian","John, no, I think really not a lot has changed since that point in time when I made those statements. Treasury and Fed officials have said in different settings, both in speeches and before congressional hearings, that they plan to acknowledge the difference in the business models between banks on one hand and other industries that might become non-bank SIFIs under their supervision. So those words were encouraging. But as we've mentioned, the rules have not been written. There is a draft out there. Comments have been provided back to the Fed. We provided comments, others have as well. And until this clarification around what those actual rules will be, it's very difficult to provide any sort of clarity to you and others. So we're really just standing by, waiting, monitoring. We're in discussions, where appropriate, with federal officials, but we certainly have to wait and see where all this comes out, both as to whether we become a non-bank SIFI once we dispose of our bank and debank as a holding company and then what kinds of prudential rules they put in place to regulate non-bank SIFIs should we become one.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. If I can sneak one more in, just thinking about Asia, following up maybe a little bit on Jimmy's question. On a year-to-date basis, if I sort of take those results and annualize them, it looks like Asia, overall, is tracking about 5% or more below your original guidance for 2012 for that segment, at least from an earnings perspective. Just curious as to what areas of pressure you might be seeing relative to what you were expecting and whether you expect that pressure to dissipate as you look forward.","Christopher Townsend","It's Chris Townsend here. If you look at the overall operating earnings for the quarter, we're 17% up year-on-year. You break that down to the key components, which obviously are driven by Japan and Korea. Japan's up 14% and Korea's up 52%. So Japan's performed strongly in terms of PFO growth, expense control, and Korea's up in terms of equity markets and higher surrender value. If you look at it sequentially, which is, I guess, where you're going with this, there's 2 key issues which have impacted the earnings this quarter. One is some beneficial VII that came forward in the prior quarter. And secondly, there's a number of items which are really a true-up of lapse assumptions and expense items for Japan and Hong Kong, which have impacted this quarter, which are one-off issues.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. So as we look out to the full year, I guess the question is, how do you expect the results to fare versus that original guidance? And do we just have to expect that there's a new baseline that's perhaps a little bit lower despite the strong year-over-year growth in Japan and Korea?","Christopher Townsend","Yes, I think you need to look at the broader picture. The PFO growth is very strong across the region, we're up 7%; in Japan, we're up 9%; in Korea, we're up 11%. And some of the other factors are quite beneficial for us, particularly in terms of persistency. We're up 1.5 points to 89.5 in Japan, which is a consistency, which we articulated to you at the Investor Day in Tokyo.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I have a couple of follow-ups. First, on goodwill, just to hit that from one different angle, you mentioned in the comments that buyers may have to discount using kind of a captive or an offshore structure, and I just wanted to clarify why that would be the case. Is that due to kind of regulatory concerns that are emerging around VA runoffs?","John C. R. Hele","Randy, this is John. There are various -- some states have launched investigations and are reviewing captives. Although there's been no conclusions or points of view on this yet, we think buyers would be more cautious. Historically, some transactions we know were viewed being optimizing fully the offshore structure and others take a range. We, at MET, we do use an offshore captive, but we allocate economic capital fully against all the risks in the company. So we run at, I would say, on a conservative basis. Other buyers may take different views. And we think with these investigations underway, that buyers would be more cautious now in terms of valuing these types of businesses.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, so it's more of the kind of a captive review. It's not necessarily kind of regulatory concerns about the insolvency fund being on the hook or something like that?","John C. R. Hele","No, not at all.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, and then if I could, just a follow-up on the pension closeout conversation. You mentioned that some of these large blocks that have gone -- have not met your hurdle rate objective, I guess, my question is if you could clarify for us what that hurdle rate objective is and if it may be subject to change given your low-for-long rate outlook.","William J. Wheeler","Don't put words into my mouth, Randy. I didn't say -- I said we competed for that business and we have pricing discipline about, and obviously, we didn't win those closeouts, but that's the way it goes. I think there'll be more. In terms of our pricing objectives, and I think we actually talked about this on the last earnings call, we view our cost of capital today domestically as 12%. So that's our hurdle -- minimum hurdle rate. So if we don't beat 12%, we're not adding any economic value at all. We generally are trying to price business with a target of a 15% return. And you have to remember, a lot of these liabilities are going to be around for a very long time and it's important that we -- if you price it poorly, you're stuck with that for a long time. You don't get an opportunity to change the numbers a couple years from now. So that's why we're maintaining our discipline here.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Do you think as we look at these deals from the outside, is there a good rule of thumb we can think of about like the capital you would allocate to a book as a percentage of assets and liabilities? I mean, generally, and I think annuity books are kind of like 5%. I mean, is that how we should look at the capital allocation to try and get to those returns?","William J. Wheeler","It's tricky. I guess I'd hesitate to give you a rule of thumb because what we've seen already is that the mortality differences between these various blocks that have -- had transacted are quite material. You think -- you would guess sort of they're generally retirees so they would be the same, but they're not. The mortality differences were quite different, so -- and that has a pretty big impact on whether or not what the capital allocation would be. So I guess I would hesitate to give you a rule of thumb.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein from Evercore.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Actually, my first question is a follow-up for a comment or question that Suneet had. And I guess I'm just curious, back to the annuity business, the original intent behind the sales target for the year of, call it, $18 billion was to be capital-neutral in terms of the statutory capital that was allocated, at least that's my understanding. And I guess I'm just kind of curious, you've had a few quarters since that was put out, you've had some market movements. Equities up, rates volatile. Is that, in fact, holding out, or are you continuing to add capital to the annuity business?","William J. Wheeler","This is Bill. I think rate-neutral is still a fair assumption here or capital-neutral. Obviously, the business is performing better than planned, mainly because of the market environment and our sales targets are basically where they -- we expected them to be, so -- but I think neutral is still a good term for this. Just if you pull back a minute, obviously, with this low interest rate environment, the VA business, especially the in-force block, is not performing terribly well with regard to the exposure to interest rates and such. On our new sales, our new sales this quarter had a 14% ROI, and that's with a full economic capital allocation using today's environment. So we view that as pretty attractive business, and so we're being tough-minded about annuities and making sure that our risk exposure there doesn't grow too much relative to MetLife overall. But this business is profitable for us. And certainly, today's sales are profitable. And this is a consumer need, which is isn't going to go away and is a part of all our customers' financial planning as they deal with retirement. And so this is a business we like. We can't let it get too big relative to the size of MetLife. I mean, I think that's why you see the big pullback.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then, I guess, still a few. On Latin America, constant currency growth may be a little bit late. I think there may been a group case that was lost. But could you just talk a little bit about the growth outlook in Latin America and what expectations you would have for that?","William J. Wheeler","Yes, so Latin America on the surface looks like it had a pretty weak top line quarter. But of course, we did elude to the fact that sales growth was actually very good this quarter, it was up 28%, and we're seeing very strong sales. Interestingly, the strongest area of growth is in direct marketing in Latin America, and that's in a number of different countries. So top line is actually good. The premiums fees and other income this quarter are -- certainly, the currency adjustments hurt us and there were -- as you alluded to, there were a number of sort of anomalous factors. There were some group cases that didn't renew where the revenue was probably more important than the -- it was more impactful than the profits were. We had a reinsurance adjustment, which affected the top line, but didn't have a bottom line impact. So I view Latin America top line growth when you kind of parse through all that is something like 6%. That's probably a little bit -- year-over-year. That's probably still a little slower than normal. I would think -- I think of Latin America, in total, of being sort of a high single-digit revenue grower. We've certainly hit 10% in certain quarters. We probably average to something like 8% or 9%, and that would be my long-term outlook.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Smith from Scotia Capital.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","So I want to go back to something that was stated at the ACLI's conference last week, and that was with respect to the non-bank SIFI rules that have yet to be written, there was a presentation where somebody characterized separate accounting assets as general account assets waiting to happen and that the capital ratios that some of these life insurance companies are putting up are not necessarily truly reflective of the real capital status of those companies. And I was wondering if you could comment on that and how, in your discussions with the Fed, they are talking to you about separate account assets.","John C. R. Hele","Joanne, this is John Hele. There are many discussions, of course, and submissions going on to the regulators about the future rules for non-bank SIFIs. We're participating in that as is the ACLI and other people in the industry. But as of right now, we can give no feedback or guidance on where these will end up.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","I guess, just in terms of the comment that was made about separate account assets being general account assets waiting to happen, how do you respond to something like that?","John C. R. Hele","I wasn't there and don't have the context for all those points. The bank rules, if you strictly apply bank rules today, separate accounts are included as general accounts. We are saying they should be excluded because it makes sense from a legal structure as an insurance company. It's quite a different framework from the banking frameworks and the legal structures of banks. And that's a key point that we are making continually to the regulators, and we'll have to see where all this ends up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","My first question -- I have 2. My first question is probably best directed to Bill Wheeler. Bill, why are these pension closeouts taking now -- taking place now? The reason I ask is that some plans have been underfunded for a while. The supposed new accounting rules that create all this volatility on balance sheets and income statements, I don't think are new, they're 3 years old. The Pension Protection Act, which makes it harder for companies to maintain underfundedness, was passed 7 years ago. So why now on these pension closeouts, especially given the extremely low level of interest rates, which, I believe, will act as an impediment to them?","William J. Wheeler","That's a great question, Eric. We -- if you remember, and I know you do, we've been a big -- talking about large pension closeout opportunities for a long time, and of course, nothing happened until very recently. And in talking to the treasurers of companies who have these large pensions, one, they're not being -- in most cases, they're obviously not being used as a benefit anymore. Their pensions are closed and the blocks that have been closed out are on retirees, in any case. so I think what's going on is even if -- I think companies have said, you know what, I can't wait any longer for interest rates to improve. By the way, I have a very large pension obligation here. I can just start closing out pieces of it and maybe average into better interest rates over time. I also think they recognize that being a first mover here is probably a good thing. There is not an unlimited amount of capital today that's available to support pension closeout business, and I think those who feel like they go early are probably going to get better deals than those who go late. And who knows how that will play out. But I know that's the sentiment out there. So you're right. In some cases, you would think that this would not be an ideal time, but I think what's happening is companies have decided they just can't wait any longer and they should get going.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And with respect to the goodwill write-off or, I guess, it's not a write-down. You've written off, I believe, please correct me if I make an error here, 100% of the goodwill assigned to the retail annuity business. Why is the stock market entering into this in the sense that the stock market is -- the reason I asked the question again is that the stock market has pretty much recovered to its pre-crisis peak or is close to it. We've got a good year. Why is the current level of the stock market -- or maybe it had to do with when we've come to where we are. Why has that depressed the value of the business?","John C. R. Hele","Eric, this is John. Yes, the stock market's back up, so the equity returns, say, in the variable annuity business within the retail annuity business, overall, has recovered. When we speak of the market impact, we're speaking of how buyers view, if you had a pure annuity company, a retail annuity company traded on the stock exchange, what price to book would that be trading at today. So it's the valuations that -- of retail annuity business that would have to purchase that business. So when I refer to the market environment, I'm referring to, call it, the high betas or the low price-to-books -- lower historical price-to-books that people have today and have been here for some time on these type of business.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of John Hall from Wells Fargo.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And I guess since Ed's probably not going to ask a question, I might just ask a fill in about the risk-based capital for him. Could you give that out, John, please?","John C. R. Hele","John, I have to tell you that the risk-based capital calculations MET does annually, and we'll be giving that in our December forecast.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, great. For Steve Goulart, the Baa assets have been moving up progressively in the fixed maturities portfolio over the course of the year. Is that because of an allocation in that direction or are you just -- or is that a result of credit changes?","Steven Jeffrey Goulart","No, that's our own action as we've looked at portfolio opportunities in this market, and we have modestly increased our BBBs. We think that's a good place to gain extra yield and still be comfortable with credit.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, great. And then just lastly, Steve Kandarian, you mentioned in your comments at the outset the agreement that you have with Walmart. And it's an intriguing, I guess, venture. Could you just describe a little bit more about what you're doing there and perhaps the cost that might be associated with that? I mean, how are you going to be accessing the Walmart customer?","Steven A. Kandarian","John, as you mentioned, it's a pilot program, so it's early days. There isn't a great deal of capital associated with it at this point in time, but that obviously could grow over time as sales increase. And I really don't have much to mention at this point in time from a financial perspective because it is very much in its incipient stage. I think the most important thing here is that MetLife is going to innovate. MetLife's going to find new ways to get to market and provide these kinds of products to our customers. And we know there's a tremendous need by people in the United States to get greater coverage and protection from life insurance products. But perhaps we, as an industry, haven't made it easy enough historically for them to complete a sale, and this is one of the ways we are looking to increase participation rates out there in the public in the arena of life insurance.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess, what I'm asking is, is this a direct effort off of their website? Is this a kiosk in the store that's automated? Is this a person who works for MET standing there selling policies? I mean, what's the access point?","Steven A. Kandarian","It's in the store. It's more of a kiosk sort of environment. You walk in there, you'll see displays with basically like a card on there that you can go when you check out at the counter. It's prepaid, and then there are a few questions that they answer and phone calls to be made by the customer to activate the life insurance. John, we'll walk you through one if you like. We'll go with you.","John McCallion","Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And if you have any follow-up questions, feel free to give us a call in the Investor Relations, and Ed Spehar will be able to answer all your questions.

We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings press release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.","Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia.","Before we begin, I'd like to highlight that we will be including additional disclosures in our 2012 10-K on our variable annuity business and the sensitivity of earnings to a sustained low interest rate environment.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.","Steven A. Kandarian","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone.","We are pleased to report fourth quarter 2012 operating earnings of $1.4 billion, up 10% over the fourth quarter of 2011. Operating earnings per share were $1.25, above the guidance range of $1.12 to $1.22 provided on the December 2012 guidance call, and 7% over the fourth quarter of 2011. For the full year 2012, we reported operating earnings per share of $5.28, up 21% (sic) [22%] from 2011, and an operating return on equity of 11.3%.","We are very pleased with these results given the challenging macroeconomic environment.","John Hele will discuss our financial results in detail. I would like to highlight a few items.","First, despite growing pressure in the U.S. from low interest rates, our investment spread margins were up in 3 of our 4 U.S. business lines. The strength of our investment spread margins reflects our prudent asset liability management and the benefits of our interest rate hedge program. We continue to manage the risks of low interest rates and take actions as appropriate.","Second, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined at our May Investor Day. One of our cornerstone initiatives is to refocus the U.S. Business, which includes shifting our business mix away from market-sensitive, capital-intensive products to our protection-oriented, lower-risk products. On February 4, we introduced a new living benefit variable annuity product, GMIB Max V, to replace GMIB Max IV, which is no longer being sold. The biggest change between the 2 products is a reduction in the rollup rate from 5% to 4%. We believe that the new product will improve the risk profile of our VA sales and generate a higher expected return on economic capital. These changes are important components of our plan to reduce U.S. variable annuity sales from $17.7 billion in 2012 to $10 billion to $11 billion in 2013.","Consistent with our strategy to grow emerging markets, another significant development is our agreement to acquire AFP Provida, the largest pension provider in Chile, from BBVA, for $2 billion in cash. MetLife is the #1 life insurer in Chile, and the Provida deal will further strengthen our market position.","Employees in Chile are required to contribute a fixed percentage of their salaries to a mandatory pension system. Pension companies such as Provida charge an administrative fee on contributions, not assets under management. As a result, fee income does not fluctuate with market changes. Provida is the #1 player in the market, with a 29% market share. With this acquisition, MetLife's operating earnings from emerging markets are expected to grow from 14% today to approximately 17%, which brings us closer to our 2016 target of at least 20%. Also, as a fee-based business, Provida is consistent with our strategy of increasing our earnings from low capital intensity product offerings.","In addition to being an excellent strategic fit, the Provida acquisition is very attractive on a financial basis. As I've said before, we strive to strike the right balance between growth, profitability and risk. We are acquiring Provida for approximately 10x projected forward earnings of roughly $200 million and anticipate that the transaction will be accretive to operating earnings by approximately $0.05 per share in 2013 and $0.15 per share in 2014. While accretion from a cash acquisition is one metric to consider, it does not necessarily determine if the transaction creates shareholder value. Therefore, we modeled the long-term EPS impact to Provida assuming we financed the transaction using a mixture of 75% equity and 25% debt. On this basis, we forecast that the transaction will be essentially neutral for EPS during the first few years and then become accretive. This analysis gives us comfort that the return on this transaction is likely to exceed our weighted average cost of capital. In addition, I have also discussed our goal of improving the free cash flow generation of our businesses. We estimate that approximately 70% of Provida's earnings will result in free cash flow available to our holding companies.","I think the merits of this transaction are clear. It's important to note that the current regulatory restriction on our ability to repurchase shares was not the motivation to acquire Provida. We are doing this deal because it makes strategic and financial sense for our shareholders.","I want to close my prepared remarks with a few comments on the regulatory environment. We are pleased that our de-banking process has progressed with the closing of the sale of MetLife Bank to GE Capital Retail Bank, and we look forward to no longer being a bank holding company. However, even after the de-banking process is complete, substantial uncertainty will likely remain on the regulatory front as we face the possibility of being named a nonbank systemically important financial institution, or SIFI. I'm -- as we have said in the past, we do not believe that our company poses systemic risk to the financial system, and we will continue to make that case to policymakers. However, if MetLife is deemed to be systemically important, it is imperative that the final prudential rules be tailored to the life insurance business model, which differs dramatically from that of banks.","While it is our strong desire to return capital to shareholders, we will need to assess the regulatory environment before finalizing any share buyback program. The assumption of no share repurchases in our 2013 guidance reflects this regulatory uncertainty. We were asked on our December guidance call about our confidence in the share buyback assumption built into our plan through 2016. As I stated on the call, I am not completely confident that we can do all of the assumed $8 billion of gross share repurchases to -- through 2016, since it is dependent on the -- on external factors that are beyond our control.","During our May 2012 Investor Day, we provided our goal of achieving an ROE of between 12% and 14% by 2016. I want to provide some guidance on the sensitivity to this range of share repurchases. If we were to assume no share buybacks through year-end 2016, our estimated operating ROE target range for 2016 would be approximately 100 basis points lower than it is today, all other assumptions held constant. Although we cannot predict what the future holds in terms of regulation and interest rates, we will continue to execute on our strategy and strike the right balance between growth, profitability and risk.","Finally, I want to assure you that our 64,000 employees around the world are working hard to deliver on our promises to our customers and to create value for our shareholders. I am confident we will succeed.","With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?","John C. R. Hele","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover our fourth quarter results, including a discussion on insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I'll give you some color on the interest rate disclosure Ed referenced and then conclude with some comments on our cash and capital.","To begin, MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.25 per share, up 10% over the fourth quarter of 2011. This quarter included a few notable items, which I highlighted during the -- our December guidance call. These 4 items dampened operating earnings by a net $13 million or $0.01 per share, better than the net $0.07 estimated in December. Let me give you some detail on the 4 items.","The first was in our P&C business. Higher-than-budgeted catastrophe losses of $70 million after tax, primarily due to Superstorm Sandy, were partially offset by a favorable prior year reserve development of $13 million after tax. The net impact was $0.05 per share. The gross loss due to Sandy was approximately $150 million. Adjusting for reinsurance recoveries and taxes, the impact to operating earnings was $90 million. Both the gross and net loss were within the estimated ranges provided in December.","The second notable item resulted from our annual assumption review. The portion related to operating earnings was a net unfavorable $13 million after tax, or $0.01 per share. In December, we'd estimated the assumption review would reduce operating earnings by $0.05 per share. We had a net positive of $37 million from DAC unlocking and reserve changes. The favorable unlocking related to our lower lapse assumption for VA was partially offset by negative unlocking for reductions in our general account and separate account return assumptions. Also included is a onetime $50 million after-tax write-down in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits of an intangible asset, representing the value of customer relationships acquired, otherwise known as VOCRA, related to a small acquisition of a dental business in 2008. I will provide an update of the below-the-line components of the assumption review in a few moments.","The third notable item was $23 million or $0.02 per share of reorganization costs.","Finally, pretax variable investment income was $376 million, reflecting strong private equity returns. After taxes and the impact of DAC, variable investment income was $242 million, which was $80 million or $0.07 per share above the top end of our 2012 quarterly guidance range. It's also $0.02 per share better than our estimated -- than our estimate provided in December.","Turning to our bottom line results. Fourth quarter net income was $96 million or $0.09 per share and included net derivative losses of $855 million after tax. The net derivative loss in the quarter was primarily due to the mark-to-market impact of our VA program, including the update to our lapse assumptions of $342 million after tax. Additionally, the tightening of Met's own credit spreads during the quarter and the rise in long-term rates, also contributed to the net derivative loss. The net derivative loss was higher than we had estimated in December, but this is a difficult item to forecast, as it is highly sensitive to capital market movements. As a reminder, most of this impact is noneconomic, as a large portion of the liabilities that are being hedged are at essentially book value.","The total impact on net income for the DAC and other assumption review was $752 million after tax, which was within the $600 million to $800 million range provided in December. Most of the charge, or $739 million, was outside of operating earnings. As noted in our December call, the charge relates primarily to changes in VA policyholder behavior lapse assumptions as well as general and separate account return assumptions for fixed income investments.","Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $46.73 at year end, below our December estimate, largely due to the higher derivative losses and essentially flat year-over-year. Operating ROE was 11.3% in 2012, up 120 basis points from 10.1% in 2011 and better than our 2012 plan of 10% to 10.6%.","Turning now to margins. Underwriting was mixed but generally unfavorable this quarter. The mortality ratio in retail life was elevated at 99% due to unfavorable experience in both V and UL and traditional life. This result was higher than the target range of 85% to 90% and worse than the 81.1% ratio in the fourth quarter of 2011. The mortality ratio in group life was 84.6% in the quarter, slightly favorable to the prior year quarter of 85.2% and below the target range of 85% to 90%. Excluding a positive reserve adjustment, group life mortality was in the middle of our target range. Group health morbidity experience was unfavorable in the quarter, and I will provide some more detail on this line shortly.","As you heard from Steve, investment spreads remained strong in 2012. In the fourth quarter, our investment spreads increased year-over-year and sequentially in Corporate Benefit Funding, annuities and retail life and were down only modestly from the sequential quarter in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits.","You can see in our QFS that the spreads in the U.S. Business increased in 2012. While variable investment income was strong last year, our spreads, excluding VII, were mostly higher as well. Spreads excluding variable investment income are not evident from our QFS, so let me provide some detail.","Deferred annuities was 284 basis points for the full year of 2012 versus 258 basis points in 2011. Variable and universal life was 167 versus 105. Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits was 237 versus 250. Finally, Corporate Benefit Funding was 112 versus 105. While we expect investment spreads will decline in 2013, the resilience of our investment margins in 2012 illustrates that this is a manageable risk factor.","As Ed referenced earlier, there will be a new disclosure in our 10-K on the anticipated impact of sustained low interest rates on our financial results. The low rate scenario in the 10-K is based on 1.69% 10-year Treasury yield for 2013 and 2014. This scenario contrasts with our plan, which assumes that 10-year Treasury gradually rises to 2.38% by the end of 2013 and then remains flat through the end of 2014. The difference between the 10-K scenario and our plan translates to an estimated negative impact on operating earnings of approximately $45 million in 2013 and approximately $150 million in 2014. The results for the 2013 low rate scenario are consistent with the guidance we provided on our December call, and the new disclosure on 2014 highlights the relatively small incremental impact on earnings next year if rates remain low.","Turning to expenses. The operating expense ratio was 22.4% for the fourth quarter and 23.8% for the full year of 2012. This was better than our plan of 23.9% to 24.5% and our estimate in December. Excluding the impact of pension and post-retirement benefits and close-outs, the operating expense ratio was 24.5% for the fourth quarter and 24.1% for the full year of 2012. This compares to the fourth quarter and full year of 2011 of 24.6% and 24.1%, respectively.","I will now discuss some of the business highlights in the quarter. Rather than go through every segment, I want to focus on areas where our results may differ from your expectations. Therefore, my comments will be on, number one, retail annuities; two, Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits; and number three, Asia.","Retail annuities had operating earnings of $462 million, an increase of $253 million from the prior year quarter. Normalized earnings were 200 -- were $320 million in the fourth quarter after adjusting for a positive DAC unlocking of $133 million from our annual assumption review and variable investment income that was $9 million above plan. On a normalized basis, retail annuities earnings were up 30% versus the fourth quarter of 2011 due to growth in the business, interest on economic capital, lower DAC amortization and lower operating expenses. Higher interest on economic capital reflects the increased amount of capital we're allocating to this business line.","Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits reported operating earnings of $167 million, down 30% year-over-year. After adjusting for above-plan catastrophe experience of $33 million, the VOCRA write-down of $50 million and $36 million of other favorable items, normalized operating earnings were $214 million, down 11% versus the prior year. The decline on a normalized basis was primarily due to an elevated group health benefit ratio of 91.6%, which was 89.7% in the prior year quarter, and the targeted range of 86% to 90%. The primary drivers of the higher ratio were long-term disability and long-term care.","In disability, we saw higher average reserves on new claims and lower net closures, partially offset by lower claim incidents. In long-term care, the benefit ratio was above plan due to higher average reserves and new claims, lower net closures and reserve adjustments. Although long-term care earnings are under pressure, we believe this suggests only a couple of pennies risk to our 2013 EPS guidance. While the group health benefit ratio was elevated for the quarter, the full year 2012 ratio was 88.6% and within our plan range.","With regard to statutory results, we completed our asset adequacy testing for 2012 and we will have no reserve strengthening in long-term care. New York requires us to have a segregated account for long-term care, with stand-alone cash flow testing. This is a more stringent approach relative to other states and should provide comfort to our investors regarding the balance sheet for this business.","Turning to Asia. Operating earnings of $198 million in the quarter were down 24% year-over-year. Asia had negative DAC unlockings of $62 million, higher than we had estimated in December, primarily due to changes in long-term lapse assumptions in Japan. Adjusting for this, normalized operating earnings were $260 million, down 1% year-over-year.","I know analysts and investors have concerns regarding the recent earnings for Asia. The current environment for the region, most notably in Japan, has some challenges. Since we developed our 2013 plan, the yen has weakened materially and interest rates are lower than we had anticipated. Based on those 2 factors, our current operating earnings expectation for Asia will be close to the low end of our 2013 guidance range.","Specifically with regard to currency, we have hedges on our 2013 projected yen-exposed operating earnings at strike prices above JPY 90 to the U.S. dollar. These hedges are currency options which provide protection against the yen weakening above JPY 90 but allow us to participate in the upside should the yen strengthen. However, we are unhedged for the yen between JPY 90 and our average plan rate of approximately JPY 82. It is worth noting that we remain disciplined in Japan.","There are more questions today on the profitability of various products and distribution channels in Japan, with concerns relating to savings products and the bank channel. In the fourth quarter, our total Japan sales were down 1% and this was driven by a 34% decline in our bank channel sales. Our decline in the bank channel resulted from a conscious effort to maintain margins.","Finally, let me discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.7 billion at year end, slightly above our guidance call estimate due to the timing of certain cash flows. We plan to use $2 billion from our existing cash and liquid assets at the holding companies to fund the Provida acquisition, which is not contemplated in our guidance call outlook for 2013.","Moving to our capital position. While we have not completed our risk-based capital calculations for 2012, we estimate our RBC ratio will be in the 450% to 475% range, which is above the 425% to 450% range we provided on our December guidance call. We estimate that our Japan solvency margin ratio will be at the high end of our guidance range of 800% to 900%.","Our preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the fourth quarter of 2012 were approximately $1.5 billion and a loss of approximately $200 million, respectively. Fourth quarter operating earnings benefited from a favorable market, while the net loss resulted from a new statutory accounting treatment for certain partnerships and joint ventures. This accounting change caused a shift from an unrealized loss to a realized loss and was neutral for capital and surplus.","For the full year 2012, statutory operating earnings were approximately $4.4 billion and statutory net income was approximately $2.8 billion. Our total adjusted capital is expected to be approximately $29 billion as of December '12, up 5% compared to the prior year. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first, from the line of Jeff Schuman with KBW.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I just wonder if you can give a little bit more color about the international growth outlook. If we look at the fourth quarter or 2012 as a whole, I think Latin America premium growth was pretty modest relative to your normalized expectations, and yet I think you forecasted pretty big acceleration in 2013. I just wonder if you can remind us why that is. And I guess, if you could touch on Asia a little bit. But even before the recent devaluation, your outlook there was, I think, for premium growth to decelerate quite significantly relative to what we've seen recently. And so maybe you can remind us kind of what the factors are there, please.","William J. Wheeler","Jeff, it's Bill Wheeler. I'll talk about Latin America. The -- so revenue growth on a constant currency basis was about 4%. We are forecasting, I guess, on a constant currency basis too, 10% for next year. We had very good sales volumes. Our sales volumes in Latin America were up to 26% year-over-year. What held back the overall PFO growth rate was there's a couple of group cases that we have lost, one in Mexico, one in Chile, that are large. They weren't terribly profitable. And so that's affected our top line growth. Now we've -- I think we've said this before on other calls, especially in the third quarter, the comparison, especially the one in Mexico, we lost at the beginning of this year. So that comparison will go away next year. And Latin America, except for noise like these group cases, is I think more like a 10% grower.","John C. R. Hele","And with regard to Asia -- this is John. With -- our bank channel was down, which has a large premium -- these are joint [ph] single premium products, so it's quite an impact when you look at the premiums. But we're seeing growth in the independent agency channels and other areas across Asia. So we're pleased that we're remaining disciplined as we grow all of our channels.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Finkelstein with Evercore Partners.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions on Provida. Should we assume that the 70% of GAAP earnings, which I think you characterized as $200 million, would you expect that to be fully dividended to the holding company?","John C. R. Hele","We expect that to be a good distribution. It may go to the international holding companies because it's in the international operations, but we expect that to be available.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a few quick questions. The -- I think you characterized the returns on this as at least equal to your weighted average cost of capital. I mean, how should we think about the IRRs on this trade? I mean, I would assume it would be above your weighted average cost of capital. Should we look at this, given growth, et cetera, as low-teens, mid-teens, high-teens? How did you -- what's the IRR that you're projecting on this?","John C. R. Hele","We're looking at this as a mid-teen return. And we think, given -- that's a good return given the Chilean economy and environment. It's one of the best places to be investing in, if you call it an emerging market. It's a very stable government and economy. So we're very pleased with that type of return.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just -- I guess, just going back to the comment about -- that Steve made on buybacks and an impact going out to 2016 if there were 0 buybacks. Obviously, the difference between 0 and $8 billion is a very wide range. And I think it's helpful to frame out kind of what I would hope to be kind of a downside scenario, but is there any feel for how we should be thinking about or moderating capital deployment expectations out to 2016? I mean, is that -- I assume the answer isn't 0, but is there any feeling for maybe what management is kind of thinking about as a reasonable range?","Steven A. Kandarian","I can't give you a lot of guidance at this very moment. As things unfold here in the coming months, I think we'll be able to provide more clarity, but we're still doing our analysis. We're still trying to understand the regulatory environment and what the capital rules may be, going forward, for us. So unfortunately, I can't give you more than that.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one final question, if I may. With the Provida acquisition and the free cash flow generated from that, is there any change in your view on the deleveraging that you're expecting it -- as part of your capital model looking out to '13?","John C. R. Hele","No, not really. I mean, Provida will close sometime later on this year, so -- and it's uncertain when that might close, so it's hard to predict exactly the cash and earnings impact it would have in 2013.","Operator","The next question is from Ryan Krueger with Dowling & Partners.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","First question was, could you just remind us of your operating EPS sensitivity to the equity market? Because I think that the market is probably running 4% or 5% better than in your original assumption at this point.","John C. R. Hele","For about 1% change in the S&P 500, it's about $0.01.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","$0.01, annually?","John C. R. Hele","In our EPS?","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Yes.","John C. R. Hele","Off of EPS, yes.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Yes, okay. And then back to the group nonmedical health business. When you gave the 2013 outlook, did -- were you fully -- did you kind of have all the information on the fourth quarter and some of the weakness that occurred in -- was that factored into the outlook for '13?","John C. R. Hele","Well, in terms of the group, the full year was within our targeted range, so we still believe our targeted range is appropriate for 2013.","Operator","Our next question is from Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First question is just on the long-term ROE target without buyback, the 11% to 13%. I guess I'm pleasantly surprised that that's up from what you're doing -- what you did in 2012 at the midpoint. So 2 questions on that. First, what is the interest rate environment that's predicated in that 11% to 13%? And then second, in terms of the $8 billion of capital that you would not be buying back in this scenario, what is the return that you're getting -- or the assumption for the return that you're getting on that capital?","John C. R. Hele","With regard to the first question, I think that we've said that should rates remain generally flat, we expect to be at the lower end of that 12% to 14% with the buybacks. And now without the buybacks, the 11% to 13% range, we'll be at the low end of that range. And could you say your second question again? I didn't get that.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just on the $8 billion of capital that you would not be using for share buybacks, what's the return assumption in this scenario? Or how is that capital being used?","John C. R. Hele","That's in a series of investments, so it would be high-quality liquid investments...","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","But it's like a bond return, as opposed to, like, a...","John C. R. Hele","Yes, yes, shorter-term bond returns.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, the other question, on the VA DAC. I think at the guidance -- on the guidance conference call, you characterized half of the roughly $700 million impact being related to a change in your fixed income return assumption, your separate account growth model from, I think it was like, 7.5% to 7.25%. So I guess, first is that accurate? And then second, how does that return compare to your assumption for equity? And then I guess, related to that, if that 7.25% maybe has to come down again because interest rates are rising and bond returns are falling, could we be looking at another sizable DAC hit at some point down the road?","John C. R. Hele","So of the total charge, about 1\/2 was lapsed; and 1\/4, returns; and 1\/4 for other. And with regard to the -- that's a separate account assumption, which is a blended assumption, which is an equity bond assumption weighting. But people also have the opportunity to switch to a general account if bonds rise, so if interest rates rise and bond funds go down. So we're comfortable with this return.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, on the comments that you made, John, about the year-end stat net income versus operating income, does any of that change the cash flow roll-forward that you guys provided to us in terms of your outlook? The $3 billion to $3.5 billion of subsidiary dividends, is that still in place? Or is this affected somehow by that net income loss?","John C. R. Hele","No, this is within our range that we had expected.","Operator","Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I had a few questions, first on the Latin American business. The reported earnings seem close to the level that they've been in recent quarters. You didn't call anything out, but it seems like there's a tax benefit, because on a pretax basis, the earnings are a lot weaker than they've been in recent quarters. And then for Steve, could you just discuss how ALICO is tracking versus your initial assumptions? Because if you look at Asia earnings, they've been weaker than expected the last few quarters. You ended up taking a reserve charge this quarter as well. And then finally, on just your capital deployment philosophy. Assuming that you are able to de-register as a bank holding company, would you want to wait for SIFI guidance before you do something with the dividend or buybacks? Or could one -- or could you raise the dividend even before the SIFI guidance comes out? How would you view that if you -- assuming that you are able to de-register as a bank holding company over the next few months?","John C. R. Hele","Yes, I hope we got all these questions, Jimmy. On the Latin American business, there was an $18 million tax benefit. It's in Latin America, but it's offset in corporate, so it's not a total change to our normalized earnings. If you could repeat the second question.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The second, just views on, like, how the ALICO business is tracking versus initial assumptions, given the weakness in Asia earnings recently.","Steven A. Kandarian","So overall, ALICO is tracking well. There's ups and downs and there's some of the markets that we're in with ALICO that are tracking a little bit below our expectations, some of the markets were above. So overall, the ALICO transaction is still very much on target for what we assumed going into the transaction. We're very happy that we did the deal and think it's a very attractive transaction on many bases, strategic as well as financial. In terms of our dividend, Jimmy, I -- it's the same issue that we have around share buybacks. We're going to assess all these factors, regulatory factors. We're going to talk our board, obviously, and get board approval before we make any changes on our dividends. So that still is to come.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just following up on Latin America. The -- on a pretax basis, what drove the weakness there in earnings?","John C. R. Hele","Well, we've been growing direct marketing and a lot of the new business channels, moving to our multiple distribution channels throughout Asia -- throughout Latin America. And that's had some higher costs associated with that. Direct marketing doesn't get DAC-ed as much, so you have just higher fixed cost in the year.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And I did notice that you added the P&C income statement, so I guess we could thank Ed for that.","John C. R. Hele","You can definitely thank Ed for that, yes.","Operator","And next, we go to Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A few questions for John. Can you just explain again what was the driver of the statutory loss for the quarter and why, with the loss, RBC came in higher than expected? Was there something going on, some moving parts there?","John C. R. Hele","Sure. So this was for an investment that we had that had unrealized losses, and that was deducted from capital. And we -- there was a change in statutory accounting or an interpretation in statutory accounting. We're now reflecting more of this through net income. So we moved from an unrealized loss to a realized loss through net income, but it was just a geography change to the income statement and had no impact on capital.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Did you say that was -- was that limited partnership investments? So what type of investments were those?","John C. R. Hele","It was a joint venture and limited partnership type investment.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And was that $1 billion? Or how big was that?","John C. R. Hele","It's a series of them, and it was about that amount.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then -- and how -- why did the RBC go up?","John C. R. Hele","Just from core favorable markets and good operating earnings.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. So the impact of the loss was, I guess -- was that already being factored in when it was an unrealized loss and so it wasn't much of a change on the RBC? I'm just a little confused as to why that wouldn't have...","John C. R. Hele","Yes, well, because it's not in your capital. It's not counted as part of your capital. It's an unrealized loss.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Understood. The other question I had for you was on the variable annuity policyholder behavior charge, $342 million. I guess, just a general question on it. How do we get confidence that you've taken enough on this? We don't have any parameters to really measure this around, just that, I guess you got more conservative, you lowered the lapse rate. Because we've seen other competitors of yours with similar product structure take multiple charges. So is there any way you can give us confidence that we're not going to -- this isn't the first of a series of charges.","John C. R. Hele","Okay, well, this was done after several years of study as customers who are in or close to the money get off of their surrender charge period. And we've had a few years of experience now. We also participated in an industry study of almost many of the major players, and our experience is tracking very well or almost exactly to that industry study. So I think we're pretty comfortable with where we are now, both we've had a few years of experience of this and how people behave as they get close to the money. When we looked at this, our assumptions are pretty good when people are well out of the money and well in the money. The curve for this dynamic lapse function, where we had to adjust it, was how people react when they get close to being in the money. And people are a little more sensitive than we had all initially assumed. We had benchmarked our original assumptions somewhat 10 years ago against people and we were pretty close to what others had done. But we've now adjusted, I think, to be what the experience is truly coming out. We had to wait until people get off their surrender charge period and also see people who might be closer in the money, so you can really see the experience of how to calibrate this loss function. But we've had, not only experience of a few years, but also industry experience.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But John, hasn't the progression been worse, meaning lapses have continued to decline on sort of a consistent basis? And if that -- are you assuming continued shrinkage of the lapse rate? Or how should I think about that?","John C. R. Hele","Well, it depends how people move in and out of the money and what happens to the equity markets and interest rates, so it is quite dynamic in how we price this and reserve for it. So it's not a simple answer that I can give you, but we have reflected our experience and I think we're comfortable right now with where we stand on this function.","Operator","Our next question is from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I have a question for Steve. I'm just curious if you could give us any color around what the process was like gaining approvals from -- in particular, from the Federal Reserve for the Provida deal.","Steven A. Kandarian","John, we weren't required to actually get an approval from any federal regulator on this, but we certainly talked to our regulators when there's any significant transaction we're engaged in. So there was communication, but there was not an approval process.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, I understand that. I'm -- I guess I'm just wondering if there was any real back-and-forth real questions about -- or many -- any indication maybe as part of that dialogue as to what specific capital levels or specific ratios or items were of most concern to the Federal Reserve around this deal around your capital levels.","Steven A. Kandarian","Yes, I'm not -- I don't wish to speak about confidential conversations with federal regulators. Probably not a good thing to do.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I figured I had to give it a shot. The incremental disclosure around rate sensitivity, in particular, I guess, around the annuities business. I understand, so the impact on an operating earnings basis when we look out the next couple of years is relatively modest, but you didn't really speak to anything below the line as it relates to DAC charges or reserve adjustments or any such thing. I was wondering, is there any help you can provide there? Because I assume we'd see some impacts as well there.","John C. R. Hele","Well, below the line, if rates stay lower, our derivatives are going to be higher, so we'd have gains from where we are now, so it's hard to predict what. Because a lot of this is noneconomic when you get to the net income side.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So I guess we should just assume that below-the-line impact to the 1.69% 10-year for the next couple of years will be essentially immaterial relative to your base plan?","John C. R. Hele","No, I wouldn't -- the net income is quite sensitive to how markets move, and most -- the vast majority of this movement is noneconomic in nature. The dynamic lapse function change we did to VAs, that was an economic change. But the rest of it is really noneconomic in nature and it's -- I can't predict how that's going to move quarter to quarter.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Last question is just thinking about the annuity segment in the core earnings. If I look back at the last several quarters and then look at fourth quarter, you're suggesting to us that the core earnings level for this segment has increased from the first 3 quarters of the year, somewhere around $240 million average rates -- average quarterly earnings level, to now $320 million in the fourth quarter. And if we were to run-rate off of a $320 million, that puts your guidance for the annuity segment for 2013 -- I think it clearly indicates that guidance would be very conservative. So is there something still inside the fourth quarter core number that we should be thinking about as not something that's going to recur as we move forward?","John C. R. Hele","Well, the retail annuity business has a lot of ups and downs. It's sensitive to the marketplace and what goes on in that business. So we're not updating our guidance on that at this time.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Well, sorry, I mean, the first 3 quarters of the year, though, on a core basis, the volatility in those earnings was not nearly as severe. I guess to the extent that there's any help you can provide, it would be appreciated.","John C. R. Hele","We're not going to update our guidance at this time.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I guess you guys are doing a good job slowing down sort of the run-on of VA sales, but curious if you're considering any strategies to accelerate the runoff of VAs, either through buyout programs or if there are any structures or vehicles out there that you would explore.","William J. Wheeler","Chris, it's Bill Wheeler. We aren't -- I think our strategies about VA is obviously, we're driving down GMIB sales and we're making product changes to do that. I think you'll see us make some announcements about new product introductions later this year, and that will -- as we sort of change the character of that business. In terms of buying out in-force, I -- we've examined that. We've looked at what others have done. I don't think that's an option we're considering at this time.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And are you still committed to the GMIB product? Or would you consider other living benefit features?","William J. Wheeler","Well, it -- I'm not sure this is well appreciated. We sell more than a GMIB today. We sell a healthy amount of lifetime withdrawal benefit. And I think what you're going to see going forward is a much more diverse annuity new business model going -- in terms of what we're going to sell.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a one quick follow-up, just on the returns of the new 4% rollup rate versus what you were selling before. How much different are your expected returns?","William J. Wheeler","Well, so GMIB IV, with the 5% rollup rate but the lower dollar-for-dollar, had an ROI in the fourth quarter of about 15.8%. And GMIB V, with the 4% rollup rate, has our ROI modeled as over 18%. So it's a meaningful jump.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then one just quick question for John. I guess, book value x AOCI is up just $0.04 year-over-year and it's grown, I guess, just 3% since '08. So what can be done to accelerate the growth in book? Or is your hedging strategy to protect economic capital, versus maybe smoothing GAAP results, really just put you at the mercy of below-the-line charges that are kind of out of your control?","John C. R. Hele","Well, clearly, it moves around a lot and we just have to continue to focus on it. And it's one of those metrics, I think, that it's even hard year-over-year to look at -- you have to look at it over a long-term time horizon. But we want to make sure that we have it in our sight and we are -- we will slowly, over time, we believe that this can improve.","Operator","Our next question is from Sean Dargan with Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Following up on the notion that book value ex AOCI is not growing much. Your long-term ROE target, is that impacted at all by book value perhaps being lower than where people were thinking about at the time of your Investor Day?","John C. R. Hele","No, other than for the adjustments we've already announced in terms of the goodwill.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Okay. Just in thinking about long-term care, are we correct to think that if interest rates stay where they are and mortality and utilization is consistent with what you saw in the fourth quarter, in that scenario, there would only be a couple of penny impact to 2013 EPS?","John C. R. Hele","Yes.","Operator","The next go to John Hall with Wells Fargo Securities.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","This question's for Steve. As I think about the de-banking process, I guess the way we think about it is it's ultimately going to occur and then you must also be planning, in some fashion, for it to occur. So I guess the question has to do with, do you have sort of a series of contingency plans about the de-banking process that, when you get actual word of it, you can move quickly, depending upon when that word comes, whether it's perhaps 2 weeks from now or 6 months from now?","Steven A. Kandarian","John, we are obviously planning for it. And there's still some work being done on our side in terms of assessing the regulatory landscape. We do get insights on an ongoing basis. That's why I'm reluctant at this point in time to make any pronouncements around share repurchases, dividend changes and the like, because the landscape does evolve. And until we get to that point when we're able to take capital actions, we don't think it's prudent for us to make pronouncements that may end up changing over time.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Understood. But say you got word in 2 weeks, do you have a contingency plan to roll forward to the board on whatever your decision would be?","Steven A. Kandarian","We have ongoing conversations and have for many quarters with our board on these issues. So it's not as if we're going to start with them in a few weeks to have this discussion. But we're doing a lot of analysis internally around all kinds of measures that can impact us from a capital perspective, and that has to be taken into account as we decide how we address the issue of capital.","Operator","And next we'll go to Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. First, admittedly, the Europe and the Eastern Europe -- or Europe, Middle East and Africa business is the smallest of your 3 international units. But there too, there seems to be a revenue issue in the quarter on a constant currency basis. I think the revenues were flat or down there or very -- essentially flat. What's happening there? And then my second question relates to Japan. I'm just hoping you can provide additional detail on the nature of the products that are subject to this intense competition that you referenced. Is it -- and the nature of the competition. Is it pricing? Is it terms? And who is proving to be the troublemaker here? Is it indigenous companies? Is it foreign competitors?","John C. R. Hele","Let me answer the question on Europe. We stopped selling in the U.K. annuities, so we're down $57 million year-on-year in PFOs on that and sales. So that makes a difference. We also have weakness in Western Europe, but that's been offset by strong growth in Russia, Turkey and also the AVIVA acquisition. So it's kind of balanced out some negatives with some positives, and that's why you're seeing it sort of flattish.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Actually, before we go on to -- I appreciate that. Just one quick question about this premium fees and other that you referenced. I'm just wondering, given the transition that Met is effecting away from high capital-intensive products -- so let's just say, given the transition that you contemplated that you're beginning here towards more, let's say, insurance products, you continue to publish this statistic and highlight it, which suggests to me that you think it's important, but I'm just wondering whether you're giving thought to and whether you might go in the direction of looking at total operating revenues if investment income figures -- if in fact it will be the case that investment income will figure increasingly prominently in your revenue mix. I just don't know and I'd like to know how you're thinking about that.","John C. R. Hele","Well, we'll take that under consideration, but I think we're comfortable now with how we record our revenues.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Now if you could just talk about Japan a little bit, I would be grateful.","John C. R. Hele","Actually, I missed your question. Could you repeat Japan?","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sure. So earlier in the conversation, there was the discussion about -- I think there was reference to certain competition in the bank channel. And I was just looking for a little bit more detail about the specific products that are being subject to competition. Is it explicit pricing? Is it other terms on the contracts that are the subject of the competition? And who are proving to be the troublesome competitors? Is it indigenous companies, or is it your foreign competitors?","John C. R. Hele","Okay, so what's still in the bank channel are mainly single premium style products, both in yen, U.S. dollar and Australian dollar and some other currencies. And of course, as interest rates move throughout 2012, these products can become more or less attractive. And you have to be very careful with these product lines. You have to adjust your crediting rates quickly, and if you don't, you can get a large volume of lower ROE business. And so we have been diligent in ensuring that the business that we do sell to the bank channel meets our profitability hurdles.","Christopher Townsend","And let me just add to that. It's Chris Townsend here. So as John referenced, the minus 34% in the bank channel earlier, I think the way for you to look at Japan would be look at the breadth of distribution of product that we have. So while the bank channel is down, I assure you that we're growing very fast in terms of the A&H products through the bank channel. We grew at 76% for the quarter. And we're selling A&H through 40 different banks at the moment in Japan, and also our independent agency grew at about 26% for the quarter. So we've got different levers to pull to make sure we're adhering to the discipline that both Steve and John referenced earlier.","Steven A. Kandarian","Eric, let me just make one other comment. This is Steve. When we did our Investor Day in May of last year, we did not give guidance on the top line, and that was very intentional. And that was a signal of a shift in thinking at our company about what we should be focusing on in the near term as we look at our strategic initiatives, as we try to refocus our business on markets that we think will create shareholder value for us. So it's not that we don't have internal targets on top line, but we're trying to signal we're not going run this company based upon the top line, drive sales that may end up being sales that come back later and with low ROEs for us. And that is I think, a cultural shift here. And again, we are looking to grow our business but we are looking to grow profitably, are looking to get business on the books that is in excess of our cost of equity capital and that really is the driving force here for us.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","If I could just quickly, and then go into some other things. Chris, maybe you could touch on the A&H business in Japan. I think Aflac came out and said, April 1, they're going to hold their rates steady. I think Sumitomo said that they were going to lower rates 3%. What's Met doing, come April 1?","Christopher Townsend","We've promised a 15% EC [ph] ROI, and that's consistent across all of our product range, including A&H.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, so no change there. If I may, Steve, a little bit of a conflict I have here in my thinking. Most companies would say, \"I've got $8 billion to deploy. I'm going to deploy that through either acquisitions or through share repurchase.\"  You don't -- is it fair to say you don't see it like that, that you don't think that $2 billion for Provida comes out of that $8 billion?","Steven A. Kandarian","I think it does. I mean, we have X amount of capital available to either make acquisitions with or to do share buybacks or to raise our dividend, yes.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So I guess I don't get the downside guidance of if we don't do this $8 billion. Shouldn't it be, if we don't do this $6 billion?","Steven A. Kandarian","Well, we did have baked into our guidance for -- through 2016, the plan, some acquisition activity. Some was in there. It wasn't any super large deals, but there were some ongoing acquisitions that we assumed in that plan.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. John, if you could -- I don't know. You guys haven't done this before, I don't think, but it might be worthwhile in this case, if you're willing. A point on the actual to expected in individual life, what does that equal to in earnings?","John C. R. Hele","I think 1 point is about $2 million.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","1 point is about $2 million, okay. And then finally, the guidance that you gave, it was a little unclear. The guidance that you gave on the interest rate assumption, that was cumulative, so it was 45 in the first year, going up another 95. So that was a cumulative thing, that wasn't another 150?","John C. R. Hele","150 is the combined number.","Edward A. Spehar","Okay, thank you very much for joining us.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call.","We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our press release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.","Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia.","[Operator Instructions]","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.","Steven A. Kandarian","Thank you, Ed. And good morning, everyone.","We are pleased to report strong third quarter results. Operating earnings were $1.8 billion, up 22% from the third quarter of 2013. And operating return on equity was 13.2%, an increase from 11.7% in the prior-year period.","Notable items in the quarter were variable investment income above the top end of the normal quarterly range, favorable catastrophe experience and prior year loss reserve development in property and casualty, a positive impact from our annual review of actuarial assumptions and a modest net negative impact from tax adjustments. These notable items increased operating earnings by $107 million. Excluding notable items, operating earnings increased 14% from the third quarter of 2013.","Favorable investment margins have been a consistent earnings theme in recent years despite low interest rates. In the quarter, the average investment spread for U.S. product lines was 236 basis points or within the approximately 220 to 240 basis point range of the past few years. Strong variable investment income more than offset the negative impact on investment margins from low interest rates. While the 2014 interest rate environment has been close to the low-rate scenario we provided in our 2013 10-K, the earnings impact has been more benign than we predicted, largely due to management actions.","Investment margins in both Retail life and Latin America returned to normal levels in the third quarter. Underwriting margins in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits were the low end of the normal range but better than the prior year quarter. Within group, disability results improved year-over-year and sequentially. We anticipate further improvement in disability results from the operational changes and targeted price increases that we shared with you on the Second Quarter Earnings Call.","Turning to expenses. We continue to deliver on the cost savings outlined as part of MetLife's strategy. The operating expense ratio of 23.0% in the quarter versus 24.3% in third quarter of last year. Operating expenses also remained well controlled on an absolute basis, up 2% from the prior year period compared to a 5% increase in adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues.","Another key element of our strategy, growing in emerging markets, also showed progress in the quarter. Compared to the prior year period, sales in emerging markets were up 10% in Latin America, 31% in EMEA and 20% in Asia.","On a per share basis, operating earnings in the quarter were $1.60, a 19% increase from the prior year period. Growth on a per share basis was dampened by the conversion of $1 billion of equity units into common shares in September 2013. The dilutive impact of these conversions was partially offset by our repurchase of $438 million of stock in the third quarter at an average price of $54.19 per share. Since we resumed our share repurchase program in late June of this year, we have repurchased a total of $756 million of stock at an average price of $52.53 per share.","Our strong third quarter stands in contrast to our second quarter. We are pleased to see underwriting results improve after the second quarter's adverse experience. In addition, the Corporate & Other loss was modest, largely as a result of tax benefits and well below the elevated level of the second quarter. At the same time, it's important to remember that this is a long-term business and quarterly results will fluctuate. And as you have heard me say before, paying too much attention to quarterly performance could lead us to take actions contrary to the future health of the business. Running a business for the long term takes patience and a recognition that what managers choose not to do is often just as important as what they choose to do.","Consider MetLife's strategy in the pension risk transfer market. As you know, MetLife did not win either of the 2 large pension closeout deals announced recently. We find the market opportunity in closeouts attractive, and MetLife has been winning profitable business from small and mid-sized pension plans. We will continue to bid on transactions of all sizes but will remain disciplined. We believe our bids on recent large closeouts would have created value for MetLife's shareholders, but the spread over our cost of capital was modest. The competitive landscape for large closeouts leaves little margin for error. Pension closeouts are long-dated liabilities that cannot be repriced, so a negative surprise relative to assumptions could impact returns for decades.","We know that large closeouts can have a material positive impact on GAAP earnings. However, our philosophy is that near-term GAAP earnings accretion is not necessarily indicative of long-term value creation for shareholders.","I would now like to provide a brief update on regulatory developments. As you know, the Financial Stability Oversight Council voted on September 4 to make a proposed determination that MetLife is a systemically important financial institution or SIFI. On October 3, MetLife requested an evidentiary hearing, which is scheduled for November 3, to contest the proposed determination. After the hearing, FSOC has 60 days to make a final determination as to whether MetLife is a SIFI. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, if MetLife is designated, the company has 30 days to decide whether to seek a judicial review of the designation in federal district court.","With regard to the capital rules for nonbank SIFIs, the Federal Reserve announced on September 30 that it will conduct a quantitative impact study or QIS to \"better understand how to design a capital framework for insurance holding companies and supervisors that has compliance with the Collins Amendment.\" Although MetLife is not under its supervision, the Federal Reserve accepted our request to participate in the QIS. It is important to note that the QIS assumes that the new rules will be compliant with the Collins Amendment, which the Federal Reserve interprets as requiring it to impose bank capital standards on all nonbanks under its supervision. We believe this underscores the critical importance of enacting the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act as quickly as possible.","We are encouraged that the House and Senate have already passed identical language, providing the Federal Reserve with flexibility to tailor the capital rules for insurance companies. And we urge Congress to finish the job during the lame duck legislative session later this fall.","To sum up, I am pleased that, in the face of economic and regulatory headwinds, MetLife continues to perform well in those areas under its control, including expense management, pricing discipline and investment performance. Performing well on the fundamentals is the clearest path to creating shareholder value over time.","With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele.","John C. R. Hele","Thank you, Steve. And good morning.","Today, I'll cover our third quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.","Operating earnings in the third quarter were $1.8 billion, up 22% from the prior year period. And operating earnings per share were $1.60, up 19%. This quarter includes 4 notable items, which are highlighted in our press release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement or QFS.","First, variable investment income was $273 million after taxes and DAC, which is $62 million or $0.05 per share above the top end of our quarterly guidance range. Second, we had lower-than-budgeted catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development, which increased operating earnings by $38 million or $0.03 per share.","Third, we had 2 tax items that mostly offset. The onetime impact from Chilean tax reform reduced operating earnings by $41 million or $0.04 per share, and this was largely offset by a favorable tax adjustment of $32 million or $0.03 per share related to the filing of our 2013 U.S. federal tax return.","Finally, as a result of our annual actuarial assumption review, there was a $16 million or $0.01 per share positive impact to operating earnings. There were a number of small items that drove this result, and most of the benefit was in Retail. The total positive impact to GAAP net income from the actuarial assumption review was $105 million. In total, notable items included an operating earnings of $107 million or $0.09 per share.","Turning to our bottom line results.","Third quarter net income was $2.1 billion or $1.81 per share. Net income exceeded operating earnings by $239 million. The 3 most significant items that explain the majority of this difference are: one, derivative net gains of $187 million after tax and other adjustments, primarily from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar; two, an impact of $89 million after-tax from the portion of the actuarial assumption review that was not included in operating earnings; and three, net investment gains of $71 million after tax.","Non-economic and asymmetrical accounting adjustments were $146 million of the $239 million difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter.","Before I discuss margins and business segments, I want to highlight new metrics for book value and ROE included in the QFS. We are now disclosing book value excluding AOCI other than foreign currency translation adjustments or FCTA, and tangible book value. Operating ROE will now be calculated using these 2 measures of book value. We believe operating ROE, based on book value excluding AOCI other than FCTA, is a better measure of performance than an operating ROE calculation based on book value excluding AOCI, as the former includes the impact of foreign currency in both the numerator and denominator. We are making this change because FCTA has become more significant and now distorts the ROE calculation.","Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $49.69 as of September 30, up 7% year-over-year but below book value per share, excluding AOCI, of $51.62. Operating ROE in the third quarter was 13.2% on book value excluding AOCI other than FCTA or 40 basis points higher than the 12.8% using book value excluding AOCI.","Tangible book value and tangible operating ROE are also new disclosures this quarter. Tangible book value is calculated by excluding goodwill and other non-insurance intangible assets from book value excluding AOCI other than FCTA. These intangible assets were $10.9 billion as of September 30, and the vast majority was goodwill.","Tangible book value per share was $39.95 as of September 30, up 7% year-over-year, and tangible operating ROE was 16.7% in the third quarter. We believe tangible operating ROE provides a better measure of the underlying business returns for MetLife.","Turning to third quarter margins.","Underwriting was favorable to the prior year quarter. Highlights included a recovery in Retail and Latin America from a weak second quarter, modest improvement in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits on a sequential and year-over-year basis and strong results in property and casualty.","Retail life's interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 51.0% in the third quarter, excluding the impact of the actuarial assumption review. This ratio was in line with the prior year quarter and significantly better than the adjusted second quarter of 55.2%. Large claims returned to a normal level in the third quarter from an elevated level in the second quarter.","In Latin America, underwriting results were similar to the prior year quarter but better than the second quarter. The sequential improvement was driven by Mexico worksite marketing claims returning to a normal level and the absence of negative onetime items.","The mortality ratio in group life was 89.9% versus 90.3% in the prior year period. Results this quarter were at the top end of our 85% to 90% targeted range but only slightly above the 89.1% third quarter average during the prior 3 years, when adjusting for the -- a onetime item in the third quarter of 2011.","The non-medical health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 79.0%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 80.6% and down sequentially from 82.6%.","Disability underwriting results were favorable to the prior year quarter and improved sequentially, largely due to lower claim severity. Dental margins were unfavorable to the prior year, driven by higher utilization. On a year-to-date basis, dental utilization is unchanged compared to the first 9 months of 2013.","In our P&C business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 83.6% in Retail and 91.0% in group. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 79.3% in Retail and 86.2% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting results were favorable versus the prior year due to the -- due to lower catastrophe and non-cat losses as well as favorable prior year reserve development.","Moving to third quarter investment margins.","As Steve noted, the average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 236 basis points, up 15 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially. Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 191 basis points, down 16 basis points versus the prior year and 4 basis points sequentially. While we have experienced modest compression in our recurring investment margins, this has been more than offset by strong variable investment income. Overall, we are pleased with our investment margins, particularly in this persistent low rate environment.","With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.0% in the third quarter, as compared to 24.3% in the year-ago quarter. As Steve mentioned, expenses were up only 2% year-over-year. Adjusting for Provida as well as onetime regulatory and project costs, expenses were below the prior year level.","Gross expense saves were $239 million in the third quarter, and net saves were $162 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $29 million and onetime costs of $48 million. While we caution against extrapolating any 1 quarter's results, the annualized effect of the net saves has reached our targeted bottom line benefit of $600 million, which was announced at the May 2012 Investor Day. In addition to our expectation for a modest increase in gross expense saves, we anticipate that, over time, the reinvestment spend will increase while onetime costs decrease.","I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter.","Retail operating earnings were $699 million, up 6% versus the prior year quarter and up 2% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in Retail was driven by Life & Other, while -- which reported operating earnings of $350 million, up 48% versus the prior year quarter and up 15% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were favorable expense margins and underwriting.","Annuities reported operating earnings of $349 million, down 17% versus the prior quarter -- year quarter and down 6% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were negative net flows and lower core spreads, partially offset by favorable markets and lower expenses.","Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $237 million, up 5% versus the prior year quarter and essentially flat after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting results improved in group life and disability, partially offset by less-favorable dental results. GVWB PFOs was $4.3 billion, up 6% year-over-year. GVWB sales increased 10% from the prior year quarter due to growth in group life and disability businesses.","Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $408 million, up 37% versus the prior year quarter and up 26% after adjusting for notable items. Growth was driven by improved interest margins and favorable underwriting results.","CBF PFOs were $582 million, up 2% year-over-year due to growth in structured settlements and income annuities, partially offset by lower pension closeouts. We remain active but disciplined in the pension closeout market and continue to see a good pipeline of small to mid-sized cases.","Latin America reported operating earnings of $152 million, up 14% from the prior year quarter and 22% on a constant currency basis, driven by the Provida acquisition and business growth across the region. Chilean tax reform, which resulted in a onetime charge of $41 million, was a partial offset.","Latin America PFOs were $1.1 billion, up 24% from the prior year quarter and 31% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region.","Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $306 million, up 19% from the prior year quarter on both a reported and constant currency basis and down 3% after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. Business growth and solid investment margins were muted because of positive onetime tax impacts in the prior year.","Asia PFOs were $2.5 billion, up 3% from the prior year quarter and 5% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to growth in Australia. Asia sales were up 10% from the prior year period, driven by strong growth in Australia and China. Repricing of products in Japan explains an 18% decline in sales from the prior year quarter. We continue to focus on value over volume in Japan as new business sales are generating attractive returns relative to the prior year.","In EMEA, operating earnings were $96 million, up 13% year-over-year and 20% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers in the quarter were business growth in the Middle East, a $10 million after-tax benefit from the annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, as well as an incremental $5 million benefit from the conversion of certain operations at calendar-year reporting.","EMEA PFOs were up 3% from the prior year period and 4% on a constant currency basis. Total sales increased 12%, with 31% growth in emerging markets, including strong employee benefits sales in the Middle East.","Finally, the operating loss in Corporate & Other was $73 million, as compared to $163 million in the prior year quarter. The improvement in Corporate & Other was mainly due to certain tax items. These items include the previously noted $32 million benefit related to the filing of the company's 2013 U.S. federal tax return, a $31 million year-to-date adjustment to reflect lower estimated tax rate in 2014 and a tax benefit from the timing of certain dividend payments from non-U.S. subsidiaries.","The Corporate & Other line is difficult to predict on a quarterly basis, and we think that the third quarter loss was well below a normal level. We would expect Corporate & Other loss to be between $175 million and $225 million in the fourth quarter and within our guidance range of $550 million to $750 million for the full year.","I will now discuss our cash and capital position.","Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6 billion at September 30, which is up from $5.5 billion at June 30. The increase from the second quarter was driven by approximately $1.5 billion of subsidiary dividends, less common stock dividends and share buybacks.","For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary third quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $1 billion, up 43% from the prior year quarter, and statutory net income was approximately $1.1 billion, up 140%. The increase in statutory operating earnings was primarily due to lower taxes and unfavorable mortality, partially offset by lower separate account returns. The increase in statutory net income was due to these factors and lower derivative losses.","Next I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. As you know, we report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the third quarter. Our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital is expected to be approximately $28 billion as of September 30, up 6% compared to December 31. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio is 1,018% as of the second quarter of 2014, which is the latest public data.","In conclusion, MetLife had a strong third quarter. Investment margins remain healthy. Expenses are well controlled, and underwriting improved. In addition, our cash and capital position remain strong, providing us with the flexibility to be opportunistic in managing capital as we seek to maximize shareholder value.","And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, I had a question on just your spreads overall. They've been pretty strong throughout the year and even if you exclude variable investment income. So if I think about your guidance, I think you had talked about a 10-year Treasury yield of around 3.36% or so by the end of the year, so we're considerably below that. Just wondering how you think about that as you look into 2015 and look at your spreads and margins given the current interest rate environment.","Steven Jeffrey Goulart","Jimmy, it's Steve Goulart on. I'll start and in just thinking about rates. I mean you're right that rates are a lot lower than the consensus. And I think, even when we look at the outlook, I think the forecast within the year is 2 88 for the 10 year and 3 35 next year. We're probably still more conservative about that, but remember there are 2 legs to this too. So we've had strong VII. We continue to have good recurring income, but we are continuing to reinvest or roll off at rates, call it, 100 to 150 below the assets that are rolling off. So we're able to maintain the yield portion of this through strong VII and continued good ALM discipline, but remember the other piece of it is also pricing and crediting rates on products too. So a margin takes both pieces to work together, and I think the other pieces work together. And I don't know if Bill wants to add anything to that.","William J. Wheeler","Well, if you look at our businesses, I mean it's in the disclosure: Our crediting rates have been flat for a long time because we've reached product rate minimums in many of our products. And even though new sales generally have lower interest rate credit minimums, they're -- it's only changing the mix slightly. Therefore, I think you're going to see investment spread compression continue, barring some significant macroeconomic change in interest rates. So I think that's it's been a very gradual decline in terms of spread compression. And I think that will continue with maybe the same -- some offset from VII.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And on VII, can you talk about what asset classes did better than normal? Obviously, VII was a little bit higher than your -- the high end of your range. And which asset classes outperformed those that underperformed?","Steven Jeffrey Goulart","Sure. The trend continues, basically. We've had strong private equity performance for most of the year, and that happened again in the third quarter. Prepayments continue to be a little bit ahead of our projections too, both bond and mortgages. And hedge funds have sort of underperformed to plan. And I think, in looking at the fourth quarter, we generally expect that trend. I don't think you'll see the same strong VII results in the fourth quarter, but I would still expect this to be within our planned range of 2 25 to 2 75, maybe more toward the lower end, just looking at what's happened in PE and hedge funds in the last couple of months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question, for John, just following up on your comment on corporate loss expectations going forward. So if I start with the dollar -- adjusted $1.51 number, stripping out the unusual items, I would then, I guess, adjust corporate other by another $0.07 or so at least. Any other adjustments that you would make when you think about run rate heading into 4Q?","John C. R. Hele","Yes, so I gave the range for the loss in the fourth quarter between $175 million and $225 million, and that's really getting out these tax -- mainly tax adjustments that we had in corporate in this quarter, with some of it was from last year which is notable that was taken out. And then the -- but there's still some catch-up in the tax rate that we made in this quarter to get at the effective tax rate for the year. So I think it's within the guidance that I've given.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, but no -- and I heard Steve Goulart's comment about his expectation for VII, so we can make that adjustment as well, but any other -- anything else that you don't believe as necessarily trendable, whether it's encaje returns within Lat Am or anything else, certain FX adjustments that you would make that you feel like are notable enough to not extrapolate this quarter into next or to make any adjustments?","John C. R. Hele","Well, Tom, I think we have a policy that we don't give guidance other than for some specific items like Corporate & Other and a few things and VII for the year. So we've given those pieces, but that's as far as we do. Thanks.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just one follow-up, I guess, for Steve. I saw the IAIS capital standard came out, I guess it was earlier this week, and was just curious -- or maybe it was late last week. Just curious if this is something that you all have been analyzing. And if so, what are your thoughts on it? And do you think there's any -- should we be thinking about that impacting what the Fed might do in terms of nonbank SIFI framework?","Steven A. Kandarian","Okay, Tom, thanks. I'm going to answer your question in 1 minute, but it was brought to my attention that I misread one of the words in my remarks. I had meant to say that underwriting margins in both Retail life and Latin America returned to normal levels in the third quarter, and I guess I said investment margins. I suppose that's a hazard of being a former Chief Investment Officer. But so Tom, in terms of the standards that just came out by the IAIS, they talked about basic capital requirements, which is where the starting point on which they will kind of develop higher loss absorbency requirements for global systemically important insurers. They will be named GSIIs. So that would include us. Now I will say it's still early days, but the key focus by us is on this HLL -- HLA standard, higher loss absorbency, and that has yet to be determined. They've talked about some principles, but it's still being worked on. So we are working very closely with regulators across the globe and with groups like the IAIS; through the IIF, the International Institute of Finance; and The Geneva Association; and others, and we're quite engaged in this. It's still early days, I'd say. And I think it's important to remember that these international bodies have no regulatory authority other than to make suggestions to the national or local regulators, who either adopt or do not adopt the standards they ultimately come up with. So it's a long way of saying we're still far from knowing what these standards will mean in terms of actual impact upon our company or the industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just have one question. As you think about your cost of equity capital and your discussion around pension risk transfer transactions, and you indicated that participating in some of these larger transactions would have created value for you but modest value for your shareholders, do you perceive -- as best as you can tell, do you perceive your cost of equity capital to be materially different from that of other large insurers?","Steven A. Kandarian","It's Steve. I don't really want to try to opine upon other people's cost of equity capital, but I think we have a pretty good understanding of our cost of equity capital, what impacts it. And we've taken steps from our strategy work to try and reduce that as well as increase our returns. And we look closely at all businesses, including the pension closeout business, to determine where we think we're creating shareholder value and where we're not. And we'll bid on that kind of business but we'll be very disciplined, as I mentioned in my remarks. And we can't really speak to what others' thought process is or what they think their cost of equity capital is, to simply make sure that whatever we do on our side is a value to our shareholders over the long run.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","One quick follow-up. Is it that the smaller end of the market, the smaller -- well, let's say, the mid-sized employer market for pension risk transfers is just less competitive and that has allowed you to achieve your targeted rates of returns, where you weren't able to do so in the larger market? What's different about the markets where you have achieved success in terms of winning business?","William J. Wheeler","Eric, it's Bill. So we ask that -- we've asked that question a lot internally ourselves about, geez, there's something going on with expenses or implementation costs for smaller deals that -- versus large deals. And the answer is it -- I think every transaction is a little different in terms of what we think the mortality experience is likely to be, the assets that are getting transferred over and or not. And so they're all a little different. My -- I would've assumed at one time that -- larger-case deals, because there are just less bidders, because there are less bidders avail -- able to take the larger transactions on their balance sheet, that those would have been somewhat less competitive. That has clearly turned out not to be true, at least in the last couple of years. And we have experienced a lot more success in the small end of the market than the large. And we were -- last year, for instance, in 2013, we were the market share leader in this category. There were not any large deals last year. And even after these 2 big deals were announced, we won shortly right after that 3 smaller deals. So it's hard to understand the competitive dynamics in terms of large versus big. I would just say there's -- I don't think, really, there's much difference.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two quick ones. First, just in terms of the ultimate goal for ROE, if we look at the new book value standard. It looks like it gives you about 30 to 40 basis points, at least this quarter, because of lower book value. When you think about your ultimate ROE objective, has that changed because of the rebasing of the book value?","John C. R. Hele","No. This is John. I mean the goal of our ROE was set out as a strategy, which was a basic return goal of return over equity, and you want to have that on the same basis. Currency has moved quite a bit since 2012. As I said, this just was not really a major impact in prior years. '13, it started to become more as continuing, so we thought it was important to make this adjustment. Most of our major competitors adjust for this already in how they quote and think about this. So it truly is the economic return that's happening to get apples and apples on the numerator and the denominator. So we think it's a better measure, but we are returning, with these measures we're publishing, to the goals that we set out of the 12% to the 14% ROE.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And if I could ask just one question on PRT. And Steve, I appreciate your commentary on the conservatism of your pricing. When you think about the sensitivity of your ultimate profitability of this business, is interest rates the primary and the overall variable that's really driving the sensitivity? Or is it mortality and other assumptions that also causes a lot of the sensitivity of your profitability analysis?","William J. Wheeler","Well, again, we look at -- this is Bill Wheeler again. We look at the -- anytime we -- a case of any size, we have to look at the underlying mortality experience and extrapolate from that in terms of -- because remember, the closeouts we're doing, they're almost all retired lives. They're not generally active lives. And retired lives, what's the age of the group? What -- there are lots of demographic issues which can change the mortality assumptions. You have to make a good assumption there. And then we have a target set of investments that we want to put up against these liabilities. We have a standard set, and that'll inform our investment spreads. Those are the 2 big drivers. It's really not administrative costs, though we have a very efficient administrative platform. Or it's not setup costs. It's -- that's the 2 big factors are mortality experience and then the investment spreads you're going to earn.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You used to discuss the sales trends you're seeing in group benefits and the level of activity in the market. I mean it's also -- are you starting to see any benefit from employment growth on plan enrollments?","William J. Wheeler","Yes, Erik, it's Bill again. The -- so we're having a good sales year. And I think John alluded to that, that sales activity is up year-over-year. We're -- we had a -- we've talked, I think, in previous quarters about exchanges. The exchange numbers that sales numbers came in, essentially where we think they're going to for the full year, but the adoption there is pretty slow, so I would say that's not a very big factor yet in the group marketplace. The -- we're also -- I would argue, I would contend we're having quite a good renewal season in terms of cases we already had that have come up for renewal pricing. We are generally achieving our targets there, and that's good. So that means the market is -- it's competitive but not overly competitive. And in terms of adding -- seeing increases due to payroll, I would say, right now, that's modest. And there is a little bit of growth there, but it's not very material.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then on just the underwriting results in group, can you give a little bit more detail on where you saw improvement this quarter and where you see additional opportunities?","William J. Wheeler","Sure. So there are 3 big drivers here. It's group life, disability and dental. Group life, a little better year-over-year, right at the -- just under the top end of our guidance range, so I would call it a so-so underwriting quarter. I think there's improvement left there, and I think you'll probably see that in the coming quarters the next year. Disability, pretty good improvement sequentially. And I think -- and I -- we are working through our -- I think, on the last quarterly call, we talked about some operational issues in one of our claims management sites. And we've seen some improvement in the metrics there, and I think that will continue. So I think there's opportunity for continued upside there. As John alluded to in the call, dental was soft this quarter. We're still seeing a catch-up in utilization. Remember, in the first quarter, we had a really poor weather. Nobody went to the dentist, and -- but they did eventually go see their dentists in the second quarter and also the third quarter. So utilization now is just where it was at the 9-month period last year, so I think we've had our catch-up. And so my guess is dental will -- should improve from here as well. So I see -- even though I think it was an okay improvement overall in group underwriting, I think there's more to come.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I had a couple of follow-up questions on interest rates. So first, if we think of the better performance than expected on the interest rate front, given that interest rates have come down and spreads have not weakened nearly to the degree that you expected back when you provided the 10-K assumptions, what else do you have? Are there any other things that you can do as you think of 2015 and a possibly lower rate environment there that could still mitigate the impacts from the declining rates?","John C. R. Hele","This is John. And our strategy, I think, will continue, that we have mitigated much of the decrease in the core spreads by variable investment income. And of course, we've been helped by good equity markets and other factors, but also the diversification of our asset structure helps mitigate this, as well as the derivatives that have been purchased some time ago. Unfortunately, as time wears on, that impact from those derivatives will slowly start to wear off and we will be faced with declining spreads if rates stay at these low levels. So it's there will be continued pressure on this, and we are doing our best to mitigate it.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and that leads me to my second question, which really goes to -- back to the assumption review. So clearly, there was no real impact from a lower interest rate environment in the assumption review. And I know that the company had lowered it's expected total returns a couple of years ago. If rates remain kind of lower for longer, at what point do you have to revisit your current assumptions? Or are you comfortable with where they are today regardless of kind of the rate environment that we currently see?","John C. R. Hele","Right. So that's -- it's a very important question and something that we consider all the time. Rates are low. We even saw some quite low 10-year Treasury rates just a few weeks ago. And so the question always is does that make you change your long-term assumption. Our actuaries make assumptions that impact our business for the next 50-plus years, sometimes even longer, so you have to think about this over a very long time. And we look at recent trends, but we also look way back, over 100 years or 50 years or 40 years. And you think about your different economic cycles. So you have to take all those into account. We do target basically a 4.5% 10-year Treasury, which is a basis of the Fed inflation target of 2% and then a long-term growth return for the U.S. economy. We still think that is appropriate for the long, long term. We do great into that from where we are today. And we also have to remember that even though we have low rates, we just saw the announcement that the Federal Reserve is stopping bond buying, so an unprecedented buying within the market, so that's never been seen before by both the Federal Reserve and the ECB, which has a big impact on global markets. And I think the Fed said that they will be buying more, but they will keep their current balance the same, so they will buy. They will keep it up, so they won't even see that going down. And this has a large impact on what's happening to interest rates. We've also seen some global economic concerns, which there's always a flight to U.S. Treasuries whenever that happens. So I think you always have to take the current day's news, quarter's news, year's news into a total perspective and think about 40 and 50 years, which is a hard thing to think about, but that's what our actuaries have to do. And we would have to see some continued time and really get a fundamental differing view, long-term view, on the U.S. economy and inflation targets to fundamentally make -- to make some changes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Question on Retail. While the earnings were on track, sales came pretty soft on the life insurance and annuity side. So to hit your longer-term targets, I think we'll probably going to need to see that turn around. So can you discuss what's driving the current weakness and where you stand on product introductions? Or are there distribution initiatives to help drive stronger growth?","William J. Wheeler","Nigel, it's Bill. So there are sort of 2 stories here. Both life sales and annuity sales are down -- or variable annuity sales are down significantly year-over-year. And I would say almost all of that is product driven. We -- well, if I take variable annuity sales, we forecast all year. Or when we gave sort of our outlook call last -- late last year, we said that we expected variable annuity sales to be down and that '14 would sort of represent the dip year and then we'd see -- we'd start to see growth in '15. And that's even probably more true than we estimated at the time. I do expect to see growing VA sales, but I think they're going to be timed very closely to the new product rollout that we expect over the next couple of quarters. And we're not in a position to make product rollout announcements today, but there will be new product rollouts coming. And I think that'll strengthen our competitive position in that marketplace. And so I would say it's product driven, not distribution related. With regard to life, a couple things going on there. Again, the third quarter was a little soft, and seasonally, it's always going to be the softest quarter. It -- we changed pricing in term life in the third quarter. And I think -- when that got announced, I think people waited for the new repriced term to come out, and I think that probably made the sales look a little worse than we otherwise would have thought. So I think there will be a recovery in the fourth quarter in term. There is a new product in the competitive scene, indexed universal life, which is garnering a lot of sales. We don't sell that product. And of course, what makes the year-over-year comparison a little more difficult is the sale of no longer selling universal life with lifetime guarantees. There too, we have had some new product introductions, which I think have gotten a lot of interest. And I expect to see sales momentum starting to build in Retail life as well over the next, I would say, 4, 5 quarters. So a bit of a dip this year given all the changes we've made in the Retail business. And I don't think that's really surprising, but we -- but I think we're on the upswing.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's helpful. Just a quick follow-up on the IAIS basic capital requirements. We're hearing that bid rules are likely to be similar. Interested to say whether -- or to hear whether you think that's right, or it's just too early to tell.","Steven A. Kandarian","Nigel, could you repeat that a little bit -- a little slowly?","John C. R. Hele","Let me just -- yes. Nigel, did you say that -- the IAIS capital rules, that it's expected the Fed will use these? Is that what you...","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, it'd be along the same lines, right.","John C. R. Hele","It is unclear what the Federal Reserve will do. Technically, right now, they're bound by the Collins Amendment, which the Federal Reserve is interpreting to apply basically Basel III to anything that is similar in an insurance company that a bank has. If the current bills in the House and Senate get reconciled and signed by the President, then the Federal Reserve has the freedom, they believe, to adopt different set of rules, but up to now, the Fed has not given any guidance as to how much tailwind that they expect to do. They have said that they will, of course, look at what the IAIS comes up with, in a very similar way that the Federal Reserve looks at what Basel does for banks. The Basel Committee passes basic global rules, Basel III. The Federal Reserve then looks to those rules, interprets them and comes up with standards that they believe are at least as strong as what the Basel III rules are. So I believe they'll be following a similar process when it comes to in rules that apply to nonbank SIFIs, but exactly how that turns out and where it ends up is unknown at this time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I had a question on expenses. So you've already achieved the $600 million net expense save target. So trying to get a sense of, as we look forward from here, how do you think about additional opportunities to improve the consolidated expense ratio going forward.","John C. R. Hele","Ryan, it's John. Yes, as I mentioned, we have realized our goal. I did say and we do expect to be continually focusing on our expense ratios. I think, when we gave our long-term guidance last fall -- last December and we spoke about the various business lines, in general, the goal from here on in is to grow revenues faster than expenses to get that growing margin growth. But the cost saves, the major program that we started in 2012, we are basically there at a run-rate basis.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Is it -- I guess, as a follow-up to that, I think I definitely remember in the international businesses that the goal is, in kind of each case, to grow. Do you expect expense growth to be lower than revenue growth? And it seemed like that might be less the case in the U.S. Should we expect it mostly to be driven by international, with U.S. kind of seeing less opportunity for improvement from here?","John C. R. Hele","Yes, well, we had -- in the fast-growth markets, we expect that to be better. And we do expect a slight improvement in certain of the U.S. businesses, but in some of the larger ones, really far less from this point forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Devine from Jefferies.","Colin Devine","With respect to where you stand in the regulatory front, it's been a pretty busy year, I guess, with New York, notwithstanding what's going on with the Fed. Are there any updates you can give us on where things stand with respect to your use of captive reinsurance? Or how are you looking at reinsurance usage overall now given the changes from New York, ditto on the XXX situation? And then also, perhaps for Steve Goulart, the NAIC is looking at a bunch of different changes to RBC capital requirements on the C1 charges both with the much broader range of bond categories, commercial real estate. How is that impacting your thinking about where you're going to be reinvesting next year even perhaps repositioning the portfolio but to keep the yield up?","John C. R. Hele","Colin, this is John. So when it comes to captives, of course, our variable annuity captive, which is now based in Delaware, will be merged into a set of statutory entities in November this year. This is what we announced last year, and we're on track for that. We have all regulatory approvals to proceed. So that means that sales of variable annuities will no longer be using any seeding to a captive. They'll be in the statutory entities, either the New York company for New York sales or the large non-New York company for non-New York sales. Life captives, we have existing ones in place, but for New York, we don't seed to captives at all. And we don't sell universal life for secondary guarantees anymore, which is what these captives are used for. We don't sell those any place in the U.S., so we have no real net use for the -- for the major use of these captives. There's a small amount of term insurance non-New York that might be used for that. And then I'll turn it over to Steve for the RBC question.","Colin Devine","One question, John, before you do that. Going forward, when you refer to MetLife's RBC, is it going to be just for the New York entity? Or will you start referring to it on a consolidated U.S. basis? Not -- but the[ph] international operations, obviously, but [indiscernible].","John C. R. Hele","Colin, we don't really give it for -- on a consolidated U.S. basis for our primary U.S. statutory entities, and that's the number that I quote on an ongoing basis. And that will be reflecting -- post the merger of all these companies, we'll then reflect the VA captive, which used to be offshore, in that number. So our RBC at the end of this year will reflect all the VA business within the statutory entities.","Colin Devine","Okay. And is there any update on the -- what -- how that will impact your RBC? Is it still the sort of 60 bps there?","John C. R. Hele","We have -- gave some time ago guidance that we expected it to be of above 400% RBC, and we still expect that to be the case.","Colin Devine","Okay. And Steve?","Steven Jeffrey Goulart","Colin, Steve. A couple of comments, I guess, on that. And obviously, we're following what's going on in RBC and potential ratings. It's always an important factor in our investment plan. My understanding, though, is on the -- at least on the bond side, I think there's still a lot of uncertainty on where the NAIC is going to come out on that. The one positive is actually on the mortgage side, where I think it looks like some of the re-ratings there are going to be positive. And of course, given the importance of real estate and mortgages to us, that would be a benefit.","Colin Devine","So you're specifically fine to to meet there [ph]. Is there -- what about also for owned real estate? I mean you've been very successful in it. Does that give you -- if they're going to drop the capital requirement that meaningfully, open up an opportunity to get back into that perhaps a bit more actively and also thinking that you don't face the same sort of mark-to-market fluctuations?","Steven Jeffrey Goulart","Well, I guess, at this point, I couldn't say it'll change our strategy. Remember, real estate equity has always been important to us, and it continues to be a good component of our overall investing strategies, probably more so than some of our peers. So I wouldn't say it would necessarily increase that because you still have to think about overall risk-return and capital requirements.","Edward A. Spehar","Okay. Thank you, everyone.

We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings press release, our quarterly financial supplements and in the Other Financial Information section.","A reconciliation of forward-looking information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period-to-period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.","Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Eric Steigerwalt, Interim Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussion are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Bill Hogan, Executive Vice President and Head of our Japan operations.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Steve.","Steven A. Kandarian","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. MetLife continued to perform well in the second quarter, particularly in light of the current environment. We delivered operating earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.33 per share, up 18% year-over-year. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, rose to $48.60, a 12% gain year-over-year.","MetLife's story in the second quarter is one of sound execution on the fundamentals. Our underwriting results remain solid with strong performance in dental and improving results in disability. MetLife's commitment to underwriting discipline demonstrates that we will not chase sales at the expense of margins, which has proved over time to be a competitive strength. Consistent with our strategy of balancing growth and risk, we have reduced variable annuity sales in the quarter by 34% year-over-year and by 6% sequentially.","Emerging market growth, another strategic priority, was very strong in Latin America with earnings up 5% on a reported basis and by 19% on a constant currency basis. Perhaps no area better reflects the disciplined approach we take to the business than our actions to manage interest rate exposure. As you know, we provided extensive disclosure about our interest rate risk in conjunction with the third quarter 2011 earnings call. Interest rates have come down further since then. And we have done additional analysis on the impact to MetLife's earnings. I would like to share those results with you today.","The interest rate scenario we discussed last fall assumed a rate curve with a 10-year Treasury rate held flat at 2% for 5 years. We reran that scenario using a more recent yield curve with a 10-year Treasury at a record low 1.4%. The result was essentially no incremental impact on MetLife's earning per share for 2012 and 2013 and only roughly $0.05 per share in 2014.","We also examined the impact of the low interest rate environment on MetLife's return on equity. At our Investor Day in May, we said we expected to have an ROE of 12% to 14% by 2016. Even if the 10-year Treasury rate were to remain at 1.4% through the end of 2016, we would expect to hit the lower end of that range, adding roughly 100 basis points of ROE from this year's expected level despite the low interest rate environment. The impact of low interest rates on MetLife's earnings is more benign than many suspect for 2 main reasons. First, we still have room to adjust credit rates on a number of our products in response to changes in interest rates. And second, our hedging program has been highly effective. We made a forward-looking call in 2004 to start buying low rate protection when the 10-year Treasury was trading above 4%. We are reaping the benefits today, and we will continue to do so for a number of years to come.","Now let me discuss a few regulatory issues facing MetLife. With regard to debanking, regulatory approval for the sale of the depository business of MetLife Bank to GE Capital needs to be obtained from the FDIC. And the application for sale is pending with them. I know that investors are eager for resolution of this issue, but the timing is outside of MetLife's control. As I said last quarter, I'm not going to speculate as to when the FDIC will take final action. As soon as we have something to report, we will. Until then, we are not responding to questions about the status of the FDIC process.","Looking ahead, a central regulatory issue for MetLife is whether we'll be named a nonbank systemically important financial institution and what the new prudential standards for nonbank SIFIs will look like. The Financial Stability Oversight Council has begun designating nonbank SIFIs. On July 18, FSOC applied the designation to 8 financial clearinghouses. As we have said many times, we do not believe regulated insurance activities pose systemic risk to the U.S. financial system. In the event that certain insurance companies are named SIFIs, the impact is a matter of public debate with some policy analysts focusing on the benefits and others focusing on the costs. My view is that the impact will depend on how the final prudential rules are written.","So far, Federal Reserve officials have signaled their intention to adapt the rules to the unique circumstances of nonbank financial firms. In recent congressional testimony, Fed officials have said the bank-centric capital rules would likely be a bad fit for insurance companies. There is a recognition that insurance companies have different asset and liability structures than banks and that the appropriate regulation needs to take that into account.","Now let me provide an update on recent M&A activity. As I've said previously, we take a portfolio view of our business, investing in markets we consider core and divesting from those that do not meet our strategic priorities or financial requirements. Earlier this week, we closed on the sale of a significant portion of our Caribbean and Central American operations to Pan-American Life Insurance Group, which was initially announced last November. Also this week, we closed on the acquisition of Aviva plc's life insurance operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania, which expands MetLife's presence in growth markets in Eastern Europe. Our views on M&A remain consistent. Any transaction we pursue must compare favorably to alternative uses of capital.","Before I hand the call over to Eric, I also want to take a moment to highlight the completion of the senior executive team here at MetLife. Yesterday, Chris Townsend started as our President for Asia based in Hong Kong. Chris comes to us from Chartis, where he served as CEO of their Asia Pacific region with 4,700 employees in 15 countries. Chris has a strong background in the area of capital management and portfolio optimization, as well as the direct-to-consumer business, which is an important part of our Asia operations.","And right after Labor Day, John Hele will be starting as MetLife's new CFO. John is a highly qualified Chief Financial Officer with over 30 years of broad experience in the financial services industry. He comes to us from Arch Capital Group, where he was Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Previously, he was Chief Financial Officer of ING Group, one of the largest financial services companies in the world. Earlier in his career, John spent 11 years with Merrill Lynch in investment banking, marketing and finance positions.","Finally, I want to thank Eric Steigerwalt who has done an excellent job as Interim CFO. Upon the arrival of John Hele, Eric will devote himself full time to leading our Retail business and reporting to Bill Wheeler, President of the Americas division.","With that, I will hand the call over to Eric.","Eric T. Steigerwalt","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.33 per share, for the second quarter. This quarter's results included a few significant items, which I will discuss shortly, that benefited operating earnings by $0.02 per share. Overall, our strong results continue to demonstrate the resiliency of our businesses and our focus on pricing, underwriting and expense discipline across all of our regions. Interest margins were favorable due to strong variable investment income, which was significantly above our planned range and higher recurring net investment income. As we have stated in prior calls, we have been able to maintain strong spreads despite this low rate environment due to our ALM discipline, private origination capabilities and the effectiveness of our hedging programs. In addition, we continue to manage crediting rates prudently and have additional capacity to lower rates on our interest-rate-sensitive products.","In the Americas, we saw favorable underwriting results in Non-Medical Health and had significant improvement in property\/casualty as compared to the record catastrophes in the prior year quarter. We also had solid results in Latin America, particularly in Mexico and Argentina. In addition, expenses remained very much under control. Our overall expense ratio was 24.1% on a reported basis in the quarter and 23.2% when adjusting for pension and postretirement benefits.","Now I'll walk you through our financial results and point out some of the highlights. First, let me discuss some significant items included in the second quarter results. Pretax variable investment income was $371 million. After taxes and the impact of deferred acquisition costs, variable investment income was $242 million, or $0.07 per share, above the top of our 2012 guidance range. This performance was primarily driven by strong private equity returns. I should remind you that we report our private equity funds on a one-quarter lag, therefore, we would expect that returns in our private equity portfolio in the third quarter will be impacted by market performance in the second quarter.","In the Americas, our property & casualty business incurred catastrophe losses of $94 million after tax, which was $44 million after tax, or $0.04 per share, above our second quarter plan provision of $50 million after tax. These higher-than-expected catastrophes were partially offset by a favorable non-cat prior year development reserve release, primarily in our auto business, of $25 million after tax, or $0.02 per share.","In our Asia region, operating earnings were negatively impacted by $17 million, or $0.02 per share, due to a DAC model refinement in Japan.","In our EMEA region, operating earnings benefited from a $12 million after-tax, or $0.01 per share, release of negative VOBA in Greece as customers have shifted away from interest-sensitive pension products to products with more liquidity.","And finally, our Corporate & Other segment had 2 individual items, which each negatively impacted earnings by a little over $0.01 per share. These items relate to expenses from our efficiency initiative and our Japan JV run-off book of business.","Now let's take a look at the results in the quarter by region. For the Americas, reported operating earnings were $1.1 billion for the second quarter, up 11% versus the prior year quarter. The primary drivers for this earnings growth were in our Retail and Group, Voluntary and Worksite Benefits segments. The Retail segment reported operating earnings of $380 million for the second quarter, up 14% as compared to the prior year quarter, driven primarily by the annuity segment. Operating earnings for annuities were $226 million in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year as the business continues to enjoy strong core spreads, higher fee income due to separate account asset growth and lower expenses, partially offset by market true-ups in the quarter. Deferred annuity spreads, as reflected in our quarterly financial supplement, were 301 basis points in the quarter, down modestly from the record spreads in the first quarter but up 44 basis points year-over-year. This improvement was due mainly to higher derivative income, primarily from interest rate floors, as well as lower crediting rates.","Our Group, Voluntary and Worksite segment reported operating earnings of $295 million for the quarter, up 29% versus the prior year quarter, driven by the Non-Medical Health and property\/casualty businesses. Non-Medical Health reported operating earnings of $133 million in the quarter, up 22% year-over-year, mainly on improved underwriting earnings across the product set. The Non-Medical Health benefit ratio for the quarter was 86.1%, a 140-basis-point improvement in the ratios compared to the prior year quarter of 87.5% and well within our expectations.","In dental, our underwriting trends remain favorable as a result of stable utilization combined with our disciplined pricing strategy. Also, disability results improved due to a lower LTD incidence rate compared to the prior year quarter and plan. However, recoveries, while better than the prior year, continued to remain below plan in the second quarter.","Property & casualty operating earnings were $44 million in the quarter, up $100 million versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower catastrophes as compared to the record prior year levels. That said, pretax catastrophe losses of $144 million were above our plan. The combined ratio for property & casualty was 102.3%, or 83.4% excluding catastrophes in the quarter. This result was significantly better than the combined ratio of 121.7%, or 85.9% excluding cats in the second quarter of 2011.","Latin America operating earnings were $135 million, up 5% year-over-year. On a constant rate basis, operating earnings were up 19% due to business growth across the region, operating synergies and higher investment yields. Also, underwriting results were favorable to plan, primarily in Mexico. We expect underwriting in Latin America to continue to be favorable for the balance of the year.","Mortality results in the U.S. were modestly unfavorable in the quarter compared to the prior year quarter. Group life's loss ratio for the quarter was 87.3%, higher than the very strong prior year quarter of 82.1% but right within our expectations. Retail life's mortality ratio was 85.6% in the quarter, higher than the prior year quarter of 84.4%. However, reinsurance recoveries were better in the quarter, resulting in an improvement of overall underwriting results year-over-year.","Premiums, fees and other revenues for the Americas were $8.4 billion, down 1% from the prior year quarter. Higher separate account fees and retail annuities, solid dental premiums in Non-Medical Health were offset by lower pension closeouts. In Non-Medical Health, results this quarter reflect nearly $100 million of premiums from the TRICARE Dental contract, which became effective May 1. Also, in Latin America, while revenues were up 1% year-over-year, they were up 13% on a constant rate basis, driven by growth in accident and health and strong immediate annuity sales.","Now let me turn to the Asia region. Operating earnings in the Asia region were $275 million, up 61% from $171 million in the prior year quarter and up 25% after adjusting for onetime items, most notably $44 million of higher claims and expenses in the second quarter of 2011 as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. We are seeing solid growth in new business in Japan, as well as strong persistency gains year-over-year, particularly for accident and health products. Premiums, fees and other revenues in Asia were $2.3 billion, up 6% from the prior year quarter on both the reported and constant rate basis. Growth was driven by new business in Japan and persistency gains in both Japan and Korea. In addition, total sales for the region grew 13%, driven by Japan, which was up 33% year-over-year, as well as strong growth in China and Australia. For the region, key product drivers were life and accident and health sales in Japan and A&H sales in China, as well as group sales in Australia.","In EMEA, operating earnings were $82 million, up 28% from the second quarter of 2011 and up 46% on a constant rate basis. This increase was due to expense improvements, business growth in several countries and the benefit of a onetime item in the quarter that I discussed earlier. EMEA premiums, fees and other revenues were $815 million, down 4% versus the prior year quarter on a reported basis and up 3% on a constant rate basis. Finally, EMEA sales grew 13% compared to the second quarter of 2011, driven by Turkey, credit life sales in Russia and strong sales in our Gulf countries. This is a solid result despite the challenging market conditions across the region.","Now let me turn to investments. Let's start with our realized investment gains and losses. In the second quarter, we had after-tax investment portfolio net gains of $4 million. Included in this net gain were impairments of $36 million after-tax. We expect investment portfolio net losses to remain relatively modest for the remainder of the year.","Moving to our commercial mortgage holdings. This portfolio continues to perform well. As of June 30, our valuation allowance was $300 million, down from $368 million at the end of the first quarter. The loan-to-value ratio of our portfolio improved again this quarter to 59% from 60% as valuations continue to improve in the markets where we invest. Additionally, as of June 30, there were no delinquent loans in the portfolio and no losses recorded during the quarter on this $41 billion portfolio.","Finally, with respect to our derivatives portfolio, we had after-tax gains of $1.3 billion that were driven primarily by lower interest rates and the impact of MetLife's credit spreads. As a reminder, derivative gains or losses related to MetLife's credit spreads do not have an economic impact on the company.","Now let me discuss the balance sheet and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies at June 30 totaled approximately $5.3 billion, which is on track with our 2012 guidance. This includes a $1.5 billion residual capital remittance from our Japan operation in May as it converted from a branch to a subsidiary, offset by the deployment of $397 million as we repaid senior debt that matured in June. Our Japan solvency margin ratio on the new basis was 847% as of March 31, 2012, and well above our target ratio of 600%. Due to accounting rules, this included the effect of the plan residual capital remittance, which was largely offset by a surplus relief transaction that occurred in the first quarter.","Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our U.S. stat earnings and capital position. Our preliminary second quarter 2012 statutory operating earnings and net income for our domestic insurance companies were approximately $230 million and $630 million, respectively. The results were impacted by higher reserves related to the market performance in the quarter. While reserve adjustments go through the income statement, the hedges in our derivatives portfolio do not go through the income statement but instead are reflected in unrealized gains. Therefore, our total adjusted capital, or TAC, increased by $2.1 billion in the quarter, primarily due to unrealized gains on derivatives and other invested assets, and now stands at approximately $30 billion as of June 30. For the first 6 months of 2012, statutory operating earnings and statutory net income were approximately $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.","In conclusion, MetLife had another very good quarter. Our margins remain strong as we continue to focus on generating profitable growth through pricing, underwriting, expense and investment discipline. As a result, we have been able to grow earnings, maintain a strong balance sheet and capital position in a very challenging environment.","And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator so we can take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Question, I guess, for Steve. On the capital, I appreciate that you can't really talk about what the Fed and the FDIC might do, but this is a management team that's always been sort of planning for contingencies. And as we think about the capital that's building here, I think you're pretty much on track as you said in terms of where you're going to be at the end of the year. If you can't return capital to shareholders, what is Plan B in terms of redeploying that capital? I mean, does M&A all of a sudden become a lot more compelling? And do you think there's opportunities out there or anything in the pension transfer market? I mean, just kind of get a sense of what's going to happen to this capital that's clearly building and is not needed for your core business right now?","Steven A. Kandarian","I think it's premature for me to say that we'll do one thing or another. We're still working hard to de-bank and be able to take capital actions. In terms of M&A, I wouldn't say that if we have interim period where we can't return capital or raise our dividend that, that somehow changes our analysis around whether we should buy or not buy a company that's for sale at some price. So I would still look at it as -- it needs to be accretive to earnings. We're not going to let our standards slip based upon our inability in the short term to return capital to our shareholders above the current levels of our dividend.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's great. But is there anything out there that you're seeing versus, perhaps, the last time you spoke to us in terms of M&A opportunities? Or is it pretty much the same?","Steven A. Kandarian","As you know, we look at most anything that is in our general scope of businesses we're in currently. And I'm sure you're aware there are number of properties today for sale. I anticipate there'll be a number of other properties available for sale in the coming months and years as well, particularly in light of capital rules in Europe and elsewhere. So we're remaining disciplined. I think MetLife has proven over the years that we don't get caught up in the frenzy of the moment in terms of buying properties. And I've said before that we're not going to adjust our standards around what is a good transaction or not a good transaction, either strategically or in terms of pricing of a deal based upon what the competition is doing. We're going to remain disciplined, and we're confident that we can, over time, make appropriate acquisitions at prices that make sense for our shareholders.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then my follow-up question or second question is for Bill Wheeler. Obviously, the underwriting results in the Americas were strong. I think we're seeing some mixed results from some of your peers. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of pricing, particularly in some of the group insurance lines and if you think that kind of what you're seeing in the market is truly reflective of the current interest rate environment or are people sort of pricing based on an expectation that eventually rates will rise? Just any color there would be helpful.","William J. Wheeler","Sure. Well, you kind of mixed 2 ideas there. In terms of sort of group underwriting, I would say that the environment is clearly better. And there are number of people, I think, who were probably too aggressive. I think they're -- it's caught up with them and their results. And so I think they're showing a lot more discipline now, and that's just good for us. And I think the other thing, too, obviously, is that our underwriting discipline over the last couple of years, the contrast is pretty stark with some of our peers. So I think that's good. In terms of interest rates and how that might be influencing pricing, we've seen yet another kind of dip here in interest rates from the 10-year Treasuries sort of the 2-ish range down to 1.5. I think that I'm not sure everybody's caught up yet with that reality in terms of their pricing. And so I would guess you're going to see more pricing adjustments coming from the industry because of it. I think when interest rates get this low, obviously, that really starts to pressure ROIs, product sales. But it takes a little bit of time, I think, for pricing to adjust. And I'm sure some people probably think that, \"Gee, I'll just wait and I'm sure it will get better. How could it possibly get lower?\" But I think people have been making -- saying that line for quite a while, and now it's not come true. So we view this as an opportunity, obviously, to change prices if we need to in certain areas. And we've been pretty -- pricing pretty aggressively in places like UL. And obviously, the variable annuity business for quite some time now. And that's had an effect on our sales levels there, but I think that makes good sense to do.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I was hoping -- maybe for Bill. I was hoping we could revisit the slide from your Investor Day and get a sense for how things maybe have or haven't changed given the first half of the year results. And the slide I'm referring to is the one that showed sort of 3 different categories of return on equity with a bunch of different businesses categorized in 15% or greater, 10% to 15% and then under 10%, and in particular, focus on the group disability and the annuity business, both of which were under 10%. I'm wondering if there's been any change there.","William J. Wheeler","I think with regard to the annuity business, the answer is probably no. But our new product sales ROIs in this quarter, even with relatively low interest rates, we calculate our ROI to be about high-13s as an average for the quarter. Probably by the end of the quarter, given where interest rates had moved to, it would probably move to something more like 13%. But we're changing some more of our features on our VAs. We're changing, altering the dollar-for-dollar feature, which I think will improve the ROI in the out quarters. So it's a big block. So it's hard to move the overall ROE there. But new product pricing is good. Secondly, with regard to disability, our book is really starting to turn. And you can see that. In terms of our underwriting results and the profitability of it, again, this is in pretty stark contrast to most of our peers in the group disability business who -- and I'm hard-pressed to actually explain why, but our book is different than theirs. And if you've been aggressive, I think you're getting punished for it. But incidence rates are down. Claim closure rates are still elevated. And so we're -- so underwriting isn't yet where it should be or could be, we think, in the future. But clearly, the ROE of that book is improving.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And Bill, just as a quick follow-up on that, I mean, in the group disability business, what does -- how do we think about 100 basis points of loss ratio improvement there? How much does that move the ROE, roughly?","William J. Wheeler","I'm not sure off the top of my head. Crudely, something like 1 point.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then separately, I guess a question for Eric. Just thinking about Asia and EMEA, those are the 2 other primary segments where I don't think we really have any strong or any real idea what the ROEs are today. Can you give us some sense?","Eric T. Steigerwalt","That's an interesting question, John. We have not been giving any returns out on the segments, as you know. We've been working through our economic capital that is associated with how we allocate equity. The returns, I would say, in both of those operations are quite good, but I'm not going to give out a number.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And -- understood. Maybe some further disclosure going down the road. Last one, just a quick one, given the severity of drought conditions, is there any reason we should be thinking about potential losses on the agricultural mortgage portfolio?","Steven J. Goulart","John, it's Steve Goulart. The answer is no. I mean, we've obviously been following that closely in our portfolio, but we don't think it would have any material impact. And also remember, an advent in that market has been crop insurance over the last few years. So most of our borrowers are insured through their crop insurance programs as well. But we don't think it will have any material impact on us.","Operator","[Audio Gap]","Bank of America.","Unknown Analyst","I think this question is for Steve Kandarian. There is a debate about whether GAAP or statutory will be the basis for regulation of insurance companies if they are designated nonbank SIFIs. And I'm just wondering, is it reasonable to assume that the bank capital model framework that underpins the CCAR analysis would be a workable model for life insurers as long as there are revisions to how separate accounts are treated, the capital charges are designed to appropriately reflect the risk of corporates and just that there's generally a clear understanding that derivatives are used exclusively to hedge economic risks and approach that can introduce, I guess, what we would call uneconomic outcomes on a GAAP basis from quarter to quarter?","Steven A. Kandarian","So we've said that our feeling is that the RBC framework really makes the most sense in terms of regulating the industry. Obviously, there's improvements that have been made to the RBC framework over a number of years. There could be further improvements made, but we think that's the best way to look at the risks in our industry. If it is decided that insurance companies are deemed as being systemically risky, then the framework will come out of the Federal Reserve. At this point in time, we really don't have a great deal of insight as to how they will sort all that out. If they use more of a bank framework with a modification, we'll have to see the details of that to determine whether or not we think that is an appropriate way to regulate a company like ours. They have made statements on the record out of Washington at the most senior levels of the Fed, the Treasury that a purely banking model would not make sense in terms of regulating the insurance industries. So those are favorable comments from our perspective. But again, the details are going to be the key here, and those details have not been sorted out. They have not been finalized. It's very early days on the details of the regulatory framework, if there is one for us.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And my follow-up is for Bill Wheeler on the interest rate assumption behind product pricing. Bill, I think you mentioned that VA marginal returns, it sounds like, came down only slightly during the quarter despite a material decline in the 10-year Treasury yield. Did I hear that correctly? And if I did, I mean, I guess that's implying that this product is not nearly as interest-sensitive, maybe, as some people anticipate?","William J. Wheeler","Well, okay. So first, you used the phrase -- word marginal. I just need to correct you. There's nothing -- our -- these are not marginal returns. These are fully allocated, fully costed returns on the product.","Unknown Analyst","I'm sorry, I meant marginal as meaning new business returns.","William J. Wheeler","No, I know. It's just we were good to capture [ph] it. I took the opportunity. Well, look, they're obviously somewhat interest-rate sensitive. But remember now, the underlying guarantees and the minimum interest rates for annuitization are still very low. I think the minimum annuitization right now is 1% in the guarantees. So even though, yes, they came down, there's still a cushion there, obviously. And there's a lot of parts of the economics of these products. It isn't all about the guarantee, of course. The base fee itself is very profitable. So sure, there's been -- when I say there's no interest rate sensitivity, a couple of quarters ago or 2 quarters ago, the ROI here was in the 15s or higher. So we have seen it tick down. I'm not real happy with high 13s, but I think given where interest rates are, that's pretty good. So there's been some sensitivity, but the point of it is this is still a product which earns above our cost of capital. And so we think we're still adding value with each sale. And that's the most important thing.","Unknown Analyst","And just one quick one on the life side. If you were to look at the appropriate -- what you would view to be the appropriate pricing of interest-sensitive individual life products, I know that's a broad category, but how much do prices have to change if we were to assume 1.5% 10-year Treasury versus 2.5%? Is that a very significant change given how the products are already designed with the minimums that are in place today?","William J. Wheeler","I think it's a reasonably significant change. We just priced one of our interest-rate sensitive products. One of those interest-rate sensitive products, we raised prices 15%. Okay. Now that was not just in the last -- based on interest rates in the last couple of quarters, but it's, I mean -- but we've -- pricing in the UL category has been moving up aggressively now for a couple of years, and I don't think that's going to stop.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Mark Finkelstein from Evercore Partners.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I guess I'll ask the somewhat obvious follow-up, which is, are there any capital impacts with this lower rate as you look out to 2016, above and beyond what you kind of told us in your interest rate disclosures at this lower rate?","Eric T. Steigerwalt","Mark, it's Eric. So let's just review the bidding on what we did previously. We said that in the last interest rate presentation that Steve referred to, that we would have no stat reserve strengthening but that we expected to have modest actions year after year after year. We said there'd be no GAAP loss recognition in the U.S. We said we'd probably have, let's call it, $400 million to $450 million after-tax impact on DAC mostly occurring in the back end of that 5-year outlook. And we said there's potential pressure on Retirement Products goodwill. So at this point, and I'm just going to make a blanket statement here, anything I say here is going to be subject to what we learn in actual testing, okay, which is beginning, both for CFT, loss recognition, goodwill testing, et cetera, okay? So having said that, I think maybe the change here would be, I feel compelled to say that, modest stat reserves strengthening could be required if rates stay low. For GAAP loss recognition, as we think about it from the point of view of August 1 here, August 2, whatever date this is, we don't see a lot of loss recognition in the near term. But again, we'll have to see what happens as we go through testing. We still don't see, given our current methodology, a big DAC impact in the next couple of years. And I would certainly then finally add that there remains pressure on our goodwill, specifically for the Retirement Products. We're starting goodwill testing now, and we'll have to see where we come out as we get to the end of the year here. So I'm increasing it, using the word modest, but always subject to what we learn as we go through all the various tests.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Question on Corporate Benefit Funding and I guess more directly on the pension closeout market. Obviously, you saw PRU do a big transaction in the quarter. AIG has talked more constructively about this market. And I'm interested in how you're thinking about, one, the opportunities with pension closeouts; and two, I guess how you're thinking about the opportunity in terms of capital deployment that can be larger transactions, but on the other hand, it also adds significant assets to equity leverage. So if you could just kind of comment on the opportunities and broadly how you're thinking about that business now.","William J. Wheeler","Sure, Mark. I think you framed it out really well. The General Motors transaction, I think it's fair to view that as a bit of a catalyst. I think that's causing other corporate treasurers of large traditional companies with old traditional pension plans to think hard about what they should be doing. And certainly, there's a lot more conversation now than there was pre-GM. My expectation -- but the can of that, of course, is interest rates keep ticking down. And I think that makes pension closeouts more difficult. So there's contrary trend influences there. But I do think you'll see more deals, more big deals, despite the low interest rates. In terms of how we're approaching it, each -- a big pension closeout is a big sort of one-off transaction. It's not unfair to think of it like a big M&A deal. It's a large transfer of assets. So the capital considerations there are significant. And so we, just like an M&A deal or anything else, which is a big capital transaction, have to evaluate that capital that would get allocated to that deal versus other alternatives that are available to the company. We will not do a big closeout just so we can print a big deal, okay? If it doesn't add shareholder value and get us the right kind of returns on our capital, we will not do it. And so that's got to be our discipline. And look, I think our track record about having -- being disciplined about those kind of decisions is pretty good. So that's got to be how we look at it.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then finally just a follow-up on annuities. When do you expect the pricing changes that you've announced, including, I guess, changes to the dollar-for-dollar withdrawal benefit to be implemented and would the IRRs on the product at this rate environment be pushed over 500% -- or 15% with those changes?","William J. Wheeler","So the dollar-for-dollar adjustment, I think, it was implemented in August. I think there are other changes we're making. Some of those are occurring this month. So I guess we're in August, so technically I meant some were implemented in July. So I don't think the dollar-for-dollar change, given where interest rates are, will push it back to 15%. But it will push it, I think, closer to 14%.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","But the overall changes, do you get over 15%?","William J. Wheeler","Well, no. The other changes won't necessarily improve the ROI, but they'll -- because they are more about the in-force. So it's the ROI on new sales.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Most have been asked. I guess a question for Bill Wheeler on Latin American business. I mean, this is obviously a region that you guys like. I think you want to get bigger here given that you didn't get a lot kind of with the Alico acquisition. But I guess how are you thinking about the opportunity there given the decline in short-term rates, how they've moved noticeably lower? And does that really kind of begin to push consumers to begin to kind of venture closer to the products that you guys are offering in that region?","William J. Wheeler","I think in most of the countries, our interest rates -- the interest rates aren't having, I would say, a big impact on our insurance sales. I think the one area where you see this phenomenon where it's a real trade-off between an insurance product and a bank deposit is in Brazil. And we're not really very much in that where insurance products obviously have a sort of a built-in interest rate. We're not very heavy into that market, and we're certainly not trying to compete with those kinds products. Latin America, the reason Latin America is really attractive to us is it's all about an emerging middle class that are first-time purchasers of life insurance. So life insurance as a percentage of GDP is growing very nicely, and then GDP itself is growing nicely. And there are markets that are developing. Our fastest-growing segments in Latin America right now are in direct marketing, okay, which, obviously, has nothing to do with interest rates, really. It's all about the channel management and driving growth. In general, I would tell you that we really do like Latin America. Obviously, it's a big segment for us. The returns are very good. The growth rates are good. Our top line growth adjusting for currency was 13% this quarter. We have very good management teams down there. They're seasoned. And our market position, we're #1 in 4 different -- 4 of the 6 Latin American countries we participate in. So we're very well positioned. So obviously, it's an area where there will be a lot of emphasis going forward.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe a question for Steve Goulart. Given the challenge to find yield, and I guess coupled with the challenge to deploy, some of the capital that you guys have, curious if you're at all enticed by the yields in Europe and if you'd consider putting more money to work there to offset some of the low rates -- low new money rates you guys are seeing?","Steven J. Goulart","Well, I think we've always been a pretty conservative investor. And it's always most important to make sure that we can pay off our liabilities. So we're always looking for relative value propositions, but I don't think we're comfortable with, by and large, what you see in peripheral Europe. Just given our European portfolios though, we continue to invest in Europe, but they tend to be in the safer economies and in very strong corporates.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Hall with Wells Fargo.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","In Bill's commentary, he mentioned cost of capital. And I was just wondering, what is it that you consider to be your cost of capital? And in that construct, what are you using in considering your beta as right now?","William J. Wheeler","That's a very interesting question. So maybe I'll talk a little bit. Maybe I'll let Mr. Kandarian -- because this is obviously -- this a big focus inside MetLife right now. So I would just say our cost of capital, I would say, in general, sort of the rule of thumb we're looking at in terms of how we price products is roughly 12%. And that's sort of a blended cost of capital across all products. And that's obviously up over what we -- I would think most people would have said what it was a couple of years ago. So when we price products, if they don't, in our minds, if they don't earn at least 12%, we think we're destroying value. And so that's how -- that's guiding us in our pricing. But in terms of sort of the general philosophy on where we are, I'll let Steve do that.","Steven A. Kandarian","Hi, John. We look at this very closely. We've talked about it internally in terms of not just product pricing but overall strategy at MetLife. And say our -- if you kind of impute a cost of capital to MetLife's equity right now, it's higher than the 12% number that Bill just referred to, and we believe that is a temporary level of equity capital cost to us. And we have to really look at this in a longer time frame because basically, right now, the markets are very volatile, probably driven by things like low rates, obviously, for our industry, regulatory overhang for larger insurers and so on. And that's driven up the perception in the marketplace about what our beta is. And it certainly is now closer to a 2 beta as opposed to historical norm closer to 1 or 1.1. So as we think about our business, I wouldn't, for example, on the flip side say if our beta drops just hypothetically to below 1, let's say 0.6 or something, that all of a sudden, we're going to print a bunch of business at 8%. We wouldn't think that would be the prudent thing to do longer term. Similarly, if things are spiking up because of near-term volatility out there, we have to kind of look past that at a short timeframe. So Bill gave you the answer about how we're looking at our products right now, but clearly, our cost of capital is higher than historical because our beta is significantly higher than the historical 1.1x that we've seen.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just sort of a follow-up, and this is going out the plank a little bit. Say MetLife is designated nonbank SIFI. What effect do you think that would have on your cost of capital?","Steven A. Kandarian","John, I think it depends on what the rules look like. And analysts have looked at this both ways and said, \"On the positive side, you get the good housekeeping seal of approval of the federal government. You're too big to fail. You're safe to do business with. It could lower your beta is one theory.\" The flip side is there could be very harsh rules around the regulation and capital requirements, and that can make you unattractive in some ways. That could raise your cost of capital. And 2 of the rules are written. I think it's just we're all speculating as to the ultimate impact. What we have said, certainly, on the record is that we don't think that we really should fall under Dodd-Frank in this regard and should not be designated systemic. But if we are so designated, let's be sure these rules really are appropriate for the risks of our company.","Operator","And our last question of the day comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher with Credit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question was just on the interest rate impact guidance. Is the reason -- I guess this should be for Eric. Is the reason the incremental drop in rates has essentially minimal impact on EPS for the next 3 years because your initial guide was conservative enough and that it didn't assume much benefit from lowering crediting rates but now you are? Or can you help us get to kind of what's behind those assumptions?","Eric T. Steigerwalt","Look, these are big exercises. So obviously, everything is thought about within a range. And when we went out with that guidance, we thought we had a reasonable range here. And now that we've done a refresh of this, I think it kind of confirms what we thought previously and now just simply adds to that. Now we've got a couple of things going on here. We always thought when we made that presentation last year that we would -- that we not only had room in crediting rates but that we would take advantage of that if rates continue to decline. That's number one. In some of our portfolios, I think we're probably better cash flow matched than anybody externally would actually think. Third, we've got a lot of interest rate protection. We've got all of these floors and swaptions and swaps that we've talked about. Floor income year-over-year is meaningful and could continue to be meaningful depending on if rates stay here or, frankly, even if they went a little bit lower. I guess I'll give you a sense because I've know we've talked about it this publicly. Like in our UL block, 1\/3 of that block is at minimum guarantees. So here where we are today, end of the second quarter, 1\/3 of the block is at minimum guarantees. I don't know what you would have thought that number was, but that means, obviously, we've got 2\/3 to go. It's in the 70% range on the general account annuity blocks. And so putting all of those things together, the impact from where we were to here is minimal.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Got it. And just 2 quick follow-ups, if I could. Eric, you had mentioned Retirement Products goodwill potentially comes under scrutiny, I guess, at year end. Can you remind us how big that is?","Eric T. Steigerwalt","$1.7 billion.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, we're starting to see some of your competitors in long-term care, obviously, having some pressure because of low rates, and that's just mechanical. But in addition to that, you're also seeing adverse claims trends. I'm curious what you guys are seeing because I think generally you have a newer vintage book. But can you comment at all on what you're seeing on long-term care and sort of the outlook for that business?","Eric T. Steigerwalt","Well, Bill would like to do that one.","William J. Wheeler","I just want to prove I know. Let me start by saying just to remind everyone, we exited the long-term business a couple of years ago. There was a modest tick-up in claims activity this quarter, so underwriting results were down a little bit. But it wasn't very material. In terms of kind of managing the block, I used the word immunized it loosely, but we put in some very long-term interest rate swaps that are in that block to kind of really protect ourselves from just this sort of scenario. So we think we're managing interest rates really well there. That said, it's possible that there might need to be some stat. We might add the stat reserves. We have done that historically, I think you know, not necessarily because we absolutely had to but because we were starting to get close to the line. So we've been making installment payments. So all along the way in terms of long-term care, and I think that's been prudent. And the way that things have played out, it's really prudent. So we're in good shape, I think.","John McCallion","Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And have a great rest of the day.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note on the forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release.","With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.","John Hall","Welcome to MetLife's second quarter 2019 earnings call. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review.","Joining me this morning on the call are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management.","Last night, we released an expanded set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. The content for the slides begins following the romanette pages that feature a number of GAAP reconciliations. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that, given the busy earnings call scheduled this morning will extend no longer than the top of the hour. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. After Q&A, Michel will conclude with some closing remarks.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Michel.","Michel Khalaf","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. During my first 90 days as President and CEO of MetLife, we have worked to reinforce the connection between our purpose and our strategy while strengthening our focus on consistent execution. For more than 150 years, this company has been helping people protect their families and their finances so that they can realize their full potential. We are committed to strong financial performance so that we can continue fulfilling this noble purpose for decades to come.","MetLife had an excellent start to 2019 and last night, we reported strong second quarter results as well. Quarterly adjusted earnings totaled $1.3 billion or $1.38 per share, up from $1.30 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Excluding notable items, we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.46 per share compared with $1.36 per share a year ago. Net income of $1.7 billion exceeded adjusted earnings, primarily due to interest rate-driven gains in our derivative portfolio. Net income totaled $845 million a year ago. Market conditions were mixed overall. Strong equity markets fueled the rebound in variable investment income. These gains were offset by the impact of falling interest rates on recurring investment margins and by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.","Although, the interest rate environment remains challenging, our results demonstrate that we have become a less market-sensitive company. John McCallion will discuss the interest rate environment in greater detail. MetLife's direct expense ratio benefited from solid revenue growth, favorable items and continued expense discipline. Excluding notable items and pension risk transfers, our direct expense ratio was 12.3% compared with 13% a year ago. Notable items in the quarter included the expenses associated with our unit cost initiative, which reduced adjusted earnings by $70 million. This initiative remains on track to deliver $800 million of annual pre-tax margin improvement by 2020, underscoring our commitment to expense discipline. Finally, MetLife's book value per share, a key indicator of shareholder value was $47.09, up 10% from a year ago.","Moving to specific business highlights. Our flagship Group Benefits business reported strong adjusted earnings results in the second quarter, driven by volume growth and expense margins. Group Benefits sales are up 12% year-to-date, with growth across all markets. Voluntary products continue to see a particularly strong sales momentum.","Adjusted earnings for our Retirement and Income Solutions business matched a strong quarter year ago, with higher variable investment income and favorable underwriting offsetting weaker recurring investment margins. Adjusted earnings for our Property & Casualty segment benefited from favorable underwriting, primarily lower incurred catastrophe losses, reflecting the re-underwriting of our homeowners business.","Adjusted earnings for our Asia business were essentially flat, relative to a strong result a year ago. The negative impact of a strong U.S. dollar relative to most Asian currencies was offset by strong volume growth. Competition in the Japanese foreign currency denominated product market pressured FX sales from a year ago. This was partially offset by higher accident and health sales in Japan, as well as continued strong sales in China.","Our Latin America business reported an 18% increase in adjusted earnings year-over-year. This was mostly due to strong Chilean encaje returns and good volume growth. For our EMEA business, adjusted earnings were down 10% from a very strong second quarter of 2018, but they were in line with our expectations on a constant currency basis. Sales strength was evident in the group business in the U.K. and credit life in Turkey.","Overall, it was another strong quarter for our company. I believe we are making steady progress towards establishing a track record of consistent execution. One of my top 2019 priorities, as President and CEO of MetLife, is to complete the strategic review of our businesses. All our executive group members, along with many other leaders across the company are fully engaged in this process. I am pleased with the progress we are making on this next horizon of our strategy and we look forward to sharing the full results with investors on December 12.","Our strategic changes are more likely to be evolutionary than revolutionary. We remain firmly committed to certain bedrock principles around deploying capital efficiently, generating strong risk-adjusted returns and driving profitable growth. Just as important, we are strengthening our efficiency mindset so that expense discipline and continuous improvement become embedded in our company's DNA. Consistent with our principles, we are taking steps to optimize our portfolio so that we can maximize the value of our highest potential businesses.","The recent announcement to sell our Hong Kong business provides a good example. MetLife has strong franchises throughout Asia and we are committed to the region. However, after a thorough review of the Hong Kong business, we did not see a path to scale or risk-adjusted returns above our cost of capital. By selling this business, we will free up additional resources to enhance value creation.","Strong value creation requires the right strategic choices, none more important than how we allocate capital. We always seek to deploy capital to produce the highest risk-adjusted returns whether through organic growth, M&A or returning capital to our shareholders.","In the second quarter, MetLife returned $750 million of capital through share repurchases. For the first two quarters of 2019, we have returned more than $2 billion to shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases. With only $20 million left on our prior authorization, our Board of Directors approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization last night. Sound capital management also demands close attention to capital structure.","MetLife, Inc. recently saw an opportunity to issue its first ever yen-denominated senior notes offering, one of the largest ever offerings of yen debt by a U.S. financial services company. We issued nearly $1.4 billion of yen-denominated senior notes and use some of the proceeds to pay down debt with an average coupon well above that of the new yen debt. All in, the payback period on recovering our make-whole fee is only 13 months.","In closing, we think the emerging picture of MetLife is clear. We are a financially strong company with a well-diversified portfolio of businesses that is focused on consistent execution. Our goal is to be a company that can perform well across a variety of economic environments. Our second quarter adjusted earnings results demonstrated that we are less exposed to market factors and that softness in one part of our business can often be offset by strength in another.","Across MetLife, our people feel energized by our performance and excited by our potential. As we develop the next horizon of our strategy, we will continue viewing all major decisions through the lens of value creation for our customers, our people and our shareholders.","With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to go through our second quarter results in greater detail.","John McCallion","Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will begin by discussing the 2Q 2019 supplemental slides that we released last evening, along with our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement.","Starting on page 5, the schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the second quarter of 2019. In the quarter, net income was $1.7 billion or $365 million higher than adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion. This variance is primarily due to higher net derivative gains resulting from the decline in interest rates in the quarter.","Overall, the results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. We had one notable item in the quarter as shown on page 6 and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. Expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings by $70 million after-tax or $0.07 per share. Adjusted earnings excluding the notable item were $1.4 billion or $1.46 per share.","On page 7, you can see the year-over-year adjusted earnings excluding notable items by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were essentially flat year-over-year and up 2% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were up 7% and 10% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases.","Overall, positive year-over-year drivers included solid volume growth, the impact from strong equity markets, favorable underwriting and better expense margins. Investment margins were modestly higher, as a strong rebound in variable investment income was mostly offset by lower recurring interest margins. In addition, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies and higher taxes relative to a favorable 2Q 2018 were partial offsets.","With regards to business performance, Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 19% year-over-year. The key drivers were better expense margins and solid volume growth. With respect to underwriting, favorable mortality in Group Life was mostly offset by less favorable Non-Medical Health results compared to the prior year. Group Life mortality ratio was 85.3%, which was favorable to the prior year quarter of 87.9% and at the low end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. Favorable results were primarily due to lower claim severity. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non-Medical Health was 75.4%, which is within our target range of 72% to 77%, though this result was less favorable than the prior year quarter of 73.1%, due to higher claim severity and disability.","Group Benefits continues to see strong momentum in the top line. Adjusted PFOs in the quarter were up 5% and year-to-date sales were up 12%, led by the growth in voluntary products across all markets. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were up 1% year-on-year. The key drivers were favorable underwriting margins and volume growth. This was mostly offset by lower investment margins as weaker recurring interest margins exceeded the positive contribution from variable investment income for this segment.","RIS investment spreads were 119 basis points in 2Q, 2019, down 10 basis points year-over-year, but up 23 basis points sequentially due to strong private equity returns and prepayment fees in the quarter. Despite the ongoing pressure from the inverted yield curve, we continue to expect full year RIS investment spreads to be in the bottom half of our 2019 guidance range of 100 to 125 basis points. RIS favorable underwriting was largely due to updated claim processes, which contributed approximately $30 million after tax. RIS adjusted PFOs were down 81% year-over-year, due to the strength of the FedEx PRT deal in the second quarter of 2018. Excluding PRTs, RIS PFOs were up 23% due to strong structured settlement sales. As for pension risk transfers, PFOs in the quarter were $556 million. We continue to see the PRT market as attractive, with a strong pipeline.","Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were up 11%, primarily due to favorable underwriting margins. Pre-tax cat losses of $78 million in the quarter were $30 million lower than the prior year quarter. With regards to the top line, P&C adjusted PFOs were up 2%, while sales were up 3% versus 2Q, 2018. Asia adjusted earnings were down 1%, but up 2% on a constant currency basis. The positive year-over-year drivers were favorable volume growth and better investment margins, which includes the impact of a regulatory change in China. These were partially offset by less favorable expense margins and favorable underwriting margins in the prior year quarter.","Asia assets under management, excluding fair value adjustments, grew 11% year-over-year. As part of our enhanced disclosures, we have now included Asia AUM as a key metric in our QFS. Asia sales were down 10% on a constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were down 12% primarily driven by a 32% year-over-year decline in foreign currency denominated annuity products. FX annuity products, which are primarily sold through bank channels, had a challenging quarter, given the drop in U.S. interest rates. We anticipate further challenges for FX annuity products in the second half of the year.","In contrast, we continue to see strong momentum in our A&H sales, which were up 12% year-over-year. A&H sales were aided by the popularity of our dollar-denominated rider, which we launched in November of 2018 and the increase in short-pay A&H products in advance of a tax regulatory change effective in October of this year. Other Asia sales were down 5% as growth in China and India were more than offset by lower sales in Korea.","Latin America adjusted earnings were up 10% and 18% on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were a favorable impact from capital markets on our Chilean encaje and volume growth across the region. Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 9% and 15% on a constant currency basis, driven by volume growth across the region led by higher annuity sales in Chile. Latin America sales were up 14% on a constant currency basis driven by higher sales in Chile and Mexico, as well as a large group case in Brazil.","EMEA adjusted earnings were down 10% but flat on a constant currency basis. Favorable underwriting, investment margins and volume growth, were offset by favorable expense margins in 2Q of 2018. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth across the region. EMEA sales were up 6% on a constant currency basis due to higher volumes in employee benefits in the United Kingdom and Egypt as well as Credit Life in Turkey. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 7% primarily due to favorable expense margins.","The benefit from higher variable investment income was entirely offset by lower recurring interest margins. With regards to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 53.9%, higher than the prior year quarter of 52.6% but within our annual target range of 50% to 55%. Mortality frequency was modestly higher than a year ago.","The LTC block continue to perform well as results were favorable versus the prior year quarter due to improved experience in rate actions. Corporate & Other adjusted loss excluding notable items was $237 million. The higher adjusted loss in the quarter was primarily driven by two items: First, we had a make-whole fee related to early retirement of debt in the quarter of $32 million after-tax; and second, an after-tax adjusted loss of $17 million, regarding a sale of a block of business that had previously been reinsured. Also, please keep in mind that the timing of preferred stock dividends varies by quarter.","In the first and third quarters of the year, we paid $32 million and in the second and fourth quarters, we paid $57 million. The company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 18.6% and within our 2019 guidance of 18% to 20%.","Now let's turn to page 8 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the past six quarters, including $334 million earned in the current quarter. Our private equity portfolio, which is accounted for on a one quarter lag, rebounded strongly this quarter. For the year-to-date VII was $508 million pre-tax and well on track toward meeting our 2019 guidance range of $800 million to $1 billion.","Now I'll discuss recurring investment income. Our new money rate was 4.01% versus a roll-off rate of 4.34% in 2Q, 2019. This compares to a new money rate of 3.98% and a roll-off rate of 4.52% in 2Q, 2018. Although, the gap between the new money rates and roll-off rates has narrowed, we would not expect parity to occur until we have a sustained U.S. 10-year Treasury yield of roughly 3% to 3.25%.","Turning to page 9. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2018 as well as the first two quarters of 2019. As we have stated previously, our goal is to realize $800 million of pre-tax profit margin improvement by 2020. This would represent an approximate 200 basis point decline in our annual direct expense ratio from the 2015 baseline year. We believe the annual direct expense ratio best reflects the impact on profit margins, as it captures the relationship of revenues and the expenses over which we have the most control. By successfully executing on our expense commitment, it will improve profit margins and provide capacity to fund future growth and innovation.","We have made consistent progress towards achieving our target by 2020. As the chart illustrates, we have already achieved 140 basis point improvement in the annual direct expense ratio from 2015 to 2018. For 2Q, 2019, we posted another strong result, as the direct expense ratio, excluding notable items and PRTs, came in at 12.3%. This was aided by favorable items including; lower interest on tax reserves and lower employee benefit costs related to market movements in the second quarter. Overall, these favorable items totaled roughly 20 basis points and followed 60 to 70 basis points of favorable items in 1Q, 2019.","Now let's turn to page 10. Given the drop in interest rates this quarter, we decided to add to this page on potential impacts to our income statement and balance sheet from low rates. First, we can confirm that the 2019 to 2021 adjusted earnings sensitivity that we previously provided is largely unchanged. Second, we expect our average 2019 and 2020 free cash flow ratio target of 65% to 75% to hold between a range of 1.5% to 4.5% on the 10-year U.S. Treasury. This is an update from our prior sensitivity guidance of 2% to 4.5%. And finally, the table at the bottom of page 10 provides the estimated impacts if we were to lower our long-term U.S. actuarial interest rate assumption of 4.25% by 25, 50 or 75 basis points. In each hypothetical scenario, we would not trigger GAAP loss recognition and would incur a relatively modest impact to net income.","I will now discuss our cash and capital position on page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at June 30, which is up from $3.2 billion at March 31. Holdco cash was elevated this quarter due to the timing of subsidiary dividends as well as the incremental debt issuance that Michel noted.","Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our capital position. As a reminder, for our U.S. companies, our 2018 combined NAIC RBC ratio was 402%, which compares to our new target ratio of 360% following U.S. tax reform. For our U.S. companies, preliminary second quarter 2019 statutory operating earnings were approximately $2.4 billion, and net earnings were approximately $1.9 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by $438 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to the impact of a prior year dividend from the investment subsidiary, partially offset by lower VA rider reserves and improved underwriting results.","We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.1 billion as of June 30, down 1% compared to December 31, 2018. Net earnings were more than offset by dividends paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 890% as of March 31, which is the latest public data.","Overall, MetLife had another strong quarter driven primarily by good fundamentals, growth in our businesses, solid underwriting and expense discipline. In addition, our cash and capital position as well as our balance sheet remains strong. Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Can you talk about the outlook for expenses as we move into the second half of the year? You mentioned some favorable items in the first half, so should we expect the expense ratio to move a little bit higher given timing and seasonal factors? And if that's the case, are there any businesses where they should be more evident?","Michel Khalaf","Hey, good morning, Erik. I would definitely reiterate that. That was kind of our commentary last year that we had some seasonality in expenses in the second half of the year. We tend to see those expenses rise in places like group in terms of as we go through the enrollment process. And as we mentioned in the script, the first quarter, we saw some benefits that we didn't expect to recur similar to the second quarter so we want to normalize for those things anyway in addition to just the seasonality point.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you. And then you mentioned that there haven't been any material changes to your low interest scenario guidance that you've given in the 10-K. Can you talk about any potential actions that you can take to mute the impact particularly as we look out to 2020 or 2021?","Michel Khalaf","Yes. Look, I think we've been spending quite a bit of time over the last several years. I think if you go back to, let's start with, why is the impact muted, first, I think we've been trying to shift our risk profile for some time now, and that's starting to take effect. Obviously, when you think about those results, we have some good ALM discipline and I think that's coming through in sensitivities that we have.","In terms of further actions, I think, yeah, look we're always considering, we're constantly reevaluating our ALM practices, looking at outlook in terms of interest rates and where the forward curve may be and things like that. So there are actions we can take, but everything is kind of on the margin. The most important thing we have is, price the business appropriately. And I think that's starting to come through and you can see that in that page.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kligerman","Hey, good morning. I'd like to talk a bit about the favorable - well, maybe low end of guidance, benefit ratios. So you came in at 85.3 on Group Life. And then, with the non-medical and you're guiding to 72 to 77. You came in at 75.4. That's after 72.9 last quarter and then 72.6 in 2018, so both of them are pretty much in the more favorable end of the guidance ranges. Can you talk a bit about the competitive environment out there and the ability to kind of stay in that kind of lower quadrant of your guidance?","Ramy Tadros","Good morning, Andrew. It's Ramy here. As you know, we do operate in a competitive environment, but the group business is a business that we've been investing in, in a disciplined way over time and we're seeing that strategy materialize. And I would say, in general, we look to differentiate beyond price. We look at the product set and the right product set that we have, our service capabilities our distribution reach.","So having said all of that, this is still insurance and you'd expect to see quarter-on-quarter volatility. So the mortality loss ratio, we did come in at the lower end of our range, but I would guide you for the full year number that's going to revert back somewhere to the middle of that range from a mortality perspective.","The Non-Medical Health benefit for this quarter was slightly above the midpoint, but if you actually look at it from a year-to-date basis, it was slightly below. So, again, on both of those ratios I would guide you towards the middle of our guidance and we feel confident that we're able to get there.","Andrew Kligerman","And no competitive pressures out there to kind of lower your prices?","Ramy Tadros","We do some - we do see competitive pressures, but we're able to hold our own and we're able to, in some cases, we walk away from business, but -- where we think pricing is irrational, but you could see from a top line perspective, you look at our persistency in our rate actions. Our PFO number is 5% year-on-year, which is smack in the middle of our range. So we have a number of levers at our disposal that we pull to hold our own and maintain both top line and bottom line here.","Andrew Kligerman","Excellent. And then just a follow-up question. In the Asian operations, so some weakness in Korea and then also some weakness in the FX-denominated sales in Japan. Again, I'm just kind of curious what happened in Korea? What's the competitive landscape like there? And same question with respect to Japan.","Kishore Ponnavolu","This is Kishore. Let me take the Korea question first. Year-on-year sales in Korea declined 14%. I want to give you a little bit of context in Korea. We have three channels in Korea. Our Korea agency channel that has held really well. Our general agency channel, which is a significant channel and our MFS channel which is a relatively smaller portion of our sales. In the GA channel, we sell mostly savings in retirement products, and that channel from a market perspective took a hit in the second quarter.","The overall market for savings in retirement products dropped by about 25%, and we believe that's because of the equity market volatility in Korea. So we got that our proportionate share there, but I want to shift to a positive note with regards to Korea is because we have a number of in-market actions. We've actually increased the manpower in our Korea agency. We launched a couple of products, which are actually getting very good traction. So because of that, second half, we expect Korea sales to come back pretty strong. With regards to -- sorry, go ahead.","Andrew Kligerman","No, no, I was saying in Japan, yes.","Kishore Ponnavolu","So, in Japan, if you think quarter-on-quarter, we're down 32% in the annuity sales, right? So let me give you a little bit of context on annuity sales. The vast majority of our annuity sales come through our banker channel. It's a little bit volatile channel, right? If you look at 2018 second quarter sales, we almost had $200 million of sales. And relative to 2017, that was 136% increase year-on-year come off, reinforce the volatility point. So against that high watermark, this year, we're down 32%. And there are two drivers for that, right?","Number one driver is the volumes through the banker channel for foreign denominated products actually came down. So year-on-year, the volume fell 9%. So what's the reason for that? We believe it's U.S. dollar interest rate softening, and that means the value proposition for customers is a little weaker relative as a result of that. Now that's only a 9% decline, okay? There's a second factor.","The second factor is that given that there's a strong interest in this particular segment, there have been some new entrants into the space, and some of them have been very aggressive with their crediting rates. We've been in this business for a long time, and we're very disciplined player, and we refuse to change volume, and so we're going to be leaning on our strength here. We have strong banker relationship, got 120-plus bank relationships. We believe we have advantages on investment management side on the dollar-denominated products that others may or may not have, and so we're going to leverage this. So we're going to see some softness here for the next couple of quarters, as Michel and John referenced, but we believe that the market will come back through the banker channel. And on top of that, we'll get our fair share. I hope that helps.","Andrew Kligerman","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi. Good morning. I had a couple of questions. First, on just Michel your priorities for deploying capital, different stories about you potentially selling your Central European business, the Hong Kong business, and I realize you can't comment on deals. But if you were -- like, what are your priorities in terms of cash that might be generated either through the business or from potential sales between acquisitions, investing in the business and possibly buying back stock? ","Michel Khalaf","Yeah. Hi, Jimmy. Well, first of all, let me sort of reiterate, in terms of our capital management philosophy, we believe that excess capital, beyond what we need to fund organic growth and for strategic acquisitions that clear risk-adjusted hurdle rate, belongs to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","As you know, we are conducting a strategic review and I would say that that work is moving along nicely. Without getting into too much detail, strategy is about choices and paramount among them is how we deploy capital, as well as other scarce resources. Our commitment to value creation requires us to exercise discipline across all capital, including capital supporting new business, as well as in-force business, not just excess capital. This means that pricing new product at appropriate internal rates of return with appropriate payback periods. It also means optimizing of our portfolio when and if necessary.","Let me point out that since the MetLife acquired Alico, we've divested more than 20 businesses, some large like our U.S. Retail business and other smaller such as the Hong Kong business. In all cases, we've been careful and deliberate. As the business is not meeting our return hurdles and we do not see a clear runway to doing so within a reasonable time frame, we have to consider alternatives, including divestitures, to free up capital for greater value creation over time. So that's our approach. I think it's consistent with how we've done things to-date. And as I've noted, since the Alico acquisition we've had a number of divestitures, but I would certainly not comment on any particular rumors that have been out there.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then on -- just for John maybe, on the accounting changes, obviously they were delayed by a year. But do you have any insights on how MetLife would be affected, that you're able to share? And I'm assuming that MetLife Holdings is the most susceptible business to the changes in long-duration accounting contracts. So if you could just comment on, like, if you've got better insights on what the impact of the changes would be on MetLife's balance sheet and\/or earnings going forward?","John McCallion","Good morning, Jimmy. Yes we are supportive of the proposed delay, still needs to be voted on, but we are supportive of that. I don't think it changes anything in terms of impact to us in terms of the timing, other than it gives us and the industry a chance to work together on implementation. In terms of which segments are most -- holdings would be one of them. I think wherever we have FAS 60 business, which would be holdings, there're some in RIS or some in Asia, those would also be impacted.","Jimmy Bhullar","And are you planning on sharing the expected impacts anytime in the next few quarters, or is it going to be as we get further - as we get closer to the actual standards going into effect?","John McCallion","Yeah. No, no. I think we - nothing soon. This is a lot of work. It's a complex standard, which is why we support the additional year, and I think it's appropriate for us in the industry to kind of work through this so that we can present these new information in the most effective and efficient way.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. First question is just some on the interest rate sensitivity disclosure you put out there. So the U.S. sensitivity looks pretty low to changes in interest rates for U.S. GAAP. John, is it fair to say that if you also considered the sensitivity to both Japan and EMEA, it would also be modest, or -- and also are those predominantly about the FAS 60 products there, do you have a decent amount of 97 in those regions?","John McCallion","Yes. So just to be clear crystal clear, that sensitivity that's provided there is for changing the U.S. 10-year Treasury rate long-term assumption, right, which is our reversion to, at this point, 4.25%, and as you comment or references, it impacts our U.S. segments. In EMEA, I would say the mix of business doesn't really cause kind of a material number to arrive one way or another. And rates have been pretty low, and we assume that's the case anyway. In Japan, like when we test loss recognition -- for loss recognition there, we use current rates and just assume they don't revert anywhere. They just stay state level. So...","Tom Gallagher","Got it. So the Japanese interest rate assumption is at current spot rate, like that\u2019s your\u2026","John McCallion","When we do loss recognition testing in Japan, we assume spot and then level from there.","Tom Gallagher","Got it. That's for loss recognition testing?","John McCallion","Yes.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. And then my follow-up is just on the new disclosure in the supplement about the Japan assets shows there's been pretty strong asset growth there, and I know you mentioned annuity sales declining. How -- if we're going to be in this lower level of annuity sales, is that -- how did net flows look? Like would you -- because I think it was double-digit growth in assets there based on current sales volumes. Would you still have positive flows there? And would you still get a decent amount of asset growth if we remain around current levels?","Kishore Ponnavolu","Tom, this is Kishore. So at the last outlook call at the Investor Day and also at the outlook call, we said high single-digit asset growth for Asia, as a segment. We're sticking to that, and there's no change at this point. If the question is in regards to a slowdown with regards to annuities, certainly I want to remind you that there are other lines which have actually gone the other way. A&H, Michel talked about the 12% increase in A&H. That's the advantage of a multiproduct multi-distribution business.","In addition, earlier, I talked about some year-over-year decline for the second quarter with annuities from the bank segment. We expect that to change and obviously moderate over time. And, certainly, we expect to get our fair share back. So this is a quarter or two, but over the medium term we expect to get back to our fair share.","Tom Gallagher","Okay.","Michel Khalaf","I would just add, Tom, to Kishore's comments, also in the foreign-denominated annuity products and other products that we sell, there's a very high persistency there. So just from a net perspective, it's a good statistic to think about.","Tom Gallagher","Got it. Yeah. That's what I was trying to get at. The -- I presume there're still strong positive flows, even after the decline in annuity sales, but I can circle back for more detail.","Kishore Ponnavolu","So the one extra thing to John is also, Tom, a bulk of these annuity sales are single premium. And so, because they're single premium, the full impact of these sales are not necessarily reflected in the A&P and they show up on assets.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I have a follow-up question on the strategic review. I know that it includes potential dispositions. I'm curious, I guess as you're doing the strategic review, does it also contemplate the need for potential M&A and other businesses where you feel like you needed additional capabilities or scale?","Michel Khalaf","Yes, absolutely, Ryan. We are -- part of our review is looking for also ways to accelerate revenue growth, especially in markets and businesses where -- that we feel are attractive and where we have a competitive advantage. We're always looking at M&A opportunities as a way to further enhance our growth. Clearly, we look for opportunities that are a good fit with our strategy and that are accretive and we have also a consistent way of evaluating many opportunities globally.","We look at value and cash generation. Clearly, those deals need to earn more than their cost of capital. We also evaluate M&A against alternative uses of capital. We consider capital markets the cost of raising capital in our assessments, but we continue to look at M& A as an opportunity for us to drive growth or enhance efficiency in certain businesses and markets.","Ryan Krueger","Thanks. And then on the interest rate scenario to earnings in the 10-K, there's a very minimal impact on 2019, steps up some in 2020 though, though not all that large. I guess, just the delta between, I guess, the reason it's so minimal in 2019 and then steps up in 2020. Does that really to things like interest rate for us, or is there something else going on there?","John McCallion","Yeah. Hey, Ryan. So -- and remember that was 100 basis point parallel shift, right, that we gave you. And I think the punch line, as we said, was that largely intact. It wasn't quite -- it hasn't been quite parallel. Right. The long end has dropped further than the short end, so there's a - that non-parallel shift and we talked about this before, it does have, call it, a negative impact on sec lending.","The reason to your question, the reason why it's smaller in the first year is, it's mainly derivative. It's not necessarily floors, although we have those too, but it's just even the pay lag on our receivers swap, right? So as LIBOR drops, your pay lag and your expense goes down.","Ryan Krueger","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on interest rate question related to the hedges. Can you just quantify what that benefit is that you're getting today and how that should track over the next couple of years?","John McCallion","Yes. We don't have that specifically, Suneet, broken out. I would just again, I think, we would revert back to the kind of the overall. There's a lot of different items going on in there that some things that benefit for from just the drop in LIBOR. There's others that have more of an impact on the longer end, and so that's the part of our, I think, diversified portfolio that benefit here. We do get some offsets from having the short end of the curve drop as well in a positive way, but we haven't broken out each individual component. We just kind of revert back to kind of the aggregate change.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. And the reason I ask is, I am looking at, I think the last time you gave the slide that showed the trajectory of the derivative income was years ago, but it did look like somewhere around 2020, 2021, there was sort of a leg down in terms of the benefit that you get and I know this was pretty bright house I just want to get a sense is that still roughly the picture that we should be expecting going forward?","John McCallion","Yes, I think you're referencing -- I mean it\u2019s probably more than a few years ago, right, the trajectory of the floors. Is that what you're talking about?","Suneet Kamath","Yes, I think it was from your 2016 outlook call but I think that\u2019s the last time we got it. So\u2026","John McCallion","It\u2019s probably pre-John Hall. But, no, I think, certainly, we certainly at one point, those were one major benefit to lower rates, those have probably declined over time in terms of the amount of floors we have. But we've continued at different times to take up -- look, when the risk of rates rising, which was not too long ago was the major risk, we actually took the opportunity to add some floors. And so in our RIS segment, you know, we have talked about spreads and actually if LIBOR continues to drop, that sensitivity to LIBOR is going to start to flip. And that's partly due to the fact that we were opportunistic to buy some additional floors there that have a strike starting at 2%. So it's kind of it evolves over time, and it's not so static.","Suneet Kamath","Maybe an update at some point would be helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi. Good morning. My first question goes back to slide 10 as well. I was wondering if you could -- with the low interest rate sensitivity if you could just give us a sense of what scenario would actually drive a GAAP loss recognition charge. I know you haven't laid it out in any of these assumptions that you have on the slide, probably seems like would have to be a pretty big impact.","John McCallion","Yes, I think that's the punch line. It would need to be a pretty big impact. I mean even beyond. We showed 25, 50 and 75 even beyond that. We have quite a bit of healthy loss recognition testing margins in the U.S. in our FAS 60 business. So to get kind of a full unlocking our loss recognitions impact, it would take quite a bit of a drop in that long-term rate assumption.","Elyse Greenspan","And then I noticed in footnote three that it says, this includes MetLife Holdings. So does this interest rate scenario assumption, does that includes - incorporate in your LTC block?","John McCallion","Yes it does.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then, lastly on the PRT side of things, that business is typically been more second half heavy in terms of deals. I know we're obviously dealing with a lower interest rate environment. Have you guys seeing any change in the pipeline of no potential transactions that you might see towards the later stages of this year?","Michel Khalaf","Yeah. We actually are still seeing a very robust pipeline in the PRT space. And in particular, we're seeing a pretty robust pipeline on some of the jumbo deals. Clearly, over time, as rates come down, that would impact volumes in this market, but it really depends on the ALM posture of the pension plan.","Some of those plans are already better matched and therefore are more insulated to falling grades and are getting the benefit from rising equity markets. So having said all of that, I think, over time lower rates will be headwind to volumes, but for now we're still seeing a very robust second half pipeline.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling and Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Just a question about the expenses, which have been a very good story, especially in the life holdings. I was just wondering can you take our more expenses from holdings now, or do you see kind of the current level as good as it gets, given some of the favorable expenses that you see in the first half of this year?","John McCallion","Yeah. I think as we go through this unit cost initiatives, a good portion of those initiatives help reduce some of the expenses there in holdings. In addition to just like, I call, BAU and the efforts that we're taking. Obviously, this is a business that will gradually run off. So I think the relationship there in expenses is a pretty good kind of way to think about it. In terms -- over time as the business runs off, we'd also expect the expenses to run down as well.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. And then, in terms of the recurring interest margin, you've talked about expecting more towards the lower end of the guidance range, given where rates are. I recall last quarter you talked about your holding a little bit more cash and short-term investments. Have you redeployed those? Are you trying to hold on to those and kind of maybe be more opportunistic down the road?","John McCallion","Yeah, sure. So just to reiterate and this is what I said in my opening remarks, we still expect full year to be within our -- this is for RIS, our 2019 guidance of 100 to 125, albeit at the bottom end of that range. Also, in addition to VII, as you mentioned the sequential improvement was helped by the fact that we did deploy some of that excess cash one hand that we referenced in the first quarter.","So even though interest rates fell, there was -- and there was a further inversion of LIBOR. We were able to improve our spreads sequentially. And I think the last thing I'd point out and it's timely, we had the Fed -- the latest fed rate cut yesterday, the forward curves projecting a steepening from here and so we're starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel for, I'd say, spread compression in that business.","So any improvement won't happen immediately and at these projected levels any benefit would be probably modest, but it starts to put us near or at the bottom of spread compression for this segment for some time. ","Humphrey Lee","Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd now like to turn the call back to Michel.","Michel Khalaf","Thank you. Let me close by saying how pleased I am with our second quarter results especially in light of a challenging capital market environment. Overall, we delivered another very good quarter in which our diversified set of businesses demonstrated their fundamental strength.","I want to thank everyone for joining us today on a busy morning, and I look forward to speaking with you again soon.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review.","Joining me this morning on the call are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also here to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management. Last night, we released a set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. An appendix to these slides features a number of disclosures and GAAP reconciliations, which you should also review. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend to the top of the hour. [Operator Instructions]","With that, I will turn the call over to Michel.","Michel Khalaf","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. The headline from our financial results is that MetLife had a solid underlying fourth quarter and a very strong year. Our track record of consistent execution continues, and this leadership team is committed to being a top-performing company. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we delivered adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings rose to $1.98 from $1.35 a year earlier. Net income in the quarter was $536 million, driven by mark-to-market losses on interest rate-related derivatives that we hold to protect our balance sheet.","Backing out the impact of notable items, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.53, up 21% year-over-year. The positive drivers included market factors, volume growth and capital management, offset in part by higher seasonal expenses as we indicated would be the case.","Adjusted return on equity in the quarter, excluding AOCI, other than FCTA and notables, was 12.6% compared with 11.7% in the prior year quarter. For the full year 2019, MetLife delivered very strong results. Net income was $5.7 billion, while adjusted earnings were $5.8 billion. We've spoken before about our efforts to bring net income and adjusted earnings into closer alignment, efforts that succeeded in 2019.","On a per share basis, adjusted earnings rose 13% to $6.11, up from $5.39. Excluding notable items, adjusted earnings per share were $6.06, 10% higher than the prior year. The drivers were capital management and volume growth that more than offset the impact of lower recurring interest margins. Across our businesses, 2019 was a year of significant achievements. Our flagship U.S. group benefits business generated adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion, nearly double the earnings from this business just 3 years earlier. In retirement and income solutions, we booked nearly $4.3 billion of pension risk transfer sales, our second best year ever. Just as important, we delivered on our commitment that investment spreads would fall within a range of 100 to 125 basis points. Despite declining interest rates, we came in at 106 basis points.","In both our Asia and Lat Am businesses, we delivered double-digit adjusted earnings growth year-over-year, excluding total notable items on a constant currency basis. And within investments, we generated variable investment income of nearly $1.2 billion, largely on the strength of our private equity portfolio. Our competitive advantage and sourcing private assets provided significant protection for our investment portfolio. In a year when the 10-year treasury fell by 77 basis points, our net investment yield only declined by 2 basis points. Our strong business performance drove adjusted return on equity for the year, excluding AOCI other than FCTA and notables, to 13%, up 20 basis points from the prior year and right at the midpoint of our target range.","Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, grew nearly 10% to $48.97. And our direct expense ratio came in at 12.6%, an improvement of 30 basis points over the prior year. As we have noted, our unit cost initiative is on track to deliver $900 million of margin expansion, which is $100 million above our initial commitment.","MetLife's consistent execution in 2019 created significant shareholder value. Our robust free cash flow generation enabled us to return roughly $4 billion to shareholders in the form of common dividends and share repurchases. We deployed another $3.6 billion of capital to support new business at internal rates of return comfortably above our hurdle rate. And growing appreciation of our company's strength led to a total shareholder return of 29%. The strategic themes of focus, simplify and differentiate that we outlined at our December Investor Day were clearly on display in 2019 and will drive our decisions in the years ahead. On focus, we have reduced our footprint post the ALICO acquisition from 66 markets to 44, and in 2019, announced the sale of our Hong Kong business. We continue to look at our portfolio through the lens of strategic fit and deploy capital to businesses that can meet or exceed our risk-adjusted hurdle rate. We will be just as disciplined when it comes to optimizing our portfolio. Any transaction must be in the long-term interest of MetLife, offering either compelling economics or a significant reduction in our risk profile.","On simplify, we will overdeliver on our UCI cost-saving target, and going forward, we'll adopt an efficiency mindset that will create an additional $1 billion of capacity to fund innovation and growth over the next five years. On differentiate, we will continue to capitalize on those competitive advantages that are difficult for others to replicate. We believe our group benefits business in the U.S. creates unmatched value for customers. And as we expand the platform with attractive benefits, such as pet insurance, digital wells and health savings accounts, we are very well positioned to extend our lead.","In early January, we gathered 200 of MetLife's senior leaders at an off-site meeting to ensure we have full alignment on our strategy. Notably, 10 of our 12 Independent Directors were in attendance as well. There was tremendous energy and enthusiasm for the task before us, to be a purpose-driven company that creates superior value for its people, its customers and its shareholders. We have set bold aspirations for all our stakeholders, for our customers who are committed to building remarkable and enduring relationships. We are taking concrete steps to strengthen both our metrics and our leadership commitment to customer focus.","For our people, we promised a culture that energizes them to make a difference. We are already making progress with our latest employee engagement survey, providing further evidence of the cultural evolution taking place at MetLife. When I look at MetLife's recent history, I see remarkable progress. A few years ago, we were in a de-risking phase where the emphasis was on the need to improve our cash flow. Then we reached the inflection point I spoke about last year, where we could pivot to a focus on responsible growth. Now we are in the next horizon, where we have fully transitioned to leveraging our competitive advantages to win in the marketplace, which brings me to our aspirations for our shareholders. I covered these in detail at Investor Day and will highlight the key points today.","First, we will achieve an adjusted return on equity of 12% to 14%. Second, we will dispense with serial expense programs in favor of an efficiency mindset that will generate $1 billion of additional capacity over 5 years. And third, we will maintain a 2-year average free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75%, which will generate $20 billion of deployable cash over the next 5 years. In closing, we are pleased to deliver another solid quarter and very strong year that add to our record of consistent execution. We believe that MetLife's narrative and results are converging nicely. Our thesis is clear. We are a simpler and more focused company with a great set of businesses and strong free cash flow. Our track record in support of this thesis is equally clear. $900 million in projected expense savings, healthy growth in our most attractive businesses and consistent delivery of free cash flow in our 65% to 75% range.","With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to cover our fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail.","John McCallion","Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I will begin by discussing the 4Q '19 supplemental slides that we released last evening, which highlight information in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. Starting on Page 3. The schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year of 2019. Net income in the fourth quarter was $536 million or $1.3 billion lower than adjusted earnings of $1.8 billion. This variance is primarily due to net derivative losses resulting from the increase in interest rates during the quarter. For the full year, net income of $5.7 billion largely mirrored adjusted earnings of $5.8 billion. The results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continued to perform as expected.","Notable items are shown on Page 4, and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. First, favorable tax items in the fourth quarter increased adjusted earnings by $475 million after tax or $0.51 per share. I'll provide more details on these tax items shortly. Second, as a result of the favorable tax items, there was a related release of interest on tax reserves of $64 million after tax or $0.07 per share, which is a reduction in and recorded through direct expenses as opposed to income taxes. Finally, expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings in the quarter by $119 million after tax or $0.13 per share. For the full year, these costs were $332 million or $0.35 per share. As a reminder, fourth quarter of 2019 is the last quarter for this incremental spend, and therefore, there will be no UCI-related costs in 2020. Excluding notable items in the quarter, adjusted earnings were $1.4 billion or $1.53 per share.","Page 5 provides further detail on the notable tax items in the quarter. First, we had a tax benefit of $317 million related to a settlement with the IRS regarding the U.S. tax reform repatriation transition tax. This settlement resolves uncertainty regarding the taxation of dividends from foreign subsidiaries paid prior to U.S. tax reform. Second, we had a tax benefit of $158 million from an IRS audit settlement relating to the tax treatment of a wholly owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. As some of you may recall, MetLife took a charge in the third quarter of 2015 related to this matter. We have now settled this issue for all audit years and the matter is closed.","On Page 6, you can see the fourth quarter year-over-year adjusted earnings, excluding notable items by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 13% and 14% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were up 21% on both a reported and constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Overall, positive year-over-year drivers include strong equity market performance, continued strength in variable investment income, solid volume growth and favorable tax benefits. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins in the quarter.","Turning to the performance of our businesses in the quarter. Group benefits adjusted earnings were up 43% year-over-year, driven by favorable underwriting, solid volume growth and higher investment margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins in the quarter. The group life mortality ratio was 85.4%, which is at the low end of our annual target range of 85% to 90% and favorable to the prior year quarter of 89.4% due to lower claims severity.","The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non-Medical Health was 71.4%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and also favorable to the prior year quarter of 73.2%. The primary driver was strong disability results, which benefited from renewal rate actions and higher claim recoveries. In addition to the strong bottom line, the business continues to grow its top line with adjusted PFOs in the quarter up 6% and full year sales up 11%, led by growth in voluntary products.","Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 10% year-over-year, driven by lower investment margins. RIS investment spreads were 106 basis points in 4Q '19, and while down 24 basis points year-over-year, spreads were up 4 basis points sequentially. For the full year 2019, investment spreads were also 106 basis points, which was within the 2019 guidance range.","Looking ahead, we continue to expect spreads to remain within our 2020 guidance range of 90 to 115 basis points. RIS adjusted PFOs were up $2.6 billion year-over-year, driven by strong pension risk transfer deals of $2.5 billion in 4Q '19. As announced last week, this includes a $1.9 billion transaction with Lockheed Martin, which covers approximately 20,000 retirees and beneficiaries. The pipeline for PRTs remain strong, and we expect this to continue into 2020.","Property and Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were down 75% versus 4Q '18, primarily due to unfavorable underwriting in the quarter. The overall combined ratio was 101.6%, driven by higher severity within auto bodily injury, including approximately 6 points from adverse prior year development. We are reassessing operational practices and have accelerated rate actions. Based on current trend and planned rate actions, we expect to be within our 2020 target combined ratios. With regards to the top line, P&C adjusted PFOs were up 1%, while sales were down 6% versus 4Q '18.","Moving to Asia. Adjusted earnings were up 21% and 23% on a constant currency basis. The positive year-over-year drivers were favorable volume growth as general account assets under management, excluding fair value adjustments, grew 9% as well as better investment margins and favorable equity markets. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting.","Asia sales were down 16% on a constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were down 23%, primarily driven by foreign currency denominated annuity products. FX annuity products, which are primarily sold through bank channels had another challenging quarter, given the contraction of the bank market. In addition, our A&H sales in Japan were down 10% year-over-year, which is a function of changes in the tax laws associated with certain products. We expect Japan sales to remain soft through the first half of 2020 before recovering. Other Asia sales were down 3%, but up 5%, excluding the impact from our divested Hong Kong operations, driven by growth in Korea.","Latin America adjusted earnings were up 18% and 21% on a constant currency basis. The primary year-over-year drivers were higher investment margins, solid volume growth, better expense margins and the favorable impact from capital markets on our Chile Encaje. These were partially offset by the less favorable underwriting compared to 4Q '18.","Latin America adjusted PFOs were down 7% and 4% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower SPIA sales in Chile. Latin America sales were up 11% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher sales in Brazil and Mexico.","EMEA adjusted earnings were up 20% and 22% on a constant currency basis. The main drivers were lower taxes and volume growth. These were partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on a constant currency basis, and sales were up 12% on a constant currency basis from growth across the region.","MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings were up 21% year-over-year, driven by the strength of the equity markets as well as favorable underwriting and investment margins. These were partially offset by less favorable expense margins, although primarily due to items that we do not expect to recur.","With regard to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 55.5%, in line with seasonal expectations and favorable to 58% in the prior year quarter. For the full year 2019, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio, excluding notable items, was 52.9%, comfortably within the target range.","Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding notable items, was $98 million. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $132 million due to lower taxes and favorable investment margins. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins.","For the full year 2019, Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding notable items, was $608 million, which was within our 2019 guidance range of an adjusted loss of $550 million to $750 million. Excluding the notable and other favorable tax items, the company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 18.5% and within our 2019 guidance of 18% to 20%. As a reminder, our 2020 effective tax rate guidance is expected to be within 20% to 22%.","Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income in 2019, including $327 million earned in the fourth quarter. This was another solid performance for variable investment income. Our private equity portfolio, which is accounted for on a 1 quarter lag, had another solid quarter; and the quarter also contained higher mortgage prepayments. For full year 2019, VII was $1.2 billion pretax and above our 2019 guidance range of $800 million to $1 billion. As a reminder, our 2020 VII target range remains $900 million to $1.1 billion.","With regards to recurring investment income, our new money rate was 3.45% versus a roll-off rate of 4.17% in the quarter. This compares to a new money rate of 4.24% and a roll-off rate of 4.4% in 4Q '18. Lower interest rates have pressured this relationship. As we have noted previously, we would not expect parity to occur until we have a sustained U.S. 10-year treasury yield of roughly 3% to 3.25%.","Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2019. We have made consistent progress towards achieving our UCI target by 2020. 2019 marks another 30 basis point improvement versus 2018, and 170 basis point improvement overall from the baseline of 14.3% in 2015.","The 4Q '19 direct expense ratio, excluding notable items and PRTs, came in above trend at 13.7%. As we've indicated, our expenses tend to be seasonally higher in the fourth quarter due to higher enrollment and other costs incurred prior to receiving premiums in our group benefits business. In addition, the higher direct expense ratio reflects roughly 50 to 60 basis points of unfavorable items, primarily driven by higher employee benefit costs and higher corporate initiatives in the quarter.","Despite the higher 4Q expenses, we are quite pleased with the overall progress that we have made in driving down the company's direct expense ratio, as demonstrated by the improvement of our full year results. We are on track to deliver a direct expense ratio of approximately 12.3% for full year 2020, which equates to an incremental $100 million of profit margin improvement over our original commitment.","I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.2 billion at December 31, which is up from $3.5 billion at September 30. $700 million increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend as well as holding company expenses.","In 2019, we returned approximately $4 billion of capital to shareholders, and our average 2018 and 2019 free cash flow ratio was 72% and within our 65% to 75% guidance. We remain committed to maintaining a 65% to 75% 2-year average free cash flow ratio over the near term. This target still holds with a 10-year treasury between 1.5% and 4.5%.","Next, I'd like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, we estimate that our combined NAIC RBC ratio will be above our 360% target. For our U.S. companies, preliminary 2019 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4.5 billion and net earnings were approximately $4.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $164 million from the prior year, primarily due to lower VA rider reserves and improved underwriting results. These were mostly offset by the impact of a prior year dividend from an investment subsidiary. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.6 billion as of December 31, 2019, up 1% compared to December 31, 2018. The increase in operating earnings was partially offset by dividends paid to the holding company and derivative losses.","Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 904% as of September 30, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife delivered another solid quarter to close out a very strong 2019. Our ability to leverage our diverse market-leading businesses to drive capital-efficient growth, while maintaining expense discipline across the firm, has led to a strong, consistent level of results in 2019.","We grew book value per share by 10% year-over-year, while generating an adjusted ROE of 13%, excluding notable items. In addition, our cash and capital position as well as our balance sheet remain strong and resilient.","Finally, we are confident the actions we are taking to become a simpler and more focused company will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.","And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Andrew Kligerman","My first question is around the group benefits. So you mentioned that PFO, up 6%; sales, up 11%; the life benefits ratio was 85.4% against guidance of 85% to 90% and the Non-Med was 71.4% under the 72% to 77%, so it's clearly phenomenal. And it seems like quarter in, quarter out, you're doing this. So I want to get a sense of what's the pricing environment like right now? And when is it going to get a little uglier or get ugly at some point because it always does in insurance?","Ramy Tadros","Andrew, it's Ramy here. Phenomenal, I think we would say, it's a very strong quarter for us, and we're extremely pleased with those results. To give you some context around your question, if you think about this into 2020 and beyond, I would say a few things. One is that we are very confident in our fundamentals here. This is an attractive market. It has structural characteristics that make it attractive that we talked about. And we are a market leader here, and we do have sustainable competitive advantages that we continue to press.","If you think about the specific results on the underwriting ratio, like you said, remember, this is an insurance business. So you do expect these ratios to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, they do have some seasonality to them, with first quarter typically being a bit elevated. The other thing you should think of as an insurance business is that the results that we're seeing are entirely within our expected range of outcomes in the context of our business. So if you look at 2020, our view of those ranges have not changed from the ones we've given you in December and our expectations for the full year remain the same and are in the mid -- towards the middle of that range.","From a competitive environment, it is competitive. It's not irrational. We seek to differentiate on a lot of factors beyond price. And the other thing I would say, there's a lot of white space in this business, and we talked about the voluntary opportunity in particular, where we see white space for further growth.","Andrew Kligerman","Great. And then just on RIS. I guess, spreads were within the guided range of 90 to 115 at 106, as you said earlier, John. And I guess, could you share with us what the annual portfolio turnover is on that business? And what kind of new money yields you're getting as you move forward against the portfolio yield?","John McCallion","Good morning, Andrew. It's John. Yes, I would just -- maybe I'll start with the beginning part there and just say, this is consistent with what we expected, and we mentioned previously on the third quarter call, we started to see a bottoming of spreads, partly due to the anticipation of the benefit of 2 fed rate cuts and that's kind of starting to get fully absorbed in the market. And so that was one. And also, we saw the dislocation and the repo markets subside. So we've seen some bottoming of the kind of spread decline happen over the last couple of quarters. And as we said, we think that's a pretty good run rate for the near term.","In terms of -- in terms of turnover in this particular RIS book, I don't think we have that handy here. But again, you can talk to IR off-line. It's -- we talk about overall this -- the roll-off reinvest with regards to rate for the firm. A lot of that, obviously, mix matters there, and it's hard to read into that specifically. But I think just -- I would go back to what we've said, which is that the spreads here have started to bottom. You see the benefit of 2 full rate cuts. You can see that in our crediting rate. It's kind of dropped faster than our investment yield in this business, and that's because we have a lot of floating rate liabilities in that business. And it does take some time for that to fully get recognized because 3-month LIBOR does -- it has to take a little -- a few months before it's fully recognized there. So I'll let Steve add some color.","Steven Goulart","I'll just add a little bit of color, Steve Goulart, Andrew. But just reminding you of our capital markets business, which I think is where you're going with that question. In general, it is a shorter duration business, and there isn't a lot of mismatch. So even when there's rollover on the asset side, we're also managing rollover on the liability side. So it's a reasonably matched business, and that protects us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question, it seems like there were some good PRT momentum to end the year. If you could just give us a little bit of an update on the sales pipeline? And what you're seeing with that business? And I guess, interest rates went up in the fourth quarter, and then they've been down this year. Is that -- have you seen any impact from interest rates on the pipeline there?","Ramy Tadros","Good morning, Elyse. It's Ramy here. We're clearly very pleased with our PRT results, both for the quarter and for the year. The quarter was a $2.5 billion quarter, and as Michel mentioned, it's a $4.3 billion a year for us. Remember, we're focusing -- from a pipeline perspective, we are focusing on the larger end of the market. So these are big pension plans, mid-single digits, but sometimes even higher with respect to the size of these plans. That's the part of the market where we have a competitive advantage with respect to our rating, our investment capability and our scale of the balance sheet. And when you think about those plans, they are on a derisking journey, right? So this is not something that's a trade that they make overnight. And that -- this derisking journey ends up taking a number of years. And therefore, for any one of them, the current rate position is only an input because it depends on their overall ALM position and it depends on their equity allocation. So having said all of that and given the market we're focused on, we're still seeing a very robust 2020 in that segment that we're looking at.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then my next question, within your P&C business, you guys called out higher BI severity trends in the quarter, impacting both current accident year as well as prior accident years. If you could just give a little bit more color on what you're seeing? And as you think of 2020, does getting within your guide assume that the severity trends might remain elevated at least for part of this year?","Ramy Tadros","Sure. So clearly, it's been a challenging quarter for the P&C business. And the headline here, as you've mentioned, is a bodily injury severity. And as you know, it's a trend that we're seeing in the marketplace. We saw some initial indication of deterioration in the third quarter, and we took some reserve strengthening then. And those indications worsened in the fourth quarter, which warranted additional strengthening. And that's a combination of PYDs as well as out-of-period strengthening for '19.","As we look forward, I can tell you, we're looking at these trends very closely. We're pulling a range of levers, which are at our disposal, beginning with rate actions where we've accelerated some of the rate actions into early 2020, but we're also looking at underwriting and claims practices. So we're on top of this. I could say with respect to the auto line, in particular, where we stand today, our expectations are that we would remain within our overall guidance range for auto, albeit towards the upper end of that range. So if you recall, that's a 93% to 98% for the auto business.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And John, one just quick numbers question. The derivative loss in the quarter, you said that, that was driven off of the move in interest rates. Given that interest rates have been down to start 2020, should we think about that reversing in the first quarter this year?","John McCallion","Yes, directionally correct. Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from ISI.","Thomas Gallagher","Just one follow-up on property casualty. The current accident year auto loss ratio was 82%. And I guess, the question is, is that a just 4Q pick? Or is that a current accident year catch-up for the prior quarters as well? Like what would a better trend loss ratio be? Because I assume it's not a 107 combined as the way we should think about normalized heading into 2020?","Ramy Tadros","Yes. I mean, if you look at the fourth quarter, if you exclude the PYDs in the quarter, I would say, remember, that the fourth quarter is typically seasonally higher for auto for us. So if you think about that fourth quarter results, excluding PYD, it's 98.9%. And again, there's some elevation because of seasonality here.","Thomas Gallagher","Got you. And then just a question on capital management. So buybacks were lighter this quarter and your buildup of cash at the holding company is now $4.2 billion. So that's slightly above your target for the first time in a while. Any reason why you dialed it back this quarter despite having the excess cash to use?","Michel Khalaf","Yes, Tom, it's Michel. As we mentioned, we are comfortable with the $3 billion to $4 billion buffer at the HoldCo, slightly above this -- for the fourth quarter. Mostly, I would say, timing related in terms of dividends to the HoldCo. I would look at our sort of cash buyback activity in the fourth quarter in tandem with the third quarter. We had mentioned then that we had pulled forward some of the share repurchases. We tend to be opportunistic in that respect. So nothing more to read into that, I would say.","Thomas Gallagher","And Michel, just as a follow-up, are you -- how are you thinking right now in terms of the balance or trade-off between M&A and buybacks?","Michel Khalaf","No change also in terms of our capital management philosophy. I think we talked before about M&A opportunities, how we view those strategic fit accretive. And we sort of also consider alternative uses of capital. So I would say no change in terms of our capital management philosophy. Excess capital belongs to the shareholders, and absent M&A activity, we'll return it in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.","Jamminder Bhullar","I just had a question first on what you're seeing in terms of the operating environment in the Latin America business, and specifically, in Chile, where your sales were weak this quarter. There's also a lot of talk about political uncertainty and potential changes in the pension business.","Oscar Schmidt","Yes, Jimmy, this is Oscar. So let me start with the social situation. As I said in December, the magnitude of the profits was a surprise to everybody. But I have to say it's getting better. And remember that, in summer, in Chile, the flow activity, January and February, we'll need to see what happens in March when the year really starts there. But so far, the social environment has been much better. In terms of the business, to-date, we have not seen a significant impact on our business through January from the situation there. But facts and circumstances may change, of course, as the situation evolves.","So let me talk about the reform, which, I think, is your other question. The government finally managed to present a project in the Congress for pension reform, and they were able to make it to be approved in the house, in the lower chamber. Now it has to go to the Senate. February is -- there's no Congress activity. So we need to wait until March to see what happens in the Senate. I have to say, it's too early to say in the legislative process to -- what's going to happen. It's possible that there will be more changes, right, to be introduced before the project ends up enacted as a law. But we cannot say what is the final impact. But based on the facts, not today, which is the version of the project that is being discussed, we don't anticipate material financial impact to the region. It's -- I would say, it's a good step forward for the people of Chile in terms of the kind of pension improvements that introduces, and hopefully, will help to ease the social situation there if the project is approved. So we really support the government pension reform efforts. I hope that answers your question?","Jamminder Bhullar","And the potential impact on your business as of the proposal as you see it currently?","Oscar Schmidt","As it stands today, it's not big, right? Now I have to say we've got to be prudent because we don't know how it's going to end. It still has to go through senate and the executive power has to approve it, but the version that is being discussed today, we think it's good for people, and the impact on our business is not that big.","Jamminder Bhullar","Okay. And then if I could ask one more of John McCallion. Just on the changes in accounting that are coming through in 2022 on long duration contracts, you haven't disclosed any sort of potential impact on your business either as anybody else. Are you expecting to start quantifying more of the impact in the next few quarters? Or would you wait until your even closer to the rules being implemented, so maybe next year?","John McCallion","Yes, hard to tell in terms of time line at this point. We're still working through it. So we don't really have a projected or estimated time line in terms of when we would share that information.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW.","Ryan Krueger","[Technical Difficulty]. Just from reinsurers on pieces of MetLife Holdings at the December Investor Day. Can you give an update on that? And are you still seeing the same amount of interest following the decline in interest rates this year?","John McCallion","Ryan, at the beginning of your question, you cut off, but I think it had to do with just any updates on just activity from reinsurers with regards to holdings, is that right?","Ryan Krueger","That's right. And have you seen any impact from lower interest rates as well?","John McCallion","Yes. I would actually maybe refer to the way that Ramy described PRTs. It's not something that they can turn on, turn off. This is like -- given the size and the complexity, sometimes it just requires people to spend time on these things for some time. So I don't think they react to movements in interest rates as much. So I would say it's no change at this point. It's -- there's still kind of a good supply of capital out there, but I'd say the bid-ask spread is still fairly wide, but there's a number of folks that have entered the space over the last few years, and we're seeing that.","Ryan Krueger","And then on the expenses, there was a lot of seasonality, I guess, in 2019. Can you give us any sense of, I guess, how to think about normal seasonality with the direct expense ratio?","John McCallion","Yes, I will try. And I make that point only because we have talked about that there is seasonality from quarter-to-quarter, which is why we focus on the annual direct expense ratio. Having said that, let me just kind of recall a few things. So we did say that -- and we've called out previously that the third and fourth quarter tend to be -- tend to be elevated due to the cost, as I mentioned, in my opening remarks for the enrollment of group customers, and we don't get those premiums in until the following year, so this tends to be an elevated. And even this year, if you recall, we didn't see that come through in the third quarter. So there was even some slippage into 4Q.","On top of that seasonality, there were some additional onetime costs in the quarter that we would not expect to recur. We had some elevated employee benefit costs. Remember in the earlier 3 quarters, we had employee benefit costs going the other way. So they've kind of washed or kind of neutralized each other out. And then we also had some additional corporate initiatives spend in the quarter, in 4Q, that was elevated. So we estimate 50 to 60 basis points above what normal trend would be for kind of the fourth quarter. And so you can kind of think of that as what we had expected in the quarter and the additional onetime costs that came through.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Just want to follow up on that expense. So -- but looking back specifically in group benefits, just looking back, I don't really see there's a seasonality that you talked about in 3Q and 4Q. And then, obviously, this year, we see the bonds of it in the fourth quarter. So I was just wondering, is there anything constructionally different this year compared to years past?","Ramy Tadros","Well, remember also, I mean, we've been growing a lot, right, in the last few years. So you're seeing there is kind of a pickup as a result of just sheer growth, but I would say that's the case. We can -- we'll look again, but it's there. And there's other things that go into this, right? I mean, there's other investments being made. So sometimes, it's hard. But as we've said -- and I think, last year, there might have been employee benefit costs that offset that. So the volatility and some of the market impacts from unemployed benefit costs can impact the segments as well. So you might see a little offset, but you can be assured, it's in there.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up question on the tax rate. So I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about the effective tax rate was 18.5%. I'm a little bit struggling to get to that number based on the tax items that you called out. I think you may have some additional tax items, too, but maybe if you can help me to think about like the tax rate, what contributed to the reported number and then versus your effective tax rate?","John McCallion","Yes. I think if you -- so if you adjust the notable items, you come to something closer in the 13s in terms of effective tax rate. So we did have some additional positive items that were not called out as notable just because of the size and, call it, our kind of approach to notables of anything over a $50 million impact. So it's a series of a few items. One is there were some revision to the rules on the GILTI tax in the fourth quarter, and I think it was early December, maybe late November, which ultimately provided a company's ability to use some additional foreign tax credits. So that came through in the fourth quarter. And then the remaining amount is effectively just some return to provision true-ups and some other year-end tax estimate refinements. So if you exclude those items, it's, call it, $65 million impact, you get to 18.5%. And so that's how you reconcile the quarter ETR.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Barnidge from Piper Sandler.","John Barnidge","Sorry. I was muted. Have you seen any change in the operating environment in EMEA following the favorable U.K. election and subsequent Brexit certainty?","Michel Khalaf","Yes, John, I would say not much. I mean, our business in the U.K. as mostly employee benefits and individual protection. So I wouldn't say that we've seen a major -- there's an improvement in the overall sentiment, I would say, post-elections and now with Brexit sort of not necessarily behind the U.K. but at least decided. But no impact to our business that I would call out, no.","John Barnidge","Okay. And then kind of back to the auto adverse development, were there specific states this came from? And what levels of rate are you going to push to correct this, specifically within auto?","John McCallion","Yes. I mean, we -- there are clearly some skew there, and there are some states where we see -- where we saw higher severity than others. So there is that skew there, and we're clearly focusing on the states where we're writing the most amount of business. In terms of rate taking, so if you look at over 2019, we took 2% in rate across the book on average. Over the last 90 days, we've accelerated the rate actions for 2020. So we've taken under 2% in rate, just for Q1 of 2020, and we're clearly going to be watching this carefully. We expect to take additional rate as warranted.","Operator","And I'd now like to turn the call back to Michel Khalaf for any closing comments.","Michel Khalaf","So let me close this meeting by thanking everyone for joining us. We're pleased with our strong 2019 results and our growing track record of consistent performance. Having said that, rest assured that this leadership team is motivated by a strong sense of urgency to create greater shareholder value. Thank you again, and talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconferencing.

Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.","Edward A. Spehar","Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Call.","We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings press release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment income and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.","Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.","Steven A. Kandarian","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another strong quarter, with most financial metrics exceeding our plan. Second quarter 2013 operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 11% over the second quarter of 2012. Operating earnings per share were $1.44, a 7% increase over the prior year period, and operating return on equity was 12.3%.","This quarter's results reflect the continuation of our strategic shift away from capital-intensive, market-sensitive products to high-return, lower-risk product lines, as well as our strategy to grow emerging markets. This shift was evident with variable annuity sales down 40% versus the prior year period, while sales rose 28% in our Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits segment; 32% in Latin America; and 32% in the emerging markets within our Europe, Middle East and Africa segment. Our investment margins were favorable again in this quarter as a result of good variable investment income, effective asset\/liability management and income from derivatives, many of which were purchased in the mid-2000s to protect earnings under a low rate scenario.","In the second quarter, our average investment spread across all U.S. product lines was the top end of the roughly 200- to 250-basis-point range experienced during the past few years. To help you think about the impact of interest rates on earnings, I refer you to the low interest rate stress scenario in our 2012 10-K. We said that the continuation of the late 2012 interest rate environment in the U.S. through year-end 2014 would reduce our operating earnings by $45 million in 2013 and $150 million in 2014 relative to plan.","In late 2012, the 10-year treasury yield was 1.69%. Our plan assumed rates would steadily increase and reach to 2.38% by year-end 2013, and then remain at this level through 2014. In addition, credit spreads were tighter in late 2012 than assumed in our plan. Today, the 10-year treasury yield is approximately 2.6% or slightly above our plan assumption, and credit spreads have widened, which puts them roughly in line with our plan. With a rate environment only slightly more favorable than our plan, we did not assume investment margins will expand as a result of the recent increase in interest rates. To be sure, higher interest rates are a positive development, but the benefits for MetLife are reduced risk of margin compression and balance sheet charges.","Now I would like to provide an update on customer centricity, followed by some comments on the regulatory environment. We continue to expand significant effort on the 4 cornerstones of our strategic plan because they are firmly within our control and critical to becoming a world-class organization. Regulatory outcomes by contrast are only partially within our control, but require no less effort, given their potential impact on our long-term competitive position.","Customer centricity is an important element of our strategy, and while it won't show up in the numbers overnight, it can help create an enduring competitive advantage for MetLife. I have noted in the past that MetLife and the life insurance industry have not done as good a job of delivering exceptional customer experiences as some other industries. Simply put, we are just too hard to do business with. As a result of important simplification work we are doing around the globe, we have early indications that enhancing the customer experience not only increases customer satisfaction but also reduces additional work and ultimately, lowers cost for MetLife. Results in several areas, faster call handling, improved self-service, first-contact customer resolution and streamlined claims processing, bear this out.","In Korea, improved technology has dramatically reduced telephone wait times, with 86% of calls answered in less than 20 seconds today, up from 47% before the upgrade. In the U.S., simple fixes to our website tripled customer use of our online change of address process and virtually eliminated related customer complaints. In the U.S. and Mexico, call center representatives, newly empowered with better tools and technology, are now resolving 60% of customer problems in a single contact, up from 45%. And in Poland, a redesigned claims process, including simpler forms, reduced documentation requirements and proactive status updates to customers, reduced life insurance claim payments turnaround times by 30% from 5.6 days to 3.9 days. There is still much work to be done, but I am encouraged by our early progress on improving the MetLife customer experience.","Now let me offer a few observations on the regulatory environment. As you know, on July 18, the Financial Stability Board designated MetLife and 8 other insurance companies as globally systemically important insurers or GSIIs. Our understanding is that being named a GSII has no legal effect unless MetLife is designated a systemically important financial institution or SIFI by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. If we are designated a SIFI, MetLife would be subject to enhanced prudential standards promulgated by the Federal Reserve. Furthermore, the Fed will have to determine whether to subject U.S.-based GSIIs to additional supervision and prudential rules.","Two days before we were named a GSII, FSOC voted to advance MetLife to Stage 3 of the SIFI designation process. As I said at the time, I do not believe that MetLife is a systemically important financial institution. The life insurance industry is a source of financial stability. Even during periods of financial stress, the long-term nature of insurance liabilities protects against bank-like runs and the need to sell assets quickly.","For pure protection products, the company makes no payment unless an insured event occurs, so there's no way to accelerate the liabilities. For products that include a savings component, there are strong disincentives to surrender and cash out. Not only can policyholders face surrender charges and tax penalties, but they may find it difficult to purchase new policies if they had to be medically re-underwritten. The existence of the state-based guarantee funds provides a further incentive for customers to hold on to their policies. Importantly, state insurance regulators have the ability to halt surrenders in the event of financial distress and have typically done so.","As a practical matter, being moved to Stage 3 means that FSOC can request nonpublic financial information to examine a company's potential for systemic risk. During the process, MetLife is permitted to submit additional information to FSOC, demonstrating that our business does not pose systemic risk. It's unclear how long we will remain in Stage 3 of the designation process. Our only frame of reference from the insurance industry is the experience of AIG and Prudential, both of which spent more than 7 months in Stage 3.","After Stage 3 is complete, a 2\/3 vote of FSOC is needed for a proposed determination that a company is a SIFI, including an affirmative vote by the chairperson, who is The Secretary of the Treasury. If a company receives a notice of proposed determination, it has 30 days to request a nonpublic hearing to appeal the decision. FSOC then has 30 days to hold the hearing and another 60 days post hearing to make a final determination, which again requires a 2\/3 vote of FSOC, including an affirmative vote by the chairperson. At that point, a company may bring action in U.S. district court, seeking to have the determination rescinded.","The critical question for insurers designated as SIFIs is what the prudential rules will look like. Will they be bank-like capital rules or rules appropriate for the business model of insurance? Senator Susan Collins of Maine helped put this issue in perspective in a letter to the federal banking regulators last fall. For context, Senator Collins sponsored a provision on the Dodd-Frank Act requiring capital standards for nonbank SIFIs to be no less rigorous than those that apply to banks. In her letter, she said, \"it was not Congress' intent that federal regulators supplant prudential state-based insurance regulation with a bank-centric capital regime.\"","We strongly believe that insurance companies should be regulated differently than banks. As I've said many times, if life insurers are subjected to capital rules designed for banks, MetLife's ability to issue guarantees would be constrained. We'd have to raise the price of products we offer to consumers or stop offering certain products all together.","To be clear, we strongly support prudential regulation of the life insurance industry. After all, we are financially liable for insolvencies to the state-based guarantee funds. What is imperative is that the rules be tailored to the business model of insurance. In closing, while the regulatory environment remains fluid, we are delivering strong financial performance today and executing on our strategy to generate increasing shareholder value over time.","With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?","John C. R. Hele","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our second quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash, capital and guidance.","As Steve noted, MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.6 billion or $1.44 per share, up 11% year-over-year. This quarter included a few notable items, all in our EMEA region. The first relates to our pension business in Poland. In June, the government of Poland announced 3 proposals, and any one of these 3 would materially change the country's pension system. A change in the system is expected before the end of the year, with implementation occurring sometime in 2014.","We expect that the economics of our pension business will be materially altered in Poland, resulting in either a significant reduction or the elimination of our pension assets under management, which were approximately $7 billion as of June 30. Therefore, we have written off the entire DAC and VOBA balance related to this business, resulting in an after-tax charge of $26 million or $0.02 per share in the second quarter. Going forward, our preliminary estimate is that this change to the Polish pension system will reduce EMEA's operating earnings by $15 million to $30 million annually.","Also in EMEA, we had a couple of onetime tax items this quarter. The first was a tax benefit of $52 million, as we made an APB 23 assertion for the region. This was partially offset by a $30 million write-off of a deferred tax asset related to our U.K. wealth management business due to regulatory changes that made future sales growth and profits less certain for this startup operation. The net benefit of these 2 items was $22 million or $0.02 per share.","Turning to our bottom line results. Second quarter net income was $471 million or $0.43 per share and included net derivative losses of $1.1 billion after tax. The net derivative loss in the quarter was driven primarily by 3 items that we consider to be either noneconomic or a cause of asymmetrical accounting treatment. These are: number one, an increase in interest rates; number two, changes in foreign currencies, principally the weakening of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar; and number three, the MetLife-owned credit impact associated with our VA program. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $47.20 at June 30, down modestly from March 31. This slight decline was a function of modest net income due to the net derivative loss and 2 quarterly dividends declared in the quarter.","Turning to margins. Underwriting was generally unfavorable this quarter. The mortality ratio in retail life was 89.7% due to unfavorable experience in both variable and universal life and traditional life. This result was higher than our expectation for the quarter and worse than the 85.6% ratio in the second quarter of 2012. The mortality ratio in group life was 86.5% in the quarter, favorable to the prior year quarter of 87.3% and well within the target of 85% to 90%. The improvement in the mortality ratio was driven by lower Group Universal Life claims experience. As a reminder, a 1-percentage-point change in mortality ratio equates to quarterly operating earnings impact of approximately $2 million to $3 million for retail life and $8 million to $10 million for group life.","The Non-Medical Health benefit ratio was 89.5%, up 210 basis points from the prior year quarter of 87.4% and at the top end of the targeted range of 86% to 90%. The primary driver for the increase in the ratio was weaker underwriting results in long-term care due to higher incidence and to a lesser extent, an increase in the average claim size. However, we are seeing an improvement in disability underwriting results as the overall claims incidence trend continues to be favorable. As a reminder, a 1-percentage-point change in the Non-Medical Health benefit ratio equates to an operating earnings impact of approximately $10 million on a quarterly basis.","In our P&C business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 107.5% for Retail and 97.7% for group. Retail was impacted by higher-than-budget catastrophes in the Midwest. Overall, catastrophes were higher than budgeted in the quarter by $16 million or $0.01 per share. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were higher year-over-year in both Retail and group at 86.1% and 92.1%, respectively. The increase was driven by elevated non-catastrophe weather-related losses and lower favorable prior year reserve development.","Next, let me turn to investment spreads. In our QFS, you will note that the spreads remain strong and are higher versus the prior year quarter across all major product lines in the U.S., driven by higher variable investment income and derivative income. A simple average of the investment spreads in our U.S. businesses were 244 basis points this quarter, which compares to 231 basis points in the second quarter of 2012 and 235 basis points in the second quarter of 2011. This progression illustrates the resilience of our investment margins despite a challenging interest rate environment. In the quarter, pretax variable investment income was $312 million, reflecting strong returns from private equities and hedge funds. After DAC and taxes, variable investment income was $202 million or slightly less than $0.01 per share above the top end of our 2012 -- 2013 quarterly guidance range.","With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.5% for the second quarter. Excluding the impact of pension and postretirement benefits and closeouts, the operating expense ratio was 22.8%. This compares favorably to the second quarter of 2012, which had an operating expense ratio of 23.7% and 23.4% excluding pension and postretirement benefits and closeouts. We are pleased with this performance as it reflects progress on our strategic goal to reduce net expenses by $600 million. Through the first half of 2013, gross expense saves were $248 million, while net saves were $173 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $12 million and onetime costs of $63 million.","I will now discuss some of the business highlights in the quarter. Rather than go through every segment, I will focus on areas where our results may have differed from your expectations. Therefore, my comments will be on Retail annuities, Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, Corporate Benefit Funding, Latin America and Asia. Retail annuities reported operating earnings of $368 million, up $142 million or 63% versus the prior year quarter. The earnings drivers were comprised of several factors, including favorable market impact, lower ongoing DAC amortization, lower operating expenses and higher net investment income.","Variable annuities sales were $2.8 billion in the quarter, down 40% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. We continue to target full year VA sales of $10 billion to $11 billion. Effective August 12, we are eliminating sub-pays for all GMIB Max and Enhanced Death Benefit Max products, other than our current product, GMIB Max V.","Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits reported operating earnings of $275 million, up 3% year-over-year. As I mentioned previously, underwriting results were unfavorable in long-term care and property and casualty, and this was a case both year-over-year and relative to our expectations. However, improved investments and expense margins were effective offsets to less favorable underwriting margins.","Turning to Corporate Benefit Funding. Operating earnings were $350 million, up 10% year-over-year. The growth was driven by improvements in investment and underwriting margins. Investment margins improved as a result of lower credit interest, primarily on capital markets products, and higher variable investment income. The increase in underwriting margins was primarily driven by a mortality gain in the U.S. pensions business.","In Latin America, operating earnings were $125 million, down 7% year-over-year and 11% on a constant-currency basis due to adverse mark-to-market investment results in Brazil and Mexico, the impact of inflation in Mexico and Chile and higher expenses primarily due to business initiatives in the region. While bottom line results were pressured, underlying business growth in the region drove solid top line performance. Premium fees and other revenues were up 12% year-over-year and 8% on a constant-currency basis, driven by growth in worksite marketing in Mexico, group insurance in Brazil and direct marketing in Argentina.","In addition, total sales in Latin America were up 32% year-over-year, with strong growth in all countries. In Mexico, sales growth was driven by increases in Retail and Group products. In Chile, the sales increase was driven by growth in the agency force. In Argentina, the increase was driven by direct marketing. And finally, sales growth in Brazil was driven by higher accident and health sales.","Turning to Asia. Operating results were $330 million in the quarter, up 18% year-over-year and 27% on a constant-currency basis. Earnings were driven by underlying business growth; higher fee income from the surrender of foreign currency fixed annuity products in Japan; and strong equity market performance in Japan, which resulted in a decline in variable life guaranteed minimum death benefit reserves that benefited operating earnings by $19 million. This quarter, we again saw higher surrender activity in Japan, which was an item we've highlighted on our last call. This is the result of customers harvesting gains in foreign-currency-denominated fixed annuity products, denominated in Australian and U.S. dollars. We believe that customers have shifted assets into equities, which continue to perform very well.","In the quarter, surrender fees in excess of plan contributed $35 million to Asia's operating earnings. We expect that surrender fees will decline significantly in the second half of the year. In addition, as a result of elevated surrenders in the first half of the year, we would expect to see a reduction to operating earnings by slightly less than $15 million annually.","Finally, Asia's second quarter operating earnings were $9 million lower than our plan as a result of yen weakness relative to the U.S. dollar. As we have stated previously, we have hedges for our 2013 projected yen-exposed operating earnings at strike prices at around JPY 90 to the U.S. dollar. These hedges are currency options which provide protection against the yen weakening beyond JPY 90, but allow us to participate if the upside should the yen strengthen. Our protection now extends to the third quarter of 2014, with currency options at around JPY 90 in place for the first quarter, around JPY 95 in the second and in the range of JPY 95 to JPY 100 for the third quarter.","Now I will discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. The increase was driven primarily by $1.4 billion of subsidiary dividends, as well as the $550 million release of capital from unwinding MetLife Bank, as we mentioned at our May Investor Day.","Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. As you know, we report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the second quarter. With regards to Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 1,033% as of the first quarter of 2013. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the second quarter of 2013 were $614 million and $176 million, respectively. Statutory operating earnings were up $382 million from the prior year due to improved market conditions, while net income was lower than the prior year primarily due to derivative and joint venture capital losses.","For the first 6 months of 2013, statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies were $1.4 billion and $734 million, respectively. Total adjusted capital for our domestic insurance companies is expected to be approximately $27.4 billion as of June 30, down 6% from December 31 primarily due to subsidiary dividends paid to the holding company. Excluding the dividends, total adjusted capital would have been down 1% for the year due to unrealized losses driven by derivatives.","Finally, let me provide some comments regarding guidance. Considering the outperformance in the quarter and the first half of the year, we now expect to exceed the top end of our 2013 EPS guidance range of $4.95 to $5.35. We believe that our operating EPS will likely be lower in the second half of 2013 relative to the first half of 2013 primarily for 4 reasons: number one, we still anticipate investment spread compression for the balance of the year despite recent increase in interest rates due to our expectation for lower variable investment income and lower core yields; number two, we assume a less favorable market impact for the second half of the year; number three, we expect that surrenders in Japan will return to a more normal level in the second half of the year, which should mean a decline in surrender fee income relative to the first half of the year; and number four, we project higher expenses in the second half of the year, driven by key enterprise initiatives. Partially offsetting these items is the anticipated accretion from the acquisition of Provida, which is expected to close at the beginning of the fourth quarter.","And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Nadel from Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Two questions, unrelated issues. The first is you talked and gave some good detail on the potential change in the -- from the pension reform in Poland. I was wondering if you could sort of give us an update on your expectations. There's been a lot of discussion about potential for reform in Chile, so maybe you can talk about your current business there and then the potential impacts on Provida.","Michel Khalaf","John, this is Michel Khalaf. Let me, first of all, just give you a little bit of the background around the proposed pension reform in Poland. Poland was one of the best performing economies in the EU following the financial crisis. However, the economy slowed down significantly in the last year, 18 months, so GDP growth is expected to be under 1% this year. In addition to that, Poland has 2 major challenges. One is around its debt-to-GDP ratio, which, under the Polish constitution, must be maintained under 55%, otherwise that would trigger austerity measures. And the other issue that Poland faces is that the EU requires it to have its budget deficit brought down to under 3%, and that budget deficit is currently close to 4%. So given this economic background, political situation with a government in its second term, facing elections in 2015, the Polish authorities are intending to introduce changes to the pension system, which is tantamount really to a partial renationalization of the system. But the situation at this point is quite unique in the sense that Poland is facing these challenges and hence, the proposed reforms. Obviously, we're disappointed at these developments. We think that in the long run, these measures will have detrimental effects, especially as far as the development of capital markets in Poland and as far as participants in the pension system as well. And we're working hard with the other participants in the market and industry and trade associations to hopefully convince the government to make some changes to those proposals. So that's a little bit of the background on Poland. Let me turn it over to Bill Wheeler to talk to you about Chile.","William J. Wheeler","Thanks, Michel. So John, a couple of things, just to give you a little context about Chile. Chile is a very attractive place to do business. It has a AA- sovereign credit rating. That's the highest in Latin America. It's -- and obviously, when we -- we took that into account when we announced the acquisition of Provida. Just remember, we think we bought Provida at a very attractive price relative to where other properties in that market have traded over the past couple of years. So it's a transaction that we're still very excited about. There is a presidential election campaign going on in Chile, so there have been some comments about the AFP pension scheme. Chile thinks they invented, and I guess they did invent, the private pension scheme 20-plus years ago. They're very proud of it. They think it's been a roaring success, and I don't disagree with that. The comments in the presidential election have come both from the contenders for the new job, as well as the existing president, Pi\u00f1era. Michelle Bachelet, who is -- who was President of Chile previously and is now likely to be the winner in this coming election in November, has made some comments. And I would guess the comments are along the lines of she wants to see contributions increase, from sort of 10% of salary to maybe something like 12%. And also, she wants to make sure that workers at sort of lower socio-economic levels, sort of itinerant workers are covered more thoroughly by the existing pension schemes. I would also say she has talked about a lot of reforms in a lot of areas of the country, and so this is one of many things that she's focused on in her election campaigning. When we step back and think about what's been said and sort of her track record, remember, she had been president before so she's a known quantity, we're still very comfortable with the Provida acquisition and think it's going to be very successful for us.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then the second question I just had, John, you mentioned in Corporate Benefits Funding that it was really -- the investment margins expanded largely because of lower crediting rates related to capital markets-type business. Could you maybe give us more clarity there? Especially as it relates to -- is this a lower-level crediting rate that we should expect will continue? Or is it more tied to -- what is that tied to? Is it tied to LIBOR? Is it tied to rates at the longer end of the curve? Should those crediting rates jump back up?","John C. R. Hele","Right. Well, I would view this more as a onetime opportunistic, excellent management performance by our investment team really in the quarter. And also we've had good derivative income across all the lines. This line also benefited from some good returns we had on our sec lending program. So a lot of the assets that we've loaned out in the quarter were from this group, and we had slightly higher margins than we've had historically. So I would not put this for a full run rate. Steve will add a little bit to this, too, as well.","Steven Jeffrey Goulart","Let me just add a little color. It's Steve Goulart. And we like to think of it more than onetime, too, because a lot of it was really related to just what's happening in the capital markets. As we've been refinancing our funding agreement backed notes, obviously, those costs are coming down, and they're down substantially. If you look at what we refinanced in the first half of the year, in the order of $6 billion worth, it's down 100 to 150 basis points. And our asset yields are just not coming down as rapidly, so we're seeing good margins there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Couple of questions, first on cash. At $6.5 billion, even if we adjust for the Provida acquisition, it seems like cash is tracking a little bit at the high end of what you've guided for the end of year. So I want to see if maybe you had an update there.","John C. R. Hele","We're tracking within the range we gave you on Investor Day.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on ROEs, I think, as of midyear, you're already in the 12.5% range. And thinking of previous guidance, which I think was 11% to 13% x any buybacks and probably 11%-ish if rates remain low, it seems like you're already exceeding that. So do you have any thoughts as to do ROEs -- or do they maintain at this level? Do you expect them to come down a bit? Maybe think about the next step of the ROE story.","John C. R. Hele","We've got a few impacts that will impact the future outlook for ROE. As we said, just on the call, that we expect the operating EPS to be -- operating earnings to be slightly lower than the first half of the year going forward. We also have our convertible equity units coming in this fall that will add to the denominator. And of course, we're building capital. We're not doing capital management actions at this time, and that will build up. So ROE will be pressured without other actions going forward, slowly over time. Contrary to this, will be our ability to grow revenues faster than our expenses, which the implementation of our strategy appears to be executing so far this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First question for Steve Kandarian. First of all, thanks for the timeline on the whole regulatory outlook. It was helpful perspective. But if I take what you said and I think about the precedent that you mentioned, I guess, AIG and Pru sitting in Stage 3 for 7 months and then 30 to 60 days of incremental wait time and I couple that with your comments around -- in the past, around perhaps not doing anything more aggressive in terms of share repurchase until we actually know what the rules of the road are. So can I take from that, that as long as that time frame is out there, 7 months-plus, we're probably not going to see anything in terms of share repurchases?","Steven A. Kandarian","Suneet, what I've done in the past on this type of question is just simply say, \"As of today, this is where we are\" because things come down the pike over time that you learn more about the process or where things are going so you could change your point of view based upon new information. So I don't want to put a stake on the ground, but as of now, we don't think it's prudent to announce some large share buyback program in the face of the regulatory uncertainty that we have.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, a second question on Japan. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the accident and health market there. Obviously, Aflac has announced a pretty big partnership with the Japan Post. And I'm wondering if that will somehow impact your -- I think, your target market, which I think is a little bit more direct-to-consumer marketing, which I would assume would be a little bit more in the rural areas. So I guess, how are you thinking about your growth potential in that market given that sizable transaction -- or sizable partnership that was announced?","Christopher G. Townsend","It's Chris Townsend. Let me tell you, first of all, in terms of how our A&H business grew in Japan for the second quarter. We grew at 10% year-on-year, and that was growth across all 4 channels, so across the career agency, independent agency, DM and the bank channel. So we have said to you a number of times before that the strength of our business in Japan emanates from the breadth of distribution we have, and that's being played out in the numbers you're seeing here. Interestingly enough, the bank channel, where we're challenged in terms of some of the fixed annuity business, we grew 73% year-on-year in the A&H channel, and we're selling A&H business to about 30 different banking partners now. So we feel we've got a good reach across the country and reach across distribution, which will allow us to continue to earn very good money out of the A&H business.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So any comments on the Japan Post tie-up?","Christopher G. Townsend","The Japan Post business is an extension of an existing contract, which that company has, and it will, I'm sure, put them in good position for the cancer business. We -- our A&H business is slightly different to Aflac, and they're 80-20 cancer to medical. We're exactly vice versa in terms of 80% medical, 20% cancer. I would say that we actually launched today a new cancer product in Japan, which is fairly revolutionary in terms of some of the types it covers that it offers, and we're hoping for good things out of that product.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Maybe one last question for Steve Kandarian, I guess. You've talked to us about the -- some of the initiatives that you've highlighted, the expense savings and the emerging markets. But the other one that we haven't really heard a whole lot about is the global group benefits initiative. So just wondering if there's any color that you can provide in terms of your progress there towards that, I think, $250 million of earnings by 2016.","Maria R. Morris","Suneet, it's Maria Morris. Thanks for the question. We're actually quite pleased with the progress we've been making in the group area across the globe. As you know, we are actually working with our global companies, and we've seen sales increased year-over-year by triple digits, which is phenomenal. We've seen our multinational sales up triple digits in each of the 3 regions. And our expatriate business continues to do well as well, where sales in expatriates will be up over 50% for the year.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is it moving the needle yet in terms of earnings? Or is that still to come?","Maria R. Morris","We've been making some investments as you're aware of. We talked to you about those on Investor Day. So we're investing in the early years. We are seeing that we're above plan on earnings, but our earnings were more tempered in the early years as we invest for the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question for John, just in terms of the -- your comments about second half earnings drivers. On -- one of the things you mentioned, Japan surrenders you expect to fall off. Have you seen thus far into 3Q? I know we're a little -- we're what, 1 month into the quarter, but are you actually seeing that play out thus far? And then the other question on third quarter earnings would be you also mentioned you're assuming a lower variable investment income. Because of the lag on private equity reporting I assume you had pretty decent visibility on that. So should we be expecting something below plan or maybe middle of the plan in terms of near term where that trends? That's my first question, and then I have 1 follow-up.","John C. R. Hele","You asked 2 questions, but I'll give you that on 1. The second half earnings drivers with regards to Japan, yes, we've already seen a decrease, tapering down in that. So we do expect that to taper down for the remainder of the year. With regard to VII, we have -- some of the funds are on a 1-month lag, some is on a 1 quarter, so we're seeing it slightly less. But who knows what the equity market is going to do in August and September, and that's a key driver to these types of returns. So we're basically assuming on plan right now for -- which is the midpoint of the range we've given.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. Okay, so midpoint. And then just a question on long-term care, you'd mentioned the weakness in results as one issue for the quarter. Can you frame that a little bit? And are you still actually making money in long-term care even with the higher claims you're seeing? Is this an issue that we should be thinking about in terms of potential balance sheet impacts?","William J. Wheeler","Tom, it's Bill Wheeler. We make good money in long-term care. The issue with long-term care is that we have to hold a lot of capital against it, so the ROEs are not terribly attractive. But even with these incidence rates, long-term care is solidly profitable. A little color on the incidence. What we're seeing is higher reported claims, and the approval rate of those claims is pretty high. We're sort of digging into the issue now to make sure -- we recently moved some of the claims management and reporting and claims operations. And whenever you do that, in any insurance business, you always can -- sometimes new wrinkles can cause some blips in terms of how the claims management is done, so we're digging into that and trying to understand it better. But it's -- in my mind, this is a -- this did cause the non-health morbidity ratio to jump a little bit, but it's not that significant.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So Bill, still a lot of margin left?","William J. Wheeler","I'm sorry, what's that?","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You still have a lot of margin left on the LTC.","William J. Wheeler","In terms of balance, this isn't -- wouldn't remotely size up to be a balance sheet issue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question for Steve, on capital deployment, you mentioned you'd -- probably the buybacks would be on hold until you get greater clarity on SIFI. Does that apply to dividends as well? Because you did raise your dividend despite uncertainty on SIFI. And then the other question is on just if you could give us a little bit more detail on the components of the derivatives losses. How much of those is related to interest rates, foreign exchange or the nonperformance risk?","John C. R. Hele","Jimmy, I'll take the dividend question. As you know, we just increased our dividend early this year by 49% from $0.74 a share to $1.10. And we announced the Provida acquisition for approximately $2 billion using cash on our balance sheet. So we are deploying capital in a way we think is prudent in light of the regulatory overhang. We don't think, at this point in time, engaging in share buybacks is the right thing to do. So that is kind of where we stand right now on deployment of capital. I don't rule out what happens late in the year in terms of changes to our dividend. But as of now, we're comfortable with $1.10 per year.","Steven A. Kandarian","With regard to the net derivative loss, it was about 60% rates, 20% FX and 20% own credit.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And the dividend, I wasn't assuming that you'd raise it right now anyway, but I think, in a couple of quarters, you're going to be at 4 quarters at a consistent rate. So -- but you are implying that the buyback comments won't necessarily apply to dividends though. Is that right?","Steven A. Kandarian","That's correct.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just following up on long-term care. Are you thinking about like raising prices on the in-force business? And if you are doing that, where you are in that process? And then finally, several of your competitors have actually had success with variable annuity buyouts. And wondering if you could just comment on your thoughts on part of your block that are perhaps a little bit more underwater.","William J. Wheeler","So Jimmy, this is Bill. The -- with regard to long-term care price increases, we've been raising prices on our long-term care in-force for, I think, 3 years now. We've sort of been going block by block in terms of doing that, and we've had very good success. We announced another round of price increases or the new initiatives at the end of 2012, and we are going through the state approval processes now. In our latest round of price increases, 25 states have granted us approval. Now before you get too excited, these tend to be a smaller populations states. The big population states, where most of the block is, are -- haven't opined yet. So they're -- but we think it's going well. And we actually, frankly, have a lot of experience in terms of getting these rate increases through the regulatory process, and this one is going in a very similar fashion to what's happened to us before. So that's sort of just latest on long-term care prices. We are looking at what some of our peers have done with regard to variable annuity buyouts. We're trying to analyze whether or not that makes sense for us. We haven't made a decision yet whether it does. Obviously, the reality is, if the stock market improves and interest rates move up, our in-force becomes less and less in the money. And our net amount of risk is a relatively small number, and their in the money-ness is a relatively small portion of the in-force block. So it's -- we haven't ruled it out, but we haven't made a decision yet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just have 1 question for Steve Kandarian. Steve, I was intrigued by your comments that you were focusing intensely on improving the customer service experience. That would seem to be a logical and normal thing for any business to do. It's just that in the life insurance business, I tend to think of it as having far fewer customer interactions than, say, the P&C business. In the car insurance business, for example, people's cars get in accidents, their homes are hurt by damage and they're looking for claims-paying ability. But on the life insurance business, I tend to think of it as a business in which people sign up and sort of maybe occasionally make changes to addresses and what have you, but don't have as many interactions as, say, in the property\/casualty business. So why are you focusing on -- in what you call the customer experience as much as you do? And how will you know whether the expenditures are paying off? That's my 1 question.","Steven A. Kandarian","Eric, we've looked at a lot of studies around the issue of companies being customer-centric. And yes, P&C has more interaction than life, but we still have a fair number of interactions with our customers, even simple things like change of address or calling about some information on their product and their balances and so on and savings products. And if we don't provide a good customer experience in those interactions, people are not going to recommend us to family, friends, others who say, \"I'm thinking about buying this product or that product that falls to the life insurance category. Who did you buy from? Did you have a good experience?\" So the data is pretty clear that if you do a good job giving service to your customer, your top line improves because referrals, second sales and third sales to existing customers, as well as if you design the process right in terms of interactions and how the products themselves are sold and how the information that goes to customers is articulated, you'll get your cost down because all those customer complaints and second, third phone calls and trying to move people around the system to figure out an answer to their question becomes expensive. So again, the studies in these are pretty clear that your top line and bottom line can improve over time. It's not something that happens in the first 6 months or 12 months. It is a process that will take a number of years. We will track this. We will have data over time, but I don't have data for you right now. The cost that we're talking about here is not enormous amounts of money for some of the fixes that we're talking about. Simple fixes to websites to make them clearer, make the process much easier for the customer to interact with us are not big-ticket items. But it takes time and attention and takes a lot of people to focus on it. I used to hear when I was -- at MetLife, when I first got here, a mantra about customer service that's good enough. And I don't think that customer service that's good enough is good enough. I think you have to have good customer service, if you expect your existing customers to recommend you to others, if you expect that your ability to deliver customer service over time will be at a reasonable cost. So that's why we're engaged in this effort. It is something that we're all focused on, including all of us here at the executive group level, who make phone calls to customers who have problems with their interactions with us, where we can, on a firsthand basis, learn about those experiences and help us become more sensitized to what our customers face every day as they interact with us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein from Evercore.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Wanted to go to the, I guess, the derivative losses in the quarter. And I guess, the question I want to ask is this, obviously, rates going higher is a positive thing, but it does have that effect on earnings, both statutory and GAAP. And I guess what I'm thinking about is if you just take the assumption that rates will continue to migrate higher, perhaps follow the forward curve, if you will, who knows where they go, but how should we think about that in kind of future statutory dividends? Like, does it -- because, I mean, I'm really thinking about a nonparallel accounting treatment. Like, is this meaningful?","Steven A. Kandarian","Well, as we think -- our projections as we thought out to 2016 assume rates will be increasing. Our plan this year was the 10-year treasury go to 2.38%. We're in excess of that now but it will slowly be increasing. And we factor all this in when we think about our cash and capital projections, when we give you the ratios that we spoke about on Investor Day. So I mean we do take this into account. You have to remember that there is -- we generally have longer-dated derivatives, so it's more tied to the longer end of the curve. Today, we still have very short-term rates, very low short-term rates. And I think as people think forward over the next few years, that's where some of the more interesting pressure might come, if the curve flattened some more. So there's really 2 dimensions to the whole rising interest rate.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, I think you pointed out some key enterprise initiatives in the back half of the year as a driver of higher expenses. I know there's been a lot going on with the company, but you highlighted this specifically in the back half of the year. Is there anything specific that we should be thinking about that you can talk about?","John C. R. Hele","We have some of the -- as we spoke about at our Investor Day in terms of the cost saves, we also have some strategic expenses coming through. They've been fairly light so far, but they will be building throughout the remainder of the year. And that's one of the aspects of the large investments in technology, much related around to improving customer service, as Steve mentioned.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, just thinking about variable annuity -- or I should say annuity earnings. I know you had very wide fixed annuity spreads, but you had a substantial gapping up of the kind of the ROAs on the block. And I'm just thinking -- I mean, are we at a new basing level, if you just kind of back off some spread on fixed annuities? But just thinking about the level of annuity earnings. I mean, are we at a new basing level that we should be trending going forward off of?","John C. R. Hele","I wouldn't trend it off as high as what we have done this quarter because of the factors that I mentioned. We are reinvesting as those annuities mature, and the cash flows turn over in that business. We're investing at a lower rate than what we have historically. The derivative income has held up very well. The investment teams have been able to keep those -- that derivative income up, and that's been one of the big outperforms versus our expectations in the core spread. We also had good VII that's allocated to that line of business. So you have to put that piece down. You also remember, we've had very favorable equity markets in general in the annuity business, and that drives -- we have larger assets from that, so we get more fee income from that business line flowing through. So the higher asset base and depending upon your views of equity market performance, that will re-base higher, obviously. But this is pressure of the reinvestment narrowing down.","Steven A.

In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.","Steven Kandarian","Thank you, John and good morning everyone. Last night, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $1.41up from a $1.20 per share a year ago. Overall it was a strong quarter across most business segments with favorable results from a variable investment income, expense management and underwriting. Equity markets which rose by 5.5% in the quarter as measured by the S&P 500 create a tailwind for earnings. Well, low interest rates in a strong U.S. dollar remain as headwinds.","Adjusting for notable items operating earnings were $1.46 per share, which compares to $1.31 per share on the same basis in the prior year period. Net notable items of $0.05 per share in the quarter including higher catastrophe losses, expenses to support our unit cost initiative, illegal settlement and a Penn Treaty guarantee fund assessment. These are offset in part by a retail life insurance reserve release.","As noted in my annual letter to shareholders. MetLife has a leading position in group benefits with a market share of 25% among the large employers. We are also experiencing strong growth in the mid-market and have over 40,000 small employer relationships. What we pioneered this business as century ago, we consider group benefits an avenue for future growth and highlighted the segment as one of our growth engines and our November Investor Day.","During the quarter sales of Group Benefits were up by 29% with strength across all market segments and product lines. Our national accounts sales were particularly strong especially among clients with more than 25,000 employees. We continue to invest in this business to create differentiated customer experiences, supported by strong enabling technology and leading data protection capabilities.","Over the years our group customers have put their confidence in us, because of our financial strength and strong service capabilities. Today they're also trusting us to protect claim privacy in an uncertain world.","The macroeconomic environment in the last eight years has affected our business units in different ways. Our group for example, is correlated to the health of the U.S. employment market. We have been able to grow premiums and fees in the group business at a compound annual rate to 4.5% over the past five years. Despite modest U.S. labor force and wage growth among large employers, all else being equal a stronger U.S. job market would drive faster growth in our Group Benefits business.","I have also made note of our shift away from capital intensive [indiscernible] Life Insurance in Japan. This decision was driven by our requirement for appropriate internal rates of return and payback periods for the products we sell. The shift in our product mix resulted in lower Japanese sales for most in 2016, but we have started to turn the corner, in the first quarter 2017, Japan sales grew by 8% which strengthened foreign currency denominated whole life as well as accident & health products. Although this is too early to declare a trend from a single quarter, we are pleased with the overall direction or sales transition in Japan.","MetLife's net derivative losses in the quarter totaled $602 million. With interest rates ending in the first quarter of roughly where they started, much of the derivatives loss were driven by strength in the U.S. equity markets and costs associated with executing the separation of Brighthouse Financial.","As part of a supplemental disclosure we've again included an exhibit that details that firm value movement of our derivative portfolio. As promised at meetings with investors throughout the first quarter, we are providing on this call an update on RemainCo MetLife hedging strategy. We refreshed our hedging strategy to protect free cash flow from both falling and rising interest rates. This was accomplished through a process that sought to optimize free cash flow, well balancing several key statutory economic and GAAP metrics. While the restructuring of the RemainCo hedge program is largely complete the program is dynamic. You actively monitor and rebound when market conditions warrant. John Hele offer more detail on this topic.","Moving to investments, variable investment income totaled $343 million in the quarter, of this amount $272 million is attributable to RemainCo MetLife, which is above the high end of the quarterly guidance range of $250 million provided our outlook call in December, private equity investments for the largest contributor to the outperformance. In addition, hedge fund returns improved significantly from a year ago.","In the quarter, our global new money yields stood at 3.34%, this comparison average rollout of 4.45% over the past four quarters. In the fourth quarter, our new money rate was 3.15%. Lower yields continued to pressure the life insurance industry.","I would now like to provide an update on our plan to separate a substantial portion of our U.S. retail business. Maybe you have asked whether the separation of Brighthouse Financial will still occur in the first half of 2017. Given the complexity of the transaction we do not believe we have the necessary approvals to complete the separation in that timeframe. The MetLife and Brighthouse Financial teams continue to work diligently with our regulators in all aspects of the disaffiliation. While we did not have an exact estimate of when that work will be complete. We are hopeful it will be in the coming months. Operationally the separation is proceeding on schedule and we have reached several important milestones.","In January, Brighthouse Financial began to operate as in Penn Treaty under MetLife. In March, most significantly Brighthouse Financial began doing business under its own name. In April, Brighthouse Financial launched its first broadcast advertising campaign called predictability. You may have seen some of the ads during March Madness, the Masters or on Squawk Box. And most recently, we finalized a form of financing for Brighthouse captive to hold you ULSG liabilities. This captive will aid Brighthouse's capital efficiency and reduce statutory capital volatility.","Looking ahead, the next regulatory milestone will be the declaration of a hearing date by the Delaware Department of Insurance. We remain confident that the separation will position both companies for success in the respective marketplaces. For MetLife the separation remains the cornerstone of our transformation to a company with lower market sensitivity in a higher and more sustainable free cash flow ratio.","Turning to regulatory matters, I would like to provide a brief update on the government's appeal of the court ruling that rescinded our status as a Systemically Important Financial Institution or SIFI. On April 21st the Trump Administration issued a memorandum directing the Secretary of the Treasury to report within 180 days of the SIFI designation process used by the Financial Stability Oversight Council or FSOC. On April 24th MetLife filed a motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, asking the court to hold the appeal in abeyance until that report is complete.","As we said in our filing, we believe in abeyance will enable the new administration to determine whether any of FSOC's positions in this case should be reconsidered and whether it is appropriate for the government to continue pressing the appeal. The timing for a ruling on our emotion is at the discretion of the Court of Appeals.","Before I close, I want to update you on our share repurchase program. During the first quarter, we repurchased $858 million of our common shares. To date, we have bought back approximately $1.5 billion of our common shares, well roughly half of our $3 billion authorization that we announced in November 2016. We are on track to fully execute this authorization by year end 2017.","With that I will turn the call over John to discuss our Q1 financial results in greater detail.","John Hele","Thank you, Steve and good morning. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results including a discussion of our insurance underwriting margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.","In addition to our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement, last evening we released disclosure labeled 1Q 2017 supplemental slides. That addresses the net derivative loss in the quarter. I will speak to these slides later my presentation. We will continue to release additional supplemental slides when we have complex elements in a quarter.","Operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.5 billion or a $1.41 share. This quarter included five notable items totaling the negative $61 million that we highlighted in our news release and quarterly financial supplement.","First, unfavorable catastrophe experience net of prior year development in Property & Casualty, decreased operating earnings by $45 million, or $0.04 per share, after tax.","Second, Corporate & Other was negatively impacted by a guaranty fund assessment for the Penn Treaty insolvency and an increase in litigation reserves, which decreased operating earnings by $44 million, or $0.04 per share, after tax.","Third, expenses related to a cost initiative also in Corporate & Other decreased operating earnings by $21 million, or $0.02 per share, after tax.","Fourth, reserve adjustments primarily resulting from modeling improvements of individual life products, which increased operating earnings in MetLife Holdings by $34 million or $0.3 per share after tax.","In addition, activity related to separation resulted in an increase to operating earnings of $42 million in MetLife Holdings and offsetting $42 million decrease to operating earnings in Brighthouse Financial.","Finally, variable investment income was above the company's 2017 quarterly business plan range excluding Brighthouse Financial, increased in operating earnings by $15 million, or $0.01 per share, after tax, and the impact of deferred acquisition costs or DAC.","Adjusted for all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 11% year-over-year and 12% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis operating earnings adjusted for all notable items or $1.46 up 11% percent year-over-year and 12% on a constant currency basis.","Turning to our bottom line results. We had first quarter net income of $820 million or $0.75 per share. Net income was $726 million lower than operating earnings, primarily because of net derivative losses of $602 million after tax. For more details about the difference between net income and operator earnings please reference Page 3 in our supplemental slide disclosure this quarter. Page 4 in the supplemental slides shows the attribution of the after tax derivative loss. As Steve noted, the derivative losses driven by strength in the U.S. equity market and the repositioning of our hedging strategies.","For the total company, the $602 million GAAP derivative net loss included, number one, $402 million or two thirds of the total for asymmetrical and non-economic accounting, which including cost to reposition to remain co-hedges to protect from changes in interest rates on a statutory basis. Number two, $139 million of VA hedge ineffectiveness primarily in Brighthouse Financial including the impact of the transition to their new hedging strategy, with number three, the balance of $61 million largely driven by other risks in VA embedded derivatives. The asymmetrical non-economic accounting it's a recurring feature under U.S. GAAP, as the derivative assets and mark-to-market, but a significant portion of MetLife's VA and life liabilities are not.","As Steve mentioned, we've made significant progress at RemainCo with protecting our statutory capital and thus free cash flow from future changes in interest rates. We have obtained further hedge accounting treatment on a statutory basis and restructured the hedges such that our free cash flow percentage is expected to stay within a 65% to 75% band on average over two years with a range of the 10 year Treasury rate from 1.5% to 4%.","As stated in the recently filed Form 10 Amendment, Brighthouse Financial has made significant progress in repositioning to its new strategy. This strategy targets hedging to the statutory measurement of CTE (95) while also holding a targeted buffer of $2 billion to $3 billion. The new hedges protect on the downside using a portion of buffer, but on the upside potential of the Brighthouse Financial. Brighthouse Financial believes this new strategy will reduce hedging cost overtime and improve statutory results.","Brighthouse Financial and MetLife share a common philosophy of preserving free cash flow to the hedging strategies and protecting statutory capital. But the circumstances of the companies are bit different. Brighthouse Financial is hedging to CTE(95), Brighthouse Financial has a greater concentration of variable annuity business than RemainCo and this capital measured better reflects Brighthouse Financial's business. This Brighthouse Financial maintains a large capital buffering it can retain some risk like a deductible reducing hedge costs. In contrast RemainCo has a more diverse business with a lower concentration in variable annuities and no longer rights new variable annuity business in the U.S.","Book value per share excluding AOCI other FCTA with $50.52 as of March 31st down 5% year-over-year primarily due to the impact of derivative losses as well as the actual assumption review in the second quarter of 2016. Tangible book value per share was $41.64 of March 31st down 6% year-over-year.","With respect to first quarter underwriting margins, total company earnings were lower by approximately $0.13 per share versus the prior quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting in Brighthouse Financial accounted for approximately $0.10 of the total decrease. This is primarily due to the previously disclosed impact from the loss of the aggregation benefit, in variable in universal life and the second quarter 2016 modeling changes.","Excluding Brighthouse Financial underwriting earnings were lower by proximately $0.03 per share year-over-year. This is primarily due to higher claim volumes in Mexico and the impact of DAC assumption change in the company's Chile pension business, as well as a one-time reserve adjustment in Japan. In the U.S. underwriting results were essentially in line with the prior year quarter.","The Group life mortality ratio was 86.9%, unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 85.7%, but below the midpoint of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. This is the second lowest, first quarter mortality ratio for Group life in 13 years only the first quarter of 2016 was lower.","MetLife Holdings interest adjusted benefit ratio for life products was $48.6% and $53.8% after adjusting for notable items discussed earlier. This result was favorable to the prior year quarter of 56.6% and in the low end of the targeted range of 53% to 58%.","Finally the Group nonmedical health interest adjusted benefit ratio was 79.9% favorable to the prior-year quarter of 81.2% and within the 2017 annual target range of 76% to 81%. Favorable underwriting results were primarily due to renewal actions and dental and lower new claims severity and disability.","Turning to investment margins, the weighted average of the three products spreads presented in our QFS was 165 basis points in the quarter, up 25 basis points year-over-year. Pre-tax variable investment income or VII, was $343 million, up $178 million versus the prior year quarter, driven by strong private equity and hedge fund performance. Product spreads excluding VII were 129 basis points this quarter, down 2% year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline. Overall, higher investment margins in the quarter accounted for approximately $0.01 of EPS improvement year-over-year.","In regards to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 22.5% and 21.6% after adjusting for the notable items this quarter related to the Penn Treaty litigation reserves and the Company's unit cost initiative. The ratio was favorable to the prior year quarter of 23.8% primarily due to the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group and expense efficiencies. Overall, better expense margins contributed approximately $0.08 of EPS improvement versus the prior-year quarter.","I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Group Benefits reported operating earnings of $174 million, up 37% and 34% adjustment for notable items in both quarters. The primary drivers were favorable expense margins and strong nonmedical health underwriting results.","Group Benefits operating PFOs were $4.3 billion, up 5% year-over-year, driven by growth across all markets. This is the high end of our guidance of 3% to 5% which excluded the loss of one large dental contract which will occur in the second quarter. Group Benefits sales were up 29% with growth across all markets. We saw our particular strength in the jumbo case market due to more core activity and higher closing ratios, while persistency continues to be favorable.","Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, reported operating earnings of $218 million, up 16% but down 1% after adjusting for notable items in the both quarters due to less favorable underwriting. RIS operating PFOs were $479 million, essentially unchanged year-over-year. While one 1Q tends to be the seasonally the weakest for PRT transactions we continue to see a good PRT pipeline and we expect 2017 to be an active year for transactions of all sizes. Our approach will continue to balance growth with an efficient use of capital.","Property & Casualty or P&C, operating earnings were $29 million, up 32% but down 3% after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. Elevated catastrophes net of prior year development reduced operating earnings by $45 million in both quarters. Nearly half of these cats were due to hail storm activity in northern Texas. We have taken steps to address this. And as a result of our homeowner policy count in this area has declined 18% year-over-year. We expect the pace of decline will accelerate to additional rate increases and management actions.","Our P&C combined ratio excluding cats and private development with 89.8% modestly better than the prior year quarter of 90.0%. We continue to see improvement in our non-cat auto results, which posted a combined ratio excluding cats in prior year development of 97.2%, well below the 100.7% in the prior year quarter. Lower auto claim frequency was partially offset by higher severity as repair costs continue to increase on technology-laden vehicles. We have been taking targeted rate increases in auto over the last 12 months of 7% to 8% and expect to take similar lead actions in the immediate future.","P&C operating PFOs were $875 million, down 1% year-over-year. Overall P&C sales were down 5% to due to price increases and management actions to drive value.","Turning to Asia, operating earnings were $295 million, down 3% from the prior year quarter and 4% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. Volume growth and lower expenses were offset by higher reserves and taxes due the change in the Japan effective tax rate.","Asia operating PFOs were $2.1 billion, up 3% and up 1% on a constant currency basis. PFO's included in the joint ventures and ownership was up 3% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were up 35% on the constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were up 8% driven by foreign currency life and accident & health growth. Other Asia sales were up 89% representing good growth in all markets, during particularly by China with the growth of our protection business through our professional agency channel as well as a large group case in Australia.","Latin America reported earnings of $143 million down 5% and down 8% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. The key drivers are less favorable underwriting due to higher claims in Mexico and the impact of an assumption change in a company's Chile pension business. Favorable market impact due to better yields in Mexico and time as well as volume growth will partial offsets.","Latin-America operating PFOs $916 million up 5% and 6% on a constant currency basis. Total sales for the region were up 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong employee benefit sales, particularly offset by lower pension sales in Mexico.","EMEA operating earnings were $75 million, up 19% and 34% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were favorable expense margins and volume growth. While unit cost improvement is ahead of plan a meaningful portion of the year-over-year decline expenses is related to timing and favorable items that are not expected to repeat in subsequent quarters. EMEA operating PFOs were $614 million, essentially unchanged from the prior-year period on a 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in Turkey as well as employee benefits in the UK and Egypt. Total EMEA sales increased 4% on a constant currency basis. We continue to see a favorable shift with higher margin products in the region.","MetLife Holdings, which primarily consists of our legacy retail and long term care runoff businesses, reported operating earnings of $385 million, up 44% and 12% adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were improves underwriting and market results. MetLife Holdings operating PFOs were $1.5 billion, down 8% mostly due to the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group, which included the Company's affiliated broker dealer unit. As previously guided with operating PFOs declined by approximately 12% in 2017 versus 2016.","Corporate & Other, at an operating loss of $99 million compared to an operating loss of $190 million in the first quarter 2016. Adjusting for notable items in the current period, the operating loss of $30 million, this unusually low quarterly loss for Corporate & Other is primarily due to the incremental tax benefit of $151 million reflected in the earnings by source table at the bottom of Page 28 in the QFS. The incremental tax benefit is acquired by GAAP accounting rules to adjust the Company's overall consolidated queerly tax rate to equal the Company's annual projected effective tax rate. As a result it enables the consolidated tax rate to be consistent period over a period it causes Corporate & Other to fluctuate on a quarterly basis.","As with the Company's effective tax rate respected, we expected to be between 21% to 22% for 2017 down from 23% as previously guided, the primary reason is the benefit of non-U.S. operation rates lower than the U.S. tax rate of 35%. Brighthouse Financial operating earnings were $244 million down 25% and 17% of adjusting for notable items in both quarters. The key drivers of the earnings decline primarily related to the previously mentioned unfavorable, underwriting including $39 million a loss of the aggregation benefit and $10 million from the previously discussed 2Q 2016 modeling changes.","As a reminder Brighthouse Financial same results within MetLife's financial statements do not match the financial statements of Brighthouse Financial Inc. and related companies shown in the most recent Brighthouse Financial Form 10 due to accounting timing differences. Brighthouse Financial PFO's were $1.1 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the first quarter 2016.","Overall annuity sales are down 35% and life sales are down 54% mostly resulting from the suspension of sales through one distributor and lower sales in the MetLife Premier Client Group. Sales of the Company's index linked annuity product, Shield Level Selector remain strong in the first quarter 2017 at $455 million up 25% year-over-year.","I will now discuss the cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $3.8 billion at March 31st which is down from $5.8 billion at December 31st. This decrease reflects the net effects of share repurchases, payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses. Please note that first quarter cash at the holding companies include minimal dividends from our operating subsidiaries, and we expect operating subsidiary dividends to increase in the second quarter.","Consistent with our prior guidance. We expect MetLife to receive between $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion in dividends from Brighthouse Financial prior to separation subject to regulatory approvals. Next I would like to provide you with an idea on our capital position. Our combined risk based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies excluding Alico was 465% on an ASC basis at year end 2016.","For our U.S. companies preliminary first quarter statutory results were operating earnings of approximately $870 million and a net loss of $107 million. Statutory operating earnings were up 18% for the prior year quarter, primarily due to favorable underwriting and lower operating expenses. The net loss was primarily the result of losses underivatives.","We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $24.1 billion as of March 31st down 2% from $24.6 billion at December 31st. The decrease in statutory capital is driven by Brighthouse Financial with total adjusted capital or TAC reduced by $1.2 billion. This drop was a function of certain restructuring transaction to separation, which caused the reserves to be less responsive to equity markets in the quarter. Several restructuring and capitalization actions are expected to occur prior to the separation, which possibly impact in TAC. Many of these have been completed in the month of April.","As a result, Brighthouse Financial combined TAC has increased by approximately $1.5 billion since quarter end. On a pro-forma basis as of March 31st 2017 and to give effect to our restructuring and separation related transactions including those in April, we continue to estimate a buffer of approximately $2.1 billion above CTE (95). This result in a combined pro forma RBC ratio for Brighthouse Financial of approximately 650% as of March 31 2017. Further details will be included in the next amendment to the Form 10, which we expect to file in May. For Japan, a solvency margin ratio was 909% as of December 31st, which is the latest public data.","Overall MetLife had a strong first quarter in 2017. Highlighted by favorable impacts in equity markets, lower expenses and solid underwriting in the U.S. Top line growth was particularly strong with sales up 15% year-over-year for MetLife as a whole and 21% for MetLife on post-separation basis.","GAAP net income was negatively impacted by net derivative losses, two thirds of which were asymmetrical and non-economic. In addition, our cash and capital position remain strong, and we remain confident that the actions we are taking to implement our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow, and driving at long term and create long term sustainable value to our shareholders.","And with that I would turn it back to the operator for your question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Q - Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Steve, just a question on the separation, you've mentioned the complexity that may delay the timing, just a question on that, do you still feel confident in the structure of the transaction, in terms of the dividends, the capital for each business or do you see the delay being more administrative complexity.","Steven Kandarian","Hi Tom, nothing changes in terms of our expectations other than the timing. In the timing I use the word months, I didn't use the word quarters. It is the complex transaction. We're working closely with our regulator. There's a lot of information to impart. We are working very diligently and providing information as fast as humanly possible. But it is a large volume of information and analysis that is going on.","So that's what's resulted in the expected delay from what our initial thought was, which was made many months ago, over many quarters ago in terms of expectations around timing once you get into these transactions and you see the complexity associated with them. You see what occurs in terms of the amount of work that has to get done to make sure that everything is detailed appropriately and headlines appropriately.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then just a question on expenses to make sure I have had my head wrapped around these. So John, if I'm understanding the flow of the strategic expenses for RemainCo that would imply you still have another $260 million to $270 million left for the balance of the year. That would come through operating and corporate? That was my first question on expenses. And then also on Brighthouse, I just wanted to get a sense for how much of the kind of annualized $200 million increase in expenses this year is embedded in the 1Q result?","John Hele","The answer to your first question is yes, that's why you expect for the year and could you say the second question again, I quite get that?","Tom Gallagher","Yeah in the Form 10 it indicates Brighthouse expenses you're expected to go up $200 million in 2017 versus 2016 levels, and I just want to understand how much of that planned increase is embedded in the 1Q number. Is any of that or is a small amount just you know some indication of how much is in the 1Q number?","John Hele","Probably about $30 million of that is in Q1.","Tom Gallagher","$30 million on an annualized basis?","John Hele","No $30 million in the quarter, it's\u2026","Tom Gallagher","In the quarter building to like $50 million quarterly run rate?","John Hele","Yeah, yeah.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, so little more than half. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger","Hi thanks. Good morning. My first question was in regard to the changes you made to the derivatives program. Should we expect any impact to the to your ongoing benefit from some of the low interest rate hedges that would come through that would have been coming through operating earnings?","Steven Kandarian","There's not a material change to the benefit that we get from those hedges, of course rates are higher now so we get less benefit, but those are still essentially there.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. So no material change, other than the interest rates are moving. And then just secondly, coming into the year you had guided to $450 million to $650 million of corporate losses excluding the expense initiative costs. Does that change now that you lowered your consolidated tax rate outlook?","John Hele","Yeah, so we expect still to be within that range, but we do expect the lower tax rate for the year now.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi good morning. First, I just had a question on the derivatives losses. Obviously the derivatives loss declined significantly from 4Q, but was still relatively large. So I was a little surprised with the loss in interest rates and that rates were generally flat or lowered depending on which part of the curve you look at. So just wondering what caused that was that related to sales some of that depreciations or something else. And then how the GAAP loss in on the hedging program affected yours whether it had any effect on stat capital?","Steven Kandarian","So there's a few things going on Jimmy. First is although the 1-year Treasury dropped a little or almost flat quarter-to-quarter swap rates were up a little bit. So some noise from that that's asymmetrical on non-economic, but you get the GAAP noise from that, and you also had some strong equity market in the quarter and you've got some GAAP noise in that as well. We also as we pointed out had some hedge ineffectiveness in the quarter and that impacted the total GAAP net income.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then just in terms of the change is implemented I'm assuming you change from swaps to swaps and as you had discussed before, but is that correct and how if you can discuss some of the other changes that you have made and whether you changed the size of the hedge program whether made it bigger or smaller?","Steven Kandarian","We actually did a variety of things. We were able to get some more statutory hedge accounting for some types of derivatives by changing their technique and structure. We did move from two different instruments like that. And we have accomplished our primary goal of making stat couple of RemainCo less sensitive to changes in interest rates. And as you can see from the numbers and the breakouts RemainCo has less sensitivity across the board in terms of equities it is relatively insensitive.","I mean there's always movements and every time you look at these results every quarter there's a lot going on in a quarter when you have derivatives as well as variable annuities. There is the time decay of the derivatives is aging the portfolio your basis risk or otherwise is going to VA hedge ineffectiveness and all these get grouped together. So there are sensitivities going up and down we minimize that, but there always be some move movement here due to all these factors.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then lastly just you mentioned the strong sales in Asia and Japan. I think up to 8% to what extent do you view this as sort of a turn in their sales since the results had been pretty weak the last few quarters versus maybe some front selling related to the discount rate changes are going into effect in the second quarter?","Christopher Townsend","So let me touch, I'm Christopher Townsend here, so Japan sales were up 8% year-on-year and this driven primarily by cant see life sale growth were obliviously 1% as you know we made that shift from the end market volume for July the end of 2015, beginning of 2016, it's very strong growth in Asia is up 6%. So the foreign currency business now makes up about 70% of alternative life sales we think that fairly consistent at the mix going forward and as the number of our competitors have pulled the end life products and change pricing for the discount rate range.","We think Asia is being pushed towards a foreign currency life products and we're very well positioned to provide that given the distribution we've got, so we see that as a fairly interesting team we probably did benefit from around [indiscernible] product we repriced in April, and as you know for the reserve discount price in the financial year and we expect sales with the full often in the second quarter. Overall we're very comfortable in terms of Japan sales, but it's too early to sort of break that guidance at the moment.","Jimmy Bhullar","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. In Group benefits can you just talk about the competitive environment and where you're seeing the best opportunities and given relatively strong industry results in recent quarters you've seen any uptick in price competition?","Maria Morris","Hi this is Maria Morris. First of all I just want to say we were very pleased with our group sales results in 2017. It's a competitive market as you know it's always competitive. But having said that, I'd say that life and disability has been rational. We've seen a little bit more of intense competition in dental, especially down market, but overall we feel very comfortable with the market that we are in. You probably saw that we had strong growth and strong persistency. We've been able to get our renewal actions. And overall it's been a rational market.","Erik Bass","Got it. And then one thing to clarify just on the pace of buybacks, should we expect it to slow it all until you receive the dividend payment from Brighthouse and I'm assuming that $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion is contingent on the transaction being approved. And I guess also are there any restrictions to your being in the market around the time of the transaction?","Steven Kandarian","No we don't anticipate any change in the program that we put in place between our existing cash reserves and earnings. We believe we're on track for the program being completed by 2017.","Erik Bass","Got it. OK. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sean Dargan","Thank you. And just to follow up on Erik's question around the share repurchase. As I understand it there was kind of a bright line test that RBC couldn't fall below 400% and it sounds like whatever happened with hedge losses in the first quarter didn't bring you close to that. But is that 400% applied to the statutory entities related to RemainCo or are all of the current MetLife?","Steven Kandarian","Well RBC as measured once a year and so were half of long term projections that we always knew that there's a lot of pluses and minuses as you do this restructuring unwinding reinsurance transaction to see the pieces moving back and forth and the Brighthouse 10 of RBC we haven't done the debt infusion yet from that. So there's a lot of moving pieces here, and you have to look and if take that into account we're strongly capitalized across the board for all our businesses.","Sean Dargan","Okay. That would be great, thanks. And then just on MetLife Holdings the results were stronger on a normalized basis than I would have thought. I mean broadly speaking should we think that in quarters and where just you have - you see favorable equity market performance that MetLife Holdings will not run off as quickly, as you guided to?","Steven Kandarian","Whether it's a block of VAs in MetLife Holdings. And so for equity markets we had better fees on an ongoing basis, and that will continue to be one of the factors.","Sean Dargan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Nadel","Thank you, good morning. My question about the group insurance business, Steve, it's been a long time since and since I can remember you sort of starting off the conference call talking about or highlighting that business. Given your size and scale there particularly at the large case market is there anything beyond further economies of scale that you think you could gain from a large acquisition within that business line. And relatedly why do you think you're seeing more success particularly in the jumbo case market has competition declined there or have you just gotten a bit more aggressive.","Steven Kandarian","John the first part of your question, we always look at any opportunities out there in the marketplace. And the Group business is one of which we have a very favorable view going forward and it's been a strong part of our company for many decades. So if there's opportunities in the marketplace to make an accretive acquisition, we certainly be quite interested in looking at that. Maria you want to take the second part of the question?","Maria Morris","Sure in terms of where we've been investing in group insurance, I think we're seeing the benefits of our investment in our growth. So as an example, we've been investing in our voluntary benefit platform, and so we're seeing large groups as well as medium sized groups really gravitate toward carriers both for their core benefit programs and to offer voluntary benefits to their employees toward a carrier like MetLife where we're in a position to do that.","We've talked historically about benefiting as an example from the exchanges where we're in some cases the only non-medical carrier on the health exchanges and I think going forward the other place we really put investments in our ability to ensure that employee records are secure. So a lot of work in our security platforms that's been very helpful at market as we've look to bring on new Group life and disability business as well.","John Nadel","So Maria is it fair to say that when you talk about really strong growth in sales at the jumbo case market that a good chunk of that is actually voluntary not employer paid?","Maria Morris","It's actually both. I would say that we've had a very strong sales quarter up and down the market. So double digit growth in the jumbo market, but we've had high single digit growth in the regional market. And as you know smart market is actually not seasonally first quarter focused, but even there we've had strong growth. We've had growth in both our core business and our voluntary business, our voluntary business is up double digits from a sales perspective. So overall very strong sales quarter Group.","John Nadel","Thank you. And then a question for John, on the change in the hedging strategy implemented if both Brighthouse and RemainCo. Can you give us some senses to the duration of the program that you've put in place now and how often some of these hedges need to roll. I'm just trying to understand how the new instruments compare with some of the older hedges I'm not sure if you even still have them that had extended into the 2020s?","John Hele","So on RemainCo the duration is about the same and it's basically some longer term hedges mainly in that. Brighthouse is like a one to three year type restructuring of hedges that they're doing and they've made significant progress to get their hedging done now. So if you think about future sensitivities, we point out look at the Form 10 that was recently published. The sensitivity to VA as well as you ULSG in there and you can see both on a stat and a GAAP basis with expect to senses should be going forward.","John Nadel","No I understand that that disclosure is there, I was just trying to understand duration and you know maybe the risk of having to roll?","John Hele","So for balances is about one to three years.","John Nadel","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath up from Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. Just want to start with the stat capital, I guess it was down about a $1 billion from year end despite not taking any dividends out. So John can you just walk the mechanics in terms of why the capital was down?","John Hele","Is going down $500 million from $24.6 million to $24.1 million, and as I said most of those Brighthouse Financial and they had some of the restructuring costs, less sensitivity to the reserves. The total of CTE (95) which is what they're really hedging to in their strategy, is still as a buffer when we take into account all the transactions that will happen so on a pro forma basis, but as of March 31st you are seeing partway through the restructuring and all the steps that have to happen. So you've seen that sort of the low point and is - as I said in my script it's up significantly from March 31st and there will be a whole series of further that have to happen to get there. So we gave you sort of the pro forma view of it and expect to be in like a 650 RBC pro forma for all that as of - if all that had happened as of March 31.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And just another question on the update Form 10 to the changes or that the debt to capital of Brighthouse is now going to be 25% and then CTE (95) buffer has gone from I guess around $3 billion, to $2 billion to $3 billion so can you just discuss why - what drove those two changes?","John Hele","So the first Form 10 all the calculations the values as well as all the core assumptions and projections were all done as of June 30th last year. And the updated Form 10 as of December 31st and things change a lot between June 30th and December 31st. So there's a series of changes and I think Brighthouse will be a dynamic company and how they manage their business. And that's the reason for that still strongly capitalized and will provide good value over time to shareholders.","Suneet Kamath","Okay and just one last clarification question if could on the 9% ROE target for Brighthouse. Is that the guidance for sort of out of the gate or is that more of a longer term expectation?","John Hele","I think what happens with Brighthouse is for the next little while it is about that type of range, because of just how kind of GAAP works and there - their key focus is to build up overtime to reduce the hedging cost to start getting cash out of the company. And that's the key focus is to run it mainly on statutory basis.","Suneet Kamath","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just to follow up on John does question regarding kind of the appetite for group market acquisition given your capital position like what like what size of the transaction would you be more comfortable doing it with kind of seeking external capital?","John Hele","Hi Humphrey. Well, first of all we certainly will have some capital in reserve for acquisitions, but please remember that we do acquisitions of larger size like the Travelers deal back in 2005 the Alico deal in 2010. We would access the capital markets for any funds necessary above and beyond we hold at the holding company. And it is just important to reiterate our philosophy on acquisitions they have to make sense strategically in terms of what we are planning for the company going forward direction in businesses we want to be in.","And second of all they have to be creative for shareholders and create shareholder value have to earn more than their cost of capital. And any point in time when there is an acquisition opportunity we look at the capital markets, which of course is to raise capital in all kinds of returns would expect from acquisition including synergies and we make a determination in terms of what we're willing to pay for that business.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. And then just a housekeeping question, do you have any updates regarding the dividends to offer in some of your debt cost right now?","Steven Kandarian","Well, we do not believe that this will be a factor going forward. We have steps that we can take if we need to adjust for this. So that's something that we can plan for if we need to execute it.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And at this time there are no further questions. So I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Hall.","John Hall","Thank you everybody and we'll talk to you throughout the quarter. Good bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time today through May 11.

Spehar - Head-Investor Relations, MetLife, Inc.","Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and our quarterly financial supplements.","A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.","Now let me call to your attention four new disclosures in our quarterly financial supplement this quarter. First, expenses and sales for our non-US businesses, Latin America, Asia and EMEA. Second, business segment returns on both allocated and tangible equity as discussed on our December outlook call. Third, operating earnings and premiums, fees and other revenues on a constant currency basis. And four, an earnings (02:30) table for corporate and other, which was previously only available in our 10-Q and 10-K filings. We believe these additional disclosures provide greater transparency for our businesses and address some of the questions that we have received from the investor community in the past.","Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.","Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report good results for the first quarter of 2015. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 4.8% from the first quarter of 2014. And operating earnings per share were $1.44, a 5.1% increase over the prior year period.","Growth in the quarter was dampened by broad-based weakness in foreign currencies. Premiums, fees, and other revenues, or PFOs, were essentially flat versus the prior year but up 4% on a constant currency basis. In Latin America, reported PFOs were flat versus the prior year but up 13% on a constant currency basis. And in Asia, reported PFOs were down 6% but up 6% on a constant currency basis.","Earnings were also negatively impacted by the strong dollar. Operating earnings grew 5% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis. We believe MetLife's global platform should deliver attractive growth and returns over time, but currency translation can be a source of volatility. The increase in operating earnings in the quarter was driven by business growth and a rebound in underwriting margins. As you may recall, underwriting margins were below normal in the prior year period.","Investment margins remain healthy in the quarter with an average investment spread of 211 basis points for U.S. product lines. However, the spread was at the low end of the 210 to 240 basis point range of the past few years. Margin pressure from low interest rates was only partially offset by variable investment income. Expenses as a percentage of PFOs continue to trend downward. The operating expense ratio was 23.5% in the first quarter versus 24.1% in the prior year period.","Our goal is to grow overall revenues at a faster rate than expenses, and we have sharpened our focus on expense control to help offset the drag on earnings in the current economic environment. However, we will not forego the investments necessary to become a more customer-centric company simply to boost GAAP earnings in the near term. Accordingly, we plan to reinvest $225 million this year to modernize the company's infrastructure and make it easier for customers to do business with us. We believe these improvements will generate additional savings and make customers more willing to recommend us to others.","Just as becoming customer-centric is a key element of our strategy, so too is growing sales of capital efficient, protection-oriented products. We made good progress on this initiative in the first quarter. For example, accident and health sales outside the U.S. increased by 24%. Involuntary accident and health and non-life product sales in the U.S. grew by 57%.","I would now like to discuss return on equity. Operating ROE was 11.7% in the quarter and tangible ROE was 14.4%. However, low interest rates and the impact of regulatory uncertainty in capital management are challenges for ROE going forward. I want to remind you what we have said over the past three years about return on equity and provide you an updated outlook.","We introduced our new strategic plan in May 2012 with a 2016 operating ROE goal of 12% to 14%. Since that time, we have provided sensitivities for ROE related to interest rates and share repurchases. We have said that persistent low interest rates would bring down our 2016 operating ROE to the low end of our 12% to14% range. Unfortunately, the 10-year Treasury yield has averaged 2.2% since May 2012 and our current plan assumes rates rising less than we initially assumed.","We have also said that our strategic plan contemplated $8 billion of share repurchases from 2012 to 2016 and that no buybacks over this period would reduce ROE by 100 basis points. We have been cautious on share repurchases because capital requirements remain unknown for non-bank, systemically important financial institutions. We have not yet seen draft capital rules, and there is no clarity on when those rules will be issued. As a result, it is likely that share repurchases will be substantially lower than we had assumed in our strategic plan.","In the first quarter, we completed the $1 billion buyback program announced in December 2014. As an opportunistic buyer, we took advantage of price weakness to aggressively repurchase shares at an average price of $49.56 per share. Given regulatory uncertainty, our overall approach to share repurchases remains conservative. Since May 2012, buybacks have totaled $2 billion, or one-fourth of the total contemplated in our 2016 ROE target.","Below-plan M&A activity has also had a negative impact on returns. The acquisitions we have made have contributed approximately $200 million to earnings, or half of what was contemplated in our strategic plan. MetLife has consistently been a disciplined buyer, and we will not relax our acquisition standards simply to boost ROE in the short term.","The 10-year Treasury yield has been hovering around 2%, the regulatory environment remains uncertain, and it is unlikely that M&A will contribute as much to earnings as we had hoped. With only eight months to go until 2016, we believe it is appropriate to reflect these realities in the ROE outlook. As a result, we estimate that MetLife's operating ROE will be approximately 11% next year. An 11% operating ROE would mean a return that is approximately 9 percentage points above the current 10-year Treasury yield.","A 9 percentage point spread over the 10-year would be close to the pre-financial crisis levels, while the quality of MetLife's ROE has improved, largely due to lower leverage and derisking in the U.S. business. Despite macro and regulatory challenges, we are optimistic about MetLife's prospects. This optimism is underscored by our board's willingness to increase the common stock dividend.","As you know, on April 28, we announced a 7% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend per share. With this increase, our annual common stock dividend will be $1.50 per share, and based on MetLife's current share price, the dividend yield will be 2.9%. We have now raised the common stock dividend for three consecutive years, resulting in a cumulative increase of 103%. Going forward, it is our goal to increase the common stock dividend as our earnings grow.","Turning to regulatory issues, I would like to begin by restating one of the core principles that guides our thinking on these matters. Simply put, it is that regulators should preserve a level playing field for all of the companies in the life insurance industry. Regulators in the United States and Europe correctly point out the virtues of competition in an antitrust context. We believe that same commitment to robust competition should apply to insurance regulation, and for the same reason. Competition provides consumers with the best products at the best prices.","We were pleased when the Federal Reserve recently made clear that it will develop a single capital standard for all of the insurance companies it supervises through a formal rule-making process. If the Fed had elected to establish prudential standards for insurers by order rather than by rule, the result could've been different orders for different companies, with potentially harmful effects on competition.","Developing capital standards through a rule-making process will address one threat to competition by holding all federally-regulated insurance companies to the same standard. However, there's still a risk that these additional capital rules for federally-regulated insurers will put them at a competitive disadvantage to companies regulated exclusively at the state level. So it will be important for regulators to ensure consistency across multiple and potentially conflicting capital regimes.","In closing, MetLife had a good quarter, especially considering the pressure from low rates and the strong dollar. Looking forward, we believe MetLife will continue to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns on equity.","Finally, I am pleased that we have been able to offer higher current income to shareholders by more than doubling our common stock dividend over the past three years.","With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses, and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.","Operating earnings in the first quarter were $1.6 billion and $1.44 per share, both up 5% from the prior year period and 10% on a constant currency basis. This quarter included one notable item in our P&C business. We had higher than budgeted catastrophe experience, partially offset by favorable prior-year development, which decreased operating earnings by $16 million, or $0.01 per share.","Adjusting for the notable items in both periods, as disclosed in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement, or QFS, operating earnings were up 6% year-over-year and 11% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were business growth and underwriting improvement, partially offset by lower variable and recurring investment income.","Turning to our bottom-line results. First quarter net income was $2.1 billion, or $1.87 per share. Net income was $490 million, above operating earnings in the quarter. Three items that explain most of this difference are, number one, derivative net gains of $394 million after-tax, which reflects changes in foreign currencies and gains from lower interest rates.","Number two, investment portfolio net gains of $113 million after-tax, as credit-related losses continue to be modest in the portfolio. And these were partially offset by, number three, charges of $35 million after-tax associated with insurance contracts and other market value adjustments. Of the total $490 million difference between operating earnings and net income, we attribute $455 million to asymmetrical accounting and noneconomic adjustments.","Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $50.45 at March 31, up 6% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $41.32 at March 31, up 9% year-over-year. With respect to first quarter margins, underwriting results improved year-over-year by approximately $0.05 per share after adjusting for notable items in both periods. This was primarily due to improved mortality and morbidity experience in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, or GVWB, as well as better underwriting in Corporate Benefit Funding.","These favorable results were partially offset by adverse claims experienced in Retail Life. Retail Life's interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 59.3%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 56.9%. Results this quarter were negatively impacted by higher than normal accidental deaths, particularly accidental falls, which we believe is related to this adverse winter weather. The Group Life mortality ratio, which now includes AD&D, was 90.7% in the quarter. This was favorable to the prior year quarter of 91.9%, driven primarily by lower Term Life claim severity.","The Group Life mortality ratio is seasonally high in the first quarter. Therefore, we would expect the mortality ratio to be toward the top end of the 85% to 90% annual range. The non-medical health interest-adjusted loss ratio, which now excludes AD&D, was 77.0%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 79.9% and at the low end of the targeted 77% to 82% range.","Dental had favorable margins compared to the prior year and plan due to lower utilization. We believe lower utilization was a function of adverse winter weather and anticipate some increase in utilization similar to what we saw last year. Disability was in line with the prior year period, and we expect improvement for the balance of the year.","In property and casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 89.3% in Retail and 101.2% in Group. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 79.4% in Retail and 89.7% in Group. The more favorable Retail P&C combined ratio reflects less exposure to the Northeast, which experienced particularly severe winter weather. Overall, P&C underwriting results were favorable versus the prior year due to lower non-CAT losses, partially offset by higher CATs.","Turning to investment margins, please note annuity spreads in the QFS are now based on total annuities. The total annuities spread, which includes deferred annuities and single-premium immediate annuities, better depicts investment margins for the business than our prior disclosure of deferred annuities only. While investment margins have been resilient, we have seen some modest decline in spreads. The average of the four U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 211 basis points in the quarter, down 17 basis points year-over-year and one basis point sequentially.","Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 181 basis points, down six basis points versus the prior year and two basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower variable investment income and core yields. Pre-tax variable investment income was $371 million, within our 2015 quarterly guidance range of $325 million to $425 million. After taxes and the impact of DAC, VII was $241 million, down $33 million versus the prior year due to weaker private equity returns, partially offset by higher prepays. Core yields declined as a result of the low interest rate environment. Average new money yields are running roughly 100 to 150 basis points below the average yield on assets rolling off the portfolio.","With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.5%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 24.1% and slightly favorable to 23.6% after adjusting for a legal settlement with New York in the first quarter of 2014. Gross expense saves were $244 million in the first quarter and net saves were $180 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $31 million and one-time cost of $33 million.","I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Please note that our segment earnings in the current and prior year period reflected the changes discussed on our December outlook call. Retail operating earnings were $653 million, up 3% versus the prior year quarter and up 8% after adjusting for notable items. Growth in Retail was driven by favorable separate account performance in annuities and partially offset by unfavorable underwriting in Life.","Life and other reported operating earnings of $203 million, down 20% versus the prior year quarter and 14% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were tighter core spreads, higher corporate expenses, and lower closed block earnings. Underwriting, while below expectations, was only modestly unfavorable to the prior year quarter as adverse mortality and life was mostly offset by favorable P&C experience.","Life and other PFOs were $2.0 billion, essentially flat year-over-year as growth in the open block was partially offset by the runoff of the closed block. Core Retail Life sales were up 23% year-over-year, driven by increases in Whole Life and Term. The performance this quarter supports our view that Life sales bottomed in 2014.","Annuities reported operating earnings of $450 million, up 18% versus the prior year quarter and 22% after adjusting for excess variable investment income in the prior year. This strong performance was primarily due to separate account returns, which were 2.7% in the quarter and lower expenses. Variable annuity sales were flat year-over-year. As you know, we introduced our new VA-guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, on February 17. As the application process is typical for one month VAs, FlexChoice had little impact on first quarter results.","GVWB reported operating earnings of $228 million, up 20% versus the prior year quarter and 27% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in the quarter was driven by underwriting improvement in most products. GVWB PFOs were $4.4 billion, up 3% year-over-year, and sales increased 5% due to strong growth in voluntary products. Voluntary sales accounted for 16% of GVWB sales in the first quarter of 2015, and we would expect this percentage to grow from this level.","Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $369 million, up 9% versus the prior year quarter and 14% after adjusting for notable items. The key drivers were favorable underwriting and business growth. CBF PFOs were $543 million, up 27% year-over-year due to pension closeout and structured settlements. On closeouts, we continue to see a good pipeline of small to mid-sized cases.","Latin America reported operating earnings of $131 million, down 17% from the prior year quarter and 3% on a constant currency basis. Business growth and underwriting improvement were offset by lower inflation, higher taxes, and higher expenses in U.S. Direct. Latin America PFOs were $1 billion, essentially unchanged from the prior year quarter and up 13% on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth across the region. Sales were up 11% on a constant currency basis, driven by Brazil, Mexico, and U.S. Direct.","Turning to Asia, operating earnings were $327 million, down 2% from the prior year quarter and up 8% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth. Additionally, effective April 1, 2015, the government of Japan enacted a tax reform plan that would lower the Japanese tax rate by approximately 2%. As a result, the company expects to record a one-time benefit of $170 million to $180 million, which includes an increase in Asia's second quarter operating earnings by approximately $60 million. In addition, we expect this tax law change will favorably affect our estimated annual effective tax rate for 2015 by approximately 0.2% as compared to 2014.","Asia PFOs were $2.2 billion, down 6% from the prior year quarter but up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth and solid persistency in core markets. Asia sales were 4% on a constant currency basis, driven by a 32% increase in accident and health sales in Japan.","In EMEA, operating earnings were $70 million, down 1% but up 35% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth as well as favorable underwriting and lower expenses, both of which were better than expected for the quarter. Going forward, we believe underwriting margins and expenses will be closer to expectations.","EMEA PFOs were $629 million, down 14% from the prior year period but up 2% on a constant currency basis. PFO growth was dampened by certain product and accounting reclassifications in 2014, which had no bottom-line impact to earnings but did impact the growth rate. Adjusting for that, underlying PFO growth was approximately 8% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong employee benefit sales in the last two quarters.","Total EMEA sales increased 14% on a constant currency basis due to strong growth in employee benefits and A&H sales. As Steve noted, we had strong growth in A&H. In the quarter, A&H sales outside the U.S. were $1.2 billion, which was 23% of total combined sales in Latin America, Asia, and EMEA.","I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.7 billion at March 31. This amount reflects the completion of our buyback program, the issuance of senior debt to fund an upcoming debt maturity, cash contributions to our life insurance captives, which we discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, and the payment of our quarterly common dividend.","Turning to our capital position, the combined risk-based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies, excluding Alico, at year-end 2014 was 410%. Also, our Japan solvency ratio was 1036% as of December 31. For our U.S. companies, preliminary first quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.2 billion and statutory net income was approximately $1.3 billion. Statutory operating earnings were up 53% from the restated prior year quarter, primarily due to separate account returns and improved underwriting. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $30 billion as of March 31, up 7% from December 31.","In conclusion, MetLife had a good first quarter. Investment margins remained healthy despite pressure from low rates. Expenses are well-controlled, and underwriting improved for the third consecutive quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong, and we continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we seek to maximize shareholder value.","And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question will come from Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to just ask some questions on the updated guidance, first, the new 11% guidance for 2016. In terms of a interest rate assumption, does this contemplate the 3.5% yield that you assume is part of your business plan for 2016, that you've laid out in the 10-K? Or does it assume flat interest rates through the end of the year \u2013 or through the end of 2016?","Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Seth. We've assumed lower rates, as I mentioned, than our original plan that we put out in 2012. For 2015, we're assuming 2.46% for the 10-year Treasury and for 2016, 3.11%.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And if we think about also M&A, you mentioned that accretion from M&A was roughly half of what was assumed back in that original plan. When we think about more limited M&A than what was planned, is this a function of the regulatory uncertainty or a function of availability of opportunities in the market?","Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The main thing is remaining a disciplined buyer. The regulatory uncertainty has some impact upon that as well, in the sense that, as a designated non-bank SIFI, we're mindful of considerations, in terms of that designation, related to our business model. So there's some things we'd probably be less likely to pursue in that environment than if that environment didn't exist.","But the main reason why we did not, to-date, acquire businesses with earnings of the $400 million we were assuming in our original plan of 2012, really relates to being a disciplined buyer, looking at the marketplace. We've reviewed a number of transactions that were of interest to us, but the pricing that was attractive to us to move forward on did not ultimately end up being the pricing that the transactions went for. They went for higher numbers. So that's the main driver there. And let me just mention, on the interest rate numbers I gave you, those were year-end assumptions for the 10-year Treasury.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. My first question is just on capital deployment. And I think, Steve, you had mentioned last time on the call that you, given the regulatory uncertainty, might not consider doing an immediate buyback after the current one at the time had been completed. So now that it's done, what's your view on potential buybacks through the remainder of the year? Are you ruling those out, or would you still consider them at some point later this year?","Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jimmy, we have not made a decision yet as to whether or not we would do more share repurchases this calendar year. What I said before is that the most recent program was completed more rapidly than we anticipated, because we were buying more shares at \u2013 when the price of our stock was lower, below certain levels. So that program concluded more rapidly than we had anticipated, and we're going to take a pause for a while and reassess things further on in the year.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, just one question on the Japan business. You had pretty strong sales in A&H. Can you discuss what drove this? Is it the new products you introduced last year, or something else? And to what extent do you view the results as an ongoing trend versus an aberration?","Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region","So, yes, Chris Townsend here. The A&H results for Japan were up 32%, and that helped lift all of Asia, from an A&H perspective, up 25% for the quarter. So we did bring in new products called Flexi Plus and Flexi Gold (34:08) a little over six months ago, and the performance has been very strong since we launched those products. So we expect to see continued good growth through the second and third quarter, but the fourth quarter will be more challenging from a comparison perspective, because we had a very strong fourth quarter 2014, given that we launched these products right at the start of that fourth quarter.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Steve, just one question. Why the update on the ROE guidance right now? Is it simply you're close enough to 2016 or \u2013 I'm just curious, why now? That's the first question.","Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Tom, I think you answered it. We are now only eight months away from the start of 2016. And we have more visibility, obviously, not only to this year, but our 2016 plan and, given where rates are, given our view of where rates are likely to be, given the M&A issue I'd mentioned before, given what's realistic in terms of share repurchases in the current environment related to our SIFI designation. As you rerun those numbers, staying in that 12% to 14% range, it doesn't look likely.","And certainly, analysts on the Street have already baked that into their projections for 2016 ROE. I think the average that we've seen out there is 11.1% for 2016 ROE for MetLife. So I think it's pretty well understood how the math works, given all these factors, most of which are not within our control here at MetLife.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right. And I guess, Steve, that was going to be my point, too. I was just looking at where consensus numbers are, and I think most people have figured that out. So it clearly doesn't look like that estimates look out of whack. But the other question, just as a follow-up to that, did you say the interest rate assumption for year-end 2015 is 2.46% and year-end 2016 is 3.11%? Those are year-end figures?","Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I have to correct myself. Those are actually average 10-year rates.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Those are average 10-year rates. And then, one, my follow-up is, I guess for Chris Townsend. Your strong Japan sales, particularly in A&H, was followed by \u2013 Aflac also had very strong A&H sales growth as well. Is the A&H market growing again? Or are you all taking share from the domestic competitors? Can you give a little color for what's happening there?","Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region","Sure. The products we launched were launched after fairly detailed customer insights, so they're pretty focused customer-centric products. They're effectively hospital cash products with a range of surgical benefits and the way they work is that we have some very low-cost options for certain types of customers and we have some products, which are more appropriate for the more discerning customer, which have some more specialized covers of.","So I think the products are fairly broad in terms of their offering, which helps to drive growth overall. So probably the market for the A&H business is growing at about 3% to 5% overall. So as have been indicated, we've got well-positioned products which we're distributing through that multichannel approach which we've spoken to you about previously.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And not a sense for whether it's coming from share \u2013 share is being taken from the domestics or otherwise?","Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region","Yes, I think the market's grown probably about 3% to 5%. We're clearly outpacing that growth at the moment, but they're a new range of product. So we're comfortable with where we're at and we'll continue to drive pretty good growth out of these products for the rest of the year.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question will come from Erik Bass with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about capital return relative to the free cash flow that you're generating? And should we view all free cash flow generated as being potentially available for redeployment? Or does your ROE guidance assume that there's some additional capital build at the holdco?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So this is John. And we view, ultimately, other than an appropriate buffer at the holding company when we find out what the capital rules are, that we will be living under, that that would be truly free cash flow. It is for common dividends, for buybacks or for acquisitions. So that's why we're quantifying that for you now on a regular basis, and once we finally know the capital rules, we can come up with an appropriate capital management plan.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. But I guess your revised ROE guidance, does that assume that there is further capital build at the holdco?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We are assuming a consistent conservative nature of capital in our projections.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then maybe one question just quickly on Latin America. Can you quantify the size of the loss related to the U.S. Direct business? And how we should think about the investment being made there in 2015?","William J. Wheeler - President-American Division","Sure. Erik, this is Bill Wheeler. So remember, our U.S. Direct business is now being reported inside the Latin American segment. And the total loss for the quarter was up about $6 million year-over-year, $5 million I guess. Just keep in mind that that's different. We've now \u2013 all the direct activities that MetLife was pursuing in the U.S. are now pulled together under one management organization and being reported in Latin America.","So that was a small reason for the decline in Latin American performance. But we expect losses in that segment as we're sort of investing in growth for the remainder of 2015. Sales growth is very good there, and we don't have the ability to capitalize the acquisition cost quite like we do in our more traditional businesses.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Would you expect the kind of expenses to continue at a similar run rate or increase as sales volumes pick up?","William J. Wheeler - President-American Division","My guess is, if anything, they'll decline a little bit in terms of \u2013 the acquisition costs will be steady, I think, throughout the year. But the bottom line losses will probably drop a little bit.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. The $225 million of reinvestment spend that Steve mentioned, is that in addition to the $400 million per year that you've already guided to? Or is that part of the $400 million?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That is within \u2013 this is John. That was within the $400 million long-term that we're seeking for.","Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Got it. And then on the interest rate assumptions, you gave the 10-year assumption. I assume there's also some change in the shape of the yield curve which could impact your Corporate Benefit Funding business? Can you give any color there on what you're assuming?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We haven't given exact details, but we are assuming a flattening of the curve. If you look at \u2013 we based most of this on consensus outlooks, and you see the short end coming up throughout the next 18 months or so, up to the end of 2016.","Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Got it. And then last one if I could just revisit the question I asked last quarter now that the year-end statutory statements are finalized, you've been talking about the statutory capital impact over the last couple of years from being domiciled in New York. Can you give us any more detail on what the cumulative statutory capital or RBC impact has been to MetLife from the stricter New York insurance rules?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. This is John. For those of you who enjoy reading blue books, you'll see on page 19 of MetLife Insurance Company, there's a table that lists versus NAIC with the prescribed practices required by New York create the difference in reserves. And there's about a $1 billion difference between those two printed numbers.","However, if you look at, as we've analyzed the impact of New York and other requirements that they request we follow, the total number is actually $3 billion difference in statutory reserves. This would include about $700 million in reserves because of the fact we did not use life captives. So that's within that $3 billion. The other point I would tell you on this is that the $3 billion difference in statutory reserves has very little tax impact, not very tax effective reserves.","Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Very helpful.","Operator","And our next question will come from Sean Dargan with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. Looking at the group non-medical health loss ratio, 77%, I'm wondering how LTC did within that business. Was the, I guess, underwriting performance in line or better than you would've expected?","William J. Wheeler - President-American Division","Sean, it's Bill Wheeler. Yes, LTC did perform better than expected. That was one reason that medical health overall loss ratio, 77%, was quite good. I think another, probably equally important reason is dental utilization. If you recall last year, the first quarter because of bad weather, we saw low utilization in the dental area, and then a catch-up for the remainder of the year. And I think it's going to happen the same way this year, where we saw low utilization because of poor weather, especially here in the Northeast. And there'll probably be a catch-up for the remainder of the year. So that's \u2013 look, I think the ratio would've been \u2013 the non-medical health ratio would've been good in any case. But these are the two factors that made it especially good.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And just one follow-up on LTC in terms of maybe some strategic options because you did write all that business out of a New York company and you're probably better reserved than most, and we saw a private capital transaction recently for an LTC block. Is this something that you would consider selling even if maybe the purchase price wasn't particularly high just to make it go away and never have to talk about it again?","William J. Wheeler - President-American Division","Well, I would never exclude anything. I wouldn't put anything off the table. But I don't think that's likely or in the cards. Our block is significant. That transaction was quite small. And there's a lot of \u2013 in terms of if you think about price increases that we've been asking for through the state regulatory process, we're having a lot of success there. That's helping the block become I think more attractive over time, and so there's a lot of state of play there. And I wouldn't expect us to leave that on the table and transact anytime soon.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from the Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. So first question going back to the ROE target, the revised ROE target, now as it pertains to M&A, so I just want to clarify the $200 million of earnings as opposed to the $400 million that was expected, that is from M&A that was expected from 2012 on, so it has no bearing on the Alico acquisition or how that's performed?","Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We were assuming $400 million of additional earnings by 2016 from acquisitions when we put the plan together in 2012.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And, Steve, you said that the non-bank SIFI designation has maybe dampened the appetite for some deals that you would've otherwise considered or some businesses you would've otherwise considered. Can you give us maybe a couple of examples of businesses that you find less attractive with this designation?","Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I won't give you specific examples, but you can imagine things that would be considered in the process of designating a company as a SIFI, those kinds of factors went into our thinking in terms of what we would consider acquiring, and there were certain businesses and blocks of businesses that were for sale, particularly in the United States, that we were impacted by that factor.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And last question, Steve, given that the initial target of 12% to 14% by the end of 2016 has come up against a few headwinds that were clearly not foreseen in the beginning of 2012, have you and the board, have you had any discussions over the retirement age of 65, which I think would've probably brought to a change at the helm around the end of 2016? Have you considered maybe extending your tenure?","Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The policy you're referring to is a internal policy for senior management, executive management of age 65. Again, it's not in our bylaws, so it's something the board could waive if it chose to do so but no decisions have been made.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey. Thank you. Just on buybacks and kind of the regulatory piece. I understand the comments that your authorization's complete because you still are unsure what will happen with the rules. But I guess the question is, aren't things kind of going in the right direction? You got the Collins fix, the bank-centric draft rule that was a risk seems off the table now from the Fed. It seems like it's possible you're not going to know what these final rules are for some time, so I'd be interested in getting a sense of your increased confidence to maybe have to make decisions on capital deployment if you don't have kind of a final answer on the rules maybe by the end of this year.","Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That has factored into our thinking to date. In other words, we had said we weren't going to do repurchases several years ago when SIFI designation was still being determined for us. And then because the rules were delayed in terms of being promulgated by the Fed, we took actions in two separate cases of each $1 billion of share repurchases. And we did that because the timeframe had shifted on us in terms of our expectations of knowing the rules.","So I've said this before, it's art more than science when you don't know what the numbers are going to be, and there's no indications that you can rely upon in terms of what the capital standards ultimately are that you live under. So we have taken I think a measured approach in terms of both share repurchases and the issuance of a higher dividend on our common stock in light of what you just said, which is the delay in the timing that we were all expecting for knowing the rules.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","But I guess the core of the question is, I mean do you think things are going in the right direction? Or are these wins with the Collins fix and kind of making progress with the Fed, is that not material enough to change your decision-making process?","Steven A. Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The amendment to Dodd-Frank that you're referring to that occurred in December of last year is encouraging. It gives the Fed the flexibility to write rules appropriate for the insurance industry, as opposed to their interpretation of the Collins Amendment, which they thought required them to use no less than bank standards, in this case Basel III standards, even on non-bank SIFIs. So that is encouraging. But all that does is give them the flexibility to write rules they think are appropriate for the insurance industry.","We don't know yet what that methodology will be. We don't yet know how those rules may differ from state rules that we live under today. We don't know yet how the rules they come up with may impact us differently than the state rules, because they may look at certain aspects of our balance sheet differently than the state rules than the ASC (51:53) rules look at those assets and liabilities today. So there's no way for us to really have a good estimate of the amount of capital we need to hold under a regime the Fed has yet to put out, even in draft form.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from John Nadel with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray","Hi. Thanks. I just had one quick question for you this morning. If we look at the core adjusted for unusual items in the annuities segment, the after-tax ROA, if I look back over the past maybe three, four, five quarters, it's been averaging somewhere in the low to mid-70%s. In 1Q, it's \u2013 I think if my calculation's correct, it's about 85 or 86 basis points. It's a huge stair-step. Just a question for you, what drove that? Is that sustainable? Is there some outcome there on the expense side or otherwise that we should believe is trendable from here?","William J. Wheeler - President-American Division","John, it's Bill Wheeler. So, I wouldn't think that that's a run rate, $450 million of earnings. And there's a couple reasons for that. Annuities had a number of smaller positive factors this quarter. One was separate account performance. Even though the S&P 500 growth was pretty modest this quarter, separate account performance was much stronger. The broader stock indexes did much better. The bond market did much better. Remember, a big percentage of our assets now in the separate accounts are actually fixed income.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray","Yeah.","William J. Wheeler - President-American Division","So separate account performance was 2.4%, and that obviously helped. The second thing is investment spread, you noticed that actually picked up a little bit this quarter, and there were some, I would say, some more unusual investment income which we don't think is repeatable. But there's also \u2013 part of the reason the investment margins went up is, when we collapsed our variable annuity captive, or Bermuda captive last year, there was a pool of cash which is now being redeployed into longer-term investments. So yields are up, so that's part of the reason, but the other part is some investment earnings which are not sustainable. So I think the right run rate's a little lower than $450 million, but overall, the annuity business is performing pretty well.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray","Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question will come from Humphrey Lee with Dowling Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Just a quick question on LatAm \u2013 in the press release, you mentioned that there's some earnings sensitivity to low inflation, and I was just wondering if you can help us to kind of quantify the impact of low inflation in LatAm, and how that affect the earnings outlook, if inflation remained low in the region?","William J. Wheeler - President-American Division","Yeah, so a little background here. Obviously, certain Latin America economies historically have been prone to high levels of inflation, and it's a risk that we need to take into account when we develop an investment strategy in those countries. Because in a couple of countries, we do sell longer-term immediate annuities, especially Chile. And so, in Chile, there is a portfolio of assets where the yields on the bonds is linked to the official inflation rate.","And the inflation right now in Chile is quite low, and so that means that the yield on those bonds is near zero, and the overall impact \u2013 it was actually probably the biggest driver of under-earning performance in Latin America, was this low-inflation phenomenon. I'm trying to get the exact number here. Well, it's roughly $8 million after-tax, is what it cost us, in terms of the inflation rate in Latin America. So, this isn't just a Chile issue, but it's mainly in Chile.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And then, in terms of the annuity sales outlook you talked about, there's a little bit of a timing issue when the FlexChoice product was being launched. How (56:30) the application process to date and the overall sales in the second quarter year-to-date, as you reported today, has been trending?","William J. Wheeler - President-American Division","Yes, so applications are good. The product is getting good market acceptance. We had forecast, in 2015, a pretty meaningful increase in our annuity business sales, and a piece of that growth was driven by FlexChoice. It wasn't the whole reason for growth, but it was a big piece of it. And so we're seeing apps trending, and we're seeing a lot of good sales coming out of that, and a lot of, I would say, recapturing of sales where our own sales force was selling third-party business and now, instead, they're using FlexChoice as their key living benefit rider product.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","So, no change to your kind of 50% increase for 2015?","William J. Wheeler - President-American Division","We still think that's a good projection.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could update us on what the current benefit you're getting from the interest rate hedges through \u2013 and investment income, and how are you thinking about that trending going forward?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi. This is John. We haven't given out that specific amount. I would say that they've held up quite well historically and into this year. We expect next year to see somewhat of a slight drop-off, but we have hedge protection on this going off well into the next decade, so into the early 2020s timeframe.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just one more on the ROE. I'm just trying to reconcile the interest rate sensitivity on the ROE to what you have in the 10-K? Maybe I'm not thinking about it right, but if I look at the business plan that you have in your 10-K and where the rates are versus a 2% 10-year Treasury assumption, it looks like a bigger decline, obviously, relative to your current lowered interest rate assumptions, but even if I use that 10-K sensitivity, it seems like you're pointing to an operating earnings impact of $5 million, which for a company of Met's size is de minimis. So I must be missing something on the interest rate sensitivity in terms of why it's putting so much pressure on the ROE.","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So this is John. The 10-K update we give at the end of the year, and that's an outlook, what happens if rates stay kind of at a low level versus what we assume in our plan. Our plan had already been adjusted down, as Steve had indicated, to reflect a lower consensus already.","And the other thing that's going on there, which you'll see in the segment sensitivities is compared to our plan, which assumes a more flattening of the yield curve, which reduces sec lending earnings, the scenario that's given assumes a steeper yield curve so the long end stays down but so does the short end, and so that causes a net benefit compared to the plan. So you'll notice that in the sensitivities we give, and CBF is actually a positive in the rest of the plan. So there's really a combination of things. It's a lower long end rate in that sensitivity, but the lower short end rate is a net positive when it comes to the sec lending book of business.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And then just one quick follow-up for you, John. I think in response to Ryan's question when he was asking about being regulated by the New York regulator, I thought in your comments you had said that part of the differential is that you don't use life captives. Were you specifically referring to the VA or are you talking about XXX and AXXX as well?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That is not including any assumptions for variable annuity captives. It's only life insurance captives for AXXX and XXX.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So you were just referring to the VA. In other words, the differential's not because you don't use life captives. You do use life captives.","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We are limited in New York as to how much we can do in life captives. So if we were a non-New York-domiciled company, we estimate that the statutory reserves could be $700 million lower by the use of captives for Universal Life and Term Insurance that takes into account XXX and AXXX reserves.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks.","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Edward A.

We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and our quarterly financial supplements.","A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.","Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Last night we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $1.20, which compares to $1.44 per share in the first quarter 2015. The negative impact from market factors more than offset a benefit from volume growth. The combination of weak equity markets for most of the quarter, continued strength in the U.S. dollar, and low interest rates reduced operating earnings by $0.16 per share versus the prior-year period.","In addition, variable investment income, or VII, declined by $0.12 per share. Variable investment income can be volatile, largely because it is driven by the performance of alternative asset classes. We believe some earnings variability is an acceptable risk as these asset classes have provided strong returns to MetLife shareholders over time. To illustrate, VII was better than planned in seven of the past 10 years with the cumulative positive variance of $505 million after tax. This favorable performance to plan is noteworthy given that the time period includes the financial crisis. Despite the sluggish global economy, we estimate overall volume growth was 3% year-over-year, driven by 11% growth in our non-U.S. businesses.","In addition, the value generated from new business written has improved as a result of our accelerating value strategic initiative. For example, in Japan, our second-largest market, foreign currency-denominated product sales were up more than 50% in the first quarter. We are focused on growth in this area because none-yen products have very attractive cash return characteristics. In contrast, yen Whole Life sales were down 60% in the quarter. This sales decline was intentional as it is difficult for this product to generate attractive returns and acceptable cash payback periods in a negative interest rate environment.","Overall, top-line growth is a challenge in the current low-rate environment. However, as I often tell my team, external factors are beyond our control, so we must focus on what we can control. In this instance, to combat the pressures of growth from low rates in a weak macroeconomic environment, we must address our cost structure. It is critical that we achieve a sustained reduction in unit costs and our top priority is addressing elevated overhead expenses that will result from the separation of the U.S. retail business. It is too early to provide specifics on expense reduction, but we believe that the separated business and the remaining company combined will have a lower cost base than MetLife does today.","Now, I would like to provide an update on regulatory matters. On March 30, Judge Rosemary Collyer of the U.S. district court from the District of Columbia rescinded MetLife's designation as a systemically important financial institution or SIFI. In a carefully reasoned decision, Judge Collyer found that the Financial Stability Oversight Council's designation of MetLife was arbitrary and capricious. Her ruling said that FSOC had failed to: one, conduct a vulnerability assessment of MetLife as required by FSOC's own regulations and guidance; two, adhere to any discernible standard in determining that material financial distress at MetLife could threaten U.S. financial stability; and three, consider the consequences and cost of designation as required by Supreme Court precedent.","None of these is purely a procedural matter. For example, the judge noted that FSOC defined a threat to financial stability as one that would \"sufficiently be severe to inflict significant damage on the broader economy.\" Yet rather than applying its own standard, the judge found that FSOC \"hardly adhere to any standard when it came to assessing MetLife's threat to U.S. financial stability.\" She said she could not uphold the finding that MetLife's distress would damage the broader economy when \"FSOC refused to undertake that analysis itself.\" On April 8, FSOC appealed the judge's ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia circuit.","In MetLife's initial legal complaint filed last year, we offered 10 reasons, or counts, as to why our SIFI designation should be lifted. Judge Collyer ruled in favor of MetLife on three of those 10 counts. She rejected our argument on one count, the technical question of whether MetLife qualifies as a U.S. nonbank financial company. She did not rule on the other six counts, including those based on constitutional grounds. On appeal, all 10 counts may be brought before the D.C. circuit.","Some of the commentary on our SIFI case has portrayed it as an effort to undermine the Dodd-Frank Act. We strongly disagree with this characterization. The right to seek judicial review of an FSOC designation is part of the Dodd-Frank Act itself as enacted by Congress. In seeking judicial review of FSOC's designation of MetLife, we are upholding the process established by Dodd-Frank, not undermining it. Let me be clear. MetLife supports prudent regulation of the U.S. life insurance industry. We make long-term promises and consumer confidence depends on the ability of the life insurance industry to honor its commitments.","In MetLife's case, we have been keeping our promises since 1868 through wars, boom times, panics, and recessions. It's worth remembering that we came through the 2008 financial crisis in such strong shape that in 2010 we're able to buy Alico from AIG for $16 billion, money that AIG used to help repay U.S. taxpayers.","One of the questions we have received most frequently since Judge Collyer's decision is whether we still plan to pursue the separation of a substantial portion of our U.S. retail business. The answer is yes. As we explained when we announced the planned separation in January, the decision was driven by both strategic and regulatory factors. Strategically, the imperative of cash generation is stronger than ever, especially in light of a lower for longer interest rate environment. And from a regulatory perspective, while we are pleased that our SIFI status has been rescinded, FSOC could attempt to re-designate MetLife at a later date.","We are keeping open our options with regard to what form a separation could take, including an initial public offering, a spinoff or a sale. To prepare for the possibility of a separation in the form of a public offering, we expect to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission sometime this summer. Regardless of the form, the separated business will be leaner and more focused. With the sale of the MetLife Premier Client Group to MassMutual, U.S. retail will be only a manufacturer of annuity and life insurance products, not a distributor.","As I noted in my annual letter to shareholders last week, the expense of the advisor force was preventing us from clearing MetLife's hurdle rate on much of the new business written through that channel. By exiting proprietary retail distribution in the U.S., we anticipate run rate expense savings of approximately $250 million per year after tax, which would be split about evenly between the separated business and the rest of MetLife.","I am confident that MetLife is taking the right steps to generate long-term shareholder value. We are changing our product mix to adapt to the external environment. We are separating the business on which the company was founded to strengthen the amount and timing of cash generation. And we are focusing on expenses to ensure both the separated business and MetLife have a competitive cost structure.","Finally this morning, I would like to discuss some changes to our finance team. As we announced in news release a short while ago, Marlene Debel, our Treasurer, is becoming CFO for the U.S. This is a much-deserved opportunity for Marlene. Mike Walsh, our CFO to the Americas, will be retiring after 28 years at MetLife. Mike has been a trusted business partner to many of us. We thank Mike for his many valuable contributions and wish him all the best in his retirement. John McCallion, who is well known to many of you as our former Head of Investor Relations, will become our new Treasurer. And Ed Spehar, our current Head of Investor Relations, will assume John's role as CFO of EMEA.","I told John he has done such a good job that he gets to come home from Europe. And I told Ed he has done such a good job, he gets to go to Europe. Congratulations, Marlene, Mike, John and Ed as you embark on the next chapters of your careers and lives.","With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I'd also like to recognize the contribution of Marlene, John and Ed and wish them well in their new roles and thank Mike for 28 years of outstanding service to MetLife. I am very proud of my finance leadership team. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses, and business highlight. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. Operating earnings in the first quarter were $1.3 billion or $1.20 per share.","This quarter included three notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement, or QFS. First, variable investment income was $109 million after DAC and taxes, which was $86 million or $0.08 per share below the bottom end of our 2016 quarterly plan range.","Second, we had higher-than-expected catastrophe losses, which decreased operating earnings by $45 million or $0.04 per share after tax. Third, we had a onetime tax benefit in Japan partially offset by a tax charge in Chile, which increased operating earnings by $10 million, or $0.01 per share after tax. The tax rate in Japan decreased 60 basis points, resulting in a $20 million onetime benefit, partially offset by a $10 million charge from a 200-basis-point increase in MetLife's tax rate in Chile.","Turning to our bottom-line results. First quarter net income was $2.2 billion, or $1.98 per share. Net income was $866 million, higher than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative net gains driven by lower interest rates and the financial impact of converting Japan operations to calendar year reporting. Japan's results including operating earnings for the month of December 2015 were reflected below the line in order to eliminate the accounting lag. The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $824 million after tax related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting.","Book value per share excluding AOCI other than FCTA was $53.31 as of March 31, up 6% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $44.17 as of March 31, up 7% year-over-year.","With respect to first quarter margins, underwriting in the Americas was favorable versus the prior-year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Favorable results in Group Life, Retail Life, and Latin America were offset by less favorable results in nonmedical health, and property & casualty. Total company underwriting margins were essentially in line with the prior-year quarter.","The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.9%, favorable to the prior-year quarter of 90.7% and the low end of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We experienced lower claim severity versus the prior-year quarter while frequency was in line with our expectations. Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 54.8%, favorable to the prior-year quarter of 59.3% and within the annual target range of 51% to 56%. The year-over-year improvement was driven by a return to more normal average net claims. As we had highlighted, 1Q 2015 had higher than normal accidental death, particularly accidental falls, which we believe were related to adverse winter weather.","In Latin America, underwriting was favorable to the prior-year quarter and relative to the expectations primarily driven by lower loss ratios in Mexico. The nonmedical health interest adjusted loss ratio was 83.2%, unfavorable to a strong prior-year quarter of 77.0% and above the top end of the annual target range of 77% to 82%. The key drivers were higher seasonal utilization in dental and higher claim severity in disability as well as favorable LTC underwriting in the prior-year quarter. The first quarter is a seasonally weak quarter for dental and disability. This seasonality was not apparent in the nonmedical health interest adjusted loss ratio during the past two years, largely because dental utilization was low due to adverse winter weather.","In property & casualty, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 100.4% in Retail and 102.9% in Group. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 86.3% in Retail and 93.0% in Group. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was in line with expectations but above a strong prior-year quarter of 79.4% in Retail and 89.7% in Group. We experienced higher catastrophe losses in our homeowners business and modestly higher severity in our auto business. However, auto results strengthened this quarter, and we expect further improvement throughout 2016 as a result of rate increases.","Turning to investment margins, the average of our four U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 170 basis points in the quarter, down 41 basis points year-over-year. Approximately half of this climb, or 20 basis points, was the result of lower variable investment income. Pre-tax variable investment income, or VII, was $165 million, down $206 million versus the prior-year quarter mostly due to weak hedge fund performance. Our allocation to hedge fund is approximately 40 basis points of the total investment portfolio, and we plan to further reduce our exposure.","Product spreads excluding variable investment income were 161 basis points this quarter, down 21 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields account for most of this decline. With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.8%, unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 23.5%. The higher operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily driven to the write-off of a net reinsurance receivable.","I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $532 million, down 19% versus the prior-year quarter and down 11% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Life and other reported operating earnings of $172 million, down 15% versus the prior year quarter but up 7% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary driver was net favorable underwriting as life mortality rebounded from an unfavorable prior-year quarter and property & casualty non-catastrophe results returned to more normal levels. Underwriting improvement was partially offset by lower investment margins.","Life and other PFOs were $2 billion, down 1% year-over-year as growth in the open block was more than offset by runoff of the closed block. Life and other sales were up 1% year-over-year as the 15% increase in P&C was mostly offset by a 5% decline in life sales, mainly in Whole Life. Whole life volumes were strong, but we sold less high-face policies versus the prior-year quarter. Annuities reported operating earnings of $360 million, down 20% versus the prior-year quarter and down 19% after adjusting for VII below plan this quarter. The key drivers were less favorable market impact, negative fund flows and higher expenses.","The initial market impact reduced operating earnings by $5 million after tax, which compares to a $26 million benefit in the prior-year quarter. Total annuity sales were $2.3 billion in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year. We continue to see good momentum in our index-linked annuity, Shield Level Selector. Shield sales were $411 million in the quarter or triple the sales in the prior-year period and up 14%, sequentially. VA sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, essentially flat to the prior-year quarter.","Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $174 million, down 24% versus the prior-year quarter and down 20% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting as compared to a strong prior-year quarter and lower investment margins. GVWB PFOs were $4.6 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Sales were up 28% year-over-year with growth in Group and Voluntary products. I know that segments earnings were below consensus estimates, which I believe relates to seasonality that was not evident during the past two years. In terms of the full-year outlook for GVWB, the near-term guidance on certain key items provided on our December outlook call still applies.","Corporate Benefit Funding or CBF reported operating earnings of $295 million, down 20% versus the prior-year quarter and down 12% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key driver was lower investment margins. CBF PFOs were $508 million, down 6% year-over-year due to lower pension risk transfers or PRT. As we have noted before, PRT sales can be lumpy, but we continue to see a good pipeline and remain optimistic about future growth opportunities.","Latin America reported operating earnings of $137 million, up 5% from the prior-year quarter and up 32% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, Latin America operating earnings were up 45% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were volume growth as well as favorable investment and underwriting margins. U.S. direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $14 million versus an $18 million loss in the prior-year quarter, reflecting growth and lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $966 million, down 4%, but up 14% on a constant currency basis.","Excluding U.S. direct PFOs, which were up 35% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, Latin America PFOs were up 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. Total Latin America sales were flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Excluding U.S. direct sales, which were down 18% year-over-year, LatAm sales were up 3% on a constant currency basis. This growth was primarily driven by direct marketing, partially offset by lower Afore sales in Mexico in the current quarter, as well as the large group case sales in the prior-year quarter.","Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $305 million, down 7% from the prior-year quarter and 5% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in the current quarter. Strong volume growth across the region was more than offset by lower fixed annuity surrender fees in Japan as well as higher project costs and other expenses in Japan, in the region. Asia PFOs were $2 billion, down 7% from the prior-year quarter on both the reported and constant currency basis.","There are two factors that reduce Asia PFOs this quarter. First, as a result of a regulatory change, we are now required to use the equity method of accounting for the 26% ownership interest in our India joint venture. As a result, beginning in 1Q 2016, we are no longer reporting 100% of India PFOs and Asia PFOs. Instead, the financial results of our 26% interest will be reflected as net investment income in Asia. This accounting changes consistent with the treatment of MetLife's other joint ventures in Asia, which include China, Malaysia, and Vietnam. In addition, Asia PFOs were negatively impacted by the withdrawal of single premium A&H yen products in Japan. As previously noted, these products do not meet our hurdle rates in the current interest rate environment.","Excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of our India operation and the withdrawal in Japan of single premium A&H yen product, PFOs were up 2% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were down 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value creation and growth in targeted markets. In Japan, sales were down 1% year-over-year. We have seen a successful shift in sales to high-return foreign currency-denominated life products, which were up 53% year-over-year, and away from low-return yen life product, which were down 35% year-over-year. Japan third sector sales were down 29% versus the prior year as a result of exiting single premium A&H and the negative impact on packet sales from a reduction in yen-denominated Whole Life products.","EMEA operating earnings were $63 million, down 10% year-over-year and down 3% on a constant currency basis. Earnings in the prior-year quarter benefited from favorable underwriting margins and lower expenses. Underlying volume growth in the first quarter of 2016 is consistent with our near-term outlook of high teens on a constant currency basis. EMEA PFOs were $615 million, down 1% from the prior-year period but up 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by the Middle East and the U.K. Total EMEA sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis and 7% after adjusting for the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year. The 7% growth was driven by employee benefit sales in the Middle East and accident health products across the region.","I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.3 billion at March 31, down from $6.4 billion at December 31. This amount reflects the capital contribution of $1.5 billion to MetLife Insurance Company USA in contemplation of the proposed separation as well as regular cash flows, including subsidiary dividends, payment of our quarterly common dividend, and other holding company expenses.","Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Our combined risk-based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies, excluding Alico, was 513% on a reported basis and 537% on an NAIC basis at year-end 2015. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 936% as of December 31, which is the latest public data.","For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary first quarter statutory operating earnings and net earnings were approximately $700 million. Statutory operating earnings were down 38% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to low interest rates. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $30 billion as of March 31, up 1% from December 31.","In conclusion, first quarter operating earnings were below expectations, primarily due to market factors. While the current environment remains challenging, we are confident that our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.","And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. The first question is, I guess, can you give us some sense at least based on what your legal representation might be advising you as to the timing around this appeal process?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, John. It's Steve.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. Yes, the Justice Department filed their appeal nine days after the original decision came down from the District Court, and we anticipate that the ministerial paperwork will be filed by June 6. That's what the court has requested, the Circuit Court, and then there'll be a briefing schedule at that point in time which, we think concludes sometime in the fall time period. And that will be followed by oral argument, which is likely to occur in late 2016 or perhaps spill over to early 2017. And then, a decision will be forthcoming sometime after that.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. Okay. So we could see something wrapped up on the initial appeal by mid-2017, give or take, you think is reasonable?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's probably reasonable, but courts take their own calendar into account in terms of these kinds of things. There's no way to know for certain how long it's going to take once the case has been heard.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. And then, my second question is just as it relates to the likely filing in the summer of an S-1 related to the retail business. Is it your anticipation that the filing of that IPO document would be sufficient to clear the hurdle of providing the nonpublic information necessary to give you and the board the okay to reinstate a buyback program?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, we're certainly not going to discuss capital actions before the filing of the S-1. Once we know more about what direction we're taking here and file the S-1, we'll have greater clarity, and we'll make a decision at that point in time as to what we can or should say regarding share repurchases. Obviously, the form and timing of a separation impacts the cash flows and capital actions. So, all this is kind of coming together as we determine how the separation will take place. And again, at this point in time, we don't know enough to be able to speak to capital actions. And after filing the S-1, we'll know more and we'll then figure out whether we know enough at that point in time to give greater clarity.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. And last one real quick...","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","One thing \u2013 one thing...","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","...and only because I've gotten the question \u2013 I'm sorry.","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me \u2013 just one more thing. I think one thing that's important to remember here is that we at management clearly understand and have stated that we want to return excess capital to shareholders. We also are taking a very bold step here in terms of separating out a major part of our business, what MetLife was founded upon I guess 148 years ago. So I think that really is our first and foremost consideration and focus for us right now.","And if we get all this executed properly, which is our intent and our goal, as we've said before, the predictability and the amount of free cash flow as a percentage of our operating earnings we believe will go up, and that really is kind of long-term or intermediate-term payoff for these actions we're taking. I think that really should overweigh or overshadow the near-term impact in terms of timings around share repurchases.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Yeah, I totally understand that. Thank you. And then, I just had one more quick one only because I've gotten this question a couple of times. You've pushed out the date for your Investor Day, I assume it's related to the timing in getting this stuff done as it relates to the retail business, but is there anything more to it than that?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, the planned separation and with the work we're doing around accelerating value, we want to make sure we had sufficient information for our investor base to hear from us. We didn't want to have an Investor Day where we'd say we still haven't determined that or we can't talk about that and so on. So, our initial plans around the Investor Day in terms of timing preceded some of these actions we were taking in terms of clarity around those actions.","So, as we step back and thought about it more recently, we said, what's the timing of things that we're going to have to analyze and make determinations on? And some of those items weren't going to be done by the initial date that we had put out there for Investor Day, so we felt that it just made more sense for everyone if we had an Investor Day at a point in time where we could provide greater clarity about the direction of the company going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. So, I had a question first on just the weak sales in Asia and maybe Latin America as well. It seems like there's a major initiative to grow in Asia a few years ago, especially in accident & health. And now, you seem to be pulling back from some parts of the market. So, how much of the decline in sales recently has been in response to macro conditions in Japan versus maybe a change in your view on the economics of the business?","Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region","Hi. It's Chris Townsend here. Let me tell you the story for Asia for sales. So overall, the headline number is down 10%. The Japan sales are flat but with a very different mix, as both Steve and John referenced in their prepared remarks, the Yen life portfolio is significantly down driven by the economics and I think both referenced the long payback period of that and the challenges of low interest rate environment. But this is offset by a significant increase in terms of the foreign currency life and foreign currency annuity products, both of which our customers find highly attractive given the enhanced yield they can get from a foreign currency play.","The A&H business is still highly attractive for us and generates very good margins in that business, but there is a packaging issue there for us in terms of when we sell Yen Whole Life, we packaged that often with A&H. And as that Yen Whole Life came down by 60%, the A&H business came down as well. But we'll look to offset that going toward.","For the rest of Asia, China was up 16% for the quarter, Hong Kong and Bangladesh had good sales, and emerging markets overall were up 16% for the quarter.","The one challenge for us and the rest of Asia was Korea. Korea was down sharply this quarter, but again because of the management or accelerating value action work we've been taking there, we basically changed commissions predominantly in the general agency channel to reward persistency and better customer behavior or better behavior for our customers. And also, we changed the crediting rate in terms of the macro environment there in terms of the lower interest rate environment. But we'll be launching new products there in the second quarter, and we think we'll get the sales back on track for that business. So that's been really a roundup of the sales for Asia.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And on the Yen Whole Life, how much business is sitting on the books now and what are your views on margins on that business given what's happened with JGB yields?","Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region","Let me tell you in terms of the sales, first of all. So, the sales this quarter made up 12% of our total sales in Japan. A year ago it was a third, so we've made a significant reduction in terms of that business. Given that the rate environment there at the moment, we believe that the current margin on that business under a range of assumptions meets our cost of capital for that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. I realize it's too early to get specifics, but I was hoping you could expand a little bit on your comments that combine the expenses for the remaining Met and the separated combined company would be lower than the current level. It seems a little bit counterintuitive given that you may need separate infrastructure for two public companies, so if you could provide any examples of where you see dissynergies from size, that would be helpful.","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think, Erik, there are synergies from being one company, so if you're going to separate the two businesses by definition, there'll be dissynergies, and there will be in some places duplicative costs if you take no actions. So, what we're saying is that we're engaged in a very rigorous analysis around our cost structure. Part of it has to do with the separation with stranded costs, and part of it just has to do with this macroeconomic environment of lower rates for longer tepid growth, and not just in the United States but globally. So, in that environment, we have to take a very close look at our cost structure and look at unit cost in particular, and that is what we're undertaking as an effort right now.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And does the $250 million of savings from the Adviser sale, is that included in your comments when you say that combined expenses would be less than the current level?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, we're saying above and beyond that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR. Please go ahead.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thank you. I had a question, thinking ahead a little bit on the NewCo as it likely will be standing alone by April 2017 when the new DOL rule goes into effect. So, if that's purely a manufacturing entity, do you view that NewCo Met as being subject to legal liability under the best interest contract to the extent it's selling variable annuities?","Eric Thomas Steigerwalt - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut","Good morning. It's Eric Steigerwalt. Look, one of the primary things that we've done is the announced sale of our field force MPCG to MassMutual. And so, given the timing of DOL, our, what we'd call, tied Adviser force will not sell any products under the umbrella of MetLife or NewCo when the DOL regulation goes into effect. That sale will be done long before the DOL regulation goes into effect. And just to give you little color on that, we think we're going to close in July. We're on track to close in July, so the answer is with respect to the biggest piece of the effect on MetLife, which is our own field force in the United States, it will be sold to MassMutual and closed in July.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","But to the extent you're going to manufacture, do you think that the distributor will sign the best interest contract in the VA or indexed-annuity sale? Or would you also be subject to that legal risk?","Eric Thomas Steigerwalt - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut","So, it's hard to tell. I can talk about that in two pieces. One, obviously, we will have a very important field force which is our wholesaling force going forward, and so you have to think about the DOL with respect to how wholesalers will operate, so that's something that we have to work through over time here. And then secondly, it's just too early to know where distributors are coming out with respect to the regulation. So, maybe four months or five months from now, we'll have a better view of that, but right now given the fact that this is almost 1,100 pages, we're just going to have to wait and see what a number of distributors are going to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. And good morning. I have a question about the variable investment income and specifically what your view of hedge fund investment is going forward, given some of the headlines about pension funds rethinking their strategy and some other insurers and just recent volatility in that asset class.","Steven J. Goulart - Chief Investment Officer & Executive VP","Hi, Sean. It's Steve Goulart. Certainly, the first quarter was challenging for variable investment income. And if you look at our miss, it was heavily because of hedge fund returns which actually were negative for the quarter. And I think if we look at the market environment that exists today and we can talk about a number of factors, I think it'll be continue \u2013 continued to be challenging for hedge funds. I think when you combine that with our capital and cash flow predictability objectives, we've decided that we're going to continue reducing our hedge fund portfolio, as John alluded to in his comments. Just to remind you of some numbers, the portfolio today is just over $1.8 billion, and recall, we did reduce it during the course of last year. Also, we actually ended up redeeming about $600 million worth of hedge funds last year.","And as we look out from where we are today, we expect that we're going to redeem probably on the order of another $1.2 billion, so really take the portfolio down by another two-thirds from where it is today. Just given the way redemption provisions work and the industry, I think it will take us a couple of years to do that, but I expect that we'll probably see 60% of those redemptions come in this year and 40% next year, and maybe even leaking a little bit into 2008 (sic) [2018].","Now, I'll also put in the context of our total portfolio though, remember this is actually a very small portion of our total portfolio. Our total alt portfolio is under 2%. As John mentioned, our hedge fund portfolio today is less than half of 1%. So obviously, it's going to become even smaller, but what we'll be left with is a small portfolio of really our most consistently performing managers and hedge fund. So, there'll be a small portfolio left over, but we think overall it doesn't need to be the size it is today.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","All right. Thanks. And when I think about the impacts of variable investment come across the company, is it roughly split along the lines of what the separated business will be versus the go-forward RemainCo Met?","Steven J. Goulart - Chief Investment Officer & Executive VP","Well, if you look through the segments, I think you can get some numbers from the QFS. It's roughly proportionate. I think you'd find that the retail has a higher allocation in some pieces of variable income and lower in other pieces of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS. Please go ahead.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just to quickly follow up on VII. I think last quarter, Steve, you sort of indicated that you'd reassess the outlook for the rest of the year. I think your range quarterly is $300 million to $375 million. Any update there in terms of what we should be thinking about for the balance of the year?","Steven J. Goulart - Chief Investment Officer & Executive VP","Sure. Again, as I just mentioned, the hedge fund returns were actually negative for the first quarter. And I think if you look at the rest of the year, you have to make some assumptions, of course, and if we were able to see hedge funds and private equity return to our plan expectations for the second half of the year, we'd probably end up around the bottom of the range that we had given for the full year.","I will remind you, private equity continues to perform fairly well. I mean, it was slightly below plan, but again, still very positive. And it really \u2013 again, most of the underperformance came from hedge funds. So like I said, it depends on your assumptions for the rest of the year. Right now, we're not going to change anything. And if we hit the plan for the second half of the year, we'll be at the lower end of the range.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","All right. And then maybe for Steve, I know it's early days around the separation, but if we think about your consolidated ROE of, I guess, roughly 10% on a normalized basis in the quarter, and we think about this sort of separation, is there any directional guidance you can give us in terms of how you'd think the return profiles of the two businesses would be post-separation?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Suneet, because there's so many moving pieces right now, it's premature for me to give out ROE targets, but I would anticipate we'd talk about this certainly in Investor Day.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Then maybe just to sneak one last one in. I think, John, you said the stat earnings in the quarter for the U.S. businesses were around $700 million. I think a year ago, it was around $1.2 billion. And I think in the prepared comments you talked about interest rates, but is there any more color you can provide on what caused that big decline year-over-year?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, you have the statutory operating net income. Also some of the derivative accounting goes right through to \u2013 it's not in net income. It's statutory goes right through to the equity. So there's a lot of moving pieces when you get into the statutory accounting that we have, particularly in Met U.S.A. that has all of the VAs in it. So, everything is consolidated, remember, in our statutory statements, and you'll see the volatility flowing through here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC. Please go ahead.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much. John, I have a question about your comments related to dental. Are you saying that the seasonality that you saw in the past \u2013 I'm sorry, that the claims that you experienced in the just-reported quarter, the March quarter, were absolutely there in the past as well but were somehow masked? Is that what you mean by other considerations? Is that what you mean when you say the seasonality wasn't evident? And that therefore, since this is, so to speak, normal seasonality that the earnings were in line with your expectations? Or should I be reaching a different conclusion? Thank you.","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So, the last two years in the first quarter, we had pretty tough winter weather conditions, and we saw a decline of frequency of dental claims coming through in that quarter. If you looked at the first and second quarters of the last two years, it got caught up. People ended up going to the dentist, so you had higher frequency in Q2 for the last two years.","This quarter, we were just above the high end of our range of our expectations for dental, so it's a little higher than what we had expected. But there is a seasonality to dental. And so we just think that may have been missed as we looked at how a lot of analysts had done the numbers for the expectations for this quarter. So I just wanted to highlight that for you that this dental is more close in line of what we do expect.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","All right. Thanks very much. I'm all set.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Schwartz from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. And congratulations to everybody. Just one more that hasn't been answered yet. Can we talk a little bit about U.S. Direct? I think, John, you said that sales were down 18%, maybe you could talk about that. And also, am I wrong, wasn't that supposed to be moved from Lat Am?","Maria R. Morris - Executive VP & Head-Global Employee Benefits","Hi. It's Maria Morris. Yes, sales are down this quarter year-over-year, and that's very purposeful on our part. You may have seen that media spending is quite high as a result of both the election and other things going on. So, we're very selective in terms of how we actually put media into the marketplace. So, that's been planned. You probably also noticed, though, that our PFOs are up 34% year-over-year because we've had very strong sales over the last 12 months. And that gives us some optionality in terms of how we're really thinking about sales for this year. We will be moving the U.S. Direct business out of Latin America later this year and we'll obviously be disclosing that when we do so.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. So I guess my sense here is the election is taking up too much advertising space, advertising costs have gone up, so it's \u2013 you can't beat hurdle rates, I guess, with what you want to pay. Is that the deal?","Maria R. Morris - Executive VP & Head-Global Employee Benefits","Exactly. The way that we actually go to market, as you know, is through both a combination of DirecTV, digital and since the advertising spending is up, plus it's a cluttered space, we made the decision to delay some of that until future quarters.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start with the alternative portfolio. So, I heard Steve talk about the added value of the portfolio and how it's actually generated excess returns over the course of a long period of time. And then, I hear John talk about the interest of maybe scaling that portfolio down a bit, at least the hedge fund component of it. Would the thought be that you'd replace some of these hedge funds with other alternative investments? Or should we just think about maybe a smaller benefit or boost coming from overall VII going forward?","Steven J. Goulart - Chief Investment Officer & Executive VP","Hi. It's Steve Goulart again. When Steve made his opening comments, he was referring to the full mix of variable investment income. So, remember, that includes private equity, that includes hedge fund, there's some old real estate development JVs in there, as well as prepayments. So he was talking about the whole mix. If we look at the hedge fund contribution to that, actually it didn't contribute to it negative \u2013 positively over 10 years. It's had up and down years, and really it's just too inconsistent we think in the actual performance. So that's our reason for pulling it out.","As far as how to think about it going forward, we're basically just going to \u2013 and because the way the redemptions come in, which are spread out over a long period of time, we're really going to look at reinvestment just as part of our overall ongoing regular asset allocation and optimization plans.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. But would the VII component of the overall net investment income come in a bit over the next few years?","Steven J. Goulart - Chief Investment Officer & Executive VP","Well, as an example, for this year, again, if we look at the planned VII, the hedge fund redemptions would have a very modest reduction to overall VII. It's under $30 million. And going forward, it will depend on the mix that we achieved.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then, the other question I had was going back to the Investor Day, so I'm assuming that given the delay and the interest in maybe sharing a little more color with the investment community, at that point then come November, ultimately there will be more publicly available material data out there, would it be fair to assume then that buybacks could be back on the table by November?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yaron, the separation of the U.S. Retail business will be the driving force here. I think at the time of the Investor Day, my guess is it's probably not going to be completed. We'll know a lot more, but we won't have final clarity about our capital needs, et cetera until the actual form is known through the execution of a separation. So, and a lot of that is going to be determined not just by what we want to do, it's going to be determined by the marketplace, what we can do. So, a little bit of this is going to be a timing issue. If we're not able to execute by the time of Investor Day, then we're still going to be not knowing some key components here of the picture that will enable us to be clearer on our capital plans.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And if you are not able to execute or you don't have that clarity at that point, will you still be able to share enough material information with the Street? Or do you think that at that point maybe you'd reconsider holding Investor Day in November?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, we're not going to change the date of Investor Day from November. We'll still hold Investor Day, but we may not have all the answers at that point in time. In fact, I anticipate we won't have all the answers as to how the execution of the separation actually occurred because if I had a guess, it's less likely than more likely that it will be done by then.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. And thank you for taking my question. Just a question for Steve. In your letter to shareholders, you mentioned your interest in growing the fee-based earnings organically or through acquisitions. Can you talk about what type of fee-based business that you're interested in growing either organically or through acquisitions?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Humphrey. As you know, we purchased ProVida, a pension fund administrator in Chile, a few years ago. That is a business that we found very attractive. We were able to purchase it \u2013 a very good multiple of earnings, and it was a business we think will grow over time. We also have started up our own internal third-party asset management business, and we're growing that. So, it's both organic and acquisition-related efforts to grow our fee-based business. So, the asset management space is attractive if we can find the right opportunities, both organically and by acquisition. And we continue to look at opportunities as they become available.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","And then, in terms of the, call it, pension business, granted you have the presence in Latin America, but would you consider growing your pension business elsewhere?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You're referring to fee-based businesses like ProVida?","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Yes.","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, we would. If we find the right opportunities in other markets, we are absolutely interested in looking at those kinds of acquisitions.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","So, can you maybe \u2013 just a follow-up on that a little bit. So, would you prefer like a pension market that has more of a mandatory component similar to what you see in Chile? Or are you open to kind of more broader pension business in general?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say broader. We are opportunistic investors in businesses that we think make sense given our strategy. And we've mentioned before, and including the annual shareholder letter that we would like to grow our fee-based businesses. It's not a big component of our top line or even our bottom line at this point in time. And just from a balance point of view, we think we could do more in that space.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","So, kind of looking ahead and in an ideal situation, how much do you want the fee-based business to represent your total earnings contribution in your kind of longer-term outlook?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We haven't determined a specific percent at this point in time.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions.","Edward A. Spehar - Head-Investor Relations","Okay. Well, I want to spend just 30 seconds to go back to a question that was asked that we didn't answer. It was cut off; it was on Latin America sales. I'm just going to pass it to Oscar Schmidt.","Oscar A. Schmidt - Executive Vice President, CEO-Latin America, MetLife, Inc.","Thank you, Ed. So as we saw, Lat Am year-over-year sales are flat. If you exclude the U.S. direct, and as we know, it's still included in Lat Am this quarter, it moves up to 3%. Now, that 3% is affected by a decline in the reported sales in Mexico. That decline was originally a regulatory change. But that regulatory change there produced lower sales, it's also producing better persistency, no impact in bottom line. So, if you exclude the reported sales, Lat Am growth year-over-year is 8%, which is in line with our expectations.","Edward A. Spehar - Head-Investor Relations","Okay. Thank you all for joining.

Also here with us today to participate in discussions are other members of senior management.","Last night, we released an expanded set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks, if you wish to follow along. The contents of the slides begins following the romanette pages that feature a number of GAAP reconciliations.","After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. But given the busy earnings call schedule this morning, we'll extend no longer than the top of the hour. So in fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, I will turn the call over to Steve. ","Steve Kandarian","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported fourth quarter earnings to close on a very strong 2018. Quarterly adjusted earnings totaled $1.3 billion or $1.35 per share, up from $0.64 per share a year ago. Adjusted earnings benefited from a tax settlement that more than offset weaker capital markets, weaker underwriting and refinement to the estimated impact of U.S. tax reform. Net income was $2 billion or $2.04 per share, down from $2.14 per share a year ago. Falling interest rates, falling equity markets and the strengthening dollar drove substantial gains in the derivatives we hold to protect our balance sheet. These gains reversed much of the non-economic derivative losses incurred earlier in the year.","For the full year 2018, MetLife generated adjusted earnings of $5.5 billion or $5.39 per share, an increase of 37%. Net income for the year was $5 billion or $4.91 per share. Overall, 2018 was an excellent year, driven by solid underwriting, good volume growth, disciplined expense management and tax reform. These positive fundamentals were enhanced by the impact of significant and consistent capital management. Reflecting the strong full year results, adjusted return on equity in 2018 was 12. 6%.","Turning to total company investments. Our investment portfolio continues to benefit from higher investment rates. Our new money rate rose from 3.23% a year ago to 4.24% in the fourth quarter. Our average roll-off rate in the quarter was 4.4%. In absolute terms, recurring investment income was up 6.5% compared to a year ago as higher asset balances and rates combined to offset the roll-off of higher-yielding securities. Variable investment income of $237 million came in above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range and was aided by another strong quarter of private equity returns. For the full year, VII totaled $962 million at the upper end of our annual range of $800 million to $1 billion.","Looking ahead, we anticipate weaker first quarter private equity returns in our alternative investment portfolio given fourth quarter marketing conditions and the one quarter reporting a lag. Our full year 2019 guidance for variable investment income remains unchanged. Before I address capital management, I want to provide an update regarding the group annuity issue we disclosed in December 2017. We continue to make good progress on the remediation of this issue and expect to report in our 2018 Form 10-K later this month, the lifting of the related material weakness. At the same time, we also expect to report the lifting of the previously reported material weakness associated with over-reserving in our Japan variable annuity book.","Moving to capital management. When we held our outlook call in mid-December, I indicated that we have repurchased $700 million of MetLife shares since reporting earnings on November 1st, which extinguished our prior authorization and began utilization of our current $2 billion authorization. During the balance of December, we took advantage of market conditions and repurchased an additional $500 million at an average price of $39.46 per share bringing fourth quarter share repurchases to $1.2 billion. There remains $1.3 billion outstanding on our current authorization.","All totaled we repurchased $4 billion of MetLife common stock and paid $1.7 billion of common dividends during 2018 to bring total capital return to common shareholders to $5.7 billion well ahead of our $5 billion target and more than 100% of full year adjusted earnings. By now it should be clear to all that we have a strong commitment to returning excess capital to shareholders. As this is my last earnings call before Michel Khalaf takes over as CEO, I have been thinking about what defines my time with MetLife. The one word that sums it up best is de-risking, whether on the asset side of our balance sheet, the liability side or in the regulatory arena.","My goal is for MetLife to perform well in any economic environment. 18 months after joining MetLife as Chief Investment Officer in 2005, we sold Peter Cooper Village, Stuyvesant Town in Manhattan for $5.4 billion. While this was regarded as a historic top-of-the-market asset sale, it was actually de-risking move. That one property has risen so much in value that it represented nearly 50% of our entire real estate portfolio. The same approach to risk guided us as the storm clouds and the financial crisis began to gather. I am proud that we saw the housing bubble earlier than most and took action to significantly reduce our holdings to subprime mortgage-backed securities.","We also saw the recession coming in October of 2007, two months ahead of the official call and made a decision to sell down approximately $8 billion of assets we thought would be most vulnerable in a downturn. Our efforts to de-risk MetLife's asset portfolio helped us come to the financial crisis in such strong financial shape that we were able to buy Alico from AIG for $16.4 billion, money that AIG used to repay U.S. taxpayers.","When I became CEO in May of 2011, I knew our major task would be to de-risk our liabilities just as we had de-risked our assets. After going public, the company had been growing the topline with complicated guarantees that produced impressive GAAP earnings, but with poor underlying economics. We had exited the long-term care business the prior year, largely because some of our leadership view the liabilities ask unhedgeable. But we were still in danger putting a lot of value at risk in a lower-for-longer interest rate environment.","Initially, I thought that exiting universal life with secondary guarantees and ratcheting down verbal annuity sales will get the job done. Eventually, we realized the best course will be to spin-off our U.S. retail business altogether and create two distinct value propositions. In light of these actions, I believe we have made tremendous progress in de-risking MetLife. At the same time, we were improving MetLife's economics by boosting free cash flow and the value of new business written. We expanded capital life businesses with high internal rates of return and shorter payback periods in fixed or exited businesses that fail to meet those criteria.","As a result, our free cash flow ratio rose from 26% in 2012 to an average of 66% over 2017 and 2018. This stronger free cash flow enabled MetLife to repurchase more than $10 billion of common shares over the last five years even as we increased our common dividend at a 12% compound average growth rate since 2011. Operationally, we made significant investments to upgrade MetLife's technology, expand our digital capabilities, and deliver a better customer experience, all without negatively impacting expenses.","To the contrary, our unit cost initiative has already improved MetLife's direct expense ratio by 140 basis points and is on track to deliver $800 million of pretax margin improvement by 2020. In the midst of all these efforts, we were confronted with a regulatory risk larger than any MetLife has faced in its history. Because we won our lawsuit against the government to shut our designation as a systemically important financial institution or SIFI, it may be hard to remember how ominous the threat appeared in 2013.","The actions of the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Federal Reserve at that time, made two things clear, first, only three out of more than 800 U.S. life insurers will be labeled SIFIs; and second, the capital requirements for SIFIs will be significantly higher than for other firms. We view this as an existential threat that would make it impossible for MetLife to price many of its products competitively, harming customers and shareholders alike.","The Dodd-Frank Act included a provision allowing companies to seek judicial review of their SIFI designations. No company wants to take the Federal government to Court, but this was a path I felt we must pursue for the sake of our customers, employees, and shareholders. We were given many warnings: you will lose, your brand will suffer, you will face retribution. But if anything, because we took the principal stand and fought for what we knew was right, MetLife emerged with its repetition enhanced. I believe I was the right person to lead the de-risking of MetLife, which has stabilized our balance sheet, strengthened our free cash flow and positioned us for a profitable growth.","I also believe that MetLife is now at an inflection point, where a different kind of leadership is needed, someone with a strong track record of execution, who sets ambitious targets and knows how to meet or beat them. That person is Michel Khalaf and I'm very excited that he's taking over as CEO on May 1. The Board of Directors conducted a thorough internal and external search to find the right executive to lead MetLife. We knew it was critical to find someone who combine deep knowledge of the industry and entrepreneurial spirit, a commitment to innovation and strong leadership skills. The Board and I have every confidence that Michel is the right executive to lead our global company into the future.","In closing, I want to thank everyone who has helped transform MetLife into a more efficient, innovative and financially successful company. This starts with MetLife's 48,000 employees, who bring a deep sense of purpose to our mission of making people's lives more financially secure. I also want to thank MetLife's senior leaders for their willingness to make hard decisions to move us forward. We have built one of the strongest leadership teams anywhere in the industry. I am confident they will lead MetLife to new levels of success.","To my fellow Board members, I want to say thank you for your support, especially during our long SIFI struggle. Few Boards would have had the courage to stick with us through this challenge. I am very pleased that your trust was rewarded. And finally to our shareholders, thank you for your patience. Large life insurance companies are difficult ships to turn, but it was critical that we set MetLife on a better course for the future. As the owners of the company, you deserve a fair return on the capital you've entrusted to us. I believe our efforts are now delivering on their promise and will continue to do so in the years to come.","With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion. ","John McCallion","Thank you Steve and good morning. I will begin by discussing the 4Q 2018 supplemental slides that we released last evening along with our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. These slides cover our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results.","Starting on page four. The schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter and full year 2018. In the quarter, net income was $2 billion, or roughly $700 million higher than the adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion. The primary driver for the variance was net derivative gains due to significant market movements during the fourth quarter. Lower interest rates, equity market weakness and the strength of the U.S. dollar combined to drive the net derivative gains. For the full year 2018, net income was $5 billion, which was roughly $500 million less than adjusted earnings of $5.5 billion. Overall, the results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected.","We had three notable items in the quarter as shown on page five and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. First, favorable tax items increased adjusted earnings by $247 million after tax or $0.25 per share. The largest component of this benefit was the result of an IRS audit settlement related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. As some of you may recall, MetLife established a reserve in the third quarter of 2015 related to this matter.","Second, expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings by $100 million after tax or $0.10 per share, which is the highest UCI expenses of the year.","Third, litigation reserves and settlement costs were $60 million after tax or $0.06 per share. This includes separate fines, totaling approximately $20 million paid to the insurance Department of New York and the Securities Division of Massachusetts related to our group annuity business. Adjusted earnings excluding notable items were $1.2 billion or $1.26 per share.","On page six, you can see the year-over-year adjusted earnings excluding notable items by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 6% year-over-year and 8% on a constant currency basis. On a per-share basis, adjusted earnings were up 14% and up 16% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Overall positive year-over-year drivers in the quarter included better expense margins and solid volume growth as well as lower taxes primarily due to the U.S. tax reform. These were partially offset by the impact from weaker equity markets, lower recurring interest margins and less favorable underwriting. Pre-tax variable investment income was $237 million, up $21 million versus the prior year quarter, driven by higher private equity returns.","With regards to our business performance. Group Benefits adjusted earnings were flat year-over-year. The key drivers were solid volume growth and lower taxes, which were offset by less favorable underwriting, higher expenses and lower investment margins. With respect to underwriting, the Group Life mortality ratio was 89.4%, which was higher than the prior year quarter of 87.2%, primarily due to elevated severity. Notwithstanding, this quarter's results the Group Life mortality ratio was 87.5% for the full year 2018 and exactly in the middle of our target range of 85% to 90%.","The interest adjusted benefit ratio for non-medical health was 73.2%, which was lower than the 73.7% in the prior year quarter and below the 2018 target range of 75% to 80%. The year-over-year improvement in the ratio was primarily driven by continued positive trends in disability. This was partially offset by higher utilization in dental in the quarter. Group Benefits continues to see strong momentum in its top line.","Adjusted PFOs in the quarter and full year were up 4% with growth across most markets and product lines. Full year sales were down 1% versus 2017, which had record jumbo cases. Voluntary products saw continued momentum with sales up double digits in 2018. In addition, we also continue to grow our market as regional and small-market sales were strong and well-above full year expectations. Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, adjusted earnings excluding notable items were up 51%. The key drivers were favorable underwriting and investment margins, solid volume growth, as well as lower taxes due to U.S. the tax reform.","While the flatter yield curve has continued to pressure RIS adjusted earnings, this was more than offset by higher total liabilities which were up 5% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding the FedEx transaction announced in May of 2018, total liabilities were up 2%. As a result of higher variable investment income in this quarter, we have been able to maintain spreads which were 130 basis points in 4Q 2018 and within our prior year outlook call range of 110 to 135. Excluding VII, RIS spreads were 103 basis points, down two basis points year-over-year and one basis point sequentially. RIS adjusted PFOs were $523 million, down from $1 billion in the prior year quarter due to lower pension risk transfer sales. While we did not complete any transactions in the fourth quarter, PRT PFOs were $6.9 billion in 2018, a record year for us.","As we look to 2019, we remain optimistic on winning our share of PRT deals given the strong pipeline that we continue to see. Excluding PRT deals, adjusted PFOs were up 40% versus the prior year quarter and up 13% for the full year, primarily due to structured settlements and income annuities. Property & Casualty or P&C adjusted earnings excluding notable items in the prior quarter were up 13%, primarily due to lower taxes. Pretax cat losses were $25 million in the quarter which was $2 million lower than the prior year quarter.","With regards to the topline, P&C adjusted PFOs were up 1%, while sales were up 13% versus 4Q 2017. Asia adjusted earnings were down 9% and 8% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were less favorable underwriting and the impact of weaker capital markets in Japan and Korea in the quarter. This was partially offset by solid growth in assets under management as well as lower taxes. Asia sales were up 5% on a constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were up 19% primarily driven by strong foreign currency-denominated annuities as well as Accident & Health sales. FX and A&H products remain our primary focus in Japan and we continue to see strong momentum in the market. Other Asia sales were down 13%, primarily driven by regulatory changes in Korea.","Latin America adjusted earnings were up 10% and 19% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were better expense margins, favorable underwriting, and volume growth. This was partially offset by the impact from a lower equity market on our Chilean encaje and higher taxes. Latin America adjusted PFOs were down 3%, but up 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by volume growth across the region. Latin America sales were up 6% on a constant-currency basis. The divestiture of MetLife Afore, our former pension management business in Mexico dampened sales growth by four points compared to the prior year quarter.","EMEA adjusted earnings were down 30% and 24% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to less favorable underwriting and higher taxes. This was partially offset by better expense margins. In addition, EMEA's adjusted earnings were negatively impacted by a few one-time items totaling roughly $9 million that we don't expect to repeat. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 3% on a constant-currency basis, reflecting growth in Western Europe and Turkey. EMEA sales were down 7% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower volumes in the Gulf.","MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings, excluding notable items in 4Q 2017, were down 8% year-over-year. The primary drivers were unfavorable equity market impacts and life mortality. This was partially offset by improved expense margins and the benefits from U.S. tax reform. With regards to equity market performance, MetLife Holdings separate account returns were down 10% in the quarter and resulted in an initial market impact of approximately $25 million to adjusted earnings, which is roughly in line with our sensitivity guidance.","Underwriting results included unfavorable mortality due to a higher large face claims in the quarter, which drove the life interest adjusted benefit ratio to 58%. Despite the higher life claims in 4Q, the full year interest adjusted benefit ratio was 52.4% excluding notable items and in the middle of our target range of 50% to 55%. Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding notable items, was $132 million. Overall, the company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 12.2%. Excluding the favorable notable tax items discussed earlier, the company's effective tax rate in the quarter was 18%.","Turning to page seven. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2018, as well as the quarterly details for 2018. As we have previously stated, we believe the annual direct expense ratio best reflects the impact on profit margins as it captures the relationship of revenues and the expenses over which we have the most control. We have also noted previously that our goal is to realize $800 million of pre-tax profit margin improvement by 2020, which represents an approximate 200 basis point decline from the 2015 baseline year. We continue to make consistent progress towards achieving our target by 2020.","As the chart illustrates, we have already achieved 140 basis point improvement in the annual direct expense ratio from 2015 to 2018. While we are pleased with these results, we had certain expense items in the fourth quarter that lowered the full year ratio by approximately 20 basis points. We don't anticipate these items recurring in future periods.","I will now discuss our cash and capital position on slide eight. Cash and liquid assets at our holding companies were approximately $3 billion at December 31, which is down from $4.5 billion at September 30. The $1.5 billion decrease in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend, holding company expenses and liability management actions. Our average 2017 and 2018 free cash flow ratio was 66% of adjusted earnings excluding notable and Brighthouse separation related items. This was within our two-year average target of 65% to 75%.","Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, our new combined NAIC RBC target ratio post U.S. tax reform is 360%. And we will be in excess of that amount for the full year 2018. For our U.S. companies, preliminary 2018 statutory operating earnings were approximately $4.4 billion. And net earnings were approximately $4.2 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $1 billion from the prior year. The increase was primarily due to dividends received from the investment subsidiary, which had a corresponding offset in statutory adjusted capital as well as lower taxes. These items were partially offset by less favorable capital markets in 2018 and reinsurance recaptures in 2017.","We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.5billion as of December 31, 2018, which remains relatively flat versus 2017. Net earnings and investment gains were offset by dividends paid to the holding companies. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 794% as of September 30th, which is the latest public data.","Overall, MetLife generated a solid quarter despite challenging market conditions to close out a very strong year. Our full year financial accomplishments in 2018 include; 22% growth in adjusted EPS excluding notable items; record PRT PFOs of $6.9 billion; returned a record $5.7 billion of capital to shareholders; improved the direct expense ratio; and remained on track to achieve our target by 2020. In addition, our cash and capital position as well as our balance sheet remains strong. Finally, we remain confident that the actions we have taken to implement our strategy will continue to drive free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value to our shareholders.","And with that, I will turn back to the operator for your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Q \u2013 Andrew Kligerman","Hey, good morning. Question around mortality. It looks like it was -- and you called that out in the press release as well. It looks like Group, Asia, EMEA, MetLife Holdings all had somewhat elevated mortality. So, I just wanted to get a sense. Is this kind of a blip? Could it reverse the next quarter? How do you see the outlook?","John McCallion","Good morning, Andrew. It's John. Let me take it from the top. I might ask Michel to jump in a little bit too on the group side. But I think in general what you said is true. I would consider this just normal volatility. I think the important thing to point out if you go back to our full year benefit ratios we're generally in line with our targets. So I would tend to agree with your -- I guess, your statement that this is just a normal volatility. It's generally severity in a lot of places. We did have a reserve refinement in Asia. I think the one place; we did see some higher utilization in dental. And maybe I'll just have Michel comment on that. So we'll monitor that. But I think otherwise the other mortality or unfavorable mortality is generally just considered a blip.","Michel Khalaf","Yes, hi Andrew. It's Michel. So, on the dental front, we did see higher utilization in Q4. As a reminder, we had a very strong first quarter. Typically, the fourth quarter, we see lower utilization. A lot of insureds reached their limit so that drives the overall utilization. As I said, we had low utilization in the first quarter. We've analyzed this; we see no particular trends in any block area or service. And some of the Q4 results are also due to prior quarter development as well. So, trailing from Q3. So, we're keeping a close eye, but nothing to suggest that this is the beginning of a trend.","Andrew Kligerman","Got it. And then just on the pension risk trends. You mentioned earlier John that the pipeline still looks very good. But it was quiet in the fourth quarter. Is it getting too competitive? Is pricing under any pressure here? Or do you feel good about the returns going forward?","Michel Khalaf","Yes, Andrew, Michel again. So, it is a competitive marketplace, but we see a good pipeline based on discussions that we're having with intermediaries and plan sponsors. We feel confident in our ability to continue to win our fair share of deals while sticking to our discipline in terms of how we evaluate and assess those opportunities going forward. So, we're still bullish and confident in terms of the PRT opportunity going forward.","Andrew Kligerman","Double-digit returns are still viable?","Michel Khalaf","Well, certainly we're sticking to our discipline in terms of the returns that we look for on those deals. And again, as a reminder, we had a record year in 2017 and we more than doubled 2017 and 2018. So, another record year there as well. So, yes, we're still sort of optimistic about the market opportunity there.","Andrew Kligerman","Excellent. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Steve just a follow-up on your point on de-risking. As you think about how you leave Met position here, I think the perception is the only real remaining tail risk might be long-term care. And when you think about this risk going forward, while Met's block has performed pretty much better than everyone else in the industry so far, is there a risk that every block is underwater and eventually Met will -- it will catch-up to Met? Or do you have reason to believe that Met's long-term care block is going to be fine over the next several years?","Steve Kandarian","Hi Tom. We feel good about our long-term care block. And we talked about this; I think it was the last earnings call, gave you a fair amount of detail on it. We are getting rate relief in many states. We continued those efforts. As you know as most of this business is written on MOIC, that's under New York regulations which we had very strong capital rules and reserving requirements. So, we feel our book is in a good position. And we stopped writing this business back in 2010, as I mentioned. But obviously we still have a block of business on our books. And we still get premiums in for those policies that have been out there for quite some time. But we have looked at it very, very carefully. We've done a lot of work on it and we feel that it's in a good place.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. And then my follow-up is just on the Holdco liquidity and capital management. So looks like you're toward the low end of your Holdco liquidity target of $3 billion to $4 billion now. My question is, how much above the 360% RBC target are you in terms of stat surplus? And when you think about what your excess capital position is now, or maybe you don't have much of that excess capital, is there a thought for 2019 that you might want to build a bigger buffer? Or do you think you'll be able to use all of your free cash flow for 2019 for shareholder return purposes?","John McCallion"," Good morning, Tom. This is John. Let me take it from the Holdco and I'll touch on the RBC at the end. So first, let me just start to just help reconcile and maybe roll through \u2013 roll forward our cash from over the course of the quarter. I think it's important to recognize that we had 1.2 billion of share repurchase in the quarter. And I think you may realize that we had an additional 500 million post the outlook call. And I take that as a decision to accelerate some of what otherwise would've been repurchased in 2019. And we did so at an average price of $39.46. So, yes, we view that as good use of excess cash at that time given the work market weakness. And so we'll be mindful of that as we see how markets trend.","I think the second thing to keep in mind in the quarter; we did complete our net liability management actions in the quarter. And just remind you, we said during 2018 that we would compete $1 billion to $2 billion of net liability management during 2018. We ended up at about $1.5 billion, which we completed in the fourth quarter. Roughly $400 million or $500 million of debt repurchases. And then I attribute the remaining portion to just lumpiness and any one quarter of intercompany cash flows and tax sharing payments. So then turning to the buffer. So we're at the low end of the range today. This process of setting the buffer, we use some severe and very severe liquidity stress tests. We look at the related calls on holding company cash and capital and then we set the buffer accordingly. And so we did so a number of years -- I guess, it was two years ago or so. We set the $3 billion to $4 billion range. And it's a range for a reason.","So we take into account our outlook. And one of the things these liability management actions did is it helped reduce some of the complexity or the calls on cash at the holding company. We've historically run at about $1 billion of maturities every year in debt, debt maturities. And a lot of that liability management actions has helped push out some of those maturities. So just to give you a sense of that, we have no debt maturities in 2019. We have like $400 million to $500 million each year from 2020 to 2022. So our debt maturity towers are much different today. And as a result the holding company, under a stress, can be \u2013 can think about that.","Tom Gallagher","Right.","John McCallion","So it's just, we've kind of continued to reduce their risk, I'd say, at the Holdco. And therefore, I would expect us to manage to the lower end of that range in the near term. Moving to RBC. We did lower our RBC target as a result of the tax reform by 40 points. Remember it did not have any impact on our adjusted -- total adjusted capital. This was just merely impact to the formula for required capital. It doesn't change anything in terms of our available resources or anything like that. So we adjusted it down by the 40 points from 400 to 360. Today our best estimate that would be that we're above 380 at the end of the year.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, thanks. Good morning. In Asia, the earnings this quarter were about $50 million lower than the full year quarterly average ex-notable items. I think John you mentioned reserve item. But I'm just curious if there's anything in the quarter you view as ongoing? Or if it was just a weaker quarter in terms of underwriting? And some of the other things you mentioned on capital markets and reserve true ups?","Kishore Ponnavolu","Ryan this is Kishore. For the full year 2018, if you exclude notables, the Asia segments reported adjusted earnings is up 8%. That certainly exceeds the outlook we provided for the year. In terms of this quarter there were four factors that put pressure on our earnings. One was unfavorable underwriting. And John spoke to the reserve refinement. That's about $20 million. There were two one-timers; one in the Japan segment, the other one was in the Other Asia segment. So that's first one.","Then the second one is VII. Although VII was up for MetLife as a whole it was lower for the Asia segment by about $13 million. The third factor is the U.S. dollar strengthened in the fourth quarter against the Korean Won and the Aussie Dollar that -- about one point there. Finally, we had significant pressure on the equity markets in both Japan and Korea. Topics was down 18%, cost fee was down 13%. So this led to some reserve increases in some of various products. Just to give you a little bit of context around this, right? These reserves represent 2% of our total reserves. So that's point number one.","And then point number two is in Korea, which represents a bulk of this impact, we are hedged on a statutory basis. So given all this and looking at 2019, I'm quite comfortable reaffirming our earnings outlook guidance. Thank you.","Ryan Krueger","Great. Thanks a lot. That was helpful. And then on the weaker VII in 1Q 2019 from lack of private equity returns, can you give us any quantification of that?","Steve Goulart","Ryan its Steve Goulart. Well, as Steve Kandarian said in his prepared remarks, we do expect the weaker first quarter; remember that's a lag in private equity. We've gone back and relooked at it. We looked at our outlook. What we've done, we have lowered our expected yield but it's still low-double digits as we said at the outlook call. And most important I think is we're still confident that our VII will come within the range that we gave at the outlook call off $800 million to $1 billion. Undoubtedly we'll be weaker. Private equity will be weaker in the first quarter reflecting the fourth quarter markets, but we're confident overall still.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jimmy Bhullar, your line is open. Check your mute button.","Jimmy Bhullar","Yes, hi. So I had a couple of questions. First on just as you mentioned new money yields going up throughout last year. And if you can talk about where your new money yield sit right now versus the rates that rates on the bonds that are holding off just to get an idea on if you're close to a point where you think spread compression will begin to abate in the business?","John McCallion","Well, if you look at the trend, the trend continues to be positive. And I think we've had four quarters in a row of rising new money yield. But remember what happened in -- sort of, late in the fourth quarter to rates have fallen again. Where we would stand though is we're still confident that as rates continue to rise, we're going to be approaching that breakeven threshold. But for now, we're still looking at kind of 25 to 100 basis point for each quarter just given the volatility in some of the runoff assets. But we're getting closer, we're not there yet.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then on the international business, you've had sort of few dispositions recently with the Mexico Afore and the U.K. Wealth Management business. As you're looking at your international franchise overall, are there other pieces that you're looking to sort off deemphasize or are you comfortable with -- or is most of the restructuring effort already done?","Steve Kandarian","Jimmy, we can't say we can look at our overall portfolio businesses in terms of where were going to put more capital and where we're going to put less capital. And even in some cases as you've mentioned selloff or disinvest in those areas. So, that's an ongoing process. But if there's anything there that we come to conclude on, we'll certainly let you know.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then just lastly if I could ask on the MetLife Holding segment, the fact that a lot of the business is in New York, I think makes it difficult to sort of transact either insurer or sell it. Has anything changed the way you think that there's an opportunity for you to offload that exposure?","John McCallion","We are careful with that business, and its cash flow characteristics, but we always look at opportunities to create value for the shareholders. So, it's an area that we have spent a great deal of time looking at in the past and we continue to do so and we'll continue to do so going forward. If we find a way to transact in that area that's beneficial to our shareholders, we certainly will get give that full consideration.","Jimmy Bhullar","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Hi, thank you. I know you've touched on this part of the couple of the outlook pieces already. But I guess broader question. Is there anything on the 4Q results that changes your view on the 2019 outlook for any of the businesses? Or do you view all of the fluctuations this quarter as things that we would fall within your range of normal expectations?","John McCallion","Erik its John. Yes, that's correct. We would view this as this quarter -- this quarter does not impact our outlook for 2019. I think the only place I would just refer back to what Steve Goulart said is maybe there are some pressure on returns, but we think return for the year is still within our outlook range.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you. And then can you comment on the competitive dynamics in the group business and how they're affecting sales in persistency trends? Maybe how was your experience around the year on renewals?","Michel Khalaf","Sure. Erik, its Michel. So, it's a competitive marketplace I would say, in particular, in the dental space. But we are -- I would say, we are winning our fair share of business. I think 1\/1\/19 sales and renewals are in line with expectations. And we continue to see excellent momentum in our voluntary business as well. And that's really making up for some of the weakness that we see on the dental front, where we are really continuing to hold our ground in terms of discipline on pricing. But overall, I would say, sales and persistency are in line with expectations.","Erik Bass","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from UBS. Please go ahead.","John Nadel","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just a broader question, John. Capital markets impacts sort of broadly speaking in the fourth quarter. Do you have any estimate on what markets -- I mean, I know it was mentioned that Japan, Korea, obviously the U.S., etcetera. Can you just give us a sense for what kind of impact that had on your earnings in the fourth quarter? And how should we think about the 1Q balances that sort of go into your point of recovery?","John McCallion","Good morning, John. Yeah. As you said, there's been quite a bit of recovery already in the first quarter. I think we\u2019re close to 9% year-to-date, something like that. And only 1 point off of where the S&P was at outlook call, I believe is correct. In terms of the \u2013 in the fourth quarter I would estimate the impact to be around $0.06. About half in the U.S. and half outside. So I don't know if that helps frame the fourth quarter.","And then as you said, I think \u2013 but I don't see that impact continuing as our view right now, particularly given the recovery that we've seen so far. The only place that we would -- as Steve Goulart highlighted, there'll be some pressure in the first quarter that we think will \u2013 that we will recover and get to a return that keeps us within the range for the full year for PAI.","John Nadel","Okay. And then, maybe a little bit premature, but I guess a question for, Michel. As you're taking over the reigns, what are your priorities? And how should investors be thinking about those priorities? I know, Steve has characterized and thanked investors for some patience, given the transformation and some de-risking. How are you going to reward that patience as you think about priorities over the next one to two years? ","Michel Khalaf","Yeah. Thanks, John. So, first of all, let me say that I'm excited for the opportunity to lead MetLife. And continue degrade value for our customers and shareholders alike. Let me tell you what will not change under my watch and that's my commitment to MetLife's core goals of capital efficiency, strong risk adjusted returns and profitable growth. Like Steve, I believe that excess capital above and beyond what is required to fund organic growth belongs to our shareholders and should be used for share repurchase, common dividends, or if and when it makes sense, strategic acquisitions that clear our risk-adjusted hurdle rate.","I believe that, as Steve said, MetLife is at an inflection point. And while much has been accomplished in de-risking our business, we still have work to do to accelerate revenue growth further optimize our business and product portfolios and strengthen expense discipline. Obviously, I'm now in a transition phase, so I look forward to share more post May 1st.","John Nadel","Appreciate that. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan, your line is open. Check your mute button. Okay, we'll move on. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Scott","Hi, good morning. First question I had was just on, when I think about the sales growth in Asia and the FX annuities you saw, could you talk a little bit about like what makes that product different from your decision to exit the retail annuities business in the U.S? I mean, clearly it's a different type of product, different regulatory regime, different geography. But I guess any color you can provide that would kind of give us more comfort that that product will ultimately have much better economics than the outcome when you are ramping up on sales of annuities in the U.S.?","John McCallion","Alex I know you were at the Asia Investor Day, and we went into this in fair amount of depth. And certainly these products from a risk-adjusted return perspective are very attractive. And then we talked about the compelling value proposition, not just from a customer perspective from a MetLife perspective as well, because much of these products go through the bank channel and a lot of them are single premium, a vast majority of our sales are actually single premium.","And we take advantage of our strength, which is our investment in the U.S. dollar portfolio. We leverage that combined with our distribution power. That's driven been pretty much our success. And if you look at the category as a whole that's been growing and our share has been growing because we have a very strong value proposition. I talked about the market value adjustment feature, also talked about the constant repricing that we look at it pretty much on a biweekly basis. So this is a very actively managed portfolio. And we're very happy with that.","Alex Scott","Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up just on the U.S. group business. Can you give us an update on year-end renewals? Any insight on competition pricing et cetera?","John McCallion","As I mentioned earlier, very much in line with expectations. We're getting the renewal action that we are seeking in the market and persistency is in line with expectations. So it is a competitive market. And our pricing reflects that. But again nothing to point out in terms of deviation from what we expected or what we discussed on the outlook call.","Alex Scott","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just a follow-up on Asia sales on different directions. In Other Asia you talked about the regulatory changes in Korea hurting your sales in that segment. But I assume you have -- your sales in China is probably better. So I was wondering if you can provide some color in terms of how much the challenges in Korea hurt your Other Asia sales and then also the other components of the other countries in the region in terms of your sales prospects?","Kishore Ponnavolu","Sure. Again if you take Asia segment as a whole, we've really done well, 11% year-on-year growth for Asia segment. Now, if you take the fourth quarter, Japan obviously, delivered a stellar performance, 19% year-on-year for the fourth quarter, 13% down on the Other Asia segment leading to a 5% overall growth that John mentioned where pretty much from all of it comes from the Korea shortfall. Certainly, we've got some smaller markets, but they are certainly growing healthy. No issues on China, China has, I think, posted strong growth as well.","And the challenge with Korea is that one of our products which is our lead product has been impacted by the regulatory change on commissions where we're working very hard on repricing it and reintroducing it to the marketplace with additional marketing efforts. So, for looking forward to next year -- for this year, I think we'll be fine. I just wanted to reaffirm the outlook guidance of mid-single-digit growth for 2019.","Humphrey Lee","Thank you. And then shifting gear to Group Benefits, in the prepared remarks I think you talked about dental was a little bit unfavorable in the quarter. I guess that's a little bit surprising given the seasonality pan of that particular product line. I was just wondering if you can elaborate a little more in terms of what you saw in the fourth quarter.","Michel Khalaf","Yes. Sure Humphrey. So, as you said typically the fourth quarter, we see favorable utilization in dental because a lot of the insurers reached their maximum limits, which lowers utilization. However, this year, we had a very low first quarter, which typically tends to be high -- I mean 2018. So, that might have impacted the fourth quarter results. As I said, we've analyzed this; we see no issues with any particular block, service, or area here. So, this would indicate that this is not a beginning of trend, but we're obviously keeping a close eye on the situation.","Humphrey Lee","Thank you.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of John Barnidge from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","John Barnidge","Your Property & Casualty business has meaningfully improved the underwriting. How much rate are you currently pushing on auto and also on home?","Michel Khalaf","Yes, hi John. We think that the industry as a whole has taken about 2% to 3% on auto over the last 12 months. We've taken slightly higher rate action than that. Going forward, we think that we're going to be more in line with industry. And I would say the same on homeowners. We think we're going to be in line with industry going forward.","John Barnidge","If you've been pushing more rate than industry previously and now you're going back to industry levels. Does that apply possibly greater share you're going to take or planning you're going to take?","Michel Khalaf","Well, we've -- in our outlook call, we provided -- we increased our outlook for PFO growth in 2019 to 2% to 4% and we think that's going to grow further to -- between 5% and -- over 5% in 2020 and beyond. We're also making important investments in our P&C business. We are re-platforming that business which -- and we are rolling that out in 2019 and 2020. So we think that that's going to give us also some competitive advantages in the market which will help our top line growth going forward.","John Barnidge","Great. Thank you for the answers.","Steve Kandarian","Thank you very much. That's our last question. We look forward to speaking with everyone throughout the quarter. Bye-bye.

In fairness to all, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Kandarian","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported second quarter operating earnings per share of $1.30, up from $0.83 per share a year ago. Overall, it was a good quarter across most business segments, aided by favorable expense management and underwriting. Equity markets which rose 2.6% in the quarter, as measured by the S&P 500, provided modest boost to earnings, while low interest rates remain a headwind.","Operating return on equity in the quarter was 10.3%. Adjusting for notable items, operating earnings were $1.34 per share, which compares to $1.27 per share on the same basis in the prior year period. Net notable items of $0.04 per share in the quarter included costs incurred to consolidate our New York offices at 200 Park Avenue, investments to achieve our target of $800 million and after tax run rate savings by 2020, and branding efforts to support the launch of Brighthouse Financial as a standalone company. These costs were offset in part by a favorable settlement of a tax audit and a reinsurance reserve release.","Net income for the quarter was $838 million, substantially higher than a year ago. Current period net income was negatively affected by net derivative losses and cost associated with the Brighthouse separation.","Before I provide key business highlights for the quarter, I\u2019d like to provide an update on the Brighthouse Financial separation, which is almost complete. All necessary approvals have been secured and Brighthouse Financial shares have been trading on a when-issued basis for the past three weeks.","Last night, MetLife filed an 8-K, disclosing that Brighthouse Financial will need to increase its reserves by approximately $400 million due to refinements in legacy actuarial models. As a result, the size of the dividend MetLife expects to receive from Brighthouse Financial will be reduced from $3.4 billion to $3 billion. John Hele will discuss this matter in greater detail.","On Monday, both Brighthouse and MetLife are expected to trade for the first time on a post-separation basis on their respective exchanges, NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange. We believe the separation marks an inflection point for MetLife.","Over the past few years, we\u2019ve overhauled our product offerings to ensure that the business be right, has better internal rates of return, less capital intensity, and stronger free cash flow. We believe this work is now largely complete and that MetLife is positioned to grow profitably in the protection and fee-based businesses that from the core of the new MetLife.","To be clear, we remain vigilant in fixing or exiting businesses that do not create value. For example, shortly after the end of the second quarter, we made a hard decision to close our UK Wealth Management business, which could not clear its hurdle rate in the prolonged low rate environment. Nevertheless, we are confident that the heavy lifting has been done to transform MetLife into a company with less volatility and more free cash flow, which should lead to a lower cost of equity capital and ultimately a higher valuation.","Turning to highlights across the business segments. The U.S. business segment saw another strong quarter of earnings and sales from Group Benefits. At separation, Group Benefits will be a largest of our growth engines in the U.S. segment. And the business we ride [ph] continues to have attractive risk and return characteristics. Retirement and Income Solutions delivered strong growth in the quarter, while maintaining pricing discipline. In our Property & Casualty, stronger auto results reflected recent pricing and underwriting improvements, while whether, both cat and non-cat at had verse impact on home operating earnings.","For international businesses, operating earnings for both Asia and Latin America benefited from volume growth and higher investment margins, while operating earnings for EMEA were aided by expense control and favorable underwriting. Finally, MetLife Holdings benefited from favorable life insurance underwriting results.","Moving to investments. Pretax variable investment income totaled $279 million in the quarter. Of this amount, $222 million is attributable to the new MetLife, which calls within our quarterly guidance range of $200 million to $215 million, provided on our outlook call in December. Private equity investment is the largest contributor to the performance.","In the quarter, our global new money yield stood at 3.32%, compared to average roll-off rate of 4.23%. Over the past four quarters, our new money rate has averaged 3.18%. Although interest rates are higher than they were a year ago, we have not experienced the rising rates that many predicted after the U.S. presidential election. While I still believe that monetary policy is keeping rates artificially low, I also believe that elected officials need to do more on the fiscal policy front, especially through tax reform to spur faster economic growth.","In the positive regulatory development, yesterday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit Court, approved MetLife\u2019s motion to hold in abeyance the Government\u2019s appeal of our SIFI victory. The Court directed the parties to file motions by November 17, 2017 or within 30 days of the U.S. Treasury Secretary\u2019s report on the Financial Stability Oversight Council SIFI designation process, whichever occurs first.","This decision provides the administration time to determine whether any of FSOC\u2019s positions in this case should be reconsidered and whether it is appropriate for the government to continue to processing this appeal.","Consistent with our goal of growing profitability in the right areas, on July 7th, we announced that MetLife had reached a definitive agreement to acquire Logan Circle Partners, a fixed income asset manager with more than $33 billion of assets under management. Logan Circle will be integrated with MetLife Investment Management, and strengthen our ability to provide investment management services to existing and new institutional clients.","MetLife is already one of the largest life insurance investors in the world. And Logan Circle\u2019s strong track record in public fixed income will accelerate our effort to grow our third-party asset management business.","In addition to the approximately $80 billion we will manage for Brighthouse Financial, MetLife Investment Management will have more than $60 billion of additional third-party assets under management after the transaction closes.","While the acquisition of Logan Circle was consistent with our strategy of growing businesses with less capital intensity and strong free cash flow, it needed to meet our financial targets as well. When we analyzed projected growth, expense synergies and tax benefits, the transaction delivered an internal rate of return above our cost of capital, an attractive cash payback period and compared favorably to repurchasing our common shares.","MetLife Investment Management was another business we identified as a growth engine at our most recent Investor Day, and we will continue to grow the business organically while keeping an eye out for attractive acquisitions.","Before I close, I want to update you on our $3 billion share repurchase program, which is the largest in MetLife\u2019s history. Since we announced the program, we have bought back approximately $2.2 billion of our common shares and remain on track to fully execute the authorization by yearend. The reserve strengthening at Brighthouse Financial does not affect our current capital return plans.","During the second quarter, we repurchased $952 million of our common shares. Combined with our common dividend, we returned roughly $1.4 billion of capital to shareholders, which is close to 100% of the second quarter operating earnings.","In closing, we believe our transformation work combined with our capital return program will create significant value for shareholders.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John to discuss our Q2 financial results in greater detail.","John Hele","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I\u2019ll cover our second quarter results including a discussion of our insurance underwriting margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on potential impacts on separation as well as cash and capital.","In addition to our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement, last night, we released disclosure labeled 2Q17 Supplemental Slides that provide a walk from net income to operating earnings for the quarter. I will speak to these slides later in my presentation. We will continue to release supplemental slides when we have complex elements in a quarter.","Operating earnings in the second quarter were $1.4 billion or a $1.30 per share. This quarter includes four notable items totaling the negative $41 million that we highlighted in our news release and quarterly financial supplement. Adjusted for all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 3% year-over-year. On a per share basis, operating earnings adjusted for all notable items were $1.34, up 6% year-over-year.","Turning to our bottom-line results. We had second quarter net income of $838 million or $0.77 per share. Net income was $569 million lower than operating earnings, primarily because of net derivative losses of $284 million after tax and costs related to the Brighthouse Financial separation of $216 million after tax. For more details about the difference between net income and operating earnings, please refer to page three in our supplemental slide disclosure this quarter. Page four in the supplemental slides shows the attribution of the after tax net derivative loss.","I would highlight three main drivers. Number one, foreign currency derivative loss of $188 million after tax, primarily due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against several currencies including the euro, the British pound and the Canadian dollar. MetLife invests in non-U.S. bonds for our U.S. portfolios to provide enhanced risk diversification and incremental yield. These bonds are swapped back to the U.S. dollar, so they economically match the U.S. dollar liabilities they support. Since certain of these hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting, asymmetrical accounting treatment between the bonds and the related currency swaps drives volatility in our GAAP net income. Importantly, this FX volatility in GAAP does not exist in statutory accounting.","Number two. The VA hedge program accounted for an after tax loss of $340 million, mainly in Brighthouse Financial, including the $116 million related to asymmetrical and non-economic factors. Losses related to other risks were driven by the non-market drops in account value, primarily the deduction of fees. These losses were offset by number three, interest rate net derivative gain of $295 million after-tax due to the decline in long-term rates in the quarter.","Overall, $114 million of the $284 million net derivative loss was due to asymmetrical and non-economic accounting. Under U.S. GAAP, this continues to be a significant component of our derivative gains and losses each quarter as the derivatives are mark-to-market, but a significant portion of MetLife\u2019s VA and life liabilities are not. You can find the total impact of $203 million of adjustments for asymmetrical and non-economic accounting on our net income in the second page of tables attached to the press release.","Book value per share excluding AOCI other than FCTA was $51.03 as of June 30th, up 1% versus the sequential quarter as of March 31st. With respect to second quarter underwriting margins, total Company earnings were lower by approximately $0.02 per share versus the prior quarter, after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting in Brighthouse Financial accounted for approximately $0.05 of the total decrease. This was primarily due to the previously disclosed impact from the loss of the aggregation benefit in variable in universal life and the second quarter 2016 modeling changes.","Excluding Brighthouse Financial, underwriting earnings were higher by proximately $0.03 per share year-over-year, this is due to favorable underwriting in the U.S., primarily in group non-medical health and retail life within MetLife Holdings. The group non-medical health interest adjusted benefit ratio was 76.9%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 78.9% and within the 2017 annual target of 76% to 81%. Favorable underwriting results were primarily driven by dental.","MetLife Holdings interest adjusted benefit ratio for life products was $51.1%, driven by favorable mortality. This result was favorable to the prior year quarter of 59.4% after adjusting for notable items and below the targeted range of 53% to 58%.","Turning to investment margins. The weighted average of the three product spreads presented in our QSS was 150 basis points in the quarter, down 20 basis points year-over-year. Pre-tax variable investment income or VII, was $279 million versus $285 million in the prior year quarter, as lower prepayments were offset by stronger private equity performance. Product spreads excluding VII were 122 basis points this quarter, down 18 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline. Overall, lower investment margins in the quarter accounted for approximately $0.09 of EPS underperformance year-over-year.","The operating expense ratio in the current quarter was 22.0% and 21.1% adjusting for all notable items, benefitting from higher pension risk transfers sales and the sale of the MetLife Premier Client Group to MassMutual in the prior year. Operating expense margins, adjusting for all notable items, were less favorable to the prior year quarter by $0.02 per share. Costs associated with the build of Brighthouse Financial as a standalone company, higher variable expenses and a prior year adjustment which reduced employee benefits, were partially offset by lower operating expenses due to sale of MetLife Premier Client Group.","In regards to our unit cost initiative or UCI, our first half expense savings are generally in line with expectations. Consistent with prior guidance, as provided at our 2016 Investor Day, we believe full year 2017 UCI expense savings will be masked by the impacts of our onetime investments in stranded overhead with the net unfavorable impact to operating expenses of approximately $100 million.","Group Benefits reported operating earnings of $203 million, up 10% and 9% adjusting for notable items in the prior year quarter. The primary drivers are strong non-medical health underwriting and volume growth. Group Benefits operating PFOs were $4.2 billion, up 3% year-over-year, driven by growth across all markets. PFO growth was negatively impacted by the loss of a large dental contract in this quarter. Excluding this impact, PFO growth was 5% and at the high end of our guidance of 3% to 5%. Group Benefits sales were up 30% year-to-date with growth across all products. We continue to see particular strength in the jumbo market due to more quote activity and higher closing ratios, while persistency continued to be favorable.","Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, reported operating earnings of $268 million, up 3% due to reserve adjustment in the prior year quarter. Excluding all notable items, operating earnings were down 5% due to lower investment margins driven by continued spread compression. RIS operating PFOs were $1.2 billion, driven by two large pension risk transfers sales. Excluding PRT, PFOs were down 1% year-over-year. We continue to see a good PRT pipeline and expect 2017 to be an active year for transactions of all sizes. Our approach will continue to balance growth with an efficient use of capital.","Property & Casualty or P&C, operating earnings were $28 million, up $30 million compared to the second quarter of 2016, and up $15 million after adjusting for notable items in the prior year quarter. This result was due to improved auto underwriting, particularly offset -- partially offset by non-catastrophe weather losses in homeowners. Our P&C combined ratio excluding cats and prior year development with 88.2% better than the prior year quarter of 90.8%.","We continue to see improvement in our underwriting auto results, which posted a combined ratio excluding cats and prior year development of 94.2%, well below the 101.0% in the prior year quarter. Auto results have benefited from targeted rate increases over the last 12 months of 7% to 8%. And we expect to take similar rate actions in the immediate future. P&C operating PFOs were $887 million, up 1% year-over-year primarily the result of the auto rate increases. Overall, P&C sales were also up 1%, reflective of price increases and management actions to drive value.","Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $310 million, up 20% but down 4% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. Volume growth was offset by higher expenses and less favorable underwriting. Asia operating PFOs were $2.0 billion, down 1%, but up 1% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were down 4% on a constant currency basis, reflecting management\u2019s action to improve value in targeted markets.","In Japan, sales were down 5% as the shift to foreign currency whole life continued. FX life sales were up 43%, while yen life sales were down 66%. FX life sales accounted for 85% of total life sales in Japan this quarter. A&H sales in Japan were down 9% in advance of the introduction of our refreshed medical products Flexi S and Flexi Gold S, which were launched in July, which we expect will have improved sales in the second half of the year.","Emerging market sales in Asia were up 21%, driven by continued growth in China, following the successful launch of the whole new life critical illness product called Safeguarding Your Health, which is the first in the market to offer our full end-to-end health solution.","Latin America reported operating earnings of $154 million, up 12% and 14% on a constant currency basis, the key drivers were volume growth, lower taxes and higher investment margins. We expect lower operating earnings in the second half of the year as the full impact of the Provida fee reduction implemented in June takes hold and the favorable market performance in the first half returns to normal.","Latin America operating PFOs were $928 million, up 2% on both the reported and constant currency basis. This growth reflects the non-renewal of a low margin large group contract in the second quarter of 2017. Excluding this non-renewal, PFOs were up 8% driven by strong growth in Mexico. Total sales for the region were down 28% on a constant currency basis due to large employee benefit sale in Mexico in the prior year quarter. Excluding this employee benefit sale, sales were up 3%.","EMEA operating earnings were $72 million, up 13% and 24% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were favorable expense margins and underwriting. EMEA operating PFOs were $625 million, down 1% but 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in Turkey and employee benefits in the UK. Total EMEA sales decreased 5% on a constant currency basis, mainly due to competitive pressures in the Gulf as well as the recently exited Wealth Management business in the UK.","As a reminder, we had guided to flat EMEA sales in 2017, mainly due to uncertainty in the UK, following Brexit. Those challenges mainly related to low interest rates have proven to be server. While the Gulf has been a challenge, we continue to see strong growth in other parts of the Middle East, particularly Turkey and Egypt, and also in A&H business across the region, which now represents nearly a quarter of overall EMEA sales.","MetLife Holdings reported operating earnings of $235 million, compared to $33 million operating loss in the second quarter of 2016. The second quarter of 2016 operating loss was due to a $304 million negative impact, primarily from the separation related items and other insurance adjustments. Operating earnings in the second quarter of 2017 include a $40 million negative impact from separation related activities that was offset in Brighthouse Financial. Excluding notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 1%, driven by favorable equity market impact and underwriting, mostly offset by lower investment margins.","MetLife Holdings operating PFOs were $1.4 billion, down 17%, mostly due to the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group, which included the Company\u2019s affiliated broker dealer unit. As previously guided, we expect operating PFOs to decline by approximately 12% in 2017 versus 2016.","Corporate & Other reported an operating loss of $146 million compared to an operating loss of $243 million in the second quarter of 2016. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, the operating loss was $115 million compared to loss of $244 million in the prior year quarter, driven by a lower effective tax rate and favorable investment margins.","As for the Company\u2019s effective tax rate, it was 20.6% and 21.7% after adjusting for favorable tax audit in the quarter. We still expect the Company\u2019s 2017 effective tax rate to be between 21% and 22%, as previously guided. The primary reason for the company\u2019s low tax rate has been due to the tax preference items in the U.S. and foreign operations tax at lower rates in the U.S. tax rate of 35%.","Brighthouse Financial operating earnings were $283 million, down 5% or 31% after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. The decline in earnings when adjusted for notable items was primarily driven by lower net investment income from reduced interest rate, swap and securities lending books, lower universal life for secondary guarantees earnings after the model changes in the second quarter of 2016 and higher expenses. The higher expense activity is related to the build-out of Brighthouse as a standalone basis. As a standalone company, Brighthouse Financial expects corporate expenses to be $175 million to $225 million higher in initial year, post-separation as compared to the 2015 levels, as well as incremental interest expense from debt service.","Overall annuity sales were down 8%, and life sales were down 64%, mostly resulting from the sale of the MetLife Premier Client Group, in July of 2016. Sales of the Company\u2019s index-linked annuity product, Shield Level Selector, remained strong. In the second quarter of 2017, sales were $570 million, up 28% year-over-year and over $1 billion for the first half of 2017. As a reminder, Brighthouse Financial segment results within MetLife\u2019s financial statements do not match the financial statements of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and related companies shown in the most recent Brighthouse Financial Form 10, due to accounting timing differences.","Next, I would like to comment on some of the expected third quarter financial impacts, as a result of the Brighthouse Financial separation. The separation will result in Brighthouse\u2019s historical results being reported as discontinued operations. Upon separation, the remaining ownership interest in Brighthouse Financial will be accounted for under the equity method with changes in the fair value reported in net investment gains and losses. To give you an indication, if Brighthouse Financial closes at $70 per share at the end of the third quarter, we would anticipate realized losses of approximately $120 million post-tax. In addition, there are $800 million of losses post-tax related to intercompany transactions and tax-related items. Additionally, we anticipate an operating tax charge of approximately $200 million related to the repatriation of cash as a result of the separation, partially offset by a tax benefit associated with dividend from our foreign operations.","I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.6 billion at June 30th, which is up from $3.8 billion at March 31st. This increase reflects $615 million of net proceeds from the spin, as well as subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our quarterly common dividend, and other holding company expenses.","As announced in the MetLife and Brighthouse Financial Form 8-Ks filed last night, MetLife will receive a cash remittance of approximately $1.8 billion from Brighthouse Financial prior to the completion of the spin-off. This brings MetLife\u2019s total net cash remittance to $3.0 billion. Of the remaining $1.2 billion, $295 million was received in the fourth quarter 2016, $640 million received this quarter, the remaining relates to proceeds received from unwinding of certain reinsurance transactions, which we recognize at the holding company in 2018. This is lower than our initially planned range of $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion to adjust for Brighthouse Financial\u2019s planned reserve increases for refinements in legacy actuarial models. These refinements bring to a close an extensive internal and external review.","Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies including Brighthouse, preliminary year-to-date second quarter statutory operating earnings is approximately $1.8 billion, up 67% and preliminary net income is $538 million up 6%. MetLife\u2019s U.S. companies excluding Brighthouse preliminary statutory operating earnings were $1.9 billion, up 67% and preliminary net income was $1.4 billion, up 83%. Both are higher primarily due to favorable underwriting and lower expenses, partially offset by lower net investment income.","We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $26 billion as of June 30th, up 6%. MetLife\u2019s preliminary statutory adjusted capital was $20 billion, up 3% from December 31st, 2016 primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by dividend paid to the holding company. Brighthouse Financial expects, combined statutory total adjusted capital to be approximately $6.4 billion as of June 30th, an increase of $2.2 billion from March 31st. This increase was driven primarily by spin-off related transaction at the life holding companies including a $600 million capital contribution to Brighthouse Life Insurance Company on June 30th and proceeds to the Brighthouse bond offering.","Brighthouse Financial estimates that at June 30th, variable annuity assets above CTE95 would be approximately $2.3 billion pro forma for the separation. For MetLife Japan, the solvency margin ratio was 957% as of March 31st which is laid as public data.","Overall, MetLife had a strong second quarter in 2017, highlighted by favorable impacts in equity markets and solid underwriting in the U.S. as well as a continued focus on expense management. In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong and we remain confident that the actions we\u2019re taking to implement our strategy will drive free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value to our shareholders.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sean Dargan","Yes. Thank you and good morning. I have a question about the corporate segment. Results have been more favorable than I think were in most models, in the first and second quarters. How should we think about the timing of the expense initiatives? And just wondering if you can give any guidance for how corporate is going to play out the rest of the year?","John Hele","Hi, this is John. So, corporate does have volatility in tax from quarter to quarter. We assume it\u2019s [ph] onetime tax settlements that would be reflected in there that\u2019s why it\u2019s a bit lower this quarter, as well as timing. And as I said in my comments, issues of tax rate for the full year between 21% and 22%, I think that will be a model on track.","Sean Dargan","And then, a question about the competitive environment in group. We\u2019ve seen at least four to five carriers, all have very favorable risk results. Is this as good as it\u2019s going to get and is this the point where competitive pressures lead to some carriers starting cutting pressing?","Michel Khalaf","Hi, Sean. This is Michel. So, we\u2019re seeing -- the environment is competitive and life and disability, it\u2019s aggressive on the dental font. We remain disciplined in terms of our approach. And as you can see from our sales in the first half of the year, we have good growth across all segments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Tom Gallagher","John, the final adjustments that you highlight that are coming for the Brighthouse spend, can you just go through those again? Will all those hit GAAP net income, be [ph] OCI adjustments instead, and how many of those will actually have an impact on capital at RemainCo or will they largely be non-cash?","John Hele","So, these generally all flow through net income. And most adjustments I\u2019ve spoken about are non-cash items.","Tom Gallagher","And could you total those up again, I had trouble keeping track of those?","John Hele","Yes. Let me just flip to my page. So, as we announced in the 8-K, we expect $1.8 billion, which will come in today in cash from Brighthouse to MetLife holding companies. It brings the total to $3 billion, 3.0; of the remaining 1.2, 295 we got in fourth quarter 2016...","Tom Gallagher","No. John, sorry to interrupt you. I meant the charges that are coming in 3Q, not the cash payments.","John Hele","Okay. So, we first -- the first charge will be in the third quarter, will be reflecting the mark-to-market on our remaining shareholding in Brighthouse Financial. So, to give you a reference point of that that will get marked at the end of the quarter; it flow through net income. If Brighthouse closed at $70 a share, that\u2019d be $120 million post-tax, and delta $5 difference in that number would be about $75 million delta.","Tom Gallagher","Okay.","John Hele","If -- there will be another $800 million of losses post-tax, these are intercompany transaction and tax related items. The vast majority of those would be non-current cash impact, some are accounting adjustments. And the tax charges were not in the current taxpaying position. So, they would not be for the foreseeable future for at least the next five years impacting our cash position. I also mentioned that we anticipate an operating tax charge, approximately $200 million related to the repatriation of cash, as a result of separation, partially offset by tax benefit associated with dividends from our foreign operations. As part of the separation, we are bringing back -- we anticipate to bring back approximately $3 billion of foreign cash, so that generates the tax charge, but we\u2019ll get $3 billion cash back from the foreign holding companies to the U.S. and that\u2019s -- and we can do that in this quarter, related to the separation.","We\u2019re still evaluating and considering this point, but we wanted to give you a heads up on that. This will not change our [indiscernible] 23 election going forward.","Tom Gallagher","And then, Steve, just for a point of clarification, did you start up by saying you\u2019re targeting $800 million of after tax expense saves by 2020? I thought previously you said pretax.","Steve Kandarian","Pretax.","Tom Gallagher","Sorry, I thought you said after tax in your prepared remarks. So, it\u2019s still pretax?","Steve Kandarian","It is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Hi, thank you. I was just hoping you could provide a little bit more detail on what\u2019s driving the needs of the increased statutory reserves at Brighthouse, which block of business it relates to and why it\u2019s coming up now?","John Hele","Absolutely. So, first of all, this reserve charge that\u2019s mentioned in the Brighthouse 8-K, it\u2019s only statutory, there is no impact on GAAP on this and there is no impact to the rest of MetLife and all this, this is only a Brighthouse view. As you have seen by reading to the Form 10, it\u2019s been very extensive modeling on the variable annuity business. This charge does -- this reserve increase does reflect -- it is in the variable annuity business. We have had underway, in addition to all this modeling, a very extensive internal and external model review going on. And this is the end result to close out the final items of that. And we expect this reserve adjustment for the refinements will be a prior period adjustment and will be part of the second quarter statutory filing.","Erik Bass","Got it. And I\u2019d assume that this changes some of the sensitivities in other tables that are outlined in the Form 10. Do you have a plan or does Brighthouse have a plan to update those?","John Hele","No, this will not. Brighthouse will be in the exact same position because the smaller dividend coming up to us offsets that whole need. So, their current Form 10 is fully effective and all the numbers are fully applicable. And I want to reiterate that going forward, this dividend up from Brighthouse, none of this is in our free cash flow guidance that we\u2019ve given between 65% to 75% between 2017 and 2018; this is all in addition to that cash flow that we have. And we expect to still be in a very strong cash position and the fact that this is lower than what we had anticipated when we first started this project over a year ago is -- doesn\u2019t affect our current share buyback plans at all.","Erik Bass","Got it. And maybe last question sort of related to that. You mentioned bringing back the additional cash as well from the foreign subsidiaries. I guess, how do you bring up kind of total excess capital resources at the holding company and way sort of uses between -- obviously you are committed to maintaining the dividend and some delevering, but thinking about buybacks versus M&A or other uses with that excess capital.","John Hele","Well, our guidance for MetLife RemainCo is between $3 billion to $4 billion; we want to run with cash the holding companies. We\u2019re in a very strong cash position post all of these elements and all of these elements and continue to expect to pay a very strong dividend going forward. As Steve has always said, we believe any excess over our target that we need belongs to the shareholders or will be used for valuable, accretive and good acquisitions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Nadel","I have a couple of questions. So, I have, I guess a bit of theoretical question for you, Steve or John. Why not -- as part of separation of Brighthouse, why not take them all the way to the $3 billion cushion above the CTE95 level, let them return less capital to you guys and see that stock come out of the box with the capital management story that I assume would greatly, positively affect the valuation relative to where it stands right now?","Steve Kandarian","John, we work closely with our bankers in terms of trying to find the sweet spot, in terms of how much capital would be in Brighthouse, post-separation. And some of the factors included making sure that there was adequate capital for Brighthouse to operate over the long run. But, just the same as MetLife, not excess capital, that\u2019s not needed to run the business appropriately, given the hedging strategy going forward, given the business model that they have put together with respect to new business being written and so on. So, there was a lot of discussion, a lot of analysis around where that right number would follow, and that\u2019s what we came up with.","John Nadel","And then, John, I guess a question, inclusive of a few of these charges related to separation that we\u2019ll see in the third quarter. For RemainCo, can you give us a sense for making all of these adjustments? What is your estimate of what the book value per share ex-AOCI and ex-FCTAs will be? And I\u2019m coming up with something around $40 to $42 a share, is that reasonable?","John Hele","We\u2019ll have more details releasing that next week once the distribution is finalized and the pieces exactly are figured out. So, we\u2019ll have some better information early next week coming out to you on that John.","John Nadel","And I\u2019ve got one more if I could sneak it in. Just the $0.09 that you mentioned of year-over-year pressure from lower core investment spreads, how much of that was RemainCo versus Brighthouse and how should we think about that sensitivity for RemainCo after the separation?","John Hele","It\u2019s actually in both. I don\u2019t have the exact split on my fingertips here. But, I\u2019d assume it\u2019s pretty proportional. All of our portfolios are seeing some spread compression year-after-year as the portfolio runs off. And I think it\u2019s about half, yes, it\u2019s about half, half and half between Brighthouse and the RemainCo in terms of the split. So, going forward, if rates don\u2019t come up more, we will continue to see some pressure here. It\u2019s why we\u2019re taking cost out of the company, so that we can react to it and manage the company well going forward.","John Nadel","Okay. But all else equal, we can think about $0.04, maybe $0.05 a share on a year-over-year basis assuming rates don\u2019t move?","John Hele","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Seth Weiss","Yes, hi. Thank you. I just want to follow up on Corporate and may be just ask the question explicitly as it relates to guidance. Should we still assume that that $450 to $650 million loss in Corporate excluding the expense initiatives is a good guidance number for the full year? And then relatively, should we assume that $300 million of expense initiatives is also a good run rate for the full year, as you guided to in your outlook call?","John Hele","So, the range, 450 to 650 was excluding the expense initiatives, Seth. And right now, we\u2019d be toward the lower end of that range. And yes, we\u2019re still within our UCI guidance, generally.","Seth Weiss","Okay. And on Brighthouse, could you give any detail on how much the higher expense build was in the quarter there?","John Hele","Seth, let me just check on that and I can get back to you in a second.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR. Please go ahead.","Randy Binner","Good morning. Couple of quick follow-ups, first just to John Nadel\u2019s question. What exactly will be the timing and format of the restated numbers, post-spin?","John Hele","Let me answer the question that Seth had. It was a $15 million pretax, was a higher cost in the quarter from BHF. And we will have more guidance for you early next week. Once the spin is complete, we will have more information coming out for you on that.","Randy Binner","Okay. And then, I guess just jumping to pension closeouts, this is a little bit longer term question, but the activity there was good in the second quarter. Does your attitude or positioning either strategically or from a financial perspective change, now that Brighthouse is going to be spun out? Does that give you more risk tolerance to do more in the pension closeout area?","John Hele","As we\u2019ve mentioned when we talk about pension closeouts, we think this is a good growing business, but we actually have annual capital budget. We think on how to allocate to that business, and the spin-off of Brighthouse doesn\u2019t really affect how we think about that. So, we like the business, but we only put a certain percentage of our capital to that each and every year.","Randy Binner","Is that something that would be subject to review or is that kind of the final capital budget there?","John Hele","I think it\u2019s pretty much where we\u2019re. And of course, we look at it every year and we think about the opportunities and the margins available in that business versus other margins and other activities. We think we have a good balance today in how we do that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. On the third-party asset management side, you mentioned you want to grow it organically and maybe through M&A. Is there any area from a product perspective or geographic perspective that you\u2019re interested in taking a step at potential M&A?","Steve Goulart","Hi Humphrey, it\u2019s Steve Goulart. I think as we\u2019ve defined the strategy that we\u2019re pursuing in third-party asset management, it\u2019s pretty clear, we\u2019re drawing on our core capabilities and strength. And that really means emphasizing institutional fixed income and real estate asset classes. And so, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing so far. We\u2019ve grown the business very well on an organic basis, and we\u2019ve been looking opportunistically on ways to grow through acquisitions, and that\u2019s of course how we resulted in the acquisition of Logan Circle Partners. But again, it really is focused on fixed income assets for institutional clients and real estate. We think that\u2019s what core strengths off for now.","Humphrey Lee","So, given you\u2019re managing sizeable [indiscernible] for yourself to beginning with. So, looking at potential acquisitions, would you be taking more of bolt-on type, because you don\u2019t necessarily need to scale or do you guys just have a stronger appetite?","John Hele","As we look at acquisitions, they really are three criteria that we look out. One is it has to meet our financial criteria, and Steve talked about that too. We\u2019re very discipline financially. So, anything we look at, has to make sense from that perspective. Second, it goes to the strategy and I\u2019ve outline the strategy. So, it really is in institutional fixed income and real estate. And so, when we look at those, they tend to be things that go along well with what we\u2019re already doing, because we do want to try and achieve synergies on the revenue side, they\u2019re usually going to be some expense synergies. But we want to be able to grow the business synergistically as well. And then third is it has to fit culturally too. And we want to integrate this business, we don\u2019t believe that it should be run separately or businesses should be left outside of what we\u2019re trying to do in MetLife Investment Management. So, someone that meets those criteria which I think are high bars, that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath","Just on the Brighthouse mark that you talked about for the third quarter, is that going to be a quarterly event then, as long as you own these shares?","John Hele","Yes. It would be mark-to-market through net income each and every quarter as long as we own the shares. But, as Steve said, we are not trying to be long-term holders of these shares.","Suneet Kamath","And then that $3 billion of cash that\u2019s coming back to the U.S. that you talked about earlier. Was that contemplated in your free cash flow guidance for 2017 or is that incremental?","John Hele","It is already for cash flow, it\u2019s cash at the holding companies, you have a U.S. holding company and a foreign holding company. But, due to separation, we anticipate and we believe that this part could be brought back to the U.S.","Suneet Kamath","And just relatively, why would the separation in U.S. business impact some cash that\u2019s sitting outside U.S.?","John Hele","It\u2019s a total capital across the board, and the tax court does allow for such a repatriation with significant separation activities.","Suneet Kamath","So, just to be clear, was that number in your holding company cash and so holding company cash I think includes U.S. HoldCo and international HoldCo? I\u2019m just trying to figure out this is\u2026","John Hele","Yes. That is correct.","Operator","And I\u2019d now like to turn the call back to John Hall for closing comments.","John Hall","Great. Thanks everyone for joining us. And we\u2019ll speak again next quarter.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws, including statements relating to trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries.","MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.","Ed Spehar","Thank you, Greg. Good morning everyone, and welcome to MetLife's second quarter 2015 earnings call.","We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and our quarterly financial supplements.","A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.","Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia.","After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Kandarian","Thank you, Ed, and good morning everyone. We are pleased to report strong results for the second quarter of 2015. Operating earnings were $1.8 billion, up 11% from the second quarter of 2014. And operating earnings per share were $1.56, a 12% increase over the prior year period. Operating return on equity was 12.5% in the quarter, and tangible return on equity was 15.3%.","Second quarter results were negatively impacted by the strong dollar. Operating earnings grew 11% on a reported basis, and 16% on a constant currency basis. Favorable tax items, improvement in both investment and underwriting margins, and growth in this business more than offset the negative impact from foreign currency translation.","Investment margins remain healthy in the quarter with an average investment spread for U.S. product lines of 227 basis points, versus 215 basis points in the prior year period. This spread has been in the range of 210 to 240 basis points during the past few years, which highlights the resilience of our investment margins despite a multiyear period of low interest rates.","Underwriting margins were also favorable in the quarter. After adjusting for notable items, this is the fourth consecutive quarter that underwriting margins have improved versus the prior year period. In the second quarter, underwriting margins were better in Retail Life, Group Life, Group Non-Medical Health and Property Casualty.","Turning to regulatory matters, I will begin with a brief update on our appeal of the government's designation of MetLife as a Systemically Important Financial Institution or SIFI. Tomorrow the Financial Stability Oversight Counsel will file a brief opposing MetLife's motion for summary judgment, and supporting its own position. On August 21st, MetLife will file a final reply brief. At this time, the judge has not informed us whether she will be holding an oral hearing. And the timing of a final decision is difficult to predict.","With regard to capital rules, the passage of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act late last year provided flexibility for the Federal Reserve to develop rules appropriate for the business of insurance. The Federal Reserve is working on the required standards, and I am hopeful that those deliberations will lead to a suitable proposal. Developing an appropriate insurance capital standard in the United States is also important to informing the development of global capital standards. While the timing for producing a domestic capital standard remains uncertain, we believe global standards should not be finalized before a domestic standard is developed.","Upon completion, both standards should be tailored for the insurance business model. We are supportive of legislation that has been introduced to encourage greater transparency, and increased congressional oversight of U.S. participation in the international standard-setting process.","Another policy issue MetLife is following closely is the proposed fiduciary rule in the Department of Labor. While proponents argue the rule will help individuals save for retirement, we believe it will have the opposite effect by reducing choice, increasing cost, and limiting access to financial education and investment advice.","Wealthier investors may not be significantly impacted by the rule because their assets generate sufficient fees to pay for investment advice. However, assets of middle income investors are unlikely to generate fees sufficient to offset the higher costs of offering advice under this rule. Consequently, those consumers could find it difficult, if not impossible to receive face-to-face investment advice. The proposed rule is particularly problematic for individual annuities, which are the only products that provide consumers with a variety of benefits, including guaranteed return income they can never outlive.","The proposed rule effectively makes it a conflict of interest to sell your own products. Without substantial modifications, the proposal could force companies such as MetLife to choose between manufacturing individual annuities and distributing them. It is unclear what public policy goal is served by making it more difficult for companies to provide guaranteed retirement income to consumers.","MetLife submitted comments on the proposed rule to the labor department last week, and the department will be holding public hearings from August 10th through August 12th. We are confident that policymakers can find a way to protect the interest of consumers, while still preserving access to much needed retirement advice.","I would now like to comment on cash. As I said in MetLife's most recent annual report, we need to do a better job of generating free cash flow, which is the most important metric in determining a company's ability to return capital to shareholders.","I am pleased that the ratio of free cash flow to operating earnings has been on a upward trend, since 2012. And we remain confident in our target of 45%-55% for 2015 to 2017. Increasing the amount of cash generated by the business is an enterprise-wide imperative at MetLife. Our focus on cash is an extension of a strategy that we announced in May, 2012, which centered on improving our return on equity, while also reducing our cost of equity capital. We have successfully repositioned our business to achieve higher returns with lower risk. And are now working diligently to make sure the products we sell strike the right balance between returns, and cash generation.","I have three observations I would like to share with you related to this initiative. First, we are conducting a granular analysis of the cash and capital characteristics of our business. And in each segment that we have examined, we have identified opportunities for improvement.","Second, our goal is not maximum fee cash flow today, as that would mean foregoing attractive investment opportunities in the business. Our goal is to grow free cash flow over time. Third, while we are working toward a business model that will produce compelling growth in free cash flow, we also have the potential to optimize our balance sheet if MetLife's SIFI designation is overturned or the new capital requirements are reasonable.","Finally, I want to recognize the contributions of Bill Wheeler to the success of MetLife. As most of you know, this is the last earnings call for Bill, MetLife's President of the Americas region. As we announced in April, Bill is retiring next month after 17 years with the company. I want to take this opportunity to thank Bill personally for all that he has done to help MetLife and me over the years. Bill has contributed in numerous ways to MetLife's success. As Treasurer, he played a critical role in taking MetLife public, in 2000. As CFO, he helped guide the company safely through the financial crisis. And as President of the Americas, he restructured the U.S. retail business, and led our acquisition of Provida.","When I joined MetLife as Chief Investment Officer, in 2005, Bill did more than anyone else to help me learn the insurance business. Especially the liabilities side of the balance sheet. During my time as CEO, Bill has been a strong partner in developing and executing on our strategic plan.","Bill, on behalf of our employees, our customers, and our shareholders, thank you for all that you've done to make MetLife one of the greatest life insurance companies in the world.","In closing, MetLife had a strong quarter with double-digit operating EPS growth, despite ongoing pressure from low interest rates and a strong dollar. We continue to face regulatory uncertainty, but remain hopeful the outcomes will be manageable. Finally, we are focused on improving the cash flow characteristics of the business. An effort that we believe is necessary to maximize shareholder value.","With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?","John Hele","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our second quarter result, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses, and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.","Operating earnings in the second quarter were $1.8 billion, up 11% from the prior year period, and up 16% on a constant currency basis. Operating earnings per share were $1.56, up 12% from the prior year period, and 17% on a constant currency basis. This quarter included one notable item in our Asia business. As discussed on our first quarter earnings call, effective April 1st, the Japanese corporate tax rate was reduced from 31% to 29%. As a result, we've recorded a one-time tax benefit of $174 million in the second quarter. The operating earnings portion of the one-time benefit was $61 million, or $0.05 per share.","We estimate that the current year tax benefit from the rate reduction will be approximately $24 million in 2015.","Adjusting for notable items in the current and the prior year period, operating earnings were up 10% and 16% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers of growth on a constant currency basis were favorable investment margins, business growth, lower taxes, and under writing improvements. Higher expenses were a partial offset to these favorable items.","Turning to our bottom line result, second quarter net income was $1 billion or $0.92 per share. Net income was $723 million less than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative losses. These losses were driven by higher interest rates and weakening of the U.S. dollars against certain currencies.","The second quarter variance between operating earnings and net income includes asymmetrical and non-economic accounting of $856 million after tax. Net income adjusted for asymmetrical and non-economic accounting was above operating earnings primarily due to the portion of the onetime tax benefit in Japan, not reflected in operated earnings. Book value per share excluding AOCI, other than FCTA, was $50.73 as of June 30th, up 4% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $41.73 at June 30th, up 8% year-over-year. With respect to second quarter margins, we continue to see a good rebound in underwriting results, which were up approximately $0.03 per share after adjusting for notable items in the prior year quarter.","Underwriting improvement was primarily due to better mortality experienced in Retail Life, which returned to a normal level after adverse claims experience in the first quarter. Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 53.0%, within the expected range of 50%-55%, and favorable to the prior year quarter of 55.2%, after adjusting for a one-time benefit related to a disability waiver reserve. Average net claims from large based policies declined from an elevated level in the first quarter. The group life mortality ratio was 86.1% or toward the low end of the expected annual range of 85%-90%.","The ratio was favorable to the prior year quarter of 86.9%, due to the lower claims experienced across several products. The non-medical health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 80.5%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 82.8%, and within the targeted 77%-82%. Disability results improved year-over-year due to the lower incidence and severity, as well as higher net closure. In Dental, as anticipated, we saw higher utilization following low utilization in the first quarter. We believe the low utilization in the first quarter was a function of adverse winter weather. In Property and Casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 100.1% on retail and 96.0% in group.","The combined ratios excluding catastrophes were 80.2% in retail, and 85.5% in group. Overall P&C underwriting results improved versus the prior year due to the lower cat losses, and more favorable prior year development.","Turning to investment margin, the average of the four U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 227 basis points in the quarter. Higher recurring net investment income benefited from a conversion of the securities accounting system for the U.S. general account. And this contributed approximately 5 basis points to our product spread. ","Excluding this adjustment, the simple average was 222 basis points, up 7 basis points year-over-year due to higher variable investment income. Pretax variable investment income was $427 million, slightly above our 2015 quarterly guidance range of $325 million to $425 million. After taxes and the impact of DAC, variable investment income was $278 million, up $57 million versus the prior year quarter due to good performance across asset classes.","Product spreads excluding variable investment income and the accounting system conversion were 182 basis points, down 8 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Core yields declined as a result of the low interest rate environment. Average new money yield continued to run roughly 100 to 150 basis points below the average yield in the assets rolling off the portfolio.","With regard to expense, the operating expense ratio was 24.3%, unfavorable by 110 basis point to the prior quarter of 23.2%. Approximately half of this increase in the ratio was attributable to lower operating revenues from single-premium product. Sales of these products can fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter.","Expenses were elevated in the quarter due to higher costs within MetLife's employee benefits program, and higher regulatory costs. Expenses can be volatile for both of these categories. We would expect to see operating expense ratio improvement in the second half of the year relative to the second quarter. Gross expense saves were $262 million in the second quarter, and net saves were $194 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $33 million, and one-time cost of $35 million.","I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $690 million, up 2% versus the prior year quarter, and up 6% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in Retail was driven by favorable underwriting, and higher variable investment income. Life and Other reported operating earnings of $278 million, up 5% versus the prior year quarter, and 16% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were favorable underwriting, primarily in life, and higher variable investment income. Life and Other PFOs were $2.1 billion, essentially flat year-over-year as growth in the open block was offset by runoff of the closed block.","Core Retail Life sales were up 4% year-over-year driven primarily by an increase in Term life. Annuities reported operating earnings of $412 million, essentially flat to the prior year quarter. Higher variable investment income and lower taxes were offset by lower core spread, higher expenses, and a less favorable initial market impact.","Variable annuity sales were $1.9 billion in quarter, up 16% year-over-year and sequentially. We are seeing good traction with our new VA-guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, which was launched in February. We expect to see FlexChoice sales continue to grow in 2015, but at a less rapid pace than we had expected.","Also sales of single-premium immediate annuities are below our plan. As a result, we are lowering our expectation for total annuity sales growth in 2015, from more than 50% to more than 20%. GVWB reported operating earnings of $231 million, up 11% versus the prior year quarter, and 9% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Growth in the quarter was driven by underwriting improvement and business growth. GVWB PFOs were $4.4 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Sales were down 13% year-over-year as we were seeing an impact from an increasing competition, particularly in Dental.","Sales of voluntary products increased 22% due to growth in Accident & Health, and Property & Casualty. Corporate Benefit Funding reported operated earnings of $406 million, up 12% versus the prior year quarter, and 19% after adjusting for excess variable income in the prior year quarter. The key driver was an increase in investment margin.","CBF PFOs were $455 million, down 44% year-over-year due to lower pension closeouts, and structured settlement annuity sales. On closeouts we continue to see a good pipeline of small to mid-type cases. And we wrote a contract, in July, with over $500 million of premium. Latin America reported operating earnings of $116 million, down 15% from the prior year quarter, but up 3% on a constant currency basis. U.S. Direct, which included Latin America's result, had an operating loss of $20 million, versus $8 million in the prior year quarter. The loss this quarter was higher than expected due to business strain from strong sales, up 70%, and claims volatility in the quarter. We expect losses to moderate in the second half of the year.","Excluding U.S. Direct, Latin America operating earnings were up 13% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth partially offset by a less favorable market impact. Latin America PFOs were $1.1 billion, down 3%, but up 13% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth across the region. Total sales were down 40% on a constant currency basis primarily due to a large contract in Mexico in the second quarter of 2014. Excluding this contract, sales were up 4% versus the prior year quarter.","Turning to Asia; operating earnings were $425 million, up 31% from the prior year quarter, and up 45% on a constant currency basis driven by lower taxes as a result of the Japan tax rate change, and strong business growth across the region. Asia PFOs were $2.2 billion, down 4% from the prior year quarter, but up 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by a strong growth across all key markets. Asia sales were up 1% on a constant currency basis due to growth in Japan, and continued growth in the A&H sales across the region offset by a decline in retirement sales.","EMEA operating earnings were $50 million, down 31% year-over-year, and down 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for favorable tax items of $7 million in the prior year quarter, operating earnings were up 6% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth, particularly in the Gulf and the U.K.","EMEA PFOs was $658 million, down 8% from the prior year period, but up 10% on a constant currency basis. Total EMEA sales increased 7% on a constant currency basis due to strong growth in employee benefits and A&H sales across the region.","I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash in liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.2 billion at June 30th, which is up from 5.7 billion, at March 31st. This increase reflects subsidiary dividend, the repayment of senior debt, and the payment of our quarterly dividend. We also refinanced our $1.5 billion Series B Preferred Stock during the quarter. The lower dividend would generate approximately $19 million as savings on a full-year basis during the first 5-year fixed term of the securities.","Turning to our capital position; we reported U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the second quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin was 957% as of the first quarter of 2015, which is the latest public data.","For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary second quarter statutory operating earnings and statutory net income were approximately $900 million. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $28 billion as of June 30th, which was comparable to December 31st.","In conclusion, MetLife had a strong second quarter. Investment margins remain healthy, and underwriting improved year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remain strong, and we continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we seek to maximize shareholder value.","And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Eric Berg","Thanks very much. John, you have indicated that because of Met's status as what I believe is the only listed New York-domiciled life insurance so the only listed large New York-domiciled life insurer, the other big New York companies are mutuals of course, that you've accumulated substantial additional reserves above and beyond what would have been the case if you were, say, a New Jersey company or domiciled in any other state. What is the status of your efforts to -- not to release, but what is the schedule under which you would release these reserves in connection with the rise in interest rates?","John Hele","As a New York company and other NIC companies, we do annual cash flow testing. And these are typically done under the NIC guidelines set by the actuaries of the company and the chief actuary of the company signs off on how these reserves are tested. These are done every year at the -- based on the yields at the end of the year, and there are shocks down from there based on typically prescribed rates.","New York through prescribed letters they send to us each year suggest more conservative reserves often than our actuaries would set on a normal basis. And this is some of the additional reserves that we hold in New York. Of course, as interest rates rise slowly over time, and we continue to do the cash flow testing, some of the reserves that have been set up for lower interest rates would be released. But it depends each year on how New York suggests to us to set our assumptions for those reserves, and it would be released over time. Because often the reserve increases are over a period of time, or they could be immediate, so it depends on the type of testing that we are doing. So slowly over time the answer is how we would expect that some of this would be released as interest rates rise.","Eric Berg","One question for Steve to wrap up; Steve, you've said publicly that, and I won't quote you I don't remember exactly what you said, but I think the spirit of what you said is that I think you said at one of the conferences where you gave a presentation that you're feeling better than you have been feeling about the tone coming out of Washington, and the general outlook for, that you were hopeful about a reasonably positive outcome for Met and others with other systemically important financial institutions regarding capital requirements. What exactly is happening? What's the basis for your optimism or increasing hope that we're going to get a favorable outcome here? And am I characterizing your position, your thinking correctly? Thank you.","Steve Kandarian","Eric, we've been working closely with policymakers and regulators over the last several years since Dodd-Frank was passed. And the nature of our conversations and tone of our conversations provide me more optimism than I had, let's say, three or four years ago. But again, we try to be cautious in our optimism because obviously if we were to be too aggressive on capital management and the rules were disadvantageous to us, we would not want to have to go to the marketplace and raise large amounts of equity to meet rules that, again, we don't have yet in draft form.","So I am more optimistic that the conversations have developed over the years, where I think there's a better understanding of the insurance business model as compared to the banking model that regulators in Washington have historically been involved with. But the optimism is tempered by caution on our side in terms of being certain that we are well capitalized as these draft rules finally do come out at some point in the future.","Eric Berg","Okay thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger","Thanks, good morning. Steve, in the last call I think you said that you would evaluate potential buyback again in the back half of this year. Can you give us an update on how you're thinking about that?","Steve Kandarian","Sure, Ryan. If you recall, the second repurchase program that we've announced for the last year or so was announced in December, and began in January in terms of execution. So when we put that plan in place, we had an expectation that it would be completed by the fall of this year. As we had said, when we announced the plan, we would be opportunistic buyers of our stock. And you may recall that in the first part of the year our stock dropped a fair amount, and was below $50 a share for a period of time.","So that program was completed in three months, roughly, versus the time period we expected, which was really off into the fall. So our view now is that we will look at this again later in the year, as you mentioned. We'll have a conversation with our Board in the fall, and we'll make some decisions at that point in time.","Ryan Krueger","Okay, thanks. And then a question for Bill on the Group business, it seems like growth has decelerated a little bit. Can you talk about the dynamics there and your outlook for growth?","Bill Wheeler","Sure, Ryan. Well, I think there's a couple of things going on, one is, in certain segments of the market, especially I think the dental business I think the competitive environment has gotten more challenging. And I think that therefore our wins on new businesses are lower than they otherwise might be.","Secondly, remember, we've been being pretty aggressive about renewals and new business in our disability area, feeling that we needed to kind of catch up a little bit on our pricing. And I think that's depressed sales a little bit in disability. You can certainly see it in numbers. Our disability new sales are pretty low.","Renewals are good in terms of we're getting our price on renewals, but the new business we're getting is pretty low. So I think those two factors are causing the premium growth in the group business to be a little lower than you might otherwise expect.","Ryan Krueger","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. The first question is just on interest rates. I think when you had given guidance or targets for the various businesses you had assumed a 10-year treasury yield of around 2.8% by the end of the year. So assuming if rates stay where they are through the next few months of the year, how much of a downside risk is that to your targets? And are there things in the business that are going better than expected that maybe might help offset some of the weakness? And then also I had a question on the hedge for Asia earnings. I think last time you had mentioned that about two thirds of the 2015 income was hedged at a rate of JPY107 to the dollar. But I wanted to see if there's a change in that.","John Hele","Let me do the -- it is John. Let me do the Japan hedges first. We've actually increased our hedges. So we're now a 100%, and for 2015 the strike is at 107. And we've extended it out to 2016 as at 108, and the 2017 is at 122. And we've fully hedged all Yen earnings from Japan.","Jimmy Bhullar","Through 2017? Fully hedged through 2017, you said?","John Hele","Oh, well, as we get further out, it maybe between 85 to 100.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay.","John Hele","Yes. And I'm sorry, your first question, you wanted interest rates\u2026","Jimmy Bhullar","So just on interest rates, how much of a risk is the current level of rates if we stay here through the end of the year versus your guidance or target that you had assumed of 2.8%, how much of a risk is that to your returns overall?","John Hele","Well, we gave some sensitivities in our 10K. That shows by segment how things moved compared to a stress down compared to what our plan is at. So I would point you towards that. Let me also point out it's not just the long end moving up, we are sensitive a bit to the short end, because we had a very steep short yield curve, and so we benefited over the last few years from better earnings and securities lending. And that's impacted where we have asset intensive businesses in particular. We've seen a benefit from that in CBF over the past few years, maybe slightly higher earnings than people had thought, but that's because the short end of the curve was down. So it really depends on what's going to happen here, but I point you back to the 10K, because there would be some sensitivity there for you to analyze.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And lastly, Steve you mentioned the DoL standard briefly, besides the annuity business, is there risk in other parts of the business because of at least what the preliminary standards look like?","Steve Kandarian","Jimmy, it's largely the annuity business that we're focused on in terms of the DoL rule.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. John, your comment that you're now targeting variable annuity growth of greater than 20% from the old guidance of greater than 50%, what's driving that? Is that DoL fiduciary standards related? Can you give some color there?","Bill Wheeler","Tom, it's Bill, I'll take that one. It doesn't have anything to do with the DoL. It really is just the pace of adoption of the new product versus what we had assumed in our plan for this year. Remember, this is a different type of rider, right? It's not just that we've tweaked the features a little bit. It's the withdrawal benefit versus a GMIB. And so I think that that's causing adoption to be a l slower than we had assumed as producers get more comfortable with the product. We've seen this phenomenon before with our indexed annuity product called Shield. Sales were lower for a while than we had originally thought, and now they are seeming to accelerate now that we have had the product out for a little over a year. And we probably should have been a little smarter about how the pace of adoption here. We do, and I think John alluded to this, we do expect to see increasing sales of FlexChoice in the latter half of 2015.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, and Bill, just a follow-up on that related to DoL, so if the proposal does get past without any we will call it meaningful changes, how big of an impact do you see this being for the VA industry overall from a sales standpoint? Is it a game changer? Do you see it being meaningful or manageable?","Bill Wheeler","It's hard to make that call. It's obviously going to be meaningful. A lot of it will ultimately depend on what exemptions the DoL allows down the road. Remember, a lot of their rulemaking is really built on exemptions to existing policies. And it's hard to know if this is at the end of the day more of a disclosure issue, or how behavior is really going to change.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Seth Weiss","Hi, thank you, good morning. Steve, I wanted to follow-up on your comments on cash flow and capital. You commented on granular analysis of improving capital characteristics in certain segments. Could you give a little bit more color on some of the specific areas for improvement that you have already identified?","Steve Kandarian","That was still in the early stages of the analysis, and what we'll be doing as a company is looking at various parts of the business, and then making some decisions and tradeoffs, meaning, some parts of the business we'll try to accelerate, other parts of business we'll have to redesign some products to make it more efficient from a cash perspective. So the work that we're doing really is interactive between all parts of the company. And we're not yet at the point where it made found decisions about any one part of out business. So it would be premature for me at this point to say what we'll be doing in terms of specific products, and essentially signal something before we really have completed our analysis.","Other companies have engaged in this type of analysis before, and particularly European companies. It was a multiyear process that they went through. We're trying to accelerate that process, kind of learning from what others before us have done to shorten the timeframe, but it's not something that gets done in one or two quarters.","Seth Weiss","Okay, thank you. And then on comments in terms of if SIFI either is overturned or rules come in less onerous than feared you commented on maximizing the balance sheet. Just curious if this specifically means more share repurchases as we all think about it or if there are other tools in terms of maximizing the balance sheet beyond simply share repurchase, increased dividends.","Steve Kandarian","Well, we look at share repurchases, we look at dividends, we look at acquisitions as all valid uses of any excess capital that we hold. And at the point in time when we have greater clarity about the found decision on our judicial appeal in the capital rules for non-bank SIFIs, we'll look at the landscape at that point in time and make a decision about where we utilize our capital.","Seth Weiss","Okay, so this is utilization of capital, not really structure of the balance sheet?","John Hele","Hi, Seth this is John. It may also be how we think about our balance sheet. We have been over the past few years essentially de-leveraging. We've had less debt equity ratios. And that's been improving each and every period. And the question will be if we were free of the SIFI, what is the best balance sheet, and that could include debt, it include preferreds. I mean we have to rethink all that. We've been conservative so far. So we have maximum flexibility kind of what the SIFI rules are, because there could be Tier II, and it could be more complex, and might be different, so that we've been deliberately being a little underlevered [ph] compared to some of our targets, so that we have this flexibility. But when we're out of this one way or the other we'll optimize our balance sheet for the best returns, for the shareholder with a conservative for our safety for all of our customers.","Seth Weiss","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Hi, thank you. Can you talk a little bit more about the sales trends in Latin America? It looks like even adjusting for the Mexico Group case growth has slowed a bit there. And maybe also put into context how much the U.S. Direct business is contributing to sales?","Bill Wheeler","Yes, sure. Erik, it's Bill, I'd hate to just look at any one quarter and add a context in Latin America, and say, \"Geez, it's look like things are slowing down.\" I don't really think that's the case. For instance, the sales were a little suppressed this quarter relative to what we would normally expect our sales growth is. But if you look underneath, what you'll see is our Mexican AFORE, which is the private pension system in Mexico is, sales are much lower there. There have been certain sales practice changes, which makes switching between accounts much less prevalent for AFORE providers. And so gross sales, I'd say, are much lower, but at the same time retention rates are higher.","Maybe a better indicator of sort of what's really going on in Mexico or in Latin America is just PFOs. On a constant rate, PFO growth this quarter was 13%. And that's right where we would expect it to be. Things will move up and down in Latin America over time, but I'd say the growth trend is still in place.","Erik Bass","Got it. And then on the Direct side or that's probably still small piece of sales now, but if you can talk about how that's trending? I think you said that the level of investment spending will go down in the second half of the year and then obviously off the variable cost as sales come through.","Bill Wheeler","Yes, so Direct is a start-up. It's still I'd say this is a -- I'd call this is a transitional quarter in that we had some small reserve adjustments. They had a couple of bad homeowner's claims. We do sell Auto and Homeowners direct through that channel. And we clearly had some growth strain, because year-over-year premium growth or sales growth is 70%, which obviously I don't think we're going to continue to grow at that rate, but we're growing this business. We think that in the second half of the year there will still be operating losses, but they will be much less than what we reported in the second quarter.","And the other thing I'd say is this business is just -- if the model is coming together in that, we're seeing our mortality experience begin to improve, our retention rates are beginning to improve, so I think the trends are all in the right direction.","Erik Bass","All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","John Nadel","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe, Bill, just a follow-up on a response to an earlier question about increasing competitive pressure in the Group Insurance side, I think you mentioned certain segments -- is it fair to assume that you're talking about the large case market given that's where I think Met's prevalence is, or is there more to add there?","Bill Wheeler","Yes, well, I think I talked about the Dental business. Dental business is actually, well, what we would mid case. I think the rest of the industry calls that large case, but we're talking under between 1000 and 5000 lives. We're seeing just a little context here, John. MET is the largest for-profit dental insurer provider in the United States. So we're the market share leader. People come at us from time to time. We're currently seeing that in the mid-market. We tend to just be very disciplined about this. Dental margins are generally pretty thin to begin with. So we'll let that business go, and it will probably come back around within a year or two.","John Nadel","Got it. And then bigger picture on the Group Insurance side, you guys are the largest non-medical insurer in the U.S. I think by just about any metric. I'm curious what opportunities do you believe may develop given the ongoing consolidation that we're seeing amongst the largest medical insurers in the US. Are you seeing any ramifications from that currently in the market? And I guess over the next couple of years as this all figures its way out do you think it will result in any strategic opportunities for MET including the potential to acquire non-medical operations from these medical providers?","Bill Wheeler","Well, most of these big medical carriers do sell life, disability, dental, and it's a bit of a -- it's obviously not the remaining focus. So the logic has always been maybe they'll as they continue to get more focus on the medical side of the benefits equation that they'll potentially divest. We haven't really seen much of that happen, though that's always been the theory. So I guess the potential is always there that there might be some strategic opportunities, but I think we're just going to have to wait and see.","John Nadel","Okay, so nothing yet. And in terms of the immediate response in the market, is there anything really coming up as a result of this?","Bill Wheeler","No, other than I think the intermediaries are all very distracted right now dealing with all the consolidation both in health insurance and in commercial line.","Q \u2013John Nadel","Got it, thank you. And then just a real quick one for you, Steve; given Bill's retirement next month, I was wondering if you could update us on what kind of management structure you expect to have in place over the Americas.","Steve Kandarian","John, we haven't made any decisions on that.","John Nadel","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb","Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us your thoughts on potentially reinsuring out guaranteed living benefits on the variable annuity portfolio given what we've seen in terms of trends in the marketplace among some other major annuity writers.","John Hele","Hi, Jay, it's John. So up till now the deals that have been done have been on WBs not on IBs. So much of our in-force, and we had been selling until recently are IBs. We look and evaluate these. I think they share 50% of the risk to the reinsurer on this. And of course we're always evaluating the cost benefit of all of these ideas. We haven't done a transaction as of yet.","Jay Gelb","Okay. And then a separate issue for you, John. How should we think about the share count for the full year? So if you make a simplifying assumption that there's no more share buybacks for the remainder of 2015, can you given the exercise or issuance of stock-based compensation where would you see share count ending out for the year on a fully diluted basis?","John Hele","Well, I think if you go back over the past years and look at the issuance of share account and the timing of that by quarter to see how the large amounts are exercised and are issued for our employee benefit programs, and of course individual exercising is hard to predict, if that makes some material difference, usually it doesn't. And then we've got any buyback activity, which again Steve's mention would be reevaluated and looked at and discussed with the board this fall. But you can look back to historical patterns. I don't have it at the top of my head. But you can see it year-by-year.","Jay Gelb","It's typically way towards 4Q, right?","John Hele","I don't think so, I think it will be more in the first half of the year when we do our big awards, but again, you just go back and check. You can see it quarter-by-quarter.","Jay Gelb","Will do. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning. Steve, you had mentioned looking at free cash flow optimization and I guess considering the fact that we've seen a lot of appetite coming in from overseas insurers for U.S. businesses. Would you consider selling U.S. businesses if you deemed them not free cash flow friendly or not free cash flow oriented?","Steve Kandarian","Well, again Yaron, we haven't made any firm decisions, but everything is on the table in terms of how does analysis comes out. Certain things will want to do more of. Some things will do less of. Some businesses will have to redesign their products. And we don't rule out selling businesses.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And then you had mentioned that Dental utilization was a bit high in the second quarter just catching up on weather in the first quarter. I think that last year we saw a similar pattern but that also [technical difficulty] where utilization was still a little bit high. Do you see that being the case this year again?","Steve Kandarian","Yaron, I'm not sure if it will or not. It looks very similar to the experience we had last year, where of course we had two bad winters in a row. I will say this Dental utilization if you look at the first six months is right on plan. And so my expectation is that it will \u2013-- the third quarter will probably moderate. But you can't get surprised here a little bit.","Q \u2013Yaron Kinar","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kovac from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Kovac","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wondering going back to the Department of Labor fiduciary standards, if the rule is passed in a way that it looks today what sort of impacts would you expect on the way that you compensate producers for variable annuities that you're selling? And then also on that can you give us a sense of the percent of variable annuities that you sell in retirement versus non-retirement?","Bill Wheeler","Sure. I think what you meant in your second question is how much your variable annuities do you sell on qualified plans. It's all retirement, right?","Michael Kovac","That's right.","Bill Wheeler","But it's about 70% of our VAs today are sold in group qualified assets. And so it's an issue for us. Today we have already changed our compensation policies a couple of years ago to, I'd say, equalize comp between proprietary and non-proprietary annuities for our producers. That's kind of a bridge we've already crossed. With that said, we might still have to make other compensation adjustments to our producers based on how the DoL rule comes out. But I think we feel like we've already made -- we've already climbed part way up that hill.","Michael Kovac","Great, thanks. And then John mentioned conversion of a securities accounting system contributed about I think five basis points was the number. Can you describe in a little more detail what's going on there and if there's any continuation from that going forward?","John Hele","Hi, this is John. Yes, we convert over to a new accounting system from investment portfolio. And we do it for the U.S. portfolio this past quarter. As you can imagine with the size of our U.S. portfolio, small little rounding and different slight different impacts in amortization can have an impact. The impact we mention this quarter is a one-time event.","Michael Kovac","Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Sean Dargan","Yes, thanks and good morning. I just want to come back to the DoL proposal one more time. And I'm just wondering what the proposal if enacted as proposed would do to lapsation rates in variable annuities? And where I'm going with this is that perhaps contract holders are not turned into new contracts when the penalty period expires as often. Is that something that you're concerned about?","Steve Kandarian","We probably have mixed feelings about that, Sean. Obviously we like, as a general rule, we like low lapse rates. There is some of the in-force where the guarantees are relatively high, and some of our competitors from time to time have actually tried to buy out that business with policyholders. We've not done that by the way.","A little bit of it will depend I think in terms of the macroeconomic factors. If interest rates go up, we feel a lot better about our GMIB in-force. And I'd think in general we would then think lower lapse rates would be a pretty clear in that positive for the annuity business for Met. So I don't think that's going to be a big driver for us. I don't that will end up being much of an issue.","Sean Dargan","Okay, thanks. And just one follow-up about your focus on cash and cash flow generation, is that at odds or is that on the same page with how the Fed is thinking to the extent that you've had discussions with the Fed about your strategy to focus on cash flow?","Steve Kandarian","This is unrelated to the Fed.","Sean Dargan","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Lee","Thanks, good morning. Just a question about the spread compression that we're seeing in annuities, the base spread came down around 27 basis points and my understanding is that's in part because of some of the interest rate protection rolled off in the quarter. How should we think about the rolling off schedule of your interest rate hedges and this kind of 20 basis point impacts that we've seen in the second quarter would that be an ongoing thing? I guess in a sense how are those kind of interest rate hedges contracts were staggered throughout over the next several years?","Bill Wheeler","Humphrey, I apologize. I'm not sure I got all your question, but I think I got the just of it. So yes, there was an investment margin decline in the annuity business this quarter. And yes, it was driven by the maturity of a particular interest rate floor. MET had well over a decade ago, or roughly a decade ago had invested a lot of interest rate floors for just the kind of scenario that we've gone through. Those are starting to mature now, and therefore -- because interest rates are still low, our margins are starting to decline as they lapse.","So we had a decent-sized one that was supporting the annuity business lapses mature this quarter. So that investment margin that we lost there is permanent, right? It's not going to come back. And these things will continue to mature over the next number of years. So depending on what happens to interest rates that will obviously -- could have an impact on our interest margins in another part of the company.","Humphrey Lee","So you've had [technical difficulty] matured in this quarter but [technical difficulty] going to be every quarter we'll see a 20 basis point impact but more like depending on the schedule. And then in that case can you maybe give us a sense of how like when will we see maybe another big one that will be maturing?","Bill Wheeler","I don't remember when the next one comes. We know there's not another one coming up this year, for instance. There's not going to be any more maturities of floors coming up this year I think. I can't quite recall when the next one is coming up.","Humphrey Lee","Okay, thanks. And then, just one quick follow-up on John's comment earlier about high expenses in the quarter related to regulatory expenses. Can you give us a sense of how much was that in the quarter?","Steve Kandarian","Well, as I said about, half of the higher ratio was due to lower PFOs and single premium sales, and either half was due to expenses.","Humphrey Lee","But in terms of that expenses is what portion is related to regulatory-related expenses versus other things?","Steve Kandarian","There were some pieces within that, and they're all split between three different items.","Humphrey Lee","Okay, thanks.","Ed Spehar","Okay. We are past the top of the hours. Thank you very much for your participation. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.","Steven A. Kandarian","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year results for 2013. Fourth quarter operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 14% from the fourth quarter of 2012; and operating earnings per share were $1.37, a 10% increase over the prior year period.","Growth in the per share basis was dampened by the conversion of equity units issued in 2010 to fund the acquisition of Alico. Operating return to equity was 11.5% in the quarter. Full year 2013 operating earnings were $6.3 billion, an 11% increase over 2012; and operating earnings per share, which were also affected by the conversion of equity units, were up 7% from the prior year period. Operating return on equity for the full year 2013 was 12% or at the low end of our 2016 goal of 12% to 14%.","Operating earnings benefited from the favorable capital markets environment last year. Equity market performance added 50 basis points to return on equity in 2013 and above planned variable investment income added 40 basis points. In addition to strong variable investment income, recurring investment margins were above our expectations, with the favorable variance equating to 50 basis points on 2013 operating ROE. Together, recurring investment margins and variable investment income explain the resilience of MetLife's investment spreads despite a prolonged period of low interest rates.","Recurring investment margins have benefited from effective asset liability management and income from derivatives, many of which were purchased in the mid-2000s to protect earnings under a low interest rate scenario. However, there were also factors that depressed operating ROE in 2013. The combination of weaker-than-anticipated underwriting results, elevated legal costs and some pressure from currency weakness exerted a drag on ROE of almost 100 basis points. While MetLife's results benefited from a favorable capital markets environment in 2013, achieving the low end of our 2016 operating ROE target 3 years early is nevertheless a noteworthy accomplishment.","MetLife's financial performance last year highlighted the strength of our diversified business model. In addition, I believe the quality of MetLife's operating return on equity has improved because the upward trend in ROE has been accompanied by a decline in balance sheet leverage. Operating return on equity increased from 9.8% in 2010 to 12% in 2013, while the ratio of common equity to assets increased from 8.1% at year end 2010 to 9.9% at year end 2013. This ratio, which excludes separate account assets and the impact of accumulated other comprehensive income, is one way to look at leverage. We believe it is appropriate to exclude separate accounts from the leverage calculation because the investment risks and rewards of these assets are borne by the contract holders.","To the extent there is a guarantee in these contracts, the associated reserves are held outside of the separate accounts. These reserves and the related capital are included in the leverage ratio calculation. We have taken a cautious approach to balance sheet leverage because of uncertainties surrounding potential capital requirements, if MetLife is designated a nonbank systemically important financial institution or SIFI. In particular, we are concerned about the risk of bank-centric capital rules. MetLife remains under Stage 3 review by the Financial Stability Oversight Council for potential designation as a SIFI, and the timing of the decision from FSOC remains unknown. We believe the evidence clearly demonstrates that we do not pose a threat to the financial system of the United States. At the same time, we continue to make the case that, if designated, applying bank-centric capital rules to the business of insurance would constrain our ability to issue guarantees and increase the cost of financial protection for consumers.","Turning to our strategy. We made significant progress in 2013 on our efforts to shift MetLife's business mix away from capital-intensive, market-sensitive products to our protection-oriented products. Our full year 2013 variable annuity sales of $10.6 billion were down 40% and were consistent with the $10 billion to $11 billion target we provided in December of 2012. In contrast, emerging market sales, which consist predominantly of protection-oriented products, rose 28% in our Europe, Middle East and Africa segment and 18% in Latin America.","2013 was also a good year for our strategy to grow emerging markets. In addition to a significant increase in sales, we expanded our geographic footprint through partnerships and acquisitions in Asia and Latin America. In December, we reached a deal to acquire a stake in the insurance business of AMMB, Malaysia's fifth largest bank. The deal complements agreements reached earlier in the year to enter fast-growing markets in Vietnam and Myanmar.","In Latin America, we successfully completed our acquisition of Provida, the largest pension plan administrator in Chile. The earnings contribution in the quarter from Provida, which closed on October 1, was in line with our plan, and our outlook for earnings remains $190 million to $210 million for 2014. The acquisition of Provida is a great example of what we believe is a prudent approach to capital management given the uncertain regulatory environment. We used cash to acquire a fee-based business with limited market sensitivity and strong free cash flow. We priced the acquisition to create value based on our stock price in the high-30s, so the assumed cost of capital was higher than it is today. I also want to provide a framework for how we think about share buybacks versus dividends during this period of regulatory uncertainty.","We are not repurchasing shares at this time because we want to avoid the potential need to issue equity if there is an adverse regulatory outcome. With regard to the dividend, however, an increase typically represents a much smaller dollar commitment than a share buyback. For example, even though we increased our dividend almost 50% last year, a sizeable move because we have not raised the dividend since 2007, the incremental annual capital outlay was only $400 million. It is our practice to review MetLife's dividend policy with the Board of Directors annually.","Finally, I want to comment on recent concerns about volatility in emerging markets and the potential impact on MetLife's earnings. Recent turmoil in certain emerging markets does not change our view of the long-term attractiveness of our emerging markets business. Nothing has changed regarding the key macro drivers of middle-class growth and low levels of insurance penetration. Also, we believe that reforms instituted since the crises of 1990s should lead to less volatile economic cycles in emerging markets. These reforms include floating currencies, more independent central banks and better banking regulation. In addition, we believe emerging market sovereign debt is less risky today as a result of reduced external ownership, more longer-dated maturities and less reliance on foreign currency denominated funding. Volatility in emerging markets could mean more currency translation risks in the near term, but we expect the immaterial earnings impact relative to our plan for 2014.","Our exposure to a diversified basket of currencies explains a limited risk from recent moves in exchange rates. For example, the largest currency exposure in EMEA is the euro, which has strengthened modestly relative to the U.S. dollar for the year-to-date.","As I said in the third quarter earnings call, we know we must accept risk to earn an appropriate return for our shareholders, but determining the type of risk is a critical management decision. On balance, we believe the emerging market risk is acceptable for MetLife because it is diversifiable and the products sold in these markets generally have more favorable risk return profiles and growth outlooks than those sold in developed markets.","In closing, let me reiterate that 2013 was a strong year for MetLife. Full year operating earnings were up 11%, which followed the increase of 22% in 2012. Operating ROE improved from 9.8% to 12% over this 2-year period. While regulatory uncertainty remains a challenge, we feel very good about our fundamental business prospects.","With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele, to discuss our financial results in detail. John?","John C. R. Hele","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our fourth quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.","As Steve noted, MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.6 billion, up 14% year-over-year; and operating earnings per share of $1.37, up 10% year-over-year. This quarter included a few notable items: First, pretax variable investment income was $460 million, reflecting strong private equity and hedge fund returns, as well as higher mortgage and bond prepayments. After taxes and the impact of DAC, variable investment income was $296 million, which was $101 million or $0.09 per share above the top end of our 2013 quarterly guidance range.","The second item relates to the strengthening of our asbestos litigation reserves, which reduced operating earnings in Corporate & Other by $101 million or $0.09 per share. As noted on the December outlook call, we have asbestos litigation reserves as a result of claims related to certain research and other activities by MetLife from the 1920s to the 1950s. As the frequency of severe claims related to asbestos has not declined as expected, additional reserves were required.","The third notable item relates to an increase in other litigation-related reserves, which reduced operating earnings in the Americas by $46 million or $0.04 per share.","The final notable item -- items were in our P&C business and EMEA. In our P&C business, we had a $15 million benefit from favorable prior year reserve development and lower-than-budgeted cat losses, while EMEA had an $11 million benefit from tax-related items. In total, these 2 items increased operating earnings by $26 million or $0.02 per share.","Turning to our bottom line results. Fourth quarter net income was $877 million or $0.77 per share and included net derivative losses of $242 million after tax. The net derivative losses in the quarter were driven primarily by 3 items that we consider to be either noneconomic or a cause of asymmetrical accounting treatment: number one, an increase in interest rates; number two, changes in foreign currencies, principally the strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the yen; and number three, the MetLife own credit impact associated with our VA program.","Changes in interest rates in the quarter contributed slightly to more than 50% of the net derivative losses, while foreign currency in MetLife's own credit impact combined for most of the remaining balance. The combination of these derivative losses and other asymmetrical accounting impacts explains most of the difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $48.49 at December 31, up 1% from $47.99 at September 30.","Turning to fourth quarter margins. Underwriting in the U.S. improved on a year-over-year basis but was less favorable than planned. The mortality ratio in group life was 87.9%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 84.6%, which included a benefit of 2.7 points from 2 nonrecurring reserve refinements. The ratio this quarter was within the target range of 85% to 90%.","The mortality ratio in Retail Life was 74.8%, better than our expectation and the 99% ratio in the fourth quarter 2012, which experienced a number of high face amount claims. The mortality ratio this quarter reflects favorable direct mortality results and the benefit of nonrecurring items. However, mortality earnings were not as strong as the direct mortality ratio would suggest because the favorable experience was concentrated in claims that were more heavily reinsured.","The nonmedical health benefit ratio was 90.8% favorable to the prior year quarter of 91.6%, but worse than our plan and just above the top end of the target range of 86% to 90%. The shortfall versus planned was caused by an increase in utilization in dental and lower-than-expected offsets in our open block of long-term disability claims. Disability incidents and closure rates were within expectations.","In our P&C business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 88.6% for retail and 97 -- 93.7% for group. Year-over-year results were slightly better in both Retail and group versus the prior year quarter, which was adversely impacted by Superstorm Sandy. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 85.2% in Retail and 92.9% in group.","Moving to fourth quarter investment margins. The simple average of the 4 U.S. product spreads and our quarterly financial supplement was 241 basis points, including variable investment income; and 199 basis points, excluding VII. This result showed only a modest decline versus the prior year quarter of 246 basis points, including VII; and 206 basis points excluding VII. The story is generally the same on a full year basis. As Steve mentioned, the resiliency of our investment spreads is attributable to effective asset liability management, good variable investment income and income from derivatives.","With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 25.4% in the fourth quarter as compared to 22.4% in the year ago quarter. Adjusting for the onetime asbestos and other litigation-related expenses, the normalized operating expense ratio was 23.7%, in line with our expectations but still slightly higher than the prior year quarter. There were several factors that contributed to the higher ratio this quarter, including opportunistic reinvestment in the business such as higher advertising and IT projects. In addition, costs associated with new business such as Provida and U.S. Sponsored Direct, as well as the impact of lower closeouts, higher pension expenses and timing of certain items contributed as well.","For the full year of 2013, the operating expense ratio was 24.3% versus 23.8% for 2012. Excluding the negative impact from the asbestos and other litigation-related items, the expense ratio would have been 23.8%, equal to the prior year and slightly better than our full year plan. For 2013, gross expense saves were $571 million, which is consistent with the target we discussed on our December outlook call. Net saves were $332 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $56 million and onetime cost of $183 million. Overall, we are pleased with our expense performance as we remain on track to deliver gross saves of $770 million to $800 million in 2014 and $1 billion in 2015 and net saves of $600 million in 2015.","I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $658 million, up 4% versus the prior year quarter and up 15% when adjusting for notable items in both periods, including net positive DAC unlocking and higher catastrophes in the prior year quarter.","Life and other reported operating earnings of $285 million, up 67% year-over-year and 17% when adjusting for notable items in both periods, including higher catastrophes of $37 million after tax in the prior year quarter. The primary drivers were more favorable underwriting, higher net investment income and lower DAC amortization.","Annuities reported operating earnings of $373 million, down 19% versus the prior year quarter. Adjusting for a positive DAC unlocking of $133 million in the prior year quarter and other notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 13%. The drivers included higher fees from separate account growth, resulting from strong investment performance and lower DAC amortization. The initial market impact was favorable to operating earnings by $32 million after tax, which was $11 million higher than the prior year quarter. Variable annuities sales were $1.7 billion in the quarter, down 53% year-over-year and 38% sequentially. As Steve mentioned, full year VA sales were $10.6 billion and within our planned range of $10 billion to $11 billion.","Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits reported operating earnings of $231 million, up 38% year-over-year and essentially flat when adjusting for notable items in both periods.","The prior year quarter included favorable reserve releases, higher catastrophes and intangible write down. The primary drivers in the fourth quarter of 2013 were higher net investment income offset by higher expenses, primarily due to pension and postretirement benefits. Underwriting results were essentially flat year-over-year, with an improvement in long-term care offsetting less favorable performance in group, life and dental.","Corporate benefit funding reported operating earnings of $358 million, up 17% year-over-year and 25% when adjusting for access variable investment income in both periods and a legal reserve increase in the current quarter. The year-over-year growth was due to favorable investment margins, primarily driven by Capital Market investment products.","Latin America reported operating earnings of $173 million, up 17% year-over-year and 22% on a constant currency basis. These results reflect the 2013 Provida acquisition, which was in line with expectations and improved underwriting in Mexico, partially offset by higher expenses due to business initiatives, inflation adjustments and volume-related growth.","Premium fees and other revenues were up 28% year-over-year, 34% on a constant currency basis and 23% excluding Provida. The strong growth across the region was primarily due to worksite marketing in Mexico and growth in our agency and group business in Chile. Sales growth was also strong in the region, up 27% driven by Mexican group and worksite marketing, as well as growth in the agency sales force and direct marketing in Chile.","Turning now to Asia. Operating earnings were $324 million, up 64% year-over-year and 74% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, which included negative DAC unlocking in the prior year quarter in Japan and Korea and excess variable investment income in the current quarter, operating earnings were up 19%, reflecting higher investment income and business growth.","Premium fees and other revenues were down 8% year-over-year, but up 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in Japan, Korea and Australia. Sales were up 44%, primarily driven by a large group case in Australia, as well as higher life sales in Japan.","In Japan, we experienced higher-than-planned sales in the fourth quarter in advance of pricing changes on 2 of our yen-denominated life products. These products were not achieving our targeted return as a result of low interest rates in Japan and mandated regulatory reserve changes. Adjusting for the Australia group sales, which can be lumpy, and the higher-than-planned sales in Japan, Asia sales would have been essentially flat year-over-year.","Finally, in EMEA, operating earnings were $89 million, up 51% year-over-year and 48% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for favorable tax items in the quarter, operating earnings were up 32%, driven by business growth across the region. Premium fees and other revenues were up 3% year-over-year and 2% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth in Russia, Poland, the U.K., the Gulf and Turkey. There are items in both periods depressing year-over-year growth. Adjusting for these items, underlying growth was 8% and consistent with the near-term guidance we provided during the December 2013 outlook call.","Sales declined 1%, driven by regulatory developments in the U.K., which we discussed on the second quarter 2013 earnings call. Sales from emerging markets increased 21% due to growth in the Middle East, Russia and Poland.","Now I will discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets of the holding companies were approximately $5.9 billion at end of the fourth quarter, which is at the top end of the range that we provided at our May Investor Day after adjusting for the benefit from $1 billion of senior debt issued to prefund 2014 maturities. In addition, our 23 -- our 2013 free cash flow ratio was 36%.","Turning to our capital position. While we have not completed our risk-based capital calculations for 2013, we estimate our combined RBC ratio will be in the 440% or 460% range. Our Japan solvency margin ratio, which we file quarterly, was 945% as of the third quarter, and we estimate that our fourth quarter ratio will be above 900%.","For our domestic insurance companies in the fourth quarter, preliminary U.S. statutory results are operating earnings of approximately $900 million and net income of approximately $800 million. For the full year of 2013, U.S. statutory earnings were approximately $3 billion, and U.S. statutory net income was approximately $2 billion. U.S. statutory operating earnings were down $1.4 billion as compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher taxes, reserve strengthening on our long-term care business in New York due to mandated lower investment return assumptions and increased legal reserves. Our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital is expected to be approximately $26 billion as of December 31, 2013, down 9% compared to the prior year as dividends for the holding company and unrealized losses and derivatives more than offset statutory net income.","In conclusion, MetLife had a good fourth quarter, completing a strong 2013. Our margins remain healthy, and we continue to focus on generating profitable growth. The financial results MetLife delivered in 2013 demonstrate the strength of the franchise, the benefit of diversification and the ongoing successful execution of our strategy.","And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question, just on group benefits, I guess, for Bill or John. Can you comment on the increase in claims on dental and disability? On the dental side, I hear what you said on -- just higher claims being submitted. In disability, it sounds like it's more lack of social security offsets. Do you think those issues stay with you for a bit here, or is there some reason to think those are going to lessen over the near term?","William J. Wheeler","Tom, it's Bill. So we'll take them one at a time. With regard to dental, yes, dental claims experienced was a little higher than we would normally predict. And the reason for that is we saw higher dental usage at the lower end of the market with small employers. And we -- I guess our theory about that is that it's likely due to employees who are worried about losing their dental coverage because their companies will either change their benefits because of the Affordable Care Act or something is likely to happen. And so I think they felt, while they still had their dental coverage, they'd go get some work done. The -- we do see this kind of behavior from time to time. And I guess, while there's no assurance that it'll abate in 2014, our expectation is it probably will a little bit. You do generally see higher utilization at the end of the year anyway for kind of the same reasons. So -- and that, by and large, was not the biggest driver of the ratio. With regard to disability, let's be clear. So the block, in my mind, actually performed quite well. And by that, I mean incidents rates were good, severity was good, claim closure rates were fine and reopens of closed cases were also fine. So all that was sort of in tolerance, if you will. What the -- but the significant difference was our, as you alluded to, our social security offsets were quite low. And they're always low in the fourth quarter, but they were extremely low this time. And we -- obviously, we've listened to some of our competitors in terms of what they've talked about in the quarter. A few of them have mentioned the same -- having the same experience. We know some others have as well. So I don't -- the question is, is this systemic, or is this sort of a kind of a blip? Because occasionally, the Social Security Administration does have a blip in terms of its claim approval rates. And our feeling is that this is just an unusual quarter and not indicative of what's likely to happen next year. And I guess, I also think that therefore, the kind of recovery and underwriting that we've been predicting for 2014, I think that story is still intact.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So no backing away from the guidance you put out back in December about what you expect from group?","William J. Wheeler","No. You know, look, we're obviously a little wary, but no. We aren't backing away from that guidance.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just -- if I could shift to Chris Townsend, just a question on Asia and Japan in particular. Can you comment a bit about what's going on behind the scenes between first sector and third sector sales there? I believe you guys have a push of a new cancer product. It sounds like sales are flattish right now in that market. Is that still the expectation there?","Christopher G. Townsend","The cancer products we launched in the third quarter of the year is going very well for us. The sales in November, we sold about 20,000 products. And the good thing is that we are not cannibalizing any of the rest of our business. So as you well know, we make a good amount of our operating earnings in Japan out of the third sector products. Overall sales were relatively flat quarter-on-quarter, but for the fourth quarter, we believe that, throughout 2014, the sort of numbers we're looking at probably are low- to mid-single-digit growth for the third sector, which is probably in excess of the market growth we'd expect there.","Operator","We'll go to the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Steve, a question for you. At your opening commentary, you focused a bit on leverage there and why we should maybe be looking at leverage excluding separate accounts. While I think most of us on this call and most of us that have been following you in the industry certainly agree with that. I guess, the question I'd pose is do you think you're gaining some traction with the regulators in Washington around this issue?","Steven A. Kandarian","John, I think it's still early days to make any predictions on what comes out of Washington. First, we have not been designated at this point in time, we're still in Phase III. And as of now, there are no drafts outstanding regarding what the rules will look like. So that's why we're remaining cautious at this point in terms of our leverage. And as we mentioned in the call today, that not only did we achieve a 12% ROE, but we are less leveraged today than we were several years ago. So both earnings are up as well as the quality of earnings in our judgment.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. Turning to the international operations. I just wanted to think about tax rates here just a little bit. And I know your overall guidance for 2014 -- I believe, if I recall correctly, it's a 27.5% effective rate on a consolidated basis. Should we think about the tax rates that we saw in 2013, even adjusting for the $11 million item in EMEA, as a reasonable run rate for the international operations, Asia, LatAm, and EMEA, respectively? Because even if I adjust for that EMEA tax item this quarter, it looks like the rates outside the U.S. were pretty low. Can you help there?","John C. R. Hele","This is John, John. I would caution you, the consolidated is correct on our business. And, of course, it's 35% in the U.S. and essentially 35% in Japan, but EMEA has had some lumps this year due to APB elections and it's had some gains throughout the year. So they're going to be in the mid-20s, I believe, is the sort of combined EMEA tax rate for the year.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then is there any -- LatAm looks -- Latin America looked pretty low this quarter as well. Is there anything there that was really driven by Provida? Or just some onetime items and we ought to think about the tax rate as being higher going forward there as well?","John C. R. Hele","So it's the same story. We've had some lumpy gains here and there. You know how taxes work, so you have to average it out over the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Finkelstein with Evercore.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Actually, I want to go back to the leverage question. And Steve, you articulated how you've taken down leverage. I think you gave ratios of 8.1% to 9.9%. And what I'm curious about is, do you have an objective of where you'd like to get that ratio to? And what I mean is, on the one hand, you're talking about more opportunities, say in the pension closeout market which add leverage maybe a little bit on the non-VA annuity side, but you're also looking to -- you've also taken down the leverage ratio. So how do those 2 balance? And what are your objectives going forward?","Steven A. Kandarian","Mark, we don't have a specific number as a target going forward. We just think that, overall, it made sense for us to take the actions we've taken and not take certain actions that we may have taken absent the Dodd-Frank consideration. So by now, we would've engaged in share buybacks most likely. But given the uncertainty, we've held back and, obviously, that's added to our balance sheet, and it has resulted in less leverage for the company at this point in time. So I don't want to put any specific numbers out as a target because it is a fluid situation and is very dependent upon the environment in which we're operating from a regulatory perspective.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe just on the pension closeouts. I think, on the outlook call, you talked about a study by Towers Watson talking about 40% of sponsors looking to divest of plans under $1 billion or -- I can't recall the exact number. But there's obviously a time line in getting these things done. Are you seeing more opportunities, more activity? And what is the pipeline looking like in that area?","William J. Wheeler","Mark, it's Bill. So the general answer to your question is yes, we see a kind of momentum building in this sector, and there is sort of a couple of ways to think about momentum. You know there are the big jumbo deals that come very sporadically. And I don't think the industry right now sees any big jumbo deals that are out there ready to get bid on anytime soon, but we don't have, obviously, complete transparency into the next 12 months or so. In terms of what I would call the more normal flow business, clearly, momentum is building. Clearly, the pipeline is growing. We did, I think, $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion in pension closeouts in 2013. By the way, that made us the market share leader in 2013. So obviously, no jumbo deals in -- last year. But there's still a nice flow business that we can bid for with good returns. We do see this as an area of growth and I think in the U.S., and I think that's going to continue for quite some time.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, John, cash at the holding company, I don't recall that being mentioned at year end.","John C. R. Hele","Yes. So I mentioned $5.9 billion, which is in the high end of our range. We prefunded -- we issued some debt to prefund a redemption, a maturity coming due in 2014. So the guidance we had given before was at the high end of the range of $4.9 billion. So we're essentially, on a net position, right at our high end of our range.","Operator","Next question will come from Ryan Krueger with Dowling & Partners.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Just first, a quick follow-up on the holding company liquidity. Is the target still about $1 billion at this point or has that changed over the last year or so?","John C. R. Hele","I'm sorry. I couldn't hear what you said at the very end of your question.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Is the holding company liquidity target still $1 billion or has that changed in the last year?","John C. R. Hele","We haven't given precise numbers on that recently. With the uncertainty with the regulatory framework and everything else out there, we are just reporting how much cash we have at the holding company. We're happy with the amount of cash we have at the holding company, but that's all the guidance that we feel comfortable right now. Just the rules are so uncertain, we don't know what's going to happen with federal regulation, the whole potential of that. So for now, until we have certainty on regulatory frameworks, we're just going to report the cash we have.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay, understood. And then a question on annuity earnings. I think if I adjust for the items, as well as the equity market lift, it was about $328 million or so normalized, which was down a bit from more like $350 million in the last couple of quarters. Can you just comment on the driver of that? And should we view the 4Q earnings as a better run rate looking forward?","William J. Wheeler","Ryan, it's Bill Wheeler. So with regard to earning -- annuity earnings, I think, and I -- somebody really pressed me on the -- on our fourth quarter guidance call that we did last December. And I think we said, look, the earnings rate in the third quarter is pretty consistent with what we see at the outlook given sort of moderate stock market growth over the next year. So I -- and obviously, in the fourth quarter, performance was very consistent with that. A couple of things you always got to keep in mind: one is we had DAC -- we had positive DAC unlockings both in the sequential comparison periods as well as the year ago period, and that kind of obviously makes the numbers a little hard to compare. Secondly, remember now that half -- almost half of our separate accounts in the variable annuity business are not in equities anymore. It's a much more diversified asset mix with a lot of fixed income. So the S&P 500 is not going to be the only driver of variable annuity earnings performance. It's much more conservative than it used to be. And so I think that gives you a little feel for what's going on in the annuity business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to talk about spreads, particularly in the Corporate Benefit Funding business. I think, in your prepared comments, you had mentioned that they were strong both including and excluding variable investment income. So I just was wondering what the underlying drivers are, and if there's any change to your thought process in terms of what that might look like going forward versus the outlook conference call.","William J. Wheeler","Okay, I guess, I'll take that one. The -- so with regard to Corporate Benefit Funding spread, yes, they were strong. Yes, it was driven by both strong variable investment income, but honestly, the underlying investment performance is strong as well. The strong variable investment income, and maybe my colleague Steve Goulart will comment as well, is really -- obviously, hedge funds performed very well in the quarter. We also had very strong mortgage loan prepays experience. And so -- and I guess when you think about our outlook for the next year, we -- so we had -- I guess I'd say we had quite a good beat with regard to variable investment income in the quarter. We don't have -- the reason we call that out is we don't necessarily think it's sustainable. It's not in our base projection. And with that, maybe I'll let Steve talk a little bit about the outlook.","Steven Jeffrey Goulart","Sure. Thanks, Bill. We do have a solid outlook. I think we talked a little bit on the earnings guidance call about our plan for 2014. We've said that we expect $900 million to $1.3 billion in VII for next year or $225 million to $325 million a quarter. Obviously, the fourth quarter was very strong, Bill went through some of the highlights. Nearly every component of VII outperformed our expectations and plan in the fourth quarter. Both sets of alternatives hedge funds and private equity as well has very strong prepayments. Looking forward to the first quarter, though, we don't expect to see that same sort of performance, but we're still very confident about our plan and our outlook for the first quarter and for all of 2014 as well. Remember, there's a lag in private equity and obviously, there's a strong fourth quarter in the equity markets. I think that will help us through the first quarter. But again, I think we're very confident of being within our plan for VII for '14.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. I -- and then maybe for John. Can you remind us about how we should think about the glide path for the interest rate derivative sort of roll-off? I know we talked about this a couple of years ago, but I don't know if we've gotten an update in a while.","John C. R. Hele","We haven't -- it really hasn't changed much. It's quite long. It's -- we've had small amounts. It's been quite small actually impacting us so far up until -- including 2013. And as we hit 2015, in the next 5 years or after, it starts to slowly glide down over the 2020, unless Steve wants to add more to that? That's -- yes. And I just wanted to add on Corporate Benefit Funding. The -- also, I mentioned in my comments about -- it was helped also by Capital Market investment products, both [indiscernible] and some other products. We've been able to fund it at cheaper rates because they're short in [ph] the curves and there's been solid demand for products, so that's helped our earnings on a year-over-year basis.","Steven Jeffrey Goulart","It's Steve Goulart again. Let me just add a little bit on the derivatives piece that John just commented on. I guess -- the thing I'd point out, I think there have been some questions, \"Gee, we're in a rising rate environment now. But yet, you're still having strong derivatives income. What's going on?\" The thing to remember about this is this is all part of our asset liability management process, and it's a dynamic process. So we're always looking at what are the needs within our portfolios, what are the market opportunities that are available to us, and so the program is actively managed. Just keep that in mind.","John C. R. Hele","Thanks.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, got it. And then maybe on the same topic. Can you talk about your new money investment rate in the quarter, and maybe how that compares to sort of the overall portfolio yield on a book basis and also, the yield on maturing securities?","Steven Jeffrey Goulart","Let me start with that. Again, I think our new money yield was kind of in line with the market. I think $329 million is what we've said in that order. And, of course, our portfolio continues to run off with higher yielding securities. So there's probably, call it, 100 to 150 basis points difference between new money yield and what's rolling off in the portfolio. But that's sort of as we would expect. Again, we make -- we've made up for a lot of it. And when you look at our portfolio yield being sort of flatter or even up quarter-to-quarter, a lot of that was due to the VII performance that we saw in the fourth quarter. So the yield roll-off is as we expect, and we're making up for it so far in different pieces like VII.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Schuman with KBW.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I just want to ask a couple of top line questions. I think there was a large group sale in Australia. I was wondering how much that was, and wondering how we should sort of think about that in the context of a lot of difficult challenges in the Australian group market. In particular, I'm wondering if this was deeper annuation related.","Christopher G. Townsend","Yes, let me take that question. It's Chris Townsend here. The -- there was one single account which was a little over $200 million, and it's a mixture of both life and total permanent disability. And the mix is about 60\/40 in favor of TPD in terms of the mix of risk we take. And I guess your question is in relation to the reserve that we took in the third quarter. So we -- there's been a fair amount of dislocation in the market in terms of competitors coming in and going from the market and a fair amount of change in the reinsurance market as well. And I can assure you that we're very careful in terms of pricing to make sure we meet the appropriate hurdles, and we have a number of sets of eyes on every significant risk we write there. So it's our country team in Australia, it's our regional team based out of Hong Kong, and it's Maria Morris's team at Employee Benefits that assist us globally as well. So there are a number of people looking at it to make sure we're getting the appropriate return on our capital in terms of the pricing we're deploying.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I mean, is it safe for us to assume that the pricing is much differently than it would have been before developments over the last year or so?","Christopher G. Townsend","That would be a safe assumption, that there's a significant increase in that particular account.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","All right. Then in Group and Voluntary, I think PFO growth was 1%. I think the outlook for 2014 was mid-single digit, so a bit of a spread there. I'm just wondering how you feel about sort of accelerating that into 2014 and whether it's dependent on some economic assumptions that we should be sensitive to.","William J. Wheeler","Jeff, it's Bill. The -- keep in mind that a lot of our -- certainly, at the large end of the market, a lot of our sales are already done, right? So we have a pretty good feel for therefore, what will flow through on the income statement. And what we've seen is there's a kind of increasing momentum in group now for a couple of years. A couple of years ago, I think our group revenues actually shrunk. And so you're seeing a much more benign regulatory environment -- or competitive environment, not regulatory, competitive environment. And that means that pricing is more attractive, and we're getting a fair amount of that business. So that's already a little bit in the can already. The second thing that's driving the revenue growth is really our Voluntary Benefits & Worksite strategy. And that is -- we have some pretty aggressive goals there. I would say, in 2013, we did a very good job of hitting those goals. Maybe the best example of what's going on is in auto insurance. We are the largest provider of auto and homeowners at the Worksite. And our revenue growth there was over 5% last year, and we actually expect that to grow faster this year. So -- and that's -- for a pretty mature market -- the auto market hardly grows at all -- that's quite strong performance. So there -- so I would say a lot of the growth, we already kind of know. And -- but obviously, at the Voluntary Worksite part of it, we have some ambitious goals but good momentum.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So first, a question for Steve. You mentioned not wanting to buy back stock and then have to issue equity at SIFI standards that have [ph] 2 owners. But your stock was trading below book value for an extended period, also, relatively attractive now in valuation. So buying back earlier and issuing later wouldn't really be so bad. So just trying to get a sense of how long will you continue to accumulate capital if there's no visibility on SIFI standards this year. Would you, at some point, if you don't find any deals, decide to reevaluate your decision or not? And then, secondly, on pension closeouts, you signed the ASCO noble pension closeout deal this quarter, but maybe, Bill, if you could talk about -- you spoke about the pipeline, but maybe talk about what type of returns you're getting in this market, what the competitive environment is, have you seen other companies sort of pursue this business more aggressively. And then, lastly, on the annuity business, you're obviously pulling back from variable annuities. Fixed annuity sales are still modest, but they more than doubled from the previous quarter. So I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of this was indexed annuities and what your goals are for the traditional fixed and the fixed-index annuity business over the next few years.","Steven A. Kandarian","So I'll start, Jimmy. As to capital management, it is fluid. We are observing what's going on in the regulatory environment. We did, as you know, raise our dividend by nearly 50% last year. I did mention that we looked at the dividend on an annual basis. I have nothing to report, obviously. I have to talk to my board before announcing anything on that front. We did spend $2 billion in cash on Provida a few quarters ago, so we are I think managing capital within the context of the environment in which we're operating today from a regulatory perspective. And I think you'll see us continue taking actions that make sense in the coming quarters and years as this regulatory environment unfolds. And it's taking a while, obviously, for things to unfold around Dodd-Frank, and we have to be sensitive to what potentially can come out in terms of rules. And right now, there is just very little visibility. We've had comments coming out of people from the Fed, in hearings on Capitol Hill, saying they would like to tailor the rules to be appropriate for the insurance industry, but they followed that up with comments about the Collins Amendment, so-called Section 171 of Dodd-Frank. It ties our hands to some degree in terms of how much they can tailor those rules. That just leaves a lot of uncertainty in terms of how much capital is going to be required of us if we are designated a SIFI and if any appeals we take aren't successful. So I think we have to be prudent here. We have to do what makes sense for the company, not just in the long term, but we have to look at the near term here as well. And we don't want to be in a position where we buy back shares and then end up reissuing equity down the road. We think that would be a bad outcome.","William J. Wheeler","It's Bill again. So let's see if I get all your questions answered. So with regard to pension closeouts, yes, we did a pretty large transaction in the fourth quarter, a little under $700 million of deposits. So that was a big deal. However, just keep in mind, when you think about revenue growth rates and stuff, that in the year ago period, we did a $1 billion pension conversion, which flowed through as revenue on our GAAP income statement. And so even there -- even though we did a big one this quarter, it's-- revenue from pension closeouts actually still look like it was down year-over-year. With regard to returns, the block -- and I don't like to give or -- the block is actually performing very well. I don't like to give ROIs on new sales, obviously, because that's a competitive issue, but we think they're attractive and above our cost of capital, though, I would say at the smaller end of pension closeout market, it's much more competitive, I think, than it would be necessarily for jumbo deals. There's a half a dozen or so players who compete for this business, and I'm not sure if pricing is getting more aggressive or not. I would say it's pretty stable, but it's a pretty competitive, efficient market. And with regard to kind of the fixed annuities end of the business, a couple of things are going on there. One is we've repriced our SPIAs, our retail SPIAs, in that we had increased sales there. Remember the way a SPIA works is the whole deposit comes through as GAAP revenue. And so that sort of accentuates how much that impacts our income statement that you could see it in the sales numbers. So SPIA sales were better. We expect that to continue, frankly. We've also -- we have introduced an indexed annuity product earlier this year called Shield. Shield sales so far this year are, I would say, a little weaker than we would have liked. We've -- it has been a little slow getting approval for Shield in a number of big states, but we're building momentum every quarter there, and I think Shield will end up being a fairly big seller for us in 2014. So the strategy here is to continue to diversify our product portfolio. It isn't just about a guaranteed income benefit writer all the time. It's -- we want to make sure we meet a variety of client needs with regard to annuities and tax deferral and investment performance.","Steven A. Kandarian","Okay. Thank you very much.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including statements relating to the trends in the company's operations and financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries.","MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the ","forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission including the risk factors section of those filings.","MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.","Ed Spehar","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's first quarter 2014 earnings call. We\u2019ll be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles so called non-GAAP measures reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found in the Investor Relations portion metlife.com in our earnings press release and our quarterly financial supplements.","A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment income and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.","Now, joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks we will take your questions.","Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management including Bill Wheeler, President of the Americas, Chris Townsend, President of Asia and Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA and Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer.","With that I would like to turn the call over to Steve.","Steve Kandarian","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report solid first quarter results with operating earnings of $1.6 billion, which exceeded our plan. Favorable investment margins and well-controlled expenses more than offset fluctuations in underwriting and $57 million after-tax charge to settle a licensing matter in New York.","We anticipate that underwriting margins will improve and consider the New York settlement to be an unusual item. While operating earnings were better than our expectations results were down 5% from a strong first quarter last year. Operating earnings in the prior year quarter benefited from a weaker dollar and stronger equity market returns.","Operating earnings per share were $1.37; a 7% decrease in the prior year period. Performance on a per share basis was dampened by the conversion of equity units issued in 2010 to fund the acquisition of Alico. The final $1 billion tranche of equity units will convert in October of this year. Operating return on equity was 11.4% in the quarter.","First quarter operating earnings benefited from strong variable investment income driven by returns in private equity. The operating earnings impacting variable investment income was $63 million above the top end of our expected range or $0.06 per share. Investment margins had been resilient despite a prolonged period of low interest rates.","Our margins continue to benefit from effective asset liability management, good global investment income and income from derivatives many of which were purchased in the mid-2000s, protect earnings in a low interest rate environment.","Lower operating expenses had a positive impact on earnings in the quarter driven by expense control in all three geographic regions, the Americas, Asia, and Europe, Middle East and Africa. We feel good that our cost savings initiatives are translating to improve bottom line results.","Underwriting margins were lower than expected in retail life and group voluntary and worksite benefit largely because of adverse mortality. We believe underwriting margins will improve for two reasons. First, our analysis suggests that most of the adverse experience in the first quarter was a result of normal volatility. Second, there is seasonality in our business with underwriting margins typically weakest in the first quarter of the year.","Given the underwriting performance this quarter, it is worth reviewing, how we think about risk associated with protection oriented products. Our strategy to shift the sales mix away from market sensitive products, protection oriented products should translate to a more balanced risk profile and a reduction in so-called fat-tail risk.","For protection products, we think the primary risk factor is earnings volatility as policyholder claims will sometimes exceed pricing assumptions. We view the balance sheet risk associated with protection products as relatively modest. This is true in group insurance where we have the ability to reprice the in-force book of business in the near-term.","Overall, protection oriented product lines have a favorable risk profile in a relatively low cost of equity capital.","Although, it may seem counterintuitive, in this case, low risk does not mean lower returns. For example, group voluntary and worksite benefits remains a high return segment, even with the less favorable underwriting results experienced in recent periods, largely because of relatively low capital requirements.","A healthy spread between ROE and the cost of equity capital is particularly important in the current environment were capital requirements remain uncertain. Our strategy to shift MetLife's sales mix to a protection oriented products was clearly evident in our first quarter results.","Group voluntary and worksite benefits sales rose 18% and emerging market sales were up 14%. Variable annuity sales were $1.6 billion in the first quarter, down 54% year-over-year. However, the decline was only 4% sequentially, even though first quarter sales are typically weaker than fourth quarter sales.","Since 2012, we're focused on rightsizing our variable annuity business to achieve an appropriate risk profile. Consistent with the December outlook call, we anticipate that variable annuity sales would decline this year.","Looking forward, we are now in a position to pursue sales growth with our redesigned mix of products to have a more attractive risk return profile. We remain committed to the annuity business as we see a substantial retirement savings opportunity in the United States.","Next, I want to address the legal settlement in the licensing matter in New York, which is related to our global employee benefits business. Let me start by noting that I'm limited in what I can say the terms of the settlement agreement.","New York officials investigated whether companies we acquired for the 2010 Alico transaction were conducting insurance business in the state without a New York license. The company's MetLife acquired are in a business that provides insurance to the non-U.S. employees of multinational companies. This insurance is sold through affiliates and partners that are licensed in the countries where the insurance policies are issued.","Under the terms of the agreement with the New York Department of Financial Services, we can continue to have meetings and discussions in New York with multinational clients and prospects about the capabilities of MetLife's non-U.S. affiliates and partners. We're pleased to settle this issue with the Department of Financial Services particularly because our largest operating subsidiary is a New York regulated insurer.","Finally, I want to close the discussion of required capital and capital management. MetLife remains under states to review by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the potential designation as a non-bank Systemically Important Financial Institution or SIFI.","We believe the evidence clearly demonstrates that MetLife does not pose a threat to the financial system of the United States. However, if MetLife is designated a SIFI, we will be subject to enhanced credential standards by the Federal Reserve because those standards have not yet been written, there is uncertainty surrounding required capital levels for MetLife.","As a result, we've been conservative on capital management. Some shareholders have been frustrated by this cautious approach to returning cash. We share their frustration. Our philosophy is that excess capital belongs to our shareholders. The challenge is to strike the right balance between adherence to our philosophy and recognition that record capital levels for MetLife remain unknown.","We had anticipated that proposed capital rules would have been known by now. But, recent comments from the Federal Reserve suggest that it will be 2015 before you'll see draft capital rules for life insurers designated as SIFIs.","We will continue to take the conservative approach to capital management until there is clarity on these matters. But, we also recognize the need to consider the timing of those rules as our capital base continues to grow. The announcement last week of a 27% increase in MetLife's common stock dividend illustrates the importance that we place on returning cash to shareholders.","In closing, 2014 is off to a good start. The increase in the common stock dividend illustrates our confidence in the earnings power of the company. By significantly increasing the dividend, we are delivering on our commitment to take steps to enhance long-term shareholders value.","With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?","John Hele","Thank you, Steve, and good morning.","Today, I'll cover our first quarter results including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.","As Steve noted, operating earnings were $1.6 billion, down 4% year-over-year and operating earnings per share were $1.37 down 7% year-over-year. This quarter included two notable items. First, pretax variable investment income was $429 million, reflecting strong private equity returns. After taxes and the impact of DAC, variable investment income was $274 million which is $63 million or $0.06 per share above the top end of our 2014 quarterly guidance range. The second item was a legal settlement with New York, which reduced operating earnings and corporate and other by $57 million after tax or $0.05 per share.","Turning to our bottom line results, first quarter net income was $1.3 billion or $1.14 per share. Net income included in investment loss of $343 million after tax from the previously announced sale of the U.K. pension risk transfer business. This was modestly below the $350 million to $390 million after tax range we previously disclosed. In addition, net income included net derivative gains of $223 million after tax.","The net derivative gains in the quarter were driven primarily by three items that we consider to be either non-economic or the result of asymmetrical accounting treatment. Number one, a decline in long-term interest rates, number two changes in foreign currencies and number three, the MetLife own credit impact associated with our VA program.","The decline in long-term interest rates in the quarter contributed approximately 70% of the net derivative gains, while foreign currency and MetLife's own credit combined for most of the remaining balance. Book value per share excluding AOCI was $49.34 at March 31st, up 2% from $48.49 at December 31st.","Turning to first quarter margins, underwriting in the U.S. was less favorable than the prior year quarter and our plan. The mortality ratio in Group Life was 93.6% unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 91.3% and above our annual target range of 85% to 90%. First quarter mortality is usually higher due to seasonality. We experienced an ","elevated number of large claims in determining group variable universal life, which we believe was still \u2013 was in the range of normal quarterly fluctuations.","Retail Life also had unfavorable mortality quarter due to the three primary factors. One, two large claims in variable and universal life; two, higher than normal incidence in traditional life; and three, a reinsurance adjustment related to prior periods.","On the last point, we'd incorrectly recorded policies that were term life conversions as reinsured over several years and as a result now had to reimburse reinsurers for claims that occurred between 2006 and 2011. This catch-up adjustment reduced operating earnings by $16 million after tax in the quarter. We're not normalizing for this reinsurance adjustment as we typically do not normalize for mortality related items.","In the quarterly financial supplement, you will note a change in how we are showing mortality experience. We have replaced the historical Retail Life direct mortality ratio with an interest adjusted benefit ratio. The historical ratio reflected direct claims experience as a percentage of expected. The new ratio measures claims experience net of reinsurance and changes in future policyholder benefits net of interest relative to premiums fees and other revenues.","We believe the new ratio will better demonstrate the relationship of mortality experience to premiums earned and prove your ability to model this business. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Retail Life was 56.9% in the first quarter, which is unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 52.1% and our target range of 50% to 55%. While we are changing the mortality metric, we will discuss with you going forward, there is no change in the expected mortality experience for our Retail Life business.","We've also changed the non-medical health benefit ratio in the QFS to an interest adjusted loss ratio. The primary reason to the changes to provide a better indication of the underlying performance of our run-off launch and care insurance block of business. On the old basis, it would've been upward pressure on the benefit ratio as premiums declined and investment income increased and this upward pressure would have nothing to do with the underlying performance of the business.","The new ratio adjusts for this by removing the impact of interest on reserves, and therefore, provides a clear picture of morbidity margins. The non-medical health interest adjusted loss ratio was 78.8% favorable to the prior year quarter of 79.6% and within our target range of 77% to 82%. The 77% to 82% target range for the interest adjusted loss ratio is consistent with the old range of 86% to 90% on premiums.","General margins were favorable to prior year and plan due to lower utilization. Disability underwriting results were unfavorable to prior year and plan due to lower net closures of existing claims.","As part of our normal review process we're pursuing modest price increases in disability. However, it is important to keep in mind that dental is the primary driver of our results in non-medical health. Dental accounts for more than 60% of our non-medical health interest adjusted loss ratio, while disability only accounts for 20%. Long-term care, which accounts for approximately 10% of the ratio, had favorable underwriting versus prior year quarter and plan driven by premium rate actions and lower incidence.","In our P&C business, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 94.3% for retail and 98.2% for group. The combined ratios excluding catastrophes were 89.3% in retail and 94.3% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting results were unfavorable to the prior year quarter and plan primarily due to non-catastrophe launches as a result of the winter weather.","Moving to first quarter investment margins, the simple average of the four U.S. products spreads in our QFS was 233 basis points including variable investment income and 192 basis points excluding VII. This result showed only a modest seven basis points decline versus the prior year quarter of 240 basis points including VII. Excluding VII, there was a 19 basis points decline versus the prior year quarter due to the low interest rate environment.","With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 24.1% in the first quarter as compared to 24.0% in the year ago quarter. Adjusting for the New York legal settlement, the normalized operating expense ratio was 23.6% better than plan than the prior-year quarter.","Gross expense saves were $200 million in the first quarter and net saves were $124 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $39 million and one-time costs of $37 million. We are pleased with our expense performance as we remain on track to deliver gross saves of $770 million to $800 million in 2014, and $1 billion in 2015, and net saves of $600 million in 2015.","I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $612 million, down 2% versus the prior year quarter and up 1% when adjusting for notable items in both periods, included in net positive DAC and reserve adjustment in the prior year quarter an excess variable investment income in both periods.","Life and other reported operating earnings of $244 million, down 4% year-over-year and down 5% when adjusting for excess and variable investment income in both quarters. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting partially offset by lower expenses.","Annuities reported operating earnings of $368 million, down 1% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding a net positive DAC and reserve adjustment of $29 million in the prior year quarter an excess variable investment income in both periods, operating earnings were up 5%. The drivers included lower DAC amortization and higher fees from separate account growth.","Group, voluntary and worksite benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $188 million down 18% year-over-year due to a less favorable underwriting in Group Life disability and property and casualty partially offset by improved underwriting results in dental and long-term care.","GVWB sales were up 18% up year-over-year with group sales up in the mid-teens and voluntary and worksite sales up more than 30%. Even though we're modestly increasing disability pricing over the next year, we believe that first quarter GVWB sales would generate an attractive return on investment.","Corporate benefit funding reported operating earnings of $355 million, up 21% year-over-year driven by higher variable investment and return income as well as improved underwriting.","Latin America reported operating earnings of $183 million, up 28% year-over-year and 43% on a constant currency basis. These results reflected the ProVida acquisition, which was in line with expectations and favorable market and tax impact partially offset by less favorable underwriting and higher expenses due to business initiatives, inflation adjustments and volume related growth.","Premiums fees and other revenues were up 9% year-over-year, 22% on a constant currency basis and 12% excluding ProVida on a constant currency basis. The strong growth across the region was primarily due to higher annuity sales in Chile and worksite marketing in Mexico. Sales were up 19% year-over-year and 15% excluding ProVida driven by growth in the agency sales force higher annuity sales, direct marketing and group medical in Chile as well as group medical in Mexico.","Turning now to Asia, operating earnings were $328 million, down 2% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, operating earnings were up 8% driven by business growth and lower expenses partially offset by return to more normal surrender levels in Japan. While Asia operating earnings were strong this quarter they did benefit from the timing of certain expenses.","Premiums fees and other revenues were down 6% year-over-year but up 6% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth in Japan, Korea and Australia. Asia sales were up only 2% year-over-year dampened by results in Japan. Japan sales were flat as a strong rebound in retirement products was offset by decline in yen life sales due to pricing actions we discussed on our fourth quarter call. As a result, the volume mix is favorable for expected returns.","Finally, in EMEA, operating earnings were $88 million, up 1% year-over-year and 2% on a constant currency basis. The prior period benefited by $8 million from unusual items increase. Adjusting for these items, operating earnings were up 12% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth across the region. This was a strong quarter for EMEA and we would expect lower operating earnings in the remaining quarters of the year.","Premiums fees and other revenues were up 5% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis driven by growth in Turkey, Russia, the Gulf and Poland. Sales increased 4% driven by 9% growth in emerging markets led by the Gulf, Turkey and Poland.","I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding company were approximately $4.7 billion at March 31st. As expected, this decline from year-end was primarily due to the $1 billion of senior debt that matured in February.","Turning to our capital position, the combined risk-based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies excluding Alico at year-end 2013 was 450%. Also our Japan solvency ratio was 945% as of December 31st.","For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary first quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $760 million, down 4% from the prior year quarter and net income was approximately $666 million, up 18%. The year-over-year decline in statutory operating earnings was primarily due to higher taxes, while the increase in net income was primarily the result of lower derivative losses. Our total statutory adjusted capital is expected to be approximately $27 billion as of March 31st, up 4% compared to December 31st.","In conclusion, MetLife had a solid first quarter with operating earnings better than our plan. Investment margins remain healthy, expenses are well-controlled and we continued focus on generating profitable growth. Although underwriting was weaker than expected in the quarter, we expect results to improve during the balance of the year.","And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Ed Spehar","We are ready to take questions operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session of our conference. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Gallagher of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Steve, first question for you just on your follow-up to your comments on the environment for capital rules and how you expect clarity around non-bank SIFI to be pushed out to 2015. There is currently legislation running through both the House and Senate to clarify Collins' amendment. If that legislation passes, will that change your view in terms of having to wait or will that give you enough confidence that you'd be able to do something less conservative? That's my first question.","Steve Kandarian","Hi, Tom. Yes. There's legislation now proposed both in the House and the Senate and then there is Susan Collins from there's an amendment named in Dodd-Frank, which is Section 171 of Dodd-Frank was interpreted by the Federal Reserve as requiring them to use no less than bank standards for non-bank SIFI such as insurance companies. And there is now a bill that Susan Collins, Sherrod Brown and Mike Johanns in the Senate have coalesced behind S.2270. There is an identical bill now in the house HR 4510, again, bipartisan support by representatives Gary Miller and Carolyn McCarthy. That's all encouraging news, but of course, these be a vehicle by which this would turn into legislation not just a bill and to-date there has been resistance to any amendments to Dodd-Frank, a bill that's been promulgated now for four years this summer.","So our hope is that there will be some softening of the position of not opening up Dodd-Frank for amendments. And it's not unusual for a very complex bill to have technical amendments after some period of time. And our hope is that Congress can find a way to navigate these issues and get these kinds of technical amendments or non-partisan, excuse me, bipartisan non-controversial through Congress and signed by the President. That's our hope and we're working hard to try to support those efforts.","If such a bill were to pass, that would be very favorable news, but I don't want to over blow it either. All I would say is to the Fed that you're not constrained, you are hands are not tied in terms of opposing Basel rules on the insurance industry. It doesn't say what rules they would apply but presumably they would be more tailored to the insurance industry I think that certainly would be a net positive so that would be a positive piece of information that we certainly would take into account as we thought about capital management.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","So if it does pass positive directionally, maybe, maybe not enough for you to change your plan for now? Is that a fair way to characterize it?","Steve Kandarian","I wouldn't phrase it that way. I think there would be positive news and certainly that we take that into account as we thought about capital management and that could have an impact upon how we would move forward.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Okay. That's helpful. And then just one I guess business question from the standpoint of so Met and the rest of the life insurance industry now this quarter have had pretty weak mortality results across the board. We've seen more pockets of this over the last few years. Any thoughts overall about whether this is truly just seasonality and randomness of more deaths this quarter? Or do you think we're seeing something more structural in terms of seasoning of more aggressive pricing years any help or color on that would be appreciated.","Bill Wheeler","Tom, hi, it's Bill Wheeler. So we ask ourselves that question when we have a quarter like this. We look at the claims and the data, our overall book, we look at, we always go back and look at the last five years or 10 years and say gee, am I missing a trend here, is there something I should be paranoid about in terms of our underwriting or pricing.","So we examine this really carefully. And I think our conclusion after this quarter is, there isn't a trend, there isn't something that we need a deeper concern that we need to be worried about. What we saw was some increases in severity, both in the Individual Life block as well as Group Life. And maybe just a slight increase in frequency in Retail Life, which probably brought on by the weather.","And we know that happen, right? We see quarters occasionally like this where you have a big pop in severity. And of course, this quarter in Retail Life, which wasn't very good, just remember the third and fourth quarter last year we're extraordinarily low in terms of mortality experience very good mortality experience.","So I think we just have to appreciate that this can be a volatile business. And as Steve said in his prepared remarks, it doesn't mean, it's not a good business and with great returns on capital, but mortality over the short-term can be volatile and so you've just got to take a little longer term view.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Got it. So Bill, no cohort years and anything along those lines as you vandalize the data to raise alarms?","Bill Wheeler","That's right.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of John Nadel of Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee","Hi. Good morning, everybody. Steve, I have a question about the recent CCAR results for the large bank financial institutions. I'm just curious whether you and the Board and the rest of management have any real sort of learnings or takeaways from the recent CCAR process. And maybe particularly with the focus on Citigroup's \"failure\" which appear to be, at least this is my sense driven in part by sort of the global nature of their business.","And I'm just sort of wondering, if you're incrementally thinking about implementing any changes or anything incrementally to your enterprise risk management as a result of what you saw?","Steve Kandarian","John, I think you raise a good point, which is we're in uncharted waters here. Dodd-Frank passed in 2010; implementation really is in the very early stages, everyone's learning how to work together both on regulatory side and in this case in the bank side. I think people are going through the learnings of all this.","And I think as of now there's not a great deal of transparency in terms of how all these calculations get done on the regulatory side. So I think people are trying to figure out how to operate within that environment. And it's obviously been difficult in some cases and we're mindful of that. And we are certainly building out our capabilities in case we are designated a SIFI on a final basis and regulated by the Federal Reserve.","So it is something that we've spent a great deal of time discussing internally at the management level with our Board. And we certainly are taking steps at MetLife to make sure that we are prepared going forward should we'd be finally designated as a SIFI.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee","Okay. That's helpful. I mean obviously, it was a little surprising, right? And my sense is that management at a couple of these companies in particular Citigroup were also may be taken by surprise in terms of the result. So I know you guys had a little experience with that.","The next question is more, it's about Asia. And I was just hoping we could get a little bit better detail on some of the underlying trends that more of the product level maybe first sector in Japan versus third sector, what you like and what you saw on the sales side, what you're sort of unhappy with you. If you can just give us a sense there that would be great.","Chris Townsend","Sure, Tom. It's Chris Townsend here. So the sales for Asia as John mentioned were up 2% year-on-year and they were down 34% sequentially. So if I take that sequential plan of first of all, we wrote a very significant account in Australia in the fourth quarter of 2013 plus there was some high sales of two yen-based life products before they were repriced. It was repriced both of those products, one in October, one in December and then now at or above our return hurdle rate.","So what you've seen is following that repricing a significant reduction in terms of the first step, the life sales and because of some of the packaging element which we spoken to you before about there has been a knock on impact in terms of the third sector as well.","The persistency overall is good, revenues are up both sequentially and year-on-year. The cancer product is selling very well. We launched a new cancer product last August and we're just about at 100,000 new customers for that product now. And the cancer sales overall are up about 120% year-on-year.","Going forward, what you'll see is that we'll tweak slightly to \u2013 one of the short pay periods, the life product and also in the second half we'll launch a range of new A&H products and riders as well. So that will lift sales towards the second half of the year.","I think Dave (sic) John, the other couple points to mention here is that we've spoken a number of times about the multichannel benefits of our business in Japan. And I would just like to point out that the bank channel sales of return significantly as we've got greater stability in the yen dollar and there's sort of a reduction and the increases in the Nikkei and the Topix. We have seen that bank channel come back very strongly in 100% growth year-on-year.","And the final point here is, collectively as you think the repricing of those actions have turned into very positive margin for us and we're up about 300 or 400 basis points quarter-on-quarter.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee","That's really helpful. And Chris maybe just one more quick one, any expectation, way I guess maybe sort of what's your view reading tea leaves if you will have any chance for in Japan for the government to make some changes incrementally to co-pays? ","Chris Townsend","I don't have a view on that right now.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Erik Bass of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass - Citigroup","Hi. Thank you. First, can you provide an update on your thinking about the equity units? And I know you've been clear certainly that you don't want to do a buyback and then have to issue equity of capital requirements change, but is your view on equity units at all different since you are essentially issuing equity if you don't offset the dilution?","Steve Kandarian","It was our intent when we issued those securities that we'll buy them back in the marketplace and we mentioned that before. And again, the capital considerations that we're analyzing, because of the uncertainty of the rules which are not yet in draft form for us to review has resulted in us to date not buying back those equity units. But certainly philosophically that is something that we had intended to do when we engaged in the Alico transaction back in 2010 and issued those securities.","Erik Bass - Citigroup","Okay. And then it's on the group business, can you comment a little bit more on just to what's driving the strong sales so far in kind of current activity and pricing trends in the market? And I guess the strong sales is like coming more from new accounts or an expanded product offering?","Bill Wheeler","Eric, it's Bill. I would say that the answer is both. Remember, we talked a lot about our strategy of growing our group business, but going down marketing growing at what I would call the middle market. We have a very strong presence in the large company marketplace in the U.S. and going down market with what I would say our broad product offering, which means not only our base coverages, but also all our worksite products. And we're having a lot of success down there.","So we have seen increased sales and I would say the middle market as well as strong worksite sales, and that's consistent with I think the strategy that we've laid out here in terms of shift to more protection product.","And in terms of just that I would say the tone of pricing, the pricing environment is I would say relatively good. I mean the guys who run that business are always sort of flinch when I say that because they always feel there's somebody out there who has been a little aggressive. But I would say today the pricing environment is relatively attractive and for the worksite portion of the business we think it's quite attractive.","Erik Bass - Citigroup","Okay. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mark Finkelstein of Evercore. Please go ahead.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore","Hi. Good morning. Actually sort of a follow-up to Erik Bass' question. Steve, in your opening remarks I think you addressed to palm kind of the evolution of the rules and some of the legislative actions. But you also talked about draft rules not coming out until 2015. And in your comments you actually used the words take into consideration the timing of the rules when you think about capital deployment. So the question is, I mean how was the timing influencing or how is your thinking evolving in terms of the timing in terms of those actions?","Steve Kandarian","Hi, Mark. Well, I think you saw it with our dividend announcement. I think that's fairly aggressive increase in the dividend given that we had a large dividend increase one year earlier. And $1.40 a share for dividend for MetLife that translates to 2.7% yield, and roughly a 25% payout ratio.","So I think you're seeing we're taking actions now that we think makes sense for us given the delay in the pronouncement of the draft rules of the Fed. And when we first engaged in this analysis and discussion internally two years ago or more, we anticipated that we would have greater clarity by now about capital rules. So as time goes on and cash accumulates in the company, if we're trying to find that right balance between making sure that we have adequate capital imposed rules by the Fed on one hand, if we're finally designated. And on the other hand making sure we're here to our philosophy of returning excess capital to our shareholders.","So the dividend increase, I think is reflective of that consideration of the timing being pushed back and further accumulation of cash and again, you saw effectively another capital action back last year in the fall when we acquired ProVida for $2 billion in cash without issuing any shares in that acquisition. So we're trying to again strike that right balance.","And certainly in terms of what we're thinking about in the future, we have to really look at all these things from a perspective of both timing, how much cash we're accumulating, merger and acquisition opportunities for us, acquisition opportunities for us and our dividend levels and so on. So everything is really kind of part of a more complex equation that we consider as we look at capital management.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore","Okay. That's helpful. And then just two very quick business questions. In Asia, you referenced favorable expenses. How much did that positively influence the Asia earnings? And then in EMEA, if you talked about maybe the run rate being lower. How should we think about that as well?","John Hele","Hi. This is John. It's about $10 million for the Asia earnings on the expenses in the quarter as it's really just a matter of timing. I'm sorry but I missed the second part of the question?","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore","A similar comment on EMEA that the run rate was likely should be going forward is a little bit lower? Just trying to frame out how we should think about EMEA earnings?","John Hele","Slightly lower.","Mark Finkelstein - Evercore","Slightly lower. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Chris Giovanni of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Thanks so much. Steve, you made the comment about VA where you think you now might be in a position to grow with the better risk product. Is this still with 4% roll-up product? Are you looking to maybe re-risk the product to get back more in line with peers?","And then and thinking about kind of the growth year, I think one of the concerns you had with VA was uncertainty over the capital treatment for separate accounts the way the current bank framework is written. So if you're looking to now grow VA again, has this changed? What's changed I guess in terms of your confidence, the bigger VA book won't be an issue in federal oversight?","Steve Kandarian","So Chris let me take the first part of your question regarding the capital treatment of VAs. Then I'll turn it over to Bill for the business discussion about our strategy going forward.","Again, the rules are not written so we don't know exactly how the Fed will treat separate accounts. However, I'd say conversations we've been having with them and others in Washington are encouraging from the following perspective. I think they better understand today than they did a couple of years ago, how our business now differs from that of a bank. And I think they understand that the non-guarantee portion of VA is the true separate account component really it's not a risk to MetLife on its balance sheet. And banks don't have this separate account situation on their balance sheet. So there is even if the Collins amendment is not modified, I think an opportunity for the Fed to say bank rules just don't apply in this particular instance about separate accounts. So it is possible it's up to them obviously not me but it's possible for them to look at separate accounts and not assess significant capital charges or significant capital charges for the non-guarantee portion of that business for us.","And there's no indication by them one way or the other, but I would simply say the conversations we've had indicate more and better understanding on their part about what the risks really are associated with that part of our balance sheet which is virtually zero, if it's someone else's money that has been accounted for in our balance sheet. So with that I'll turn it over to Bill for the business question.","Bill Wheeler","Chris with regard to VA pricing and competitiveness, I know you know this, but obviously, you've seen a real hardening of that market in terms of product features and investment options and the roll-up rate is an important consideration, but it's really only one living benefit rider there is other things going on.","And I think the other thing that's happened of course is, you've seen a lot of sales now much broader diverse group of sales where there is no living benefit rider where the main motivation is tax efficiency or other things. And so our plan going forward is really to pursue all those of avenues, not just oh, we got to have a more aggressive living benefit rider, it's we've got to make sure that we are in all the other kinds of variable annuity products to meet specific customer needs.","And so when we talk about our strategy, that's a big piece of it. Now we're always looking at how we can change our living benefit rider and my guess is, we'll modify that as well but there is nothing to talk about at the moment. But that kind of gives you a little color on our thinking here.","Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Those comments helpful. And then just one on ROE, Steve, you made the comment that the group business despite some of this adverse underwriting is still generating good returns. And I know you don't want to get into kind of segmented allocation of capital. But clearly you are focused on growing certain lines of business. So how should we be thinking about the returns on kind of the in-force that you're generating on those kind of core businesses that you guys have?","And then what's maybe the drag that you're seeing from those run-off blocks that you've clearly deemphasized around long-term care and SGUL?","Bill Wheeler","Well, I'll give you a little color on that, Chris. Our protection businesses, we're talking mid to high teens ROEs and they have always been that way honestly that's the \u2013 even in what I would say a tough underwriting period. And obviously Group is really the leader there and it's quite attractive ROE business.","I would say the asset intensive businesses right now especially with the longer-term liability there go a long-term care and where there's been really low interest rates those ROEs are underperforming. And that's our challenge going forward as to \u2013 sort of work on the risk profile of those particular products, but at the same time grow the higher ROE business. And I would say obviously another factors in emerging markets ROE there is protracted this way.","Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","And Bill with those be point drags to ROE or basis point drags to ROE just speaking kind of an aggregate?","Bill Wheeler","You mean, you're asking order of magnitude of the drags?","Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Yes. I mean thinking about long-term care in SGUL, I mean clearly they are underperforming but is there kind of reducing aggregate ROEs by a point or are we talking basis points?","Bill Wheeler","Well, the long-term-care block in and of itself isn't that big. So it's relative to the size of MetLife. So I'm sure that would be bps not full basis \u2013 full points. But, yes, I would say in general, sure, those bigger \u2013 those more asset intensive long guarantee businesses have the impact on the ROEs point.","Chris Giovanni - Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Eric Berg of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks very much. The underwriting in 2013 was in some quarters quite challenging. And now you have another quarter of it although you have said that really relates to \u2013 now being there\u2019s no trend here. That doesn\u2019t necessarily tell you that you, that you got things are okay you might have a broader problem. My question is, when will we, when will you be in a position to sort of sound the all clear sign? If we have another quarter or two more quarters, how many quarters, how many quarters of normal underwriting results do you need before you can conclude that there is no problem? Thanks. That\u2019s my first question.","Bill Wheeler","Yes. Eric, you broke up a little bit, but I think I got the gist of your question which is, group underwriting experience last year was a little soft and now we\u2019ve had a soft quarter in the first quarter of 2014. How long until we feel better about it? There is, if you look back at our history especially in Group Life over time, in the first quarter we often run a mortality ratio of 90% plus, that\u2019s not that uncommon. This was a little worse than that, obviously, and so I would see this, I kind of view the Group Life experience as really kind of a seasonal quarter, but a tough seasonal quarter, tougher than normal.","In terms of the future, look, we \u2013 our expectation is that our underwriting, especially in Group Life should start, should revert to the mean in the second quarter. And if it doesn\u2019t, that\u2019ll be another data point, which would cause us concern. But that's our \u2013 that's why we kind of view this really as a blip, and there are definitely blips in these, in this experience, not a trend. So I \u2013 my expectation is, I should see improvement in the second quarter and if I don't I should be worried. And so that's kind of our feeling.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets","Very helpful. And, Steve, one follow-up question. On a global basis, it feels like the top line, and by the top line, I don't mean sales, I mean premium fees and other deposits, is growing at about 5% pace excluding the effect of currency. Is that consistent with your expectations? And how do you feel about that level of top line growth? Are you satisfied with that? Or should it be better? Do feel it's appropriate given the markets in which Met is competing, or do you feel it should be better still? Thank you.","Steve Kandarian","Eric, I think it's consistent with what our expectations are. But I also would point you to the my remarks a little bit earlier talking about essentially us pivoting from trying to get the risk profile of right of the company to now focusing on growth going forward. And I think that is \u2013 this is the right time for us to really think about those opportunities throughout MetLife's business platform, meaning through geographies, different products, and so on and to press on the issue of growth going forward.","So we've spent the last roughly three years trying to make sure that we had a risk profile in the right place, the products designed the way that we felt offered good value to our customers on the one hand, but also a fair return to our shareholders on the other hand, and didn't result in significant fat-tail risk in the future. That was sort of step one of the strategy here, in step two now that we're pivoting to what is, is finding ways to further grow the business.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Jay Gelb of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Thanks. John, can you give us a bit more insight on the sources of the net cost savings in 2015, the $600 million you broadly outlined?","John Hele","Sure. So these costs are really throughout the entire company. We've been focusing on many different aspects and taking out over the last few years layers of management particularly in the U.S. as well as the reorganization we've done in retail in the United States and moving people to Charlotte.","In the technology side, we've created a new center in Raleigh-Durham. And so you're starting now to see some of these flowing through, whereas in 2012 and 2013 we had more restructuring charges that were flowing through so the net basis was less. You're starting to see these cost saves flow through the entire company not just in the U.S. but also even in Asia and other areas we're seeing continued cost discipline. I think this is something that is starting to stick in our company and you're starting to see the results in our financials.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Is there a certain metric we should focus on in terms of trying to track that level of improvement in 2015 and beyond?","John Hele","It's the expense ratio. However, you do need to adjust a little bit if we had some material moves in our mix of business. So for example, in Latin America by the acquisition of ProVida that runs at a higher expense ratio very profitable business but a higher expense ratio. Without a mix change and for the whole company, it takes quite a bit to really shift that. So on a quarter-by-quarter basis you'll see that ratio be a very good measure. But I just caution you to adjust your models for when we do major material changes in the mix different businesses have slightly different expense ratios.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Okay. Then separate topic, I guess more for Steve and Bill. On variable annuity sales growth, you mentioned the likelihood that you could start growing VA sales growth again now with the new product in place and the new mix and less reliance on living benefits. Should we think about that as a low, mid-single-digit growth opportunity or perhaps something larger?","Bill Wheeler","I think if you think about the overall revenue of the business, yes, I'd say it's, I don't see this being a double-digit grower. Obviously, it somewhat depends on what's going on with the capital markets. But assuming those are benign, I don't expect it to be a double-digit grower.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","Is that starting in 2015 though?","Bill Wheeler","Well, I don't think we're \u2013 I think we\u2019re a little ahead of ourselves in terms of kind of giving specific forecasts for 2015 yet. But, I think what we're trying to do is make sure it's clear that we're still committed to the annuity business.","Jay Gelb - Barclays","Makes sense. Thank you.","Ed Spehar","Okay.

Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of the Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.","Steven A. Kandarian","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. I know that capital management is of great interest to our investors, and I trust you saw last week's announcement of a 49% increase in our common stock dividend, the first increase since 2007. Our new dividend results in a payout ratio of approximately 20%, which is in line with our peers. The dividend increase, as well as our plan to internally fund the $2 billion acquisition of AFP Provida, illustrates our commitment to making effective use of capital. Nevertheless, given prevailing regulatory uncertainty, we continue to assume no share repurchases in our 2013 plan.","Turning to our quarterly results. We are pleased to report that the year is off to a good start. The first quarter 2013 operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 12% over the first quarter of 2012. Operating earnings per share were $1.48, an 8% increase over the prior year period. And operating return on equity was 12.7% on an annualized basis.","Our operating earnings were aided by strong equity markets, favorable investment margins and good performance on expenses. Net income for the quarter was $956 million. The difference between net and operating income is primarily explained by derivative losses related to asymmetrical accounting treatment and noneconomic factors.","The first quarter included $411 million of after-tax derivative losses from economic hedges, where the associated risk does not have the same GAAP accounting treatment, as well as $269 million of after-tax derivative losses related to MetLife's own credit spread. John Hele will discuss our financial results in further detail in a few minutes.","As I said on our December guidance call, MetLife faces external headwinds that we cannot control, such as low interest rates and regulatory uncertainty. However, we are focusing on mitigating the impact of these headwinds and executing our strategy in the areas we can control to create shareholder value.","A good example of this is our effort to reduce expenses. We have said that the bulk of our expense saving opportunities are in the U.S., and our results reflect solid progress in this market, with total fixed operating expenses down 3% year-over-year. We are extremely pleased with this performance, especially considering that premiums, fees and other revenues in the U.S. were up 4% year-over-year and up 5% excluding pension closeouts. This expense margin improvement contributes $0.05 to earnings per share on a year-over-year basis. Expenses will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, but it's clear that our cost-saving initiatives are translating to improve bottom line results.","Going forward, we remain focused on achieving the full $600 million of annual pretax net expense savings discussed at our May 2012 Investor Day. The consolidation of our U.S. real estate footprint announced in March is an example of these efforts. By moving 2,600 retail and technology jobs to North Carolina, we are reducing labor and real estate costs, enabling better employee collaboration and driving efficiencies.","Sales growth in emerging markets is another area of strategic focus to drive shareholder value. First quarter results showed continued momentum on a year-over-year basis, with sales in Latin America up 20% and sales in the emerging economies in Europe, the Middle East and Africa up 40%, driven by strong results in the Gulf, Turkey and Russia.","The sales increase in emerging markets, combined with a 29% decline in U.S. variable annuity sales in the quarter, reflects substantial progress on our efforts to shift our business mix away from capital-intensive, market-sensitive products. We remain on track to sell $10 billion to $11 billion of variable annuities this year, which will be a decline of approximately 40% from last year.","Now let me turn to the current interest rate environment. With the 10-year Treasury yield falling back to below 1.7% and the 10-year Japanese government bond yield at less than 60 basis points, we recognize that investors and analysts are concerned about the potential impact of low rates on our business. However, our analysis suggests that a sustained low-rate environment is a manageable risk.","The current rate environment in the U.S. is very similar to the interest rate stress scenario discussed in our 2012 10-K filing, which assumes, among other things, a 1.69% 10-year Treasury through the end of 2014. Based upon these assumptions, operating earnings per share would decrease by $0.04 in 2013 and $0.13 in 2014.","In addition, we see incremental earnings risk if rates remain at current levels in Japan, but the estimated impact would be immaterial this year and less than $0.05 per share in 2014.","Next, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the regulatory environment. MetLife faces the possibility of being named a nonbank, systemically important financial institution, or SIFI, which would place us under Federal Reserve supervision. To date, MetLife has not been notified by the Financial Stability Oversight Council that we have been moved to Stage 3 of the process for designating SIFIs, although the conventional wisdom holds that we will be at some point. That is why I am spending time in Washington, participating in the debate on this important issue.","At a speech delivered at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce last month, I stated that the traditional business of life insurance does not present systemic risk to the U.S. economy and that MetLife should not be named a SIFI. My 3 main points were: one, the life insurance business did not cause the financial crisis; imposing bank centric regulations on certain life insurance companies, however well-intentioned, would negatively affect the availability and affordability of financial protection for consumers; and three, there's a better way for the federal government to regulate potentially systemic activities in the life insurance sector.","Rather than name a handful of life insurance companies as SIFIs, regulators should target those activities that caused the financial crisis in the first place. The Dodd-Frank Act defined a SIFI as a company whose failure could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United states. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, clarified that such a threat only exists if there would be an impairment of financial market functioning that would be sufficiently severe to inflict significant damage on the broader economy. There is no evidence that any traditional life insurance company is sufficiently interconnected with the rest of the financial system to meet that test.","To be clear, I am not suggesting that MetLife could never fail. What I am suggesting is that we cannot think of a single firm that would be brought down by its exposure to MetLife. For example, in our derivatives book, counter-party exposure to MetLife, net of collateral, is insignificant as a percentage of counter-party total capital. The average exposure in the event of a MetLife default is 0.25% of a derivatives dealer's total capital. The largest exposure is 0.75% of total capital, simply not large enough to create systemic risk. An approach that focuses on activities is more likely to capture systemic risk, regardless of the size of the firm. An activities-based approach is also consistent with how regulation of a life insurance business is evolving internationally. I am encouraged by the willingness of regulators and policymakers to listen to these perspectives and engage in a dialogue about these critical issues. My hope is that regulators will take into account the fundamental differences between banks and insurance companies as the prudential rules for nonbank SIFIs are being finalized.","In closing, we are focused on executing our strategy to create sustained value for shareholders over time. Our strong first quarter earnings had a meaningful increase on our common stock dividend illustrate our ability to manage through external challenges.","With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail.","John C. R. Hele","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, including a discussion on insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash, capital and guidance.","To begin, MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.6 billion or $1.48 per share, up 12% year-over-year. This quarter included 2 notable items. The first was in our retail annuities business. We had a nonrecurring benefit related to our assumption review for variable annuities, and some of the models required adjustment to reflect the full impact of the lower lapse rates. This increased operating earnings by $29 million after tax or $0.03 per share. Second, pretax variable investment income was $337 million, reflecting strong private equity returns and higher bond prepayments. After taxes and the impact of DAC, variable investment income was $217 million, which was $22 million or $0.02 per share above the top end of our 2013 quarterly guidance range.","Turning to our bottom line results. First quarter net income was $956 million or $0.87 per share and included net derivative losses of $410 million after tax. As Steve mentioned, the net derivative losses in the quarter included a $680 million after-tax loss, which is explained by 3 items: one, the tightening of Met's own credit spread; two, changes in currency rates, driven principally by the weakening of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar; and three, an increase in interest rates. These factors were partially offset by favorable VA hedge performance, favorable market conditions and changes in the in-force. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $47.37 at March 31, up 2% year-over-year.","Turning to margins. Underwriting in the U.S. was generally unfavorable this quarter. The mortality ratio in retail life was 92.7% due to unfavorable experience in both VUL [ph] and traditional life. This result was higher than the target range, which is in the mid-80s, and slightly worse than the 91.6% ratio in the first quarter of 2012. The mortality ratio in group life was 91.3% in the quarter, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 89.1% and above the target range of 85% to 90%. The increase in the mortality ratio was driven by more term claims and a higher average term life death benefit.","To give you a better sense of the earning sensitivity for retail life mortality, a 1-percentage-point change in the mortality ratio equates to quarterly operating earnings impact of approximately $2 million to $3 million. For group life, a 1-percentage-point change in the loss ratio equates to quarterly operating earnings impact of approximately $8 million to $10 million.","The group health benefit ratio was 88.9%, up 140 points from the prior year quarter of 87.5% but within the targeted range of 86% to 90%. A 1-percentage-point change in the loss ratio equates to operating earnings impact of approximately $10 million on a quarterly basis.","Next, let me discuss investment spreads. In our QFS, we now provide spreads, including and excluding the variable investment income. You will note that spreads remained healthy across all major product lines in the U.S., although we did see some modest year-over-year tightening in deferred annuities and corporate benefit funding. Overall, investment spreads were better than planned in the first quarter. However, we do anticipate that investment spreads will decline for the full year, but the earnings risk is relatively modest in 2013 and 2014 even if interest rates stay at current levels in the U.S. and Japan.","Turning to expenses. The operating expense ratio was 23.9% for the first quarter. Excluding the impact of pension and post-retirement benefits and closeouts, the operating expense ratio was 23.2%. This compares favorably to the first quarter of 2012, which had an operating expense ratio of 24.9% and 24.3% excluding pension and post-retirement benefits and closeouts. We are pleased with this performance as it reflects progress on our strategic goal to reduce net expenses by $600 million. However, results also benefited somewhat from the timing of expenses.","I will now discuss some of the business highlights in the quarter. Rather than go through every segment, I will focus on areas where our results may have differed from your expectations. Therefore, my comments will be on Retail, Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, Asia and EMEA.","Retail reported operating earnings of $626 million, a year-over-year increase of 33%. Normalized operating earnings were $581 million, after accounting for previously mentioned nonrecurring VA lapse adjustment of $29 million and variable investment income that was $16 million higher than planned. This variable investment income was about $3 million in retail annuities and $13 million in retail life and other. On a normalized basis, retail operating earnings were up 17% versus the first quarter of 2012 due to higher net investment income, lower ongoing DAC amortization annuities and lower operating expenses. These positive items were partially offset by unfavorable underwriting results in life.","Normalized operating earnings for retail annuities were $340 million, an increase of 21% from the prior year quarter. Growth was driven by favorable ongoing DAC amortization and lower expenses. We do not normalize for variances in separate account returns. And earnings and retail annuities were $33 million higher than planned, as a result of strong stock market performance in the quarter.","As a forward-looking rule of thumb, a 1-percentage-point change in the S&P 500 equates to approximately $1 million to $3 million of operating earnings in the current quarter and roughly $5 million of operating earnings in the next 12 months. These are just rules of thumb, and actual results will vary based on the equity bond mix in the separate accounts and the performance of other indices. Due to these factors, the market impact this quarter went slightly higher than the forward-looking rule of thumb.","This was a good quarter for retail annuities, with normalized operating earnings higher than planned by approximately $80 million. However, the results in the quarter benefited from items that may not occur in future quarters, and we continue to expect investment spread compression. Normalized operating earnings for retail, life and other were $241 million, an increase of 13% from the prior year. Earnings were as expected despite worse-than-expected mortality, as both investment margins and expenses were favorable.","Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits reported operating earnings of $230 million, down 5% year-over-year. After adjusting for normalizing items in both periods, which included variable investment income that was $4 million below plan in this quarter, normalized operating earnings were down 1% year-over-year. Higher interest margins, expense management and favorable underwriting in the dental business were more than offset by lower underwriting results in group life and long-term care. In long-term care, the benefit ratio was higher than planned due to higher incidence and reserve adjustments.","Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $333 million in the quarter, up 11% year-over-year and 12% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for normalized items in both periods, which included variable investment income of $10 million above planned this quarter, normalized operating earnings were up 12% from the prior year quarter. This was due to higher fee income from the surrender of certain fixed annuity products in Japan and an increase in net investment income.","The higher surrenders were largely the result of customers harvesting gains in foreign currency-denominated fixed annuity products, primarily those in Australian dollars. We believe the intent was to shift assets into equities as a result of the strong performance of the nick high [ph] and the topics, the early indication that surrenders will remain elevated in the second quarter.","Although we are only normalizing for variable investment income, it is important to note that the first quarter results may not be indicative of future quarters earnings. First, excess surrenders added $29 million after tax, and we assume that surrender activity will normalize eventually, plus there is lost earnings associated with these surrenders; second, there was a $10 million after-tax benefit from a loan repayment; third, the initial impact from the strong equity market in Japan at an $8 million after tax; finally, currency weakness could be a bigger negative in future quarters.","As we have stated previously, we have hedges for our 2013 projected yen-exposed operating earnings at strike prices at around JPY 90 to the U.S. dollar. These hedges are currency options which provide protection against the yen weakening beyond JPY 90 but allow us to participate in the upside should the yen strengthen. Our protection now extends in the first half of 2014, with currency options at around JPY 90 in place for the first quarter 2014 and at around JPY 95 for the second quarter 2014. Let me reiterate that we still believe the low end of our 2013 operating earnings guidance for Asia is a realistic expectation, even though our plan assumes a yen-dollar exchange rate of slightly less than JPY 82.","I'd like to close in Asia with a few comments on sales. Our first quarter sales were down 13% year-over-year and below our plan largely because of the weakness in bank channel sales. In Japan, our sales through banks were down 60% on a year-over-year basis. We are willing to trade business volume for business value as we remain disciplined on pricing.","Finally, EMEA had strong operating earnings of $87 million in the first quarter, up 21% year-over-year and 17% on a constant currency basis. The fundamental strength in the first quarter was driven by credit insurance in Russia, group medical in the Gulf and lower expenses. But there are also a couple of onetime favorable items related to Greece. These items were material for the segment but not the overall company.","I'd like to comment on a topic that I know is of great interest to our investors: cash. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.8 billion at the end of the first quarter, which is down from year-end but consistent with our plan given the anticipated timing of subsidiary dividends and holding company expenses.","Moving to our capital position, the combined RBC ratio for our principally U.S. insurance companies, excluding ALICO, at year-end 2012 was 466%. Also, as of December 31, 2012, our Japan solvency margin ratio was 909%. Our preliminary statutory operating earnings and statutory net income for our domestic insurance companies for the first quarter of 2013 was $793 million and $558 million, respectively. These results are lower than the prior year due to less favorable market conditions and underwriting. Our total adjusted capital is expected to approximately be $29.5 billion at the end of the first quarter 2013, up 1% from December 31.","Let me conclude by reiterating Steve's comment that the first quarter was a good start to 2013. By considering the outperformance in the quarter, we are comfortable with the top end of our 2013 EPS guidance range of $4.95 to $5.35. To help you think about the quarterly EPS run rate, we would suggest you consider a few things. Normalizing items aided first quarter operating EPS by $0.05. The excess of the initial earnings impact from the strong equity market relatively ongoing benefit added about $0.05 to first quarter EPS. The anticipated decline in our investment margins, even with the interest rate increase we assume in our plan, is expected to reduce quarterly EPS by more than $0.05 on average. The timing of expenses added a couple of pennies per share to the earnings in the first quarter mostly outside of the U.S. Also, you should assume that the unfavorable impact from the yen weakness for the remainder of the year and some normalization of surrender activity in Japan may be largely offset by the accretion from the acquisition of Provida, which is expected to close in the third quarter. Finally, we don't believe it's prudent practice to provide full year guidance on a quarterly basis, especially after only one quarter.","And with that, I will turn it back to Ed.","Edward A. Spehar","Thank you, John. Before we start Q&A, [Operator Instructions]. With that, Greg, if we could please take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to start with Steve, if I could. Yes, I thought your comments around the presentation you made in Washington were helpful. Could you provide any color on how the response has been and what the feedback was?","Steven A. Kandarian","Yes, indeed. I would say that the policymakers, people in the Hill, others in Washington are listening carefully to the arguments. There is a lot of debate going on. I think it's healthy. I think having these views on the table is important to make sure we get it right. This is an important industry. It affects millions of Americans across our country. And it's just really important that these financial protection products are still going to be available and affordable to people going forward, especially at a time when the social safety net's under a lot of pressure in our country. So I think people are being very thoughtful about the discussion, are listening carefully, and I'm hopeful that when things finally transpire here, that we'll get a solution that makes sense.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And anything on the timing of when things may transpire?","Steven A. Kandarian","We don't have any clarity on that, Suneet. Having statements coming out of FSOC that they think that the first designations of nonbank SIFIs will be coming, and the word they used was soon. But obviously, that word doesn't have really a great deal of specificity to it. So we have to wait and see how that sorts out.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then just a follow-up for John, if I could, on the holding company cash. I think you said $4.8 billion, down a little bit from year-end. If we think back to that cash flow roll-forward that you provided in December, and I know you had some items in there that were like placeholders, for example, the Dodd-Frank collateral. I'm not sure if we had real clarity on what the run rate holding company expenses were. But just sort of big picture, is that cash flow roll-forward pretty much the same based on where you sit today? Or has there been any changes to it other than the dividend, I understand that.","John C. R. Hele","Sure. The -- in the $4.8 billion is where we plan to be given the timing of our expenses and sub-dividends, how we get them in the flows in and out. We did have a placeholder, as we mentioned, for Dodd-Frank derivative collateral rules. Those are still a bit influx. The original rules that were specified last year in the U.S. were somewhat onerous. However, the international rules had a longer phase-in period and were not as onerous. There's still a discussion going on between which ones are going to be adopted. I believe they're leaning very much on the international, less onerous rules with a longer phase-in period. But for now, we're going to keep the placeholder in, and we'll have to see how things develop throughout the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question is, of the $600 million of cost saves that you're targeting, can you tell us where you're at on that? How much is in this quarter's run rate to date, and how much is still on the come-through? I think, Steve, you guys had said the $600 million should be realized by the end of '14. How much is still to come on that?","John C. R. Hele","We've gotten net, and this is mainly heading to the U.S. There's about $115 million, but we have some onetime costs of about $40 million. So the net to the bottom line is about $75 million.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And John, is that $75 million per quarter is hitting the bottom line right now?","John C. R. Hele","Yes.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. So you're not -- sorry, go ahead.","John C. R. Hele","So it's really $115 million, but there's a onetime cost of $40 million.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And you're not stripping out that one -- or are you stripping out that onetime cost from operating?","John C. R. Hele","No. No, it's included.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. Okay. So -- and that would be restructuring cost, I presume?","Steven A. Kandarian","Yes.","John C. R. Hele","Now the -- yes, some -- but some of our reinvestment, yes, the $600 million is a net number. So we plan to get to $1 billion with a $400 million reinvest over time when we get out there. So the -- we'll start to have some more reinvest heading then in future periods as well.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So should I view that, that you guys are more than half of the way there? Should I be netting that against the full year $600 million pretax number? Or should I be netting that against $1 billion? I just want understand how you're thinking about that $115 million in the context of your goal.","John C. R. Hele","Yes, I'd say we're about halfway there, maybe 1\/3 to 1\/2. The reinvestment timing is still going to be phased in, but we've made good progress here.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then the -- my follow-up is I just want to understand the yen sensitivity a little bit better at a higher level. Can you tell us what percent of your Asia earnings are actually Japan because, obviously, Korea is a pretty big contributor. So I want understand, of the $330 million, how much is Japan? And of the Japan, how much are yen-denominated earnings versus U.S. dollar-denominated earnings?","Christopher G. Townsend","Let me wait in that. It's Chris Townsend. Let me just wait in and give you the number in terms of the Japan proportion of the $333 million. The Japan earnings, overall, for the quarter of $303 million part of $333 million, and I think we're about 65% yen-based earnings on that.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Chris, that's 65% yen-based of the $303 million?","Christopher G. Townsend","That's correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","With capital, it's good to see the dividend increase last week. With buybacks, I know said your plan doesn't include any buybacks for this year. That said, you do have the dilutive equity units coming up later this year. Should we take it from your comments that offsetting the impact of those units is off the table? Or is that something you could still consider over the course of the year? Also, I know you noticed that currently, you didn't need the approval from the Fed. But would it be correct to assume that you did consult with them before going ahead with the dividend rates?","Steven A. Kandarian","Nigel, we think a strong dividend and buybacks are both important to our shareholders. Those are 2 goals of ours going forward. As you've seen, we've increased our dividend by 49% for the second quarter and going forward. And we've also mentioned today that there are no buybacks planned in 2013. That's what we're working with as an assumption. Clearly, the regulatory environment is a key factor in terms of what we do in regard to buybacks, and we're waiting for more clarity around that topic right now. So I think it's as prudent on our part to take a wait-and-see attitude around how the regulations sorts out here over the course of the year before we make commitments about buybacks.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And with the dividends, did you actually talk to -- with the Fed?","Steven A. Kandarian","No. In terms of talking to the Fed, as you know, we sold our bank in January. We legally de-banked in February. We're no longer regulated by the Federal Reserve. It wouldn't be appropriate for us to go to them at this point in time, although I'll tell you that, certainly, we went through the stress test exercise in late 2011, early 2012. We had $1.10 dividend request in that test, and we already made that public. Back in 2012, we made that public. So the Fed certainly is aware of our desire to have $1.10 dividend.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just a second, with annuities, as you mentioned, you had a positive impact this quarter from lower lapses on your DAC for variable annuities. I guess my concern is that lower lapses can actually be a sizable problem for guaranteed minimum income benefit products. Accordingly, can you discuss what sort of lapse assumptions you're seeing in your statutory accounting for variable annuities and how that compares to the lapse activity that you're currently seeing?","John C. R. Hele","Well, the -- this is John. The lapse assumptions are consistent with what we communicated at the last quarter in terms of the changes to the lapse functions. We had a slight model refinement in the calculating of the impact on operating earnings. It had no impact below the line and statutory assumptions are the same as we used for GAAP.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question on the pace of VA sales. I know $3.5 billion is probably a little bit outsized considering that you still have the old product for the first month. Could give us a sense of old product versus new products mix between that $3.5 billion?","William J. Wheeler","Yes, most of the first quarter sales were old product because even if they actually stop taking new apps, there was a lot of throughput that got processed ultimately through the quarters. So most was old product. The old products, by the way, still had an attractive ROI this quarter because, obviously, hedging costs have come down. But now, new -- sales for the remainder of the 9 months should be all GMIB Max V, the new product. And in terms of our ability to hit our run rate, we're currently tracking at a weekly sales rate that we think we'll still be able to hit that sales goal comfortably.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I had a question. You mentioned -- on interest rates, you mentioned the EPS impact of lower rates through 2014. Could you talk about potential for DAC or reserve charges over the next few years if rates remain at these levels, especially in products like long-term care? And then also how should the impact of lower rates compound beyond 2014 if we're sort of in this environment for more than a year or so?","William J. Wheeler","Jimmy, it is Bill Wheeler. With regard to long-term care, a couple things to keep in mind, that we've added to statutory reserves over a long period of time, which is, of course, where any likely reserve impact would be. It would be a long ways away from GAAP adjustments. The -- and I think we feel that with regard to what we're doing, with regard to long-term care in terms of price increases, as well as on the in-force, as well as the fact that we've really built up reserves over time prudently, make us feel that the likelihood of adjustments even with the low [ph] level of interest rates is pretty low.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And that goes for other products as well?","John C. R. Hele","Yes, so we have given you some guidance here. Steve gave you some operating earnings sensitivities to lower rates. We still have a meaner version assumptions on very long-term contracts that do gear up over time, and we are comfortable with that now and are comfortable for the foreseeable future. We still have the Federal Reserve doing extensive bond-buying in the markets. We're not certainly in normal situations. I think we have to wait and see for some period of time how that would resolve, and we would rethink about our long-term assumptions. But for now and for '13, certainly, and going into '14, we're comfortable with our long-term assumptions, which is what drives the GAAP and DAC.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But you'd review on like -- and then you're assuming a slight increase in rates over time and it does not materialize over the first -- or it has an extended period of low rates than you just look at those on an annual basis, I guess?","John C. R. Hele","We kind of look at this -- we look at this on an annual basis because we have very long-term contracts. Long-term care is probably the longest of the liabilities, so we have long liabilities. The pension business, the life insurance is all very long-term liabilities, and you have to really think carefully about how you set these long-term assumptions given we're still in the aftermath of '08, with a lot of activity by federal governments looking at and working on interest rates. So we will take it year by year and think it through carefully.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just on SIFI, have you done any internal studies that would just assess what the -- what your balance sheet would look like if it was subjected to like a Basel-type capital standards? Because just if you do a big picture analysis, it seems like as the insurance companies were subjected to bank-based standards, they would be significantly short on capital. Is that a correct assessment?","Steven A. Kandarian","Jimmy, it's Steve. The questions of being what Basel standards, and we've heard from officials in Washington, is it going to be Basel I for insurance companies? Will it be some other form of Basel? Will it not be Basel? It's really very much up in the air right now, and that's why we continue to make the argument in Washington that whatever rules come forward for nonbank SIFIs should be tailored to the industry they're regulating and not relate to a bank or bank-like approach for regulation.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, but under Basel III, the insurance companies' statements that have just given the capital charges on the various investments seems like the large insurance companies, if they are subjected to SIFI, they would be significantly undercapitalized. I don't know if you've done an analysis of that internally.","Steven A. Kandarian","A straight Basel 3 regime, it would be a very difficult capital regime for us to operate under. There's no question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I have a question on Japan sales. I think, John, that you mentioned that sales were down about 13% year-over-year, but that was driven heavily, I guess, by the bank channel, which was down 60. I was wondering if maybe -- whether you or Chris could give us maybe a little bit more of a breakdown. I'm unclear on what percentage of overall Japan sales actually come through the bank channel and maybe what some of the third sector and non-single premium whole life sales, what kind of growth rates were you seeing there?","Christopher G. Townsend","Okay. Let me have a shot at this. First of all, the bank business overall in Japan makes up about 15% to 20% of the total AMB for Japan. Of that, the fixed annuity foreign currency product that John referenced make up about 50% of the total there. So overall, we've seen that bank channel down 60%. So a rather significant reduction. And I think in terms of the surrenders you're seeing that John referenced, you'll see those continue for all the way through the second quarter. And we expect the channel -- the bank channel to be down about 30% to 35% for the full year. In terms of the A&H business, we're down 6% for the quarter, which is in line with the market. And we expect to be flat on A&H overall for the year. So with all of these moving parts, we would expect sales in Japan probably to be flat year-on-year. And overall, for Asia, given all the other countries you got in the region, we expect sales, the AMB number for the year to be about 5% up year-on-year. I would just caution you in terms of the bank sales. The -- a good portion of our earnings in Japan come predominantly from the A&H business and second from the life business, which are in reasonably good shape. And the big benefit of what we got there is the bundling capability on the A& H, where we intend to get about 60% to 65% of the life sales bundled with an A&H product, which gives us a good edge in that market overall.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then I guess, just thinking about interest rates a little bit more, I was wondering if you could give us some sense for how much portfolio overall turnover you're expecting this year and next?","William J. Wheeler","Well, I don't know that we've historically talked about portfolio turnover a lot, John. But I think our activities, we make projections on what we expect. I think the first quarter, we probably had a little more portfolio turnover than normal just given the rate environment and some of the [indiscernible] and interest rates and the like. But overall, if we look at -- historically, we look at the last several quarters, I mean, our turnover is pretty much in line with what we see for typical industry statistics.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then just real quick, any sort of outlook commentary you can provide with respect to variable investment income for the remainder of the year? I mean, you've got a pretty wide quarterly range and always want to be careful about trying to model all the way at the upper end of the range, which is what you adjust against. But any commentary there would be helpful.","William J. Wheeler","Sure. Again, there is a reasonable correlation between equity market performance and a good portion of our variable investment income, so you have to take into consideration what happened in the first quarter. We saw a very strong equity market, so I think, certainly, the near term, meaning the second quarter have to be strong. And as we look forward for the rest of the year, we're not projecting necessarily continued -- the continued same performance in the markets. So we're back probably comfortable with the plan. And overall, I think that means we are -- we feel very comfortable with the VII plan right now. We probably think we'll be closer towards the top of the plan. But obviously, anything can happen in the second half of the year.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then, Steve, just around that. A lot of private equity firms, the distributions are quite elevated and appear to be -- it appears that it's going to remain that way. Are you reinvesting such that we ought to expect private equity investments in total to remain relatively stable as we look forward?","William J. Wheeler","Yes. Yes, we have ongoing commitments to private equity. We like the sector, and we'll continue to at least maintain our investment level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Finkelstein from Evercore Partners.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you just talk about the strategy on hedging the yen in Japan and maybe just give thoughts on an endgame? I mean, you obviously kind of layered into the first quarter of '14, you layered into the second quarter of '14 at JPY 95. Where do you expect to get to and what is kind of the longer-term strategy?","John C. R. Hele","Right. This is John, Mark. Currency is always an interesting thing to think about. We have decided, we take it quarter-by-quarter. We meet and decide, do we want to take a position on the yen or not? We did so far with input from our investment group and thinking about our business there. But again, it is a quarter-to-quarter plan for us in terms of how we think about it. And we've got the protection that we've told you about.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I guess would you expect to kind of build hedges that get you through '14 based on kind of current conversations?","John C. R. Hele","We haven't decided.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just, I guess, a follow-up question on Asia earnings and just thinking about the higher lapses, maybe going back to kind of -- I think it was Nadel's [ph] question. The -- should we infer from the commentary that the higher lapses that you've seen and that you are going to continue to see into to see into this quarter are not material to the overall earnings? Or should we be thinking about an earnings strain? And if so, how much?","Christopher G. Townsend","It's Chris Townsend, again. Let me -- I guess the way you should think about this overall is that the surrender fees we're getting -- or the surrender penalties we're getting at the moment are the net of DAC and variable amortization in the market value adjustment. So that $29 million you've got in the first quarter is effectively a prepayment to the profit for the life of the contract. So what you're seeing is, economically, we're being made whole for our profit. If the contract just stayed in place, you'd probably see those earnings spread over, over the life of the -- probably, it's around 7 years, the average amount of the contract. So I think for the first 2 quarters of the year, what you'd expect to see is earnings deficiency of about $2 million to $3 million per quarter for the life of the 7 years of the contract.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just would you expect the second quarter to kind of look like the first quarter in terms of that $29 million?","Christopher G. Townsend","We would. As I said before, we'd expect the same sort of surrender fee income at the moment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Giovanni from Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess first question regarding the Provida transaction. So one of your competitors did a large-claim pension deal, pointing to better-than-expected earnings partly attributable to more customers that actually stayed in the plan post the deal announcement than what was expected. So I'm curious if you can provide any insight around what you're seeing in terms of retention since the deal was announced,","William J. Wheeler","Chris, it's Bill Wheeler. So remember, we won't close until sometime in the third quarter. That's our expectation. And I would tell you, I think Provida's performance in the first -- for the first part of this year has been right on track. And in terms of profitability and ongoing business, I haven't seen a fluctuation one way or another. So it's looking good.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess regarding VA policyholder behavior, there's certainly a lot of focus around lapse assumptions. But I wanted to ask about sort of annuitization trends. So your GMIB product, I guess, it's really at a point where you're likely starting to see some policyholder behavior trends on annuitization take-ups. So I wanted to see if you can comment on those trends sort of relative to maybe your original expectations and then your current assumptions for reserves.","William J. Wheeler","Yes, sure. My guess is we'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but I'll give you some sense of what we're doing. A very small portion of our GMIB block is available to be annuitized today, so I think roughly 5%, maybe even a little less than that. So there's not a lot of data yet on the experience in terms of people deciding to annuitize. That said, the level of annuitizations right now is very low, and even for even for products that are in the money, they -- so we're seeing a quite low level of annuitizations. But I think we haven't decided to react to that yet because it's very early days and not many people have had the opportunity to annuitize yet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Just getting back to the policyholder surrenders in Japan. I'm just wondering, if the yen is weakening, why the policyholders would want to give up their exposure to policies denominated in foreign currencies?","Christopher G. Townsend","Yes, what we're seeing there is the people are taking advantage of the significant rise in the equity markets in Japan and lock it in some of the foreign currency gains. So you've seen all of these [ph], that most of them, it's about 60\/40 in terms of Australian dollar versus U.S. dollars, the mix of these fixed annuities. But it's effectively taking the benefit and putting it into mutual funds in the equity markets.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just is there any color on what's driving the sales growth in Latin America? You call out Mexico in direct marketing. Is there anything to note there?","Steven A. Kandarian","No. It's very consistent with our plan in terms of 20-plus percent sales growth year-over-year. That was our expectation. Look, we're -- and a lot of that is driven by direct marketing, but it's really coming in a lot of areas of the business as well.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steven Schwartz from Raymond James.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I want to follow up on -- I think it was Chris' question. Bill, while you haven't seen a whole lot of annuitization yet, have you seen any changes in the usage of dollar-for-dollar withdrawals on the GMIB?","William J. Wheeler","No. But we -- when we designed the product, we assumed that there would be a certain level of dollar-for-dollar usage, and there is, and it has not changed. Remember, though, that now in the new products, the -- or the new GMIB, the dollar-for-dollar benefit, though it still exists, is much less attractive.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Steve, if I can follow up in your discussion about the dividend, were you saying that you had basically run through the current dividend through the CCAR test that the Fed found you deficient on?","Steven A. Kandarian","No. That -- that's not what I was saying. I was asked a question earlier if we informed the Fed or ran by the Fed our decision to raise the dividend to $1.10 before announcing that. So I said was because we're no longer regulated by the Fed, it would be inappropriate for us to go them seeking approval or something of that nature. But I noted that when we went through the stress test, that was our -- part of our submission was having $1.10 dividend. So they're certainly aware of our desire to raise the dividend to $1.10 for the common shareholder.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Got it. And then one more, if I may. There was a -- I think, there was a reference to a yen loss -- a currency exchange loss, and I think it was the yen, with regards to net investment income. Is this akin to what prudential has reflected over the last couple of quarters with liabilities being treated differently from the asset?","John C. R. Hele","No. We don't have that issue that prudential does. We have multicurrency reporting and that we avoid that volatility that prudential has.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","With regard to the share buyback, many of us are expecting that Met can resume share buybacks in 2014. Is that a reasonable assumption?","John C. R. Hele","I honestly don't know. We'll see what happens in 2013 in terms of regulation. We'll have a much greater clarity. It is our goal, as I mentioned earlier, to provide a good yield on our stock through an appropriate dividend and also to have share buybacks as part of our capital management process going forward. But we have to see how things sort out here in the current year around regulation coming out of Washington.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then switching gears for John, just so I understand that normalized run rate of operating earnings in the first quarter. If you normalize for the items you outlined, we get to a range of around $1.30 for the first quarter. Am I thinking about that the right way?","John C. R. Hele","Jay, you're good at math. That's exactly what I would think.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I can still subtract.","John C. R. Hele","You're still doing a good job, I guess.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then for Bill, what implied volatility assumption are you using for variable annuities?","William J. Wheeler","Well, you mean when we price, is that what you're referring to?","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes.","William J. Wheeler","Right around 100%. Or excuse me, not the implied volatility. The implied volatility is the hedging cost in total, we're assuming at about 100% when we priced. Right now, of course, they're running at about 115%, I think, or that's where they were for the first quarter.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And what duration liability do you use for implied vol?","William J. Wheeler","I think it's the 5-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just to make sure this was really is that. With regards to the dividends, when I listened to the last quarter's call, it seemed like it was very cautious on any capital deployment before there was additional clarity from regulators. So what exactly changed since that call and into the point that the dividend was increased by 50%?","John C. R. Hele","Yes, I know that some people wanted me to make some statement as soon as we sold the bank. But we're not at the point where we're going to declare the dividend for the second quarter yet, and we have a process, of course, under normal corporate governance to go to our board and get approval for any sort of capital action of that nature. So the timing just wasn't right for us to make any declaration at that point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Smith from Scotia Capital.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Yes, I just -- most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I wanted to go back just to the capital management topic one last time, understanding that there's no expectation for share repurchase in 2014, you've already taken action on the dividend, you have a $2 billion Provida deal to close. Where do you stand in terms of capital deployment with respect to additional acquisitions? Because it seems that there has been some increased activity in that market right now. So could we look for potentially another deal this year? I mean, we don't want to build it into our expectations, but would that be a possibility?","John C. R. Hele","So I just wanted to make one correction. I think you said 2014 may be you meant 2013.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","2013. Sorry.","John C. R. Hele","Yes, okay, so just to clarify that. So no expectations of share buybacks in 2013, although, as I mentioned, the Provida deal, $2 billion approximately, will be a cash transaction, so we'll be using capital in that sense. I think that, as a practical matter, regulators look at acquisitions differently than share buybacks. Acquisitions should be generating earnings and have assets involved and so on. So we certainly will be looking at transactions over the course of this year, as we always do. There's nothing we can talk about at this point in time about a deal on the horizon, but we certainly look at most anything that comes in the market that could make sense from us strategically. And at that point in time, we'll make a decision about how we finance it if there were to be another deal going forward.","Edward A.

A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because of MetLife believes it is not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and that derivative gains and losses which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.

In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve. ","Steve Kandarian","Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $1.28 and a net loss of $1.94. Capital market movements during the quarter, primarily the strong rise in interest rates, produced net losses in our derivative portfolio. ","We own derivatives almost exclusively to protect against market fluctuations in interest rates, equities and currencies. An outsized post-election move in interest rates, characterized by the 85-basis point quarterly increase in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, affected the carrying value of our derivative portfolio to a greater degree than typical. Much of this is due to asymmetrical insurance accounting which marks assets, including derivatives, to fair value, while related insurance liabilities follow an accrual-based accounting model. ","Despite almost all of our derivatives being used for hedging purposes, fewer than 15% qualify for hedge accounting. As a result, the change in the quarterly value of most of our derivatives flows through our income statement, while changes in the economically hedged risk do not. ","As in past quarters, the vast majority of our after-tax net income impact, approximately 94% in the fourth quarter, represents asymmetrical and a non-economic movement that would reverse with a decline in interest rates. Despite these accounting-related volatility, rising interest rates remains favorable for MetLife over the longer term. Included in our disclosure for the quarter is a slide that offers more detail on the fair value movements of our derivative portfolio which a John Hele will discuss later in our presentation. ","Adjusting for notable items in the quarter, operating earnings were $1.35 per share which compares to $1.33 per share on the same basis in the prior-year period. The only notable items in the quarter were $58 million of net insurance adjustments spread across the MetLife Holdings and Brighthouse segments and $28 million of spending incorporated in other, associated with the unit cost initiative we discussed at Investor Day. ","Taking a closer look at operating earnings, we benefited from disciplined expense control, higher variable investment income and a lower tax rate. Offsetting these positives, were lower underwriting margins in our U.S. businesses and Brighthouse Financial. ","Our full-year 2016 effective tax rate was 21.0%, modestly below the 22.1% estimate we provided on our third quarter call. In the fourth quarter, our effective tax rate was 17.3%. The reversal of a tax item and the timing of tax credits account for much of the difference in the quarterly rate. ","Our investment portfolio is starting to benefit from higher interest rates. Our new money rate rose from 2.89% in the third quarter to 3.15% in the fourth quarter. In absolute terms, recurring investment income was flat compared to a year ago, as higher asset balances served to offset the roll off of higher-yielding securities. ","Variable investment income of $301 million came in just above the low end of our quarterly guidance range and was aided by another strong quarter of private equity returns. For the full year, VII totaled $1.16 billion, falling only modestly below our annual range of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. ","Looking back on 2016, MetLife took a number of actions that we believe will enable the Company to perform well in a variety of macroeconomic environments. The year began with the announcement of our plan to separate a substantial portion of our U.S. retail business. This decision to part with MetLife's original business dating back to 1868 was not made lightly and we're confident that the separation will allow both companies to achieve greater success, with each offering a unique value proposition to investors. ","In March of 2016, MetLife achieved a significant regulatory victory when the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia rescinded our designation as a systemically important financial institution, with Judge Rosemary Collyer calling the process fatally flawed. When MetLife announced its intention to seek judicial review of FSOC's decision, few gave us any chance of success. We believe our decision to contest the designation contributed to FSOC reform, emerging as a key focus for policymakers. ","After announcing our separation plan in January, we achieved a number of additional milestones throughout the year. We chose a name for the new Company, Brighthouse Financial; we appointed the Company's Senior Leadership Team; we completed the initial filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; and we began the process of seeking various state regulatory approvals that will be required. ","As you know, the separation of our U.S. retail business is central to a larger refresh of MetLife's enterprise strategy which is part of our accelerating value initiative. While strategy needs to continually adapt to the external environment, it is important to put stakes in the ground at key inflection points to show the direction the Company is taking. We did this in May of 2012 and again in November of 2016. We believe the course MetLife is following toward less capital-intensive and less market-sensitive businesses is both clear and correct. ","As I said at Investor Day, capital is precious. Our enhanced capital budgeting process ensures that we prioritize businesses with high-risk-adjusted internal rates of return, lower capital intensity and maximum cash generation. ","Another essential component of our refresh strategy is our commitment to operational excellence. From a cost perspective, this is driving a cultural shift at MetLife. Our expense targets are no longer absolute; rather, they are relative. If our revenues drop or our competitors become more efficient, our expense reduction targets will go up. The $1-billion target we announced in 2016 was a point-in-time estimate. It has already moved higher to ensure we can deliver $800 million in run rate savings to the bottom line by 2020, net of stranded overhead. ","In conjunction with the rollout of our refresh strategy, we also launched our refresh brand. This was another pivotal decision that made 2016 one of the most transformative years in MetLife's history. Our new logo is modern, fresh and professional and our new tagline, Navigating life together, embodies the trusted partnership our corporate and individual customers across the globe tell us they want from MetLife. ","MetLife closed out 2016 on a strong note with the announcement of a $3-billion share buyback program, the largest in our history. We're confident that our capital return plans will not face regulatory hurdles from the federal government. We repurchased $302 million in shares through the end of 2016 and remain an opportunistic buyer of our stock. Since year end, we've acquired another $283 million of our shares. ","Looking ahead, we're encouraged the higher interest rates and the prospects for a more favorite regulatory environment, coupled with internal factors such as our new enterprise strategy, capital management and expense discipline, will position us for value creation for both our customers and shareholders. ","I would like to end this morning by thanking MetLife's employees for their tremendous effort, dedication and focus over the past year. We're asking a great deal of them to ensure that MetLife's transformation is successful and I very much appreciate their hard work. With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our Q4 and full-year 2016 financial results in greater detail. John? ","John Hele","Thank you, Steve and good morning. Today, I'll cover our fourth quarter results, including a discussion of our insurance underwriting margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash on capital. Based on your feedback, we released additional disclosure last night labeled 4Q 2016 supplemental slides that addresses the large, more complex elements in the quarter, the large derivative loss and the fourth quarter tax rate. I will speak to these slides later in my presentation. In the future, we will release additional supplemental slides when we have complex elements in a quarter. ","Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion, $1.28 per share. This quarter included a two notable items which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplements or QFS. First, changes in DAC associated with the annual fourth quarter approval of an increase in the dividend scale for traditional life insurance policies, primarily in MetLife Holdings, along with other insurance adjustments, decreased operating earnings by $58 million or $0.05 per share, after tax. ","Second, severance expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased operating earnings by $28 million or $0.03 per share, after tax. Adjusted for all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 1% year over year. On a per-share basis, operating earnings adjusted for all notable items were $1.35, up 2% year over year. ","Turning to our bottom-line results, we had a fourth quarter net loss of $2.1 billion or $1.94 per share. Net income was $3.5 billion lower than the operating earnings, primarily because of derivative losses of $3.2 billion after tax. For more details about the difference between operating earnings and net income, please reference page 3 in our supplemental slide disclosure this quarter. ","Page 4 in the supplemental slides shows the attribution of the after-tax derivative loss. As Steve noted, a significant rise in U.S. interest rates this quarter primarily drove this result. The interest rate impact in the fourth quarter was a loss of $2.2 billion after tax on derivatives outside our VA program, as highlighted in the slides. However, more than this amount, $2.3 billion, is what we consider asymmetrical accounting driven by current U.S. GAAP. ","In addition, the change in fair value of the embedded derivatives in our VA program this quarter accounted for a loss of $854 million after tax or the vast majority of the remainder. More than half of this total or $467 million after tax, was due to nonperformance risk, also commonly referred to as owned credit. We view owned credit as noneconomic. In total, $3 billion out of the $3.2 billion after-tax derivative loss or approximately 94%, was attributable to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting. ","Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $49.83 as of December 31, down 3% year over year, primarily due to the impact of the derivative losses. Tangible book value per share was $41.14 as of December 31, also down 3% year over year. ","With respect to fourth quarter underwriting margins, total company earnings were lower by approximately $0.16 per share versus the prior-year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting and Brighthouse accounted for approximately $0.10 of the total decrease, primarily due to the previously disclosed quarterly impact of the loss of the aggregation benefit in a veritable and universal life or VNUL, as well as unfavorable mortality. ","Excluding Brighthouse, underwriting earnings were lowered by approximately $0.06 per share year over year. This was primarily due to less favorable mortality experience in Group Benefits and MetLife Holdings, as well as a one-time $14 million reserve adjustment in long term care to update assumptions on 2016 claims. ","The Group life mortality ratio was 88.2%, unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 86.8%, but within the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We had a reserve refinement on a small block of claims this quarter. Adjusting for this refinement, the Group life mortality ratio was 86.9%, essentially in line with the prior-year quarter. For full-year 2016, the Group life mortality ratio was 87.2%, below the midpoint of its targeted range. ","MetLife Holdings interest adjusted benefit ratio for life products was 63.5%, higher than the prior-year quarter of 58.7%, due to claim severity and less favorable reassurance on some large claims. Finally, the Group nonmedical health interest adjusted loss ratio was 76.2%, favorable to the prior-year quarter of 77.0% and modestly better than the 2016 annual target range of 77% to 82%. For full-year 2016, the interest adjusted loss ratio for nonmedical health was 78.3%, below the midpoint of the targeted range. ","Turning to investment margins, the weighted average of the three product spreads in our QFS was 165 basis points in the quarter, up 11 basis points year over year. We believe a weighted average is the better measure for U.S. spreads in our QFS as retirement and income solutions represents roughly 3\/4 of the total asset base for Remain-Co. ","Pre-tax variable investment income or VII, was $301 million, up $192 million versus the prior-year quarter, driven by strong private equity performance. Product spreads excluding VII were 133 basis points this quarter, down 3 basis points year over year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline. Overall, higher investment margins in the second quarter accounted for approximately $0.05 of EPS improvement year over year. ","In regards to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.0% and 22.7% after adjusting for the notable items this quarter related to the Company's unit cost initiative. The ratio was favorable to the prior-year quarter of 24.4% which did not include any notable expense items primarily due to the sale of Premier Client Group expense efficiencies. Overall, better expense margins contributed approximately $0.11 of EPS improvement versus the prior-year quarter. ","I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Group Benefits reported operating earnings of $174 million, up 14% and 9% adjusted for notable items in the prior-year quarter. Primary drivers were favorable expense margins and volume growth. This is partially offset by less favorable mortality experience. ","Group Benefits operating PFOs were $4 billion, up 5% year over year, driven by growth across all markets. Full-year 2016 Group Benefits sales were up 24% over the prior year, with strong growth across most products and market. ","In addition, we're pleased with the start of the 2017 sales and renewal season. We're seeing continued strong persistency and solid sales across all market segments, as well as in both core and voluntary products. As a result, we expect 2017 PFO growth to be at the higher the end of our target range of 3% to 5%, excluding the loss of a large dental contract as discussed on our outlook call. ","Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS, reported operating earnings of $299 million, of 27% and 28% after adjusting for notable items in the prior-year quarter. The key drivers were higher investment margins and favorable underwriting. RIS operating PFOs were $895 million, up 5% year over year due to higher pension risk transfers or PRT which can be lumpy. We closed to PRT transactions totaling more than $500 million in the quarter. We continue to see a good PRT pipeline and expect 2017 to be an active year for transactions of all sizes. Our approach will continue to balance growth with an efficient use of capital. ","Property & Casualty or P&C, operating earnings were $43 million, down 2% and 23% as adjusting for notable items in the prior-year quarter. The primary driver was less favorable auto results due to increased loss severity. Our claim frequency and average premium were close to expectations. ","We have been taking targeted rate increases over the last 12 months and the fourth quarter of 2016, the average premium increase on renewing customers was approximately 7%. We continue to take similar rate increases in 2017. We expect these price increases, along with other management actions, to move the auto combined ratio toward the upper end of our 2017 guidance range of 95% to 100%. ","P&C operating PFOs were $887 million, up 1% year over year. Overall P&C sales were down 9% to due to price increases and management actions to drive value. ","Turning to Asia, operating earnings were $354 million, up 22% from the prior-year quarter and 8% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in the prior-year quarter. The key drivers were volume growth, favorable market impacts and a tax-related item in Japan. The stronger equity market in Japan and stronger dollar versus the yen helped earnings for the quarter through asset appreciation. Although Asia had a strong quarter, operating earnings excluding the one-time tax item and the favorable market conditions this quarter were in line with our guidance of $310 million plus or minus 5%. ","Asia operating PFOs were $2.1 billion, up 5% from the prior-year quarter, but down 2% on a constant currency basis, due to the deconsolidation of the Company's India operations. Excluding the impact of the India deconsolidation, PFOs were up 2% on a constant currency basis, driven by business growth in the life and A&H markets in Japan. Asia sales were essentially unchanged year over year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value in targeted markets. Sales in emerging markets were up 13%. ","Latin America reported operating earnings of $122 million, down 22%, but up 5% constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in the prior-year quarter. The key drivers were favorable one-time tax items in the current quarter and volume growth. ","Latin America operating PFOs were $913 million, down 2%, but up 5% on a constant currency basis. Total sales were essentially unchanged on a constant currency basis as higher group sales were offset by lower [indiscernible] sales.","EMEA operating earnings were $72 million, up 33% year over year and 44% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were lower expenses and the unit cost initiative, a claims reserve release in the Gulf and volume growth. EMEA operating PFOs were $622 million, essentially unchanged from the prior-year period and up 4% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth of employee benefits. We continue to see a favorable shift towards higher margin products. Total EMEA sales increased 5% on a constant currency basis. ","MetLife Holdings which primarily consists of our legacy retail and long term care runoff businesses, reported operating earnings of $199 million, down 25% year over year. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were down 3%, as unfavorable underwriting and investor margins were partially offset by lower expenses, including those related to the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group in 2016. MetLife Holdings operating PFOs were $1.6 billion, down 9% year over year, mostly due to sale of MetLife Premier Client Group which included the Company's affiliated broker dealer unit. ","Brighthouse Financial or BHF operating earnings were $330 million, down 15% and 32% after adjusting for notable items in both quarters. The key drivers were unfavorable underwriting and life reserve changes. Including $44 million of the ongoing impact from the loss of the aggregation benefit for GAAP-reserve testing associated with the VNUL business, as well as lower sever account fees. ","The $44-million impact was consistent with our prior guidance discussed on our 3Q earnings call. However, ongoing higher universal life reserves following a previously discussed model change in Q2 were $20 million in the quarter. In addition to the $10-million guidance, there was a one-time reserve adjustment for another $10 million. ","As a reminder, the Brighthouse Financial segment results within MetLife's financial statements do not match the financial statements at Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and related companies shown in the most recent Brighthouse form 10 filings due to accounting timing differences. ","BHF operating PFOs were $1.3 billion, down 15% year over year. Excluding the impact of single-premium income annuities and reinsurance recaptures, operating PFOs were down 8% due to lower fees for annuities as a result of continued negative fund flows. BHF continues to see strong sales growth from Shield Level Selector which was up 45% year over year. ","Next, I would like to discuss the Company's a low effective tax rate this quarter of 17.3%. As highlighted on page 5 of the supplemental slides, the key drivers were revised estimates of the U.S. tax on the dividend from Japan which reversed the tax expense taken into 2Q 2016; increased tax credits; an inter quarter catch-up adjustment; and a favorable audit settlement. ","Excluding these items, the Company's effective tax rate was 21.7% for the fourth quarter and full-year 2016. The 21.7% is reasonably close to the prior guidance we provided of 21.1% in the third quarter. Going forward, the Company's tax rate is projected to be approximately a 23%, consistent with our outlook call guidance. ","I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets of the holding companies were approximately $5.8 billion at December 31 which is up from $5.6 billion at September 30. This increase reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, payment of our quarterly common dividend, share repurchases and other holding company expenses. ","Please note that cash at the holding companies at year end was roughly $1 billion higher than anticipated. This was due to higher-than-projected cash of approximately $625 million, mainly due to lower collateral for derivatives and taxes, as well as timing of retail separation costs of close to $375 million which were shifted from 2016 to 2017. Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect MetLife to receive between $3.3 billion to $3.8 billion in dividends from Brighthouse Financial prior to separation, subject to regulatory approvals. ","In addition, our 2016 free cash flow ratio was 48% of reported operating earnings. However, the free cash flow ratio was 77% after adjusting for notable items, excluding the impact from actions related to the separation of Brighthouse. This was significantly above our 2016 target of 55% to 65%, primarily due to higher subsidiary dividends as well as lower operating earnings. ","Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. While we have not completed our risk-based capital calculation for 2016, we estimate our U.S. combined RBC ratio, including Brighthouse, will remain above 400%. Preliminary full-year 2016 statutory operating earnings including Brighthouse were approximately $6 billion and net earnings including BHF were approximately $5.2 billion. ","Statutory operating earnings increased by $2.4 billion from the prior year, primarily due to the favorable impact of equity markets and certain variable annuities, partially offset by lower net investment net income. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $25 billion as of December 31, 2016 which is down 14% from December 31, 2015. Dividends paid to the holding company, as well as both realized and unrealized losses, were partially offset by net earnings. ","In statutory accounting, there is a balance sheet accounting misalignment between hedge assets and the associated liabilities. Hedge assets are mark to market; however, statutory reserves are less sensitive to interest rate changes. This asymmetry causes a reduction in statutory capital when interest rates rise. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 991% as of the third quarter of 2016 which is the latest public data. ","At the core, MetLife had a solid fourth quarter. Higher investment margins and lower expenses offset underwriting weakness in the quarter. Our net loss was largely due to a significant rise in interest rates in the quarter. In total, asymmetrical and non-economic accounting drove approximately 94% of the derivative loss this quarter. ","As Steve noted, higher interest rates are an economic a benefit for MetLife. In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong and we remain confident that the steps we're taken to implement our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long term sustainable value to our shareholders. And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Sumit Kumar from Citi. Please go ahead.","Sumit Kumar","I wanted to start with MetLife Holdings if I could I don't know if you give guidance on this but do you have a sense of what the free cash flow conversion is out of that segment? ","John Hele","We haven't given details of it -- by segment yet and MetLife Holdings -- the goal of that is to optimize value for the shareholder and MetLife Holdings including cash flow so work underway with that over time will give you some more guidance on that but right now we give you the overall guidance for Remain-Co is 65% to 75% on average in 2017 and 2018. ","Sumit Kumar","Okay. And then I guess on the interest rate hedges, obviously some of those hedges are going to stay with some of them are going to go to Brighthouse so can you maybe give us a sense of how much you are benefiting from the interest rate hedges now and then what the trajectory is of that benefit over the next couple of years? ","John Hele","I'm just looking it up. So we have about a couple hundred million of benefit right now from that -- and about just under half of that is Brighthouse today and these hedges stay for a long time so they run well into 2020, 2022. That's a couple hundred million in the quarter? But yes. The quarter, I'm sorry -- that's also pre-tax. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher","Can you comment on the net income sensitivity to interest rates. We had the pretty big loss here and I realize your view is uneconomical but just curious with the next 82 100 basis point increase in rates have a similar GAAP net income loss or does the sensitivity change? Is it not symmetrical? ","John Hele","It depends both on the shape of the curve and how much it moves in the quarter, how these marks on derivatives moves we also have currency hedging and some other aspects to it so it's a little complex. We have instituted a plan, though, we're we looking at our hedging in total so we don't want to give any guidance on it now and we haven't decided how we're going to think about it. I mean, it's kind of an interesting balance, economically, we're better off even with these hedges from an economic balance sheet point of view but you have these noise through to the GAAP so how much do you want to spend money or change your hedging to protect GAAP? So we're examining various options because we're at these rates and if the rates go up further, we will be moving away from some of the more costly guarantees in our businesses that we maybe modify our hedging strategy but that is still work underway. ","Thomas Gallagher","Okay. And then, I guess the way I would think about is for these types of Mark to market losses on derivatives, to truly be uneconomical, I would have to think that it's not affecting your view of enterprise wide capital adequacy despite what sounds like some negative adjustments to statutory surplus? So can you kind of a reconcile those two things? And indicate whether there is at least an immediate negative impact on capital and how you and the rating agencies with you that? ","John Hele","So from a pure mark to market economic balance sheet MetLife is better off end of the year than in the third quarter and second quarter. But the accounting does have timing issues sometimes. So there is, as you can see, there are some statutory capital but we're still -- have our guidance and reconfirming our 65 to 75 free cash flow for 2017 and 2018 for Remain-Co on average for 17 and 18 so it hasn't change that amount long term it's very good for the business what we think about that net present value of cash flows.","Thomas Gallagher","And just one final one relates to that is I get the rate hedges related to the variable annuity business but can you comment a little more broadly since most of the loss was outside of the year, at least the accounting loss, is it mainly universal life insurance related hedges? Is that related to your pension business? Can you provide a little more granularity for what exactly there's in terms of the liabilities that you're hedging there? ","Steve Kandarian","These were general interest rate hedges purchased over years to protect against low rates across the Board and particularly we do have some long liabilities, long term care, for example that need a protected gains of some other longer liabilities so that's what it's protecting the gains and we've had them for a long time and they reduce to the income for us in a very positive way as the rates go up they produce less income now and they do have this Mark to market to the balance sheet to this asymmetrical accounting but that's why it's a big piece of it and less in the VA book. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Seth Weiss ","Understand the balance sheet income of the accounting a cement surely debatable but just wanted to see if you can reiterate your view on the near term earnings impact from higher interest rates and just wanted to double check necessarily a positive with rates moving up and maybe more specifically could you categorize what the impact to earning as from what you're losing of what's being kicked off in the derivative book for higher rates and how that is immediately offset by the earnings impact of the and force business and how to think about any timing lag that may exist between those two forces? ","John Hele","Right. Well, there is an impact. It depends on how rates go up, the short the end goes up because the short and can affect the derivative income. If we have 100 basis points increase in rates affecting operating up, right up from where we're now, you have the positive from rising rates and the reinvestment of the portfolio and you'd also have a lesser derivative income. It would be -- if it's spiked up today, the subsidy would be kind of a wash in 17 at about 100 million in 2018 and $150 million in 2019. ","Seth Weiss","And then if we think about so the book value basis, is there a way to separate out the value of the derivative portfolio? From book value? Just to get maybe a cleaner cents, a more consistent sense of what book value is or similar to what you do we with the 2015 adjustment or the FCTA adjustment? ","Steve Kandarian","That is complex. Because you have to go way back and where do you start? And how do the calculations? So I think unfortunately the answer is you are going to have to wait until the accounting is modified at some point in the future. It's been about 10 years we've been working on it but the hope is to have a better balance sheet for insurers and this work by FASB underway to move towards that. ","Seth Weiss","So you can give just and EPI per share amount of what those derivatives and opposition is what today -- ","Steve Kandarian","Well, the total values are disclosed in our balance sheet if you divide the number of shares outstanding but to try to equate to get to the true book value, the true economic value is assets liabilities that's what I mean it's not a useful number because you don't know the true economic value of the liabilities to really figure out what is the true economic book value. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jimmy Bhullar","First said of the question just on your Latin America business, and specifically on Mexico your sales in the business were pretty weak I think mostly related to the weak volume that if you could just discuss how economically sensitive the businesses and I think portion of is it -- is group sales and how susceptible are you to potential weakening in the economy in Mexico? ","Steve Kandarian","So as we disclosed, the quarter in general terms revenues are 5% are fine. We have weaker sales in Mexico which you know is -- impacting the lower sales not necessarily directly correlated with the top line because it's previously put in terms of the impact in the economy, obviously monitoring how the situation evolves including discussions about NAFTA. I have to say that our business partner in Mexico is fairly unrelated to any trade agreements so it's just tied to the general economy. Of the market we normally grow each rate to the market growth rate. ","Jimmy Bhullar","And then, just on the Brighthouse business if you look at your sales of the two major products, annuities and life insurance, individual life insurance, there opposed weak a lot in part of the distribution which is really -- so how do you think about the growth outlook for that business down the road, given that it seems that annuity flows are going to be negative for a while even with growth in the shield product and just a life -- Individual Life book seems to be shrinking. ","Eric Steigerwalt","I really can't talk about Outlook right now but I can give you a little sense. Will, where we're in the fourth quarter is right around where we thought we would be put on the what I would call the normal variable annuity business obviously there has been an FX from DOL. You\u2019ve seen that on other competitors as well. The life this is we kind of expected as we sold off the MPC gene field force and they shifted it to their new company. But the shield sales are fantastic, up 45%, quarter over quarter, so we're seeing some momentum in I would say what I call a normal VA business we continue to see momentum in the shield business light of the life business was clearly weak in the fourth quarter and will have to work on that in coming quarters going forward. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sean Dargan","I want to follow up on something John mentioned around the FASB proposals for long term insurance contracts so if I understand correctly, insurance liabilities will be fair value to every quarter. Is that something that MetLife supports? ","Steve Kandarian","We're very active with the FASB on this. The concept makes a lot of sense. That was in the details. The big question is what interest rate do you bring the liabilities back at a lot of discussion with the FASB on that and that work is still underway. A lot of the changes, though, would flow-through -- I think the proposals flow-through AOCI and not give noise to operating earnings so you still see the operating earnings peace and the noise would flow-through the AOCI. ","Sean Dargan","And then I have a question about proposed tax reform. If U.S. corporate taxes get lowered, how do you think the industry and regulators respond? Do you -- would you target and after-tax return and cut pricing or do think the industry would as a whole? Or do you think regulators would require pricing cuts? ","Steve Kandarian","I think it's pretty hard to answer a question right now about tax reform because it's so early stage. Chairman Brady of the House Ways and Means Committee has a blueprint out will have to see where that goes. There's been some support for it and other reporters of the economy are concerned about the border adjustability component still a lot of knowledge has to be gained in terms of how that will actually work and with the details will be so it's really premature for me right now to say how it will affect those factors. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Can you comment on the expected earnings run light for MetLife Holdings and if there's any residual impact from the highlight -- the items you highlighted this quarter? ","John Hele","No. The guidance we gave that our Outlook still applies for next year there's noise this quarter and some worse mortality than we had thought we had a couple large claims that fell through but we would stick with the guidance we gave you on the call. ","Erik Bass","Okay. And then on interest rates, you'd mentioned that the rise in new money rates, how much more would rates need to rise to sort of get you towards where your portfolio yield as and eliminate the drag from spread compression? ","Steve Kandarian","Well, you highlight one of the sensitivities there and this is Steve -- at the way we look at it is if you were to hold all spreads constant across asset sectors, what has to happen to the 10 year treasury? Which is a primary indicator for where we're investing and it's approximately about a 3% U.S. Treasury rate of 10 years and again it's assuming all spreads stay the same but that would be about where we would hit our breakeven on reinvesting. ","Erik Bass","And I guess when you hit that point, would you expect to get some spread benefit initially before having to share that with policyholders? ","Steve Kandarian","I think we'll have to wait and see. It will be nice to not have spread compression that we've been fighting for years and we look forward to dealing with that issue going forward. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Nadel","Just a question I'm thinking about the 2017 Outlook and taking into account all the moving parts in the fourth quarter results at the same levels are there any segments where you would say the baseline that you identified six or seven weeks ago that you talked about back in December that where the baseline has changed materially on sort of the core basis where we need to adjust our expectations for 2017? ","John Hele","No. We would not adjust our Outlook and we would try to tell that to you if we had a change to our Outlook but thanks for the question. ","John Nadel","Okay. And then, second one is just can you give us an update on any asset adequacy reserve additions of any note for 2016 year end? ","Steve Kandarian","Well, actually with interest rates going up at we've asset adequacy reserves. We have better buffers now than with the rising rates and look forward to a future of not having to add to those for a while so we -- this has been a very -- as I said, economically very favorable to MetLife with the rise in rates. ","John Nadel","And then last one real quick you didn't give an update and I suppose that means nothing's changed but can you still confirm that the spinoff is expected to take place in the first half? ","Steve Kandarian","Yes, our target is still the first half of 2017 for the Brighthouse separation. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger","John, you mentioned $625 million benefit to the holding company's cash position. Is that something that you would view as a permanent benefit or should we think about that as potentially-- ","John Hele","Some of that was tax which we have so we have the cash and then another piece was collateral for derivatives so depending upon what happens to currencies interest rates, the collateral postings can change. And we'll just have to wait and see. That's on that piece. ","Ryan Krueger","Okay. And then, on Brighthouse, could you just quantified I guess for the quarter, how much weaker worthy underwriting results relative to what you would have expected? ","Eric Steigerwalt","I would say about $19 million but I would say this. This comparison, fourth quarter of 2015, was a very good underwriting quarter for us. Whether you look at what we expected or maybe an average run rate over eight or nine, quarters, it was a very good underwriting quarter. This quarter, our fourth quarter, 2016 while it is weaker maybe than we expected, slightly weaker than we expected over the last eight, quarters, it's right on the average so similar to what MetLife experienced a little bit of severity and a little less seated but despite the fact that it cost us some earnings, not that far off of what we expect. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank Securities. Please go ahead.","Yaron Kinar","John, I think you reiterated your day cash flow target of 65% to 75% for the next couple of years. Would it be fair to expect a cash flow conversion to be a bit on the lower end for 2017 and then maybe more they catch up in 2018? Just given where the statutory capital and earnings are today? And then the separation costs? ","John Hele","So I think I understand your question but free cash flow is a lot of moving parts to it and it is a bit volatile from year-to-year so we give you an average over two years and we're confident in our rage at 65 to 75 but I can't give you an individual year target. ","Yaron Kinar","Okay. But directionally, would it be fair to expect maybe the cash flows moving up as the year moves on? ","John Hele","Directionally, we -- I'm reiterating our range. At this time, it is a bit volatile from time to time. ","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And then, in RIS, if one excludes the pension transfers I think PFOs were actually came under some considerable pressure this quarter. Can you maybe talk about that a little bit and maybe also have any color or any extrapolations that you may see for that into 2017? ","Maria Morris","This is Maria Morris. Obviously RIS has a number of different products as part of it was our institutional income annuities block that was down this quarter, quarter over quarter, we're in a process as you know a balancing kind of value and growth in this marketplace and so we're comfortable with where we ended up and going into next year we have focused plans on each of these markets. In the income annuities business we're seeing some increase in different sponsors, interested in this product line, so we do believe that will go back to traditional growth in the future. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Randy Binner ","I wanted to talk about just expenses and confirm that the overall expense savings initiative of the $800 million is still on track. I think it is but more specifically I think that you talked about the December costs associated with the expense initiative $300 million pre-tax initiative and '17 is that still on course now that we're in 2017 and is there any update or color you could give us on how the timing of that $300 million of cost associated with the expense initiative is going to come in in 2017? ","John Hele","Yes, we're on track to the outlook we gave you for the cost savings. As you remember, we spent a lot in in 2017 to get these savings later on, a lot of technology investments. It is spread out throughout the year perhaps a little more in the second half than the first half, but we will isolate these for you each and every time and so you can see these pieces of what the investments are to create the savings. ","Randy Binner","And then just a quick when I wanted to cover the long term care, there's a little bit of an adjustment in holdings. Can you just give a quick update on what the behavior versus interest rate assumptions were that change it wasn't mostly interest rate that change? ","John Hele","In long term care, we adjusted the claims we had in 2016. We updated at the end of the year for those claims what we were seeing -- we were seeing a little less termination of those claims so we had to adjusted reserves on that. Is a small amount relative to the total size of our long term care, remember that we have about $10 billion of GAAP reserves on this business, about $13 billion and so this is a small change within the total and only affecting the 2016 claims.

Last night, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $1.23, which compares to $1.38 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year decline in operating EPS was primarily explained by variable investment income, or VII, which contributed $0.06 per share to operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus $0.18 in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Variable investment income can be volatile, largely because it's driven by returns on alternative asset classes. These asset classes have provided strong returns to MetLife shareholders over time. In addition to a challenging quarter for VII, broad-based strength in the U.S. dollar remained an earnings headwind. Foreign exchange rates hurt operating earnings from our international businesses by $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter versus the prior year period. MetLife repurchased $822 million of shares in the fourth quarter. With an additional $70 million of buybacks in early January and the $107 million of repurchases in the third quarter, we have completed our latest $1 billion repurchase program.","As you know on January 12, we announced a plan to pursue the separation of a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. Until we are in a position to disclose details of the separation plan, we are not able to repurchase shares. While the separation plan has a negative impact on capital management in the near term, we are confident it positions MetLife to be a more compelling capital management story over the long term.","Exiting a business that has been central to the company since its founding in 1868 highlights our willingness to take bold actions to maximize shareholder value. Two factors drove our decision to pursue this plan: our strategic focus on businesses with capital requirements in higher cash generation and the potential impact of capital requirements on the variable annuity business if it remained part of a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI.","On the first point, as I have said on prior calls, we have learned a great deal about the cash and capital characteristics of our major business lines as a result of our Accelerating Value strategic initiative. One of the key early learnings from this effort was that the capital requirements and potential volatility of cash flows from the VA businesses do not fit well with our overall goal to deliver predictable recurring free cash flow. Following the separation, we anticipate that MetLife will generate a free cash flow to operate earnings ratio above our current target of 55% to 65%, and with less volatility.","In our view, the market does not give us appropriate credit for our higher multiple businesses, because of concern about the potential risk profile of VAs. By separating out of a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail operation, we are addressing this valuation overhang on MetLife.","On the second point, we believe that regulatory risk is significantly diminished as a result of this plan. The Federal Reserve has made encouraging comments on capital rules for so-called traditional insurance lines, but we are concerned that the Fed could view variable annuities as non-traditional, which is how this product is currently categorized by international regulators. Since we believe the standalone U.S. Retail business would not be a SIFI, separation mitigates the risk of onerous capital rules for the VA business.","MetLife continues to challenge its SIFI designation in court, and does not believe any part of our business poses systemic risk. However, we also recognize that the judicial process could take a considerable period of time, especially if either party appeals the District Court's decision. In the meantime, adverse capital rules for VAs could put MetLife at a competitive disadvantage.","Finally, as we said in the press release announcing the separation plan, we believe a standalone U.S. Retail business will be more nimble and competitive, benefiting from greater focus, more flexibility in products and operations, and a reduced capital and compliance burden. We know you want more information on what the new company will look like, including specifics on strategy and capital. However, we are able to provide only limited information prior to finalizing the form of the separation.","Turning to regulatory matters, I would like to report on two developments in New York that will improve MetLife's ability to return excess capital to shareholders. First, in late December 2015, New York changed the law for calculating ordinary dividend capacity for life insurers, creating a more level playing field with other states. Previously, an ordinary shareholder dividend could be distributed annually if it did not exceed the lesser of either 10% of statutory surplus or the statutory net gain from operations in the prior year.","The legislation adds a greater-of test, which is consistent with the existing standard in the majority of states. We had assumed that our New York subsidiary, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, would distribute meaningful capital to the holding company under the old law. However, that assumption was heavily dependent upon extraordinary dividends, which are subject to regulatory approval. While the new law means more predictable, less volatile dividends, it does not change MetLife's commitment to keeping our businesses very well capitalized. Second, the New York Department of Financial Services [New York State Department of Financial Services] is unique among state regulators in mandating certain actual assumptions and reserve requirements through an annual Special Consideration letter.","For year-end 2015 financial statements, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is permitted to aggregate all three lines of business, life, annuity, and health, to meet the requirements. Previously, health insurance was excluded. Largely because of this change, we anticipate a reserve release of approximately $1 billion, based on current capital market conditions. While New York's standards remain very conservative relative to other regulatory regimes, the change will make us more competitive with insurers domiciled in other states.","In conclusion, we are committed to making the right decisions to produce substantial and sustainable shareholder value. And we are willing to execute bold moves to achieve this goal. Our separation plan will allow MetLife to focus on businesses that have lower capital requirements and greater cash flow generation potential, while creating a more nimble and competitive U.S. Retail franchise.","I will now turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today I'll cover our fourth quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion, or $1.23 per share. This quarter included three notable items which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement or QFS.","First, variable investment income was $71 million after DAC and taxes, which was $137 million, or $0.12 per share below, the bottom end of our 2015 quarterly plan range. Second, we had higher than budgeted catastrophe losses, partially offset by favorable prior-year reserve development, which in total decreased operating earnings by $9 million, or $0.01 per share after tax. Third, we had a one-time tax benefit in Argentina which increased operating earnings by $31 million or $0.03 per share after tax. This tax benefit was a result of Argentina's currency being devalued by 40% in December, which required the remeasurement of U.S. dollar-based reserves into pesos and resulted in an increased tax deduction.","Turning to our bottom line results, the fourth quarter net income was $785 million, or $0.70 per share. Net income was $591 million lower than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative net losses and losses related to certain variable annuity guarantees where the hedge assets are more sensitive to market fluctuations than the GAAP treatment for guarantee liabilities. The derivative net losses were primarily driven by higher interest rates. The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included an unfavorable impact of $305 million, after tax, related to asymmetrical and non-economic accounting. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $51.15 as of December 31, up 3% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $42.22 as of December 31, up 5% year-over-year.","With respect to fourth quarter margins, underwriting primarily in the U.S. was less favorable than the prior-year quarter by $0.06 per share after adjusting for notable items in the both periods. Property & Casualty, Corporate Benefit funding, and Retail Life were the primary drivers of the year-over-year result. In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 96.1% in retail and 99.8% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 89.4% in retail and 96.4% in group.","Overall, P&C underwriting was unfavorable versus the prior-year quarter. We experienced higher non-catastrophe claim costs primarily due to elevated frequency and severity in our auto business as well as higher catastrophes in homeowners. We continue to increase prices in Auto which should drive improvement in our loss ratios over the next several quarters. In Corporate Benefit Funding, or CBF, the less favorable underwriting result versus a strong 4Q 2014 was due to lower mortality experience in our payout annuity business and higher claims in our life products.","Fourth quarter underwriting results were within the expected range, and CBF full year 2015 underwriting margins were in line with our expectations. Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 54.9%, which is less favorable than the prior-year quarter of 53.9% and 53.0% in 4Q 2014, after adjusting for a one-time notable item. The year-over-year variance was due to higher average net claims. The fourth quarter benefit ratio is high relative to our full year 2015 target of 50% to 55% because of seasonally high premiums and the related increase in reserves. Finally, the Group Life mortality ratio was 86.8%, and the Non-Medical Health benefit ratio was 77.7%, both within their respective ranges.","Turning to investment margins, the average of the four U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 170 basis points in the quarter, down 42 basis points year-over-year. Of this decline, 27 basis points was the result of lower variable investment income. Pre-tax variable investment income, or VII, was $109 million, down $216 million versus the prior-year quarter due to weak private equity and hedge fund performance. For the full year, pre-tax VII was $1.2 billion which was below the bottom end of our 2015 targeted range of $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion. Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 168 basis points this quarter, down 15 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline.","With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 24.4%, unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 23.7% after adjusting for notable items in the prior-year quarter. The higher operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily due to lower pension risk transfer sales as well as higher expenses related to one-time items and timing.","I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $582 million, down 19% versus the prior-year quarter, and down 10% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Life and Other reported operating earnings of $195 million, down 41% versus the prior-year quarter and down 26% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting, primarily in P&C and higher expenses. Life and other PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year as growth in the open block was more than offset by runoff of the closed block. Retail Life sales were up 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by Term, Whole Life, and Universal Life.","Annuities reported operating earnings of $387 million, up 1% versus the prior-year quarter and up 3% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were improved investment margins as well as favorable lapse experience which were partially offset by higher expenses and negative fund flows. Total annuity sales were $2.5 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year.","We continue to see good momentum in our index-linked annuity, Shield Level Selector. Shield sales were $361 million in the quarter, which were almost triple the sales in the prior-year period. Also, our VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, continues to gain acceptance in the market and drove VA sales of $1.8 billion this quarter, an increase of 13% year-over-year.","Group voluntary and worksite benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $214 million, down 10% versus the prior-year quarter and down 5% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting in auto and lower investment margins. GVWB PFOs were $4.3 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Sales were up 14% year-over-year with growth in core and voluntary products.","Corporate Benefit Funding or CBF reported operating earnings of $286 million, down 21% versus the prior-year quarter and down 18% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were low investment and underwriting margins. CBF PFOs were $886 million, down 39% year-over-year due to strong pension risk transfer or PRT sales in the prior-year quarter. Excluding PRT sales, PFOs were up 39% due to strong sales in structured settlements and institutional income annuities.","Latin America reported operating earnings of $150 million, down 1% from the prior-year quarter but up 24% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, Latin American operating earnings were up 14% on a constant currency basis. The key driver was business growth. U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $8 million versus a $22 million loss in the prior-year quarter, reflecting lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $1 billion, down 2%, but up 17% on a constant currency basis with growth across the region despite the challenging environment. Total Latin America sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to direct marketing in the region.","Turning to Asia, operating earnings were $290 million, down 15% from the prior-year quarter and down 9% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 6% on a constant currency basis driven by favorable business growth and lower taxes primarily due to a change in the Japan tax rate from 31% to 29%. Asia PFOs were $2 billion, down 11% from the prior-year quarter and down 3% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for the withdrawal of single premium A&H products in Japan which do not meet our hurdle rates in the current interest rate environment, premium fees and other revenues increased 2% on a constant currency basis.","Discontinuing the sale of single premium A&H products is a good example of our focus on cash, return on capital, and payback periods more so than GAAP metrics. We estimate the statutory IRR on single premium A&H is 7% with a 14-year payback period assuming mean reversion for interest rates. The product looks even worse if we assume current low rates persist. While these products could contribute meaningful revenue in operating earnings on a GAAP basis, the economic returns are unattractive.","For full year 2015, Asia PFOs were up 4% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were down 1% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, representing the net impact of management actions taken across the product portfolio to improve value creation and growth in targeted markets. In Japan, 2015 third sector sales were up 11% versus 2014. Our expectation is for Japan's third sector sales to be down 10% to 15% in 2016 as a result of actions to improve value, including the impact from suspension of our single premium A&H products. Excluding the impact of these actions, our expectations underlying growth in Japan's third sector sales will be consistent with our prior guidance of mid to high single digits.","EMEA operating earnings were $54 million, down 16% year-over-year and down 2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for a one-time tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2014, operating earnings were up 32% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by business growth, particularly in the U.K. and the Middle East. EMEA PFOs were $625 million, down 7% from the prior year period but up 3% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact from the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior-year quarter, PFOs were up 10% driven by Gulf, Turkey and the U.K. Total EMEA sales declined 11% on a constant currency basis due to strong employee benefit sales in the Middle East and the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior-year quarter.","In Corporate and Other, I would like to remind you of the timing of our preferred dividend payments. With our refinancing discussed on our second quarter 2015 call, we now pay dividends on our $1.5 billion Series C preferred stock on a semiannual basis. As a result, you will see preferred dividends paid in the second and fourth quarters of approximately $40 million related to this security. On an annualized basis, the lower dividend will generate a net savings of approximately $20 million during the first five-year fixed term of the security.","I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.4 billion at December 31, up from $5.5 billion at September 30. This amount includes inflows from our subsidiary dividends and the issuance of senior debt, offset by share repurchases, the payment of our quarterly common dividend, and other holding company expenses. In addition, our 2015 free cash flow ratio was 63% of operating earnings after adjusting for the third quarter non-cash charge of $792 million after tax.","Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. While we have not completed our risk-based capital calculations for 2015, we estimate our combined U.S. RBC ratio will be above 450%. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 936% as of the third quarter 2015, which is the latest public data.","In conclusion, fourth quarter operating earnings were below expectations as a result of lower investment margins, primarily due to VII, ongoing pressure from foreign currency, less favorable underwriting, and higher expenses. While the current environment remains challenging, we are confident that our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I'd like to just first ask about the comment that you can't buy back stock until more details of the spin are provided. I just want to clarify, is this the registration statement with the SEC in the next six months, or are there other events that we need to wait for before buyback can resume?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Seth. We are in possession of material non-public information, regardless of the form of the transaction, so we are unable at this point in time to engage in any further repurchases.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Could you just give us an indication of, either what events or timeframe we should be waiting for, for when you will no longer be in possession of this? What's the trigger, I guess, is the question?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Seth, we're working hard toward determining the form of the separation, and until we have determined that, we won't be in a position to do share repurchases. I don't have a specific timeframe for you. The form of the separation could be a public offering. It could be a spinoff. It could be a sale of the business or some combination of these options. And it's still too early to determine which of those it will be.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, maybe just to follow up on the spin, and specifically on comments you made in your December outlook call about no longer needing to build the capital buffer, does those commentaries \u2013 and understanding that you're unable to buy shares now \u2013 but independent of that, did that comment contemplate the need to potentially capitalize a spin company, and does this alter your view of your HoldCo capital position and adequate capital buffer?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That wasn't the reason for the comment, and we'll still have to wait to see how the form turns out, of the separation, before we know the capital positions of both remaining company and the new co.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, so...","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","This is John. Want to just add to that that, we are, as Steve said last December for our total business, we are comfortable with our capital buffers that we have here. But there's a lot to calculate out, depending upon the transaction and the form of separation. So that's work that has to be done, and that is underway, and we're working on that. But it doesn't change our view of the total capital we have for our total business.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So just to clarify, just want to not run the risk of extrapolating any statements here, the comments that you don't need to build a capital buffer related to MetLife as a combined entity, and does not contemplate a potential spin and actions that might need to be taken for that?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, that's right, Seth. Because we have said there are three \u2013 there's various forms that we're looking at. It could be a spin. It could be an IPO with a spin. It could be a sale. So all those have kind of different capital implications for both the separated company and the remaining company. So that's work that has to be done. But we are comfortable with our total capitalization that we have for our total business.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. On the U.S. Retail separation, it seems like many of the details, like the nature of the separation, branding, haven't really been finalized, as you mentioned. So just want to get an idea on your timing of when you announce \u2013 made the announcement, why did you make it when you did, versus waiting till you had decided on some of these items?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jimmy, we did a lot of work before making this announcement to pursue a separation of much of our retail business, U.S. Retail business. But more work had to get done to answer some of the questions you just raised, and many others. And to do that would require a much larger group of people both within the company and outside the company to make those determinations. And as a practical matter, it would have leaked out to the public that we were engaging in this plan to pursue a separation. So our view was once we made the initial determination that a separation was desirable and we were going to pursue that plan, now we're able to bring in many more people to do the analysis that will lead to the answers to the questions you just raised.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then can you give us an idea on the expected timing of the separation? Because it seems like an IPO or a sale would be difficult in this environment. So obviously spin is an option, but how do you try to balance doing it in a timely fashion versus maybe being opportunistic and maximizing what you're able to get from the business?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We're not in a position to give any guidance at this point in time in terms of the timing. I can only tell you that we've been working hard on our strategy for over a year now. We made this announcement about the plan to pursue a separation, and we are working very rapidly on answering all the questions that we need to answer to determine the form of such a separation and we've moving as quickly as one can.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then maybe if I can just ask one on the business. Your alternative investment income obviously as you mentioned was pretty weak in the fourth quarter. So just give us some insight into what drove that, whether it's private equity, hedge funds. And how \u2013 what's your view on some of those asset classes on how they're performing as it relates to the first quarter? I think you should have some insight given the reporting lag on private equity and on hedge funds.","Steven J. Goulart - Chief Investment Officer & Executive Vice President","Jimmy, it's Steve Goulart. Just recapping the fourth quarter, I mean, certainly we were disappointed in the performance of the alternatives portfolio, both private equity and hedge funds materially underperformed our plan and that's been somewhat unusual. But anyway that's really what happened. Prepayments were still very strong in the fourth quarter. And as we look forward to this year, you talked about first quarter. Obviously the market sort of came out of the gate on the wrong foot perhaps, a lot more volatility than expected. We don't see any reason to change the plan yet. We'll see how it unfolds. Obviously there's a lag in the portfolios, one quarter on PE, one month on hedge funds.","So you can sort of look at what has transpired. But I'd also remind you that when we look at correlation, while there's kind of a directional correlation, the correlation isn't really that high in trying to compare it exactly. So we're sort of sticking with the plan for now. I would also say though that we've engaged in some repositioning in the portfolio during the course of the latter half of last year. We reduced the alternative portfolio by about a billion dollars split between the hedge fund and private equity portfolios, really concentrating on the managers and strategies that have been the longer-term stronger performers for us and that we feel are confident are going to deliver that performance going forward.","Like Steve said in his opening remarks, this is a portfolio that has provided strong returns for us and for our shareholders over some period of time. We expect it will continue to do so. Obviously we're managing it and monitoring it very closely just given what we did late last year. And then particularly the hedge funds, they're a little bit in the spotlight just given the last couple years of underperformance there. So (34:42)","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And specifically on private equity, is it more sensitive to the level of market because that drives the marks, or is it more sensitive to IPO activity? Because I can understand fourth quarter being really bad because the S&P was down like 7% in the third quarter but it bounced back and was up almost 7% in the fourth quarter. So is it more the ending level of the market than the previous quarter, or is it actual IPO activity that influences your private equity returns more?","Steven J. Goulart - Chief Investment Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, like I said, we've studied a lot of different correlations, and it's hard to really tie any of them. So I think directionally it's a little bit both of what you said.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. First question, Steve, is just based on what you have proposed so far in terms of the split and what remains with Met, which I'll refer to as RemainCo, it looks like close to 20% of the earnings in RemainCo, which would be retail, would essentially be a closed block, if I'm understanding it correctly. How should we think about that conceptually? Is that a business that you also might be open to divesting, or should that be considered a closed block with the remaining business, or is that one still up in the air? That's my first question.","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Tom, this is John. It's something that's still under review that we're looking at. And as we develop future plans on this, we'll let you know.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then the next question is a broader one. Steve, is the ultimate goal here really to de-SIFI? I mean, I realize you're still not done with the court case, but let's just assume for a minute that you don't win that. Is the plan here to still get out of SIFI? How critical is that to you? Or do you believe the split kind of eliminates the need to de-SIFI here?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Tom, the decision to separate the U.S. Retail business, a significant portion of it, was really driven by two factors. One, our strategy work that we have talked to you about as well as the regulatory component. And when we do our strategy work, regulatory environment, business environments within markets are very central to that analysis. So those two things in combination led to the decision for the separation in pursuing the separation of the U.S. Retail business. In terms of overall, our view on the SIFI designation, we continue to believe that we are not a SIFI under Dodd-Frank. We are pursuing our appeal rights in the District Court of the District of Columbia. There's a hearing next week Wednesday, February the 10th, on the case, and we look forward to the judge's decision.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. So, John, I appreciate the commentary on the risk-based capital ratio or at least the estimate as of year-end 2015. So it looks like a pretty significant increase on a year-over-year basis from something, I think the adjustment was slightly under 400% for the U.S. at year-end 2014. Can you give us some sense for what the risk-based capital ratio looks like for the three entities that are part of the spin? I believe those entities were somewhere just north of 400% at year-end 2014. Should we think about a similar kind of boost in year-end 2015 for those entities?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, John. It's John. I really can't until we finish our cash flow testing and the actuaries sign off on their statements and we follow our blue books to really give you any details. And you'll see that all when it all gets published. You know, because of the impact of the change of the SCL (38:56) that Steve mentioned, that's helped our total ratios, our total combined ratios where we're moving up higher. But that's, until we get all that work done, we can't really give any details such as you're asking for.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay.","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You know what, we're announcing a week earlier this year than we did last year, so that's why the timing is a bit off here.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Appreciate that. I guess my second question is a bigger picture question around Japan. Obviously you guys have taken some action around product offerings given the interest rate environment. I'm wondering, given the Bank of Japan's actions last week and the significant shift in JGB yields across the curve, whether there is something more specifically that has to be done now in response to those actions. I mean, I think there's negative yields all the way up to nine years on the JGB at this point.","Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region","Hi. It's Chris Townsend. Let me respond to that. So in the short term, the falling interest rates are going to have a negative, or sorry, have a positive impact on the SMR (40:06) as the asset values will appreciate, but a potential negative impact on our U.S. GAAP earnings due to lower investment income. And that's very manageable. It's immaterial in the bigger picture of things. Over the long term, a continued lower rate situation, you can accredit drag on earnings impacted by reductions to NII, earnings and distributable cash, but as those Japanese yen yields reduce, foreign currency products may become more popular, supporting our existing strategy to move away from the yen products, the foreign currency products. On the yen products themselves, we've taken significant action on our portfolio well in advance of the recent DOJ announcement.","So what we've done is to de-risk or to reduce the focus on our Yen life portfolio by reducing commissions in that area, doubling the ticket size, continuing to focus on packaging of A&H products to enhance the returns, and also to incentivize some of the FX life products. And we took that action at the back end of the third quarter, and if you see from the sales results in terms of the life business in Japan for the fourth quarter, it was up 2% year on year for the fourth quarter, and the mix of that underneath that is quite interesting because the foreign currency life is up and the Yen life is down, which is exactly what we wanted to happen. And I think you'll see that play out as we go into the rest of 2016.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on Seth's question on I guess the capital buffer. Is it \u2013 I guess, Steve, is it fair to say that when you talked about holding a capital buffer for non-bank SIFI risk that a fair amount of the buffer was related specifically to the variable annuity business?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we don't know what the capital rules will be. The Federal Reserve has not released anything yet. There are some international draft rules out there, but they've already said they'll be changing those. So it's really just a level of comfort, I think, that we have to have. We do a lot of stress testing ourselves. We have an economic view of our risks and feel that this size buffer was sort of where we should be knowing what we know at the time we make that call. And we reassess this on an ongoing basis. As capital rules get announced, we will know what it is. We do know that variable annuities have been discussed by many regulators as being a product that may attract higher capital requirements. So that clearly is one of the larger, say, capital risk products out there which makes the separation quite compelling.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Understood. On the RBC ratio, obviously you talked about the $1 billion reserve release that certainly contributed to the increase in the year-over-year RBC ratio. Were there any other big key factors that you can help us understand at this point?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's probably the most major one.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And then just lastly, can you guys give us an update on your energy portfolio and where that stands at this point?","Steven J. Goulart - Chief Investment Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Ryan, it's Steve Goulart. Just to update on the energy portfolio. We did take the opportunity most of last year to start reducing that portfolio. We sold almost $2 billion out of it. It ended the year just under $12 billion. And, again, 86% of that is investment grade. It's tilted more towards sort of the defensive sectors in the portfolio, mid-stream refiners, that sort of thing. So I think we're comfortable. We're obviously sort of \u2013 we run it through constant stress tests, just given the energy environment, and I think, at year-end, there was an unrealized net loss of about $220 million on the portfolio.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Thanks very much. You said that on a company-wide basis, you're comfortable with the level of cushion you have, but you've also said that \u2013 I don't know whether it was unexpected, but regardless, you had a $1 billion increase in your statutory surplus as a result of the change in New York State accounting rules. Should we infer from these two statements, when we think of them together, that some of this $1 billion is going to be above and beyond what you consider to be your adequate capital cushion, and that therefore some of this $1 billion could become available for redeployment?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Eric. We view capital on a total holistic basis...","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Sure.","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Whether it be at the holding companies, within the regulated companies. We had always viewed this amount that was in these reserves as, really capital, but they were in a reserve that would be paid out over time, of course. So, I think the best way to think of this is, this is capacity that we have as we think about our total capital position, and we will have to see in terms of redeployment, as Steve said, we can't make any decisions on that until we get further along with the separation.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I have one question related to operations. Because of the decision to pull back in Japan, it seems like even on a, let's call it, just apples-to-apples basis, adjusting for notable items, adjusting for currency, adjusting for the withdrawal of the single premium product, that, well \u2013 that growth is quite slow right now in terms of premiums, fees and other revenues. And I guess my question is, once you get through this, let's call it, transition period \u2013 product transition period, what do you \u2013 how do you think of the sustainable growth rate for the whole Asia region, given that you have sort of cross currents there? You have a very mature market in Japan, but you are rapidly growing markets in Southeast Asia. So on sort of an overall basis, how should we think about the sustainable growth rate, once we get through this transition period, for Asia? Thank you.","Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region","So, it's Chris Townsend. Let me respond to that. So, first of all, there is no change to the guidance we provided in December across all of the key metrics for Asia. And we gave you some, I think, fairly clear guidance in terms of earnings and revenue in the medium term. And we're sticking by that guidance overall.","In terms of Japan, we're doing the right thing in terms of creating value for our shareholders in terms of the product portfolio. And those items I responded to one of the prior questions on, in terms of Yen life (47:40) will definitely increase the value of our business. If you look at A&H and the third sector, where we make some very solid margins, we gave earlier guidance of mid to high single digits. We updated that guidance to a range of 10% to 12%, and we came in at 11%. So I think we've delivered well in terms of that business for this year. And John gave some fairly clear guidance, in terms of his prepared remarks, as to what's happening with that portfolio overall.","So, I actually think we've had a fairly solid year in the Asia region overall, with our normalized constant rate earnings of 15% or 16%, which is again ahead of guidance. So, in conclusion, we're sticking with the prior guidance we've given.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning. I have a question regarding your auto business. Can you provide some color in terms of claims experience in the quarter, excluding cat and prior-year (48:44) development versus 3Q? And also, with 4Q in the books, does it change your view for the outlook for 2016, in terms of the loss ratio expectations?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Humphrey, were you (48:59) talking about the auto business?","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Yes.","Eric Thomas Steigerwalt - Executive Vice President, U.S. Business, MetLife, Inc.","Hi, Humphrey. It's Eric. We took about, I would say, in 2015, roughly 2% rate throughout the year 2015. Going into 2016, we'll slightly more than double that. Auto was clearly up in Q4 2015 versus Q4 2014. We actually \u2013 if you want to talk about total combined ratio, homeowners in Q4 2014 was fabulous, frankly, so that was up in Q4 2015. Still a very good result. On the auto side, like many of our peers, or at least one peer that's reported so far, we're still seeing elevated severity and frequency.","As I said in the third quarter \u2013 and obviously I'm talking about just retail here. In a minute I'll let Maria comment on group. In the third quarter, I mentioned, and I think so did some of our peers, that miles driven is up. I would also add \u2013 and I may have mentioned it in the third quarter as well \u2013 that claim costs are up as well, which shouldn't be surprising.","So, even though we saw elevated experience in the fourth quarter on the auto side, we're pretty comfortable that the rate we're going to take in 2016 will offset those results, and we should be right about where we want to be as we get near the end of 2016. Maria?","Maria R. Morris - Executive VP & Head-Global Employee Benefits","Hi. This is Maria Morris. And with regard to the group business, we see the exact same trends as we saw in our retail business, so obviously both frequency and severity up. Eric talked about a lot of the trends underlying that. I would mention one thing on severity, we do notice that, with a lot of new cars on the road, that the cost of actually repairing those is up, with the computerization and other things in new cars. So, in addition to obviously more miles driven, we've got also the issue with regard to severity. And we've been taking rate as well, so \u2013 in the mid single digits. And I would note that in group, even as we're taking rate, we still have double digit sales increases year-over-year. So we're focused just as we are in retail on continuing to take rate throughout 2016, and we're bullish on the prospects for growth.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Got it. And then shifting gears to Latin America, the U.S. Direct business continued to be an earnings drag for the segment. How long do you expect the unit to turn profitable? Is it a matter of scale or is it \u2013 are there some levers that you can pull to drive improvements in that particular business?","Unknown Speaker","Sorry. So you're referring to currency or to the growth of the business?","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","No, just from the earnings perspective.","Unknown Speaker","Right. Well, as you know, we have been facing to start saying (51:56) currency issues in Latin America, the impact is around 20% during the last year. But if you think about growth, excluding that and excluding the U.S. Direct business and adjusting for notable items in the current and fourth (52:15) quarter, (52:16) were flat year-over-year. But strong growth of approximately 11% happened adjusting for all that. We gave you guidance of upper single digits, and we continue supporting that despite from (52:32) currency. We see further deterioration of local currencies against dollar but not as big as we saw before. So in the core business in local currencies, we sustain our high single digits.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. I want to go back to the separation plan and the announcement regarding the buyback cessation for the time being. So first, Steve, I think in your comments to Tom's question, you said that really the separation plan is not just regulatory driven, it's also part of the strategic work you've done. So with that in mind, why go through the court challenge at this point if, ultimately, even if the challenge let's say was accepted, you'd still go through the separation plan?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yaron, as we've said many times, we don't believe we are a SIFI under Dodd-Frank. 80% percent of the company remains after the separation, if it were to occur, and that remaining 80% will be impacted by whatever capital rules the Federal Reserve comes out with as well as the number of other matters related to compliance that will relate to being designated a SIFI. So there's still a significant potential burden that'll be placed upon the remaining company that would put us potentially on a unlevel playing field with our competitor who are not SIFIs.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So why not file the challenge after the separation plan if you're still designated then?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You have one chance to file a legal challenge to a District Court, and that is within 30 days of being designated, which is what we did.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then the credit rating agencies came out with a few negative outlooks after the plan was announced. Could you comment on those and maybe what you can do in order to alleviate their concerns?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Often I think you'll see whenever a firm announces a significant transaction where they're buying something or selling, or just separating something, the rating agencies put you on Watch or Outlook just until they get more details and can sort out exactly what's going to happen. We announced a plan to pursue a separation. We have to sort out a lot of details, including how this will all work. And we will present that to the rating agencies when we have that work completed, and then they'll be able to have an appropriate view. So this is \u2013 we're in a transition period, a holding period, with the rating agencies until such time as we can get them more information.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then finally, I guess, this is more a comment than a question on my part. In the December outlook call, you basically said that you'd be increasing the capital deployment, given a changing in strategic view and given the buffer that you'd built. I would have thought that at the time, you knew that you were going to go through the plan or announcing the plan of a separation, and it just creates a lot of back and forth here, I think, in terms of how investors think of the buyback program and the timing thereof. So I just \u2013 I would have thought that this could have been handled differently. And I guess that's my comment and want to see if you had any reaction to that.","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","What we are doing throughout our work on strategy is to find ways to maximize value for our shareholders. We've talked about a focus on cash and growing businesses that threw off (56:30) more free cash flow and returning any excess capital to our shareholders. We also look at all of our businesses in terms of their viability longer term and how best they may be viable in the marketplace. And it was our determination after a great deal of work that the U.S. Retail business would be more viable long term as a separate entity.","So once we made that determination, we made that announcement that we'd be pursuing a plan to separate. And as I've said earlier in the call, a great deal of work has to still be done to effect that plan and to determine which avenue we take to separate that business. But all this is done through the lens of creating shareholder value.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. In retail, you mentioned higher direct expenses. Can you just discuss the drivers in the quarter? And also should we expect to see any increase in spending in either retail or at a corporate level in anticipation of the separation?","Eric Thomas Steigerwalt - Executive Vice President, U.S. Business, MetLife, Inc.","It's Eric. I'll start out. It was kind of across the board. Corporate overhead was higher, including some advertising costs. We had some legal reserves set up in there. Generally, fourth quarter is higher. So this isn't really out of line with what we would expect. Going forward, I would expect in the first quarter, you'll see something that looks more like a normal first quarter. But maybe I'll let John or Steve comment if they want to add anything.","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Just want to add about do we expect to have some expenses to do the work on the plan to pursue the separation. Clearly, there will be some cost. But the costs will vary depending upon what ultimate form we take, so it's still too early to give you any guidance on that piece of it.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, Eric, just a question, with the prospect of a final DOL rule seemingly pretty close, can you just talk about what steps you're taking to prepare and maybe if you've had any discussions with third party distributors about their comfort selling products under the current Best Interest Contract Exception (sic) [Exemption] (58:45)?","Eric Thomas Steigerwalt - Executive Vice President, U.S. Business, MetLife, Inc.","I'm sure you've heard this from others as well. We're thinking of every angle based on what was previously put out by the DOL. But as you know, we don't have anything. It's \u2013 the regulation is with OMB now. We would expect to see it, let's call it, 40 days to 70 days, something like that. So we're thinking about the various forms that it could take, again, based on what we saw previously. We have talked to a number of distributors. I don't think it would be appropriate for me to share some of those conversations. But suffice to say, we are considering all potentialities from both a product perspective and how you distribute and anything else that would result from the actual regulation coming out. So more to come. And obviously, all of us will be able to add to this dialogue when we see it sometime in the March\/April timeframe.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I just want to say at the end of the call here that the key message I want to leave with all of you today is that management is doing everything possible to unlock value for our shareholders.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and on our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.","Now, joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported second quarter operating earnings per share of $0.83. Adjusting for notable items, operating earnings were $1.27 per share, which compares to $1.51 per share on the same basis in the prior year period. Two reserve actions account for much of the operating earnings pressure: $161 million relating to our variable annuity actuarial assumption review and $257 million from modeling improvements in the reserving process, mostly for our book of universal life policies with secondary guarantees.","Compared to a year ago, foreign currency, equity markets and interest rates were all headwinds in the quarter. As previously announced, we accelerated the VA policyholder behavior assumption review to the second quarter in light of our plan to separate a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business.","In addition, we completed our VA economic assumption review. The balance of our annual assumption reviews will take place in the third quarter as usual. Following these reviews, we have strengthened our VA reserves on a GAAP basis to reflect changes in our lapse in benefit utilization assumptions, resulting in the after-tax non-cash charge of $2 billion. This action clearly had a large impact on our reported GAAP net income of $64 million in the quarter.","The reserve strengthening consists of several elements and is associated with our GMIB product. Adverse behavior changes include lower lapses, lower elective annuitization, and higher systematic withdrawals, resulting in increased annuitization under no-lapse guarantees and increased utilization of enhanced death benefits.","With a 10-year deferral period required to exercise many of the riders in our GMIB product, it was only in the past year that we accumulated sufficient credible data to update our underlying behavior assumptions. This process was further supported by an independent industry study released in the second quarter of this year. Following these changes, a greater portion of our VA liabilities follow a fair value-based GAAP reserve methodology. Prior to the assumption review, more of our VA liabilities were subject to an insurance accounting model which follows an accrual-based GAAP reserve methodology.","In his comments, John Hele will discuss the assumption review process results in greater detail. As I mentioned, we also adjusted reserves in the quarter to reflect modeling improvements and other refinements. The largest impact, $201 million of a $257 million of reserve strengthening, was for our book of universal life policies with secondary guarantees where we refined the calculation of excess death benefit reserves based on a more granular approach to projecting policyholder premium payments.","Turning to investment performance, variable investment income totaled $285 million in the quarter which is below our run rate quarterly guidance. Private equity and hedge fund returns were both below plan. Given the performance year-to-date, it is likely that full year VII will fall below the $1.2 billion low-end of our guidance range. One of the most significant geopolitical developments in the quarter was the decision by British voters to exit the European Union. Operationally, MetLife's hub in Dublin largely insulates us from passporting issues. From an investment perspective, our U.K. exposure is limited to $17 billion with nearly all of those assets currency-matched with liabilities.","Strategically, MetLife remains committed to the U.K. as an attractive long-term market. More troubling is the referendum's residual impact, mainly a global flight to safety that has put further downward pressure on interest rates with the 10-year Treasury yield near record lows. In our view, lower for longer is not going away anytime soon, and life insurance companies will need to adapt to the low rate environment.","Turning to strategy, MetLife's accelerating value initiative combined with macroeconomic factors led us to pursue a plan to separate a substantial portion of U.S. Retail business. We continue to believe the separation will allow U.S. Retail to compete more effectively while enabling MetLife to generate a higher free cash flow ratio with less volatility and lower capital intensity.","We are working diligently on the separation plan with full engagement from our advisors and internal team. To that end, we have achieved several important milestones on the path to separation during the quarter. We announced the rebranding of the U.S. Retail business as Brighthouse Financial, we made key management appointments, we sharpened Brighthouse's business strategy, and we completed the variable annuity assumption review ahead of schedule which provides key information to help establish Brighthouse's financial foundation.","We expect to file an S-1 or Form 10 shortly after our September 27 board of directors meeting. We believe a properly executed separation will create value for our shareholders whether through an IPO, a spin or some combination thereof. This involves putting together the right strategy, structure, capital and people. Once we have certainty regarding the capital requirements in final execution plan for the separation, we will return our focus to deploying excess capital. The ultimate timing and form of the separation will be determined by a number of factors, including the capital markets environment.","Turning to regulatory matters, I would like to provide a brief update on the government's appeal of the U.S. District Court decision rescinding our designation as a systemically important financial institution. On June 16, the government filed its opening brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Amicus briefs in support of the government's position were filed on June 23. MetLife's brief will be filed with the court on August 15, and amicus briefs in support of our position are due by August 22. The government's deadline for filing its final reply brief is September 9. The clerk of the Circuit Court has discretion to set the time for oral argument for any date after September 9.","In the ordinary course, oral argument would be scheduled to take place two months to four months after the filing of the final brief, and a three-judge panel would be announced approximately 30 days prior to the date for oral argument. However, the government has requested expedited treatment of the appeal. At this time, we have no indication as to when the oral argument will be scheduled. A final decision in the case is likely to follow within a few months of oral argument. Throughout this process, MetLife will vigorously defend the U.S. District Court carefully reasoned decision.","I would like to conclude this morning with an update on our ongoing focus on expenses, which I discuss in our Q1 earnings call. As a reminder, I said our goal was to ensure that even on a separated basis, MetLife would have a lower cost structure than it has in a combined basis today. As a result, we are announcing that MetLife is targeting $1 billion in pre-tax run rate expense savings by the end of 2019. This amount is well in excess of approximately $200 million of stranded overhead resulting from our planned separation and will improve the company's overall unit costs.","An example of the kind of initiative that would drive these savings is our recent agreement with CSC, a leading provider of managed services to Fortune 500 companies, to administer nearly 7 million MetLife closed block life and annuity contracts.","Our new expense target comes on top of the $1 billion in gross pre-tax expense saves that we announced as part of our 2012 strategy and achieved in 2015. On a net basis, our 2012 initiative generated $600 million in pre-tax savings, which has helped bring down our operating expense ratio over the past four years. However, in light of the significant headwinds our industry is facing, MetLife must do even more to avoid simply running in place. With these actions, we expect to reduce MetLife's expenses by 11%. We know this will require us to reduce head count, which is never an easy step for an organization to take. Our overall goal is to be more efficient so that we can better serve our customers and provide a fair return to shareholders.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in greater detail.","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our second quarter results, including a discussion of our annual variable annuity assumption review, insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.","Operating earnings in the second quarter were $924 million, or $0.83 per share. This quarter included five notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement, or QFS. First, reserve adjustments, primarily resulting from modeling improvements in the reserving process for our book of universal life with secondary guarantees, decreased operating earnings by $257 million or $0.23 per share after tax. The largest component of this adjustment was in Retail Life and Other.","The new universal life model is a policy-by-policy projection of premiums and death claims, resulting in an immediate increase in future policy benefit reserves and a decrease in projected earnings. The immediate impact was a reserve increase of $201 million after tax and an ongoing higher projected reserve increases of approximately $10 million per quarter after tax.","Second, the annual Retail variable annuity assumption review decreased operating earnings by $161 million or $0.15 per share after tax. I will discuss the results of the assumption review in more detail shortly. Third, an adjustment to reinsurance receivables in Australia decreased operating earnings by $44 million or $0.04 per share after tax. Fourth, we had unfavorable catastrophe experience which decreased operating earnings by $15 million or $0.01 per share after tax.","Finally, variable investment income was below the 2016 quarterly plan range by $9 million or $0.01 per share after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs.","Turning to bottom line results, second quarter net income was $64 million or $0.06 per share. Net income was $860 million lower than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative net losses of $1.5 billion driven by the non-cash charge resulting from the annual variable annuity assumption review. This was partially offset by derivative gains of $725 million, primarily related to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies. In addition, there was $330 million in after-tax derivative gains resulting from other variable annuity derivatives and hedging.","The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $1.8 billion after tax related to asymmetrical and non-economic accounting. Book value per share excluding AOCI other than FCTA was $53.20 as of June 30, up 5% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $43.98 as of June 30, also up 5% year-over-year.","Now let me discuss the results of the Retail variable annuity assumption review, which we accelerated in connection with the planned separation. As a result of this review, we made changes to policyholder behavior and economic assumptions, as well as the risk margin for the Retail variable annuity block of business. Given a 10-year waiting period for the exercise of certain options within our GMIB products, we have only recently begun to observe sufficient and credible evidence to support a shift in our underlying future behavior assumptions for key blocks of this business. Our study consisted of our own emerging experience, combined with recently available relevant industry data.","As a result, we have strengthened our VA reserves, resulting in an after-tax GAAP charge of $2 billion to net income, including an after-tax GAAP charge to operating earnings of $161 million. This non-cash charge consists of three significant components. First, changes in four policyholder behavior assumptions for the guaranteed riders of GMIBs to reflect current company and industry experience. One, we lowered the percentage of policyholders who elect to receive a fixed income annuity under their GMIB rider. Two, we lowered the percentage of policyholders who elect reimbursement of the initial premiums paid when that amount exceeds their current account balance. Three, we increase the percentage of policyholders who elect dollar-for-dollar withdrawals, particularly those in qualified plans at higher ages. And four, we lowered the ultimate lapse rate on certain contracts. Where material, we have differentiated these adjustments between Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and our Delaware company, ML USA.","A combination of these changes resulted in a partial shift in accounting for these guarantees from mainly an insurance accrual-based model to a more embedded derivatives under a fair value model, resulting in an after-tax charge of $1.5 billion to net income. Second, changes in economic assumptions resulted in an after-tax charge of $279 million. These changes included reducing the long-term separate account return assumption for variable contracts with traditional mutual funds from 7.25% to 7.0%, and managed volatility funds from 7.0% to 6.75%. We also reduced the projected ultimate 10-year Treasury rate from 4.5% to 4.25%, which is reached in 2027.","Third, the updates resulted in an after-tax charge of $222 million related to the risk margin required in reserves subject to fair value accounting. Let me explain the accounting a little more. GAAP accounting for living benefits is split between accrual and fair value accounting rules. If policyholders elect to annuitize or they die, then this risk is measured under an insurance accounting model, which uses an accrual method reflecting best estimate assumptions.","At MetLife, we assume 10-year U.S. Treasury interest rates start at June 30, 2016 levels and increase to 4.25% by 2027, and that long-term separate account returns are 6.75% to 7.0%. However, when policyholders elect dollar-for-dollar withdrawals and exhaust their account values, they receive fixed income annuities. The guaranteed pay-off portions of those annuities, usually for 5 years to 10 years, are considered embedded derivatives and are measured at fair value. The portion beyond the guaranteed period is measured using the insurance accounting model. Under fair value accounting, the interest rates used for discounted and separate account returns, including equity fund returns, are calculated actuarially but on average are set to current market rates. For example, at June 30, 2016, the 10-year swap rate was 1.36%. That means that all liabilities are discounted at 1.36% and all separate account assets are assumed to grow at 1.36% before fees.","Now contrast this, the modest impact on statutory reserves. Using the same change to policyholder behavior assumptions, the statutory impact is a reduction in reserves of $266 million after tax. The majority of our statutory reserves are calculated using a series of actuarial methods and also assume that the yield curve as of June 30, 2016 slowly rises based on a mean reversion to a level approximately consistent with the long-term 10-year Treasury interest rate of 4.25% in 2027, and an equity return assumption of 7.5%. As you can see, under either accounting system, the ultimate cost of these guarantees will be based on owning a policyholder behavior but on future economic conditions.","With respect to second quarter margins, total company underwriting was unfavorable by approximately $0.08 per share versus the prior year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Retail Life and Property & Casualty were the primary drivers of the less favorable experience this quarter. Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 56.7% after adjusting 21.3 points for the notable reserve adjustment discussed earlier. This was unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 53.0% and modestly above the top end of the annual target range of 51% to 56%. The year-over-year shortfall was driven by higher frequency and severity of claims.","In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 108.9% in Retail and 103.1% in Group. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was 86.9% in Retail and 92.5% in Group. The combined ratio excluding catastrophes was above the prior year quarter of 80.2% in Retail and 85.5% in Group. We experienced higher catastrophe losses in our homeowners business through the hail and windstorms in the Midwest.","Elevated non-cat losses in auto were due to higher frequency and severity. We continue to take pricing and underwriting actions in auto. We believe these actions will yield improved results in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and will bring results in line with our target combined ratios over the course of 2017. Underwriting results in Group Life and Non-Medical Health were generally in line with the prior year quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.7%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 86.1% and the low end of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We experienced lower claim severity versus the prior year quarter.","The Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio was 80.7%, modestly unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 80.5% and within the annual target range of 77% to 82%.","Turning to investment margins, the simple average of the four U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 190 basis points in the quarter, down 37 basis points year-over-year. Lower variable investment income accounted for 16 basis points of this decline. Pre-tax variable investment income, or VII, was $285 million, down $142 million versus the prior year quarter, mostly due to lower returns on alternative investments. Product spreads excluding VII were 166 basis points this quarter, down 21 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline.","With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 22.7%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 24.3%. The lower operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily due to lower employee benefits, expense efficiencies and the timing of certain projects.","I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $184 million, down 73% versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the reserve adjustments discussed earlier. Excluding these and all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were down 17% due to unfavorable underwriting and lower investment margins. Retail's operating premium fees and other revenues, or PFOs, were $3.1 billion, down 6% year-over-year primarily due to annuities. Annuities PFOs were $1.1 billion, down 12% year-over-year due to lower fees as a result of negative fund flows and lower premiums due to a decline in SPIA sales.","Retail sales were down 21% year-over-year, primarily due to lower variable annuity sales. VA sales were down 39% year-over-year, primarily due to the sales suspension by a major distributor this year. Conversely, we continue to see strong growth from Shield Level Selector, which more than doubled its sales year-over-year.","Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, or GVWB, reported operating earnings of $221 million, down 4% versus the prior year quarter but essentially flat adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were higher auto claims and lower investment margins, mostly offset by volume growth. GVWB PFOs were $4.6 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Sales were up 25% year-over-year with growth in most group and voluntary products as well as across most markets.","Corporate Benefit Funding, or CBF, reported operated earnings of $302 million, down 26% versus the prior year quarter, and down 18% after adjusting for notable items. The key driver was lower investment margins. CBF PFOs were $650 million, up 43% year-over-year due to higher pension risk transfers, or PRT. As we have noted before, PRT sales can be lumpy but we continue to see a good pipeline and remain optimistic about future growth opportunities.","Latin America reported operated earnings of $128 million, up 10% from the prior year quarter and up 36% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, Latin America operating earnings were up 40% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were volume growth, lower expenses and improved underwriting margins. U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $9 million versus a $20 million loss in the prior quarter was reflecting volume growth and lower expenses.","Latin America PFOs were $994 million, down 9%, but up 4% on a constant currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct and adjusting for SPIA sales in Chile, which tend to be uneven, Latin America PFOs grew 7% on a constant currency basis. Total Latin America sales were up 29% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct, Latin America sales were up 47% on a constant currency basis. This increase was primarily driven by a large group employee benefit sale in Mexico, as well as growth in most markets.","Turning to Asia, operating earnings were $259 million, down 39% from the prior year quarter and 17% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were higher taxes and lower fixed annuity surrenders in Japan, partially offset by high investment margins and volume growth. Asia PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 8% from the prior year quarter and 13% on a constant currency basis.","I would highlight two items that negatively impacted Asia PFOs this quarter. First, the deconsolidation of our India operations beginning in 2016 dampened growth by two points year-over-year. And second, the withdrawal in Japan of single premium and A&H Yen products in 2015 reduced growth by six points year-over-year. As noted previously, these products do not meet our hurdle rates in the current interest rate environment. Excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of the India operations and the withdrawal in Japan of single premium A&H Yen products, PFOs were down 5% on a constant currency basis. The key driver for this decline is a shift from premium-based products to higher-value, fee-based products.","Asia sales were down 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value in targeted markets. In Japan, sales were down 13% year-over-year. We have seen a successful shift in sales to higher return foreign currency denominated life product, which were up 65% year-over-year, and away from low return Yen life products, which were down 54% year-over-year. Japan's Third Sector sales were down 31% versus the prior year as a result of exiting single premium A&H and the negative impact on packaged sales from a reduction in yen-denominated Whole Life product sales. Sales in Asia, excluding Japan, were up 19% versus the prior year.","EMEA operating earnings were $64 million, up 28% year-over-year and 36% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were lower expenses and volume growth. EMEA PFOs were $633 million, down 4% from the prior year period but at 1% on a constant currency basis. Excluding certain one-time items, PFOs were up 3% on a constant currency basis. Top-line performance was in line with expectations, and we continue to see a favorable shift towards high-margin products. Total EMEA sales increased 10% on a constant currency basis, mainly driven by growth in employee benefits and accident and health policy.","In connection with separation, starting in 3Q, we will reflect the U.S. Retail business, now known as Brighthouse Financial, in a standalone operating segment. This will occur in concert with the re-segmentation of the business units that will form the remaining business of MetLife. Among other changes, we will reorganize and report our auto and home insurance business as a single separate segment known as Property & Casualty. We will have full details on the re-segmentation and re-formatted financials to you prior to reporting our third quarter earnings.","A financial reporting impact of the re-segmentation will be a GAAP charge to operating earnings in the third quarter of less than $300 million after tax. To reflect the loss of the aggregation benefit for GAAP-reserve testing associated with the variable and universal life business, Brighthouse Financial will be reported in a standalone operating segment that will no longer receive credit for the broader diversification of the consolidated U.S. Retail universal life business of MetLife. As a result, projected earnings for variable and universal life business within the new Brighthouse Financial segment will be adversely affected. Further details will be provided with the third quarter results.","I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.9 billion at June 30, which is down from $5.3 billion at March 31. This amount reflects a senior debt repayment upon maturity of $1.25 billion, as well as regular cash flows, including subsidiary dividends, payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses. We did not refinance the maturing debt in the second quarter as we prepare for the ultimate separation of Brighthouse Financial.","Turning to our capital position, we report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the second quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 870% as of the first quarter of 2016, which is the latest public data.","For our U.S. companies, preliminary year-to-date second quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.3 billion, and net earnings were approximately $500 million. Statutory operating earnings were down 39% from the prior year, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates and reserves, largely variable annuities, and lower net investment income. In addition, lower fees earned on separate account balances contributed to the decline in operating earnings. Under statutory accounting, most of the impact of hedging is not reported in operating earnings or net income, rather the gain is recorded in statutory capital. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $31 billion as of June 30, up 6% from December 31, primarily from an increase in unrealized gains on derivatives of $3.5 billion.","In conclusion, we recognize financial results well below expectations this quarter. Challenging market factors, as well as updates to our reserves, all contributed to this performance; however, we remain confident the steps we are taking to implement our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value to our shareholders.","And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I had a couple of questions related both to the charge and the VA business. So first, how does the charge affect your view of capital? I realize it's a GAAP charge, not a staff charge, and it basically had a positive, but how does it affect your view of your capital?","And then secondly, how does the charge affect just your view of the earnings power of the annuity business? If you think about earnings in the last three years, I think they have been pretty consistent on an annual basis, between $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, and the size of the charge relative to earnings is pretty large. But how do you think about the earnings power of the annuity business, given this charge?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Jimmy. This is John. In terms of the statutory reserves, you saw there was a small release. Statutory capital, which is at CT90, has a slightly smaller change, but that \u2013 the companies have good RBCs right now for that. I'd like to just caution that changes to statutory reserves are not the true determinant of overall capital. There's a variety of factors and looking forward, when Brighthouse is separated, it'll be a standalone company, not part of a broader diversified MetLife. So those will have to be \u2013 as we file our S-1 or Form 10, you'll see more details as to the capitalization of Brighthouse as a standalone company.","In terms of the earnings power, the earnings power is operating earnings and those are based on the fees of the base benefits. And we see fees sort of leveling off a bit here. You saw us report on the statutory that the VA fees are sort of leveling off because the total balances we're seeing some negative flows. So I think you'll see that staying more steady going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. John, wanted to dig into the charge a little bit more. And it sounds to me like at a high level, that the charge could be split between partial what's an assumption review, but also moving from this accounting standard of the insurance SOP 03-1, so the embedded derivative convention. So if we try to bifurcate that $1.5 billion of policyholder charges between what's assumption changes and what's a change in the accounting standard, can you help us think how we would split that?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's a great question, but it's very difficult to do because we have changed several assumptions, so if you lower annuitization which we did and increase dollar-for-dollar, that's assumption of what people are doing, but then the accounting changes it as well. And so it's interrelations between all these the actuaries, call it, the cross effect and it's a pretty big number. So if I give you one piece but there's a big cross effect in how they all add up and we can't reattribute the cross effect to it. So it's a little misleading to just look at one piece of it. They're all interrelated as you do all of these, and so in the end, it's really the total number that we have to communicate.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then maybe just...","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","But you can see the increase to the FAS 133 reserves. It's a significant increase and it's most of that $1.5 billion.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And just maybe back into the economics of it all. You gave four points as to what the policyholder behavior assumption changes were, and it just seemed, I guess, taking the simplified view, that if you increase the dollar-for-dollar utilization, that tends to be bad news for a charge, and conversely, if you increase the annuitization uptake, that tends to be positive to the business. I'm not sure if I'm reading that correctly, but I guess my question is two-fold there. Is that correct, do I have the right read on that, and why is that the case?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, we lowered the number that take annuitizations based on our experience and increased \u2013 particularly at older ages, we're seeing more people taking dollar-for-dollar, and in particular in qualified plans. Now, how these things interact with each other depend upon the future fund performance and where interest rates are. So you could see under GAAP, which for dollar-for-dollar used the fair value accounting which assumes much lower returns for separate accounts and interest rates. There's a cost to that. Whereas in statutory, which assumes a mean reversion of interest rates and separate our account returns that are reflecting equity markets that are in, say and call it, more normal, is actually a decrease in reserve.","So there's a switch-over point here between what happens to economic assumptions between the ultimate costs of these. And why is that? Well, the dollar-for-dollar becomes a cost if you run out of money in your account and then you trigger the guarantee. If you have okay investment performance, you may not trigger the guarantee. You'll have enough money in your account for a long period of time. If your separate accounts are earning 1.36%, you're going to run out of money and you have more people triggering the guarantees. So it's a combination of these two. And where all this ends up will likely be some place in between these. So it'll depend upon what policyholders do as well as what equity markets are and what interest rates are.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you and good morning. On the third quarter actuarial assumption review, do you have any perspective in terms of the potential magnitude of that impact?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We did accelerate not only the policyholder behavior review, but also the economic assumption review, and the risk margin review for the VA business, which is a very large book-of-business relative to the total risk profile of MetLife. The other reviews that we do every year on mortality and morbidity and the other blocks of business will just have to wait until we get there. But if you look back over MetLife's history, those tend to be more modest.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful. Thanks, John. Also, based on the timing of the filing of the S-1 or Form 10 for Brighthouse, should we be expecting any share buybacks in 2016?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","As I mentioned in my remarks \u2013 it's Steve here \u2013 our first order of business is to work on the separation and make sure we have a clear understanding about capitalization of Brighthouse, the form of the separation. Once we get through that, we will focus on the issue of how we'll use any remaining excess capital. So we are not at that point yet, where we can really speak to when share repurchases may begin.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I appreciate that, Steve. Post the transaction, would you still anticipate that Met can meet its targeted goals of return of capital as a percentage of earnings?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Our philosophy hasn't changed. Our accelerating value initiative is based upon driving up, among other things, the ratio of free cash flow to total operating earnings, and we think this separation plan, as well as expense initiative that we just announced, goes to that as well. And we've also said philosophically many times that excess capital belongs to our shareholders, that's in the form of dividends, share repurchases and any acquisitions that make strategic sense that are accretive to shareholders over time.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Good morning. My first question is, just thinking about the third quarter review. John, you had already mentioned the $300 million separation-related charge due to lack of a diversification benefit. But as you think about anything else or areas to watch out for, can you highlight any particular areas, whether that's goodwill or DAC that we should be focused on, where the review will come under more scrutiny in 3Q?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, there will be two things going on in the third quarter just to clarify. There will be our annual assumption review for other than variable annuities and then there's the re-segmentation. And both can have an impact, as I've said historically, MetLife other than for variability annuities, the assumption review has been more modest. And the re-segmentation we've highlighted for you what we've seen already in terms of the re-segmentation of the diversification for universal life and variable life not having the diversification credit across all of MetLife. And we will be checking our goodwill in the third quarter, but I can't give you any insight into that until we get all that work done.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then the follow-up is you'd mentioned after the re-segmentation occurs, there's going to be an adverse effect. You mentioned the charge, but is there also going to be an ongoing adverse effect on the operating results? Is there going to be a lower level of operating earnings from the variable annuity business and the life insurance business, and how should we think about that?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, I did say that we expect there could be some ongoing impacts, but we won't be able to clarify that for you until we get to the third quarter.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First, on the cost saves, the $1 billion gross amount, are there any reinvestment assumptions that would net to a lower amount, other than the $200 million of stranded overhead?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Ryan, there will be investments. We are still working out the details of those and as we develop our plans in more detail, we'll share with you really the net impacts. By the time we get to 2019, we expect almost all that to be falling through to the bottom line. But there will be investments. We did the $1 billion saves in 2012 and there was a lot of reorganizing that this next set will be really quite a structural and an investment in processing and efficiencies such as you saw the CSC announcement that we did. So this next $1 billion will take some investment to get the long-term cost saves but we do plan to have this flow through to the bottom line end of 2019 run rate, which will be 2020 going forward.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, got it. And then on corporate segment, I guess, you're at $411 million of year-to-date losses, which is higher than the $500 million to $700 million full year expectation you had. Can you give us any update on how to think about the corporate setting going to the second half of the year?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so this quarter was higher. We had lower VII which impacted it, just happened to be the assets that were there. The alternative investments were lower. And then taxes had an impact in the quarter there. Corporate is used to level out taxes for the year and we had to take a charge to level out the tax rate for the year. So those are more one-time.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS. Please go ahead.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Just wanted to follow up on the expense savings of $1 billion. How should we think about that splitting between the separated company and old MetLife?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","This will all be for RemainCo.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, got it. And then as we think, I guess for Steve, about the ROE of the company, I know there's lots of moving pieces, but by our calculation, you're somewhere in the 9%, maybe 9.5% range on a normalized basis, and I think in the past, you've talked about 11% as a target. I guess I'm just trying to understand what kept us from 9% and change up to 11% in this low interest rate environment?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Suneet, the things you've heard about over the last couple quarters, including the separation of the U.S. Retail business, as well as the expense initiative that we just announced, are all related to driving that ROE number back up to a range that we like to see it at.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","And is that range still around 11% or...","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we'll talk to you more about ranges at Investor Day in December.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much. John, would you just remind us briefly all the choices that customers have at the end of the waiting period for the GMIB? You mentioned, of course, that they can annuitize at the end of the waiting period. But under your most popular contract forms that you've written over the years, what are the other paths that a customer could take, besides annuitization?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. So, although it does vary by contract, the GMIB has, after a 10-year waiting period, the ability to take your balance and get an annuity to be paid for life, based on your benefit base, not on your account balance. And you get the greater of current annuity rates or guarantees of annuity rates that do have a setback in. And that's with a benefit base or your current account balance at current annuity rates.","But you can also then, for many of the contracts, not take that option and instead elect dollar-for-dollar, which is almost like a WB benefit for life. And if you run out of your dollar-for-dollar money by taking up to your percentage allowed, if your account balance is zero, then you get an annuity for life. So that almost gives you the same thing, and we're seeing less people take annuitization options and more people elect dollar-for-dollar, particularly as they age and more in qualified plans.","There's another feature that I spoke about that allows sort of a refund of your initial premiums paid, the first, I think, 120 days. We call it the (52:39) principal option. You can surrender your rider and get this top-off of money to be your premiums paid, but you lose then your other benefits of the other rider features for it. And then, you can always surrender your contract for cash at any time. There's no waiting period, but you have a surrender charge for the first typically five years to seven years, depending upon the contract.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And I have one second and final question regarding universal life. I'm trying to understand better than I do why this matter of looking at things on a policy-by-policy basis would lead to a reserve increase in universal life. And the reason I ask the question is, life insurance companies are always dealing with groups of policies, cohorts, averages. There's no reason to think that using an averaging method, rather than a policy-by-policy approach, would lead to a bias of overstatement or understatement. So why is, if you follow my question, it is \u2013 why is going with a \u2013 I understand that going with a policy-by-policy approach is more precise than using an average, but why would it necessarily lead to \u2013 why didn't the average work, and why did it lead, in other words, to a reserve deficiency, this averaging approach?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Within the cohorts that were being modeled before, there was a much wider variation than the average within the cohort. So, although there was an average amount of premiums paid within a group, there was a much bigger percentage of people paying the minimum, versus people paying a higher amount. And so we were underestimating the number of policyholders that will trigger the guarantees, and then trigger them sooner. So it's just a wider dispersion. But if you're going policy-by-policy, it came out to be a more precise calculation than the average way that was being done previously.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I got it. Thanks very much.","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","In terms of \u2013 to put the charge into perspective, the universal life piece of the charge, the $257 million was about $200 million, and that's about 1.6% of the total reserves for universal life with (54:53) guarantees. It's about $12.5 billion. So it is a true-up of reserves. It's a better method to calculate it, which we do from time to time. But in terms of perspective, it's not that material of a change.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR. Please go ahead.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thanks. Actually, just two questions, one follow-up there, with Eric's question. Are there any other major blocks that need to be migrated to these more granular systems? This is in regard to the SGOL, just wondering if we might see similar reserve charges, if you continue this, what I think is a technology migration.","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. This is one of the biggest and most complex areas. And of course, lower interest rates has made this a larger reserve needed as universal life with lifetime secondary guarantees. Lower rates have made these contracts to be more valuable to their customers and therefore, we've had to increase the reserves on them.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great. And then back to the main VA charge, I'm just trying to think, at a higher level, it seems like, once people exhaust their separate account, you have a cliff effect where the swap rate becomes your discount rate, rather than the mean reversion assumptions under STAT. And I think I'm saying that right, but if that is the case, then can you size what percentage of people you think in that overall VA block were going to continue to monitor at Brighthouse are expected to exhaust their separate account, and therefore be exposed to the 10-year swap as a discount rate?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right. Well, we're seeing less people annuitize. If you annuitize, you don't pick dollar-for-dollar. So less people annuitize, more people pick dollar-for-dollar. But the actual calculations are highly complex. We run tens of thousands of runs over a wide range of scenarios. So when you talk about these interest rates, these are the average interest rates, both even in STAT and GAAP. It's just the mean of those interest rates in STAT reverts to roughly this 4.25% in 2027, whereas the GAAP piece, if you pick dollar-for-dollar, a piece of your risk, the guaranteed piece, the certain period of your annuity, has to be reserved under GAAP using like a mean reversion interest rate of 1.36%.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Right.","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's a very wide difference, including a separate account returns. I want to stress, that's a separate account return before fees. So you're generally having negative returns in your separate accounts. You can see how that can have a high cost to this. If interest rates migrate higher, and you have to mark this every quarter to the current yield curve. As interest rates go up, this charge becomes less as you go through time. So I actually wanted to give you the wide range of the changes because what the ultimate cost of these things will be will depend on interest rates and what policyholders do.","I would also like to stress, this is over a long period of time. Our average age of these contracts is in the 60s and people elect these options well into their 80s and higher. So these are long-term contracts and how this works out over time will be the ultimate cost, but we do match this to our experience and we do it on a regular basis as we get credible experience. And we now have a new industry study that we just got that had some good credible experience for GMIBs, and that's why we set our reserves appropriately.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thank you.","Unverified Participant","We're at the top of the hour.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note on the forward-looking statements in yesterday\u2019s earnings release. ","With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.","John Hall","Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone and welcome to MetLife's third quarter 2019 earnings call. Before we begin, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release, and in our quarterly financial supplements which you should review.","Joining me this morning on the call are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management.","Last night, we released an expanded set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along.","The content for the slides begins following the romanette pages that feature a number of GAAP reconciliations. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend to the top of the hour. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michel.","Michel Khalaf","Thank you, John and good morning everyone. There is a growing sense of urgency and excitement at MetLife. We are renewing our commitment to being a purpose-driven company. We are making good progress on a strategy that defines the right markets, solutions, and competitive differentiators and we are building a culture that is customer-focused and highly collaborative. I am confident we are assembling all the right ingredients to win in the marketplace and create long-term value for our shareholders.","Turning to our third quarter results, MetLife delivered solid earnings despite a challenging capital markets environment marked by falling interest rates. We continue to build a company that can perform well across economic cycles.","As we reported last night, net income totaled $2.2 billion, up from $880 million in the third quarter of 2018. This result mainly reflected the impact of declining interest rates on our derivative portfolio as accounting rules require us to mark our hedges to market through the income statement but not the assets or liabilities being hedged.","Quarterly adjusted earnings totaled $1.2 billion or $1.27 per share compared with $1.4 billion or $1.38 per share in the third quarter of 2018. Excluding all notable items, we reported quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.54 per share compared with $1.5 billion or $1.53 per share a year ago.","Our adjusted return on equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA and ex-notables, was 12.9% and MetLife's book value per share as noted in our press release was up 13% to $48.56 from a year ago.","During the third quarter, we completed our annual actuarial assumption review which John McCallion will discuss in greater detail. As part of the review, MetLife changed its long-term interest rate assumption from 4.25% to 3.75%.","Along with other insurance adjustments, the impact of the actuarial review on adjusted earnings was negative $160 million with an incremental $19 million effect on net income. The overall results were in line with our expectations and with the disclosures we provided to you on our second quarter call. We believe this reflects our progress in becoming a simpler company, that derives more of its earnings from protection and capital-light businesses.","Excluding just the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, which is on a basis consistent with the consensus estimate, adjusted earnings were $1.44 per share. Market conditions in the third quarter were mixed. While lower recurring investment margins and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar had a negative impact on adjusted earnings, MetLife also benefited from higher variable investment income driven by strong private equity performance.","Investments is an area where MetLife enjoys longstanding advantages. The size of our portfolio coupled with the capabilities of our investment team allow us to differentiate through higher-yielding, private placements, commercial mortgages and private equities, all of which have generated significant alpha across economic cycles.","Moving to specific third quarter business highlights. Our market-leading U.S. group business reported strong results. The drivers were volume growth, especially sales of voluntary benefits as well as favorable expense margins and solid underwriting. Our U.S. group business has longstanding strategic partnerships, some of which date back a century.","Today, it offers the widest range of employee benefits products anywhere in the industry. This helps our customers meet the ever-evolving needs and expectations of their current and potential employees. In short, we help win the war for talent.","In addition, the size and scale of the business make it easier for us to invest in enrollment technology, claims management and privacy protection. This fuels a virtuous cycle that allows us to strengthen our relationships with customers while preserving and extending our advantages.","We are the leading player in the large market segment with over 25% market share and we see further growth through greater voluntary product penetration. We are also extending our reach into the regional and small markets, where we believe our competitive advantages provide the same opportunity to drive growth and market share.","Turning to our other MetLife businesses, excluding notable items, adjusted earnings in our Retirement and Income Solutions business were down compared with a very strong third quarter of 2018 despite good volume growth and pension risk transfer sales. This quarter, lower interest and underwriting margins had a negative impact.","In our Property & Casualty business, adjusted earnings were down compared with a strong third quarter a year ago, driven mainly by higher cat losses and lower underlying underwriting margins. In our Asia business, strong volume growth and higher variable investment income drove an increase in adjusted earnings more than offsetting the effects of a strong U.S. dollar.","Our Latin America business benefited from volume growth and equity market performance while facing headwinds from tax items, recurring investment margins and foreign exchange pressures. In our EMEA business, lower underwriting margins and higher taxes offset volume growth and favorable expense margins.","Finally, while adjusted earnings were down in MetLife Holdings, the performance of that business is firmly within our expected range for the year.","Moving to expenses, excluding notable items and pension risk transfers, our direct expense ratio for the third quarter was 12.2% compared with 13.1% a year ago. This was driven by favorable items related to the market impact on employee benefits costs revenue growth and continued discipline around expenses. We remain on-track to deliver $800 million in margin expansion by 2020 as promised.","Over the longer term, we intend to achieve greater economies of scale. We have made significant progress on this front opening multiple centers of excellence here in the U.S. and around the world that lower costs, improve controls and drive down development.","Overall, we are shifting from one-off cost initiatives to a continuous efficiency mindset where we will drive savings and greater efficiency to support continued investment and growth. Capital deployment is one of the most critical and carefully considered decisions, we make at MetLife.","We are committed to deploying capital, where it will generate the highest risk-adjusted returns. This means, exercising the same discipline across all potential uses of capital, whether to underwrite organic growth, support in-force business, finance M&A, all fund common dividends and share repurchases.","With a volatile third quarter equity market, we opportunistically push forward some of our planned annual share buyback activity for the year. In total, we repurchased $785 million of MetLife shares in the quarter. During the first three quarters of 2019 combined, we returned more than $3.2 billion to shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases.","In closing, we are pleased to deliver another good quarter, the latest installment in our improving track record of consistent execution. We have a collection of great businesses and clear advantages that we believe will continue to set us apart. I am encouraged by our progress and look forward to sharing more about our next horizon strategy and our businesses at MetLife's upcoming Investor Day on December 12. ","With that I will turn the call over to John McCallion to cover our third quarter performance in greater detail. ","John McCallion","Thank you Michel, and good morning. I will begin by discussing the 3Q, 2019 supplemental slides that we released last evening along with our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. Starting on Page 4, the schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the third quarter of 2019.","Net income was $2.2 billion or $962 million higher than adjusted earnings of $1.2 billion. This variance is primarily due to higher net derivative gains resulting from the decline in interest rates during the quarter. Overall the results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected.","I will now discuss the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review starting on Page 5. During the actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments reduced net income by $179 million of which $160 million impacted adjusted earnings.","The most significant driver was the reduction of our long-term U.S. 10-year treasury interest rate assumption from 4.25% to 3.75% with the rate mean reverting over the next 8 years. This impact was in line with our prior guidance of $50 million after-tax for every 25 basis point reduction disclosed on our second quarter 2019 earnings call.","With regards to long-term care, our statutory reserves have grown to $15.6 billion as of September 30, 2019, which is $2.7 billion higher than GAAP reserves. We also continue to have substantial LTC loss recognition testing margin of $1.8 billion as of September 30, 2019 which compares to $2.1 billion at 3Q, 2018.","Roughly half of the decrease was due to an approximate 10 basis point reduction in our average lapsed rate assumption, while the remainder was due to the change in our U.S. 10-year treasury mean reversion rate. The impact from these changes was broadly in line with the sensitivities we provided a year ago on our 3Q, 2018 earnings call.","On page six we provide a breakdown of the actuarial assumption review by business segment. In MetLife Holdings, approximately $100 million of the net income impact was due to the lowering of the mean reversion interest rate to 3.75%, with the remaining impact driven primarily by refinements in assumptions related to our regulatory closed block. We also had a few minor adjustments outside the U.S. in Asia, LatAm and EMEA.","We had two notable items in the quarter as shown on page seven and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. In addition to the $160 million after-tax, or $0.17 per share, related to our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings by $88 million after tax, or $0.09 per share. Adjusted earnings excluding both notable items were $1.4 billion, or $1.54 per share.","On page eight, you can see the year-over-year adjusted earnings, excluding notable items by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were down 6% and down 5% on a constant currency basis.","On a per share basis, adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were up 1% on both a reported and a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Overall, positive year-over-year drivers include solid volume growth and better expense margins.","Investment margins were mixed, as continued strength in variable investment income was offset by lower recurring interest margins. In addition, underwriting was generally less favorable relative to a very strong 3Q 2018.","With regards to business performance, Group Benefits adjusted earnings excluding notable items were up 10% year-over-year, driven by volume growth and better expense margins. The business continues to benefit from strong volume growth with adjusted PFOs in the quarter up 6% and year-to-date sales up 10%, led by growth in voluntary products across all market segments. In addition, we saw solid underwriting in the quarter.","Group Life mortality ratio was 87%, which is modestly below the mid-point of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. Although, this was less favorable compared to a very strong result of 85% in 3Q, 2018. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non-Medical Health was 70.3%, which is below our annual target range of 72% to 77% and favorable to the prior year quarter of 71.6%, after excluding a notable insurance adjustment. The primary driver was strong disability results, which benefited from renewal rate actions and higher claim recoveries.","Retirement and Income solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 16% year-over-year. The key drivers were lower investment margins as weaker recurring interest regions exceeded the positive contribution from variable investment income and less favorable underwriting margins. This was partially offset by favorable expense margins.","RIS investment spreads were 102 basis points in 3Q 2019, down 23 basis points year-over-year and down 17 basis points sequentially. Strong private equity returns were more than offset by the ongoing pressure from low rates and the inverted yield curve as well as the recent dislocation in the repo market during the quarter. We continue to expect spreads to remain in the bottom half of our 2019 guidance range of 100 to 125 basis points.","RIS adjusted PFOs were up 13% year-over-year, driven by $1.3 billion of pension risk transfer deals in 3Q 2019. Excluding PRTs, RIS PFOs were down 9% due to lower sales of institutional income annuities.","Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were down 34%, primarily due to unfavorable underwriting in the quarter. The auto combined ratio was 98.7%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 95.5%, primarily due to higher vitally injury severity.","In addition, pretax cat losses of $70 million were $21 million higher than the prior year quarter, but in line with our expected 3Q 2019 cat load. While underwriting results were unfavorable this quarter, we expect our full year 2019 combined ratios for auto and home to be within their targeted range. With regards to the topline, P&C adjusted PFOs were up 2%, while sales were down 4% versus 3Q 2018.","Asia adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were up 5% and up 6% on a constant currency basis. The positive year-over-year drivers were favorable volume growth as assets under management, excluding fair value adjustments, grew 13% year-over-year. In addition, results also reflected better investment margins and lower taxes. These were partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins.","Asia sales were down 7% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of the divested business in Hong Kong and a large group case in Australia in the prior year quarter, Asia sales were up 1% year-over-year.","In Japan, sales were down 15%, primarily driven by a 32% year-over-year decline in foreign currency-denominated annuity products. FX annuity products, which are primarily sold through bank channels, had another soft quarter given the further drop in U.S. interest rates. This resulted in an overall reduction in bank market sales. In addition, our A&H sales in Japan were down 15% year-over-year, which is a function of changes in the tax laws associated with certain products. Other Asia sales were up 7% due to strong growth in Korea, China, and India.","Latin America adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were up 2% and 7% on a constant currency basis. The primary drivers were the favorable impact from capital markets on our Chilean encaje and volume growth across the region. These were partially offset by lower investment margins, primarily due to lower inflation in Mexico and Chile.","Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 4% and 8% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region. Latin America sales were up 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher sales in Chile, Mexico and Brazil.","EMEA adjusted earnings excluding notable items were down 15% and down 13% on a constant currency basis. The main drivers were less favorable underwriting, primarily related to employee benefits in the U.K. and the Gulf as well as higher taxes. These were partially offset by favorable expense margins. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 6% on a constant currency basis and sales were up 13% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth across the region.","MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings excluding notable items were down 18%, driven by lower recurring interest margins and the impact of $30 million of favorable items in 3Q, 2018. These were partially offset by favorable expense margins.","With regard to underwriting, the life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 67.5% but 51.9% excluding the impact from the annual actuarial assumption review. While this ratio is higher than the prior year quarter of 50.9% on the same basis, it was firmly within our annual target range of 50% to 55%.","Corporate & Other adjusted loss excluding notable items was $135 million. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter, which had an adjusted loss of $149 million due to lower taxes and interest expense on debt. This was partially offset by less favorable expense margins.","The company\u2019s effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 17.6%, which was aided by increased tax-exempt income and the timing of some tax benefits in Argentina. We would view the run rate to be 18.8% and within our 2019 guidance of 18% to 20%.","Now let's turn to page 9 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pre-tax variable investment income for the past seven quarters, including $326 million earned in the current quarter. Our private equity portfolio, which is accounted for on a one quarter lag had another strong quarter. For the year-to-date, VII was $834 million pre-tax and we now expect to be above our 2019 guidance range of $800 million to $1 billion.","Now, I will discuss recurring investment income. Our new money rate was 3.65% versus a roll-off rate of 4.19% in 3Q, 2019. This compares to a new money rate of 4.04% and a roll-off rate of 4.37% in 3Q, 2018. Lower interest rates have pressured the spread. As we have noted previously, we would not expect parity to occur until we have a sustained U.S. 10-year treasury yield of roughly 3% to 3.25%.","Turning to page 10. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2018, as well as the first three quarters of 2019. We are committed to and have a clear line of sight towards achieving our goal of $800 million of pre-tax profit margin improvement by 2020. This would represent an approximate 200 basis point decline in our annual direct expense ratio from 2015 baseline year.","We believe the annual direct expense ratio best reflects the impact on profit margins as it captures the relationship of revenues and the expenses over which we have the most control. We have made consistent progress towards achieving our target by 2020.","As the chart illustrates, we have already achieved 140-basis point improvement in the annual direct expense ratio from 2015 to 2018. For 3Q 2019, we posted another strong result as the direct expense ratio excluding notable items and PRTs came in at 12.2%. This was aided by roughly 30 basis of favorable items including lower employee benefit costs related to market movements in the third quarter.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher than our 2019 year-to-date trend. This is a function of the strong growth we have enjoyed in our Group Benefits business where we will incur seasonal enrollment and other costs prior to receiving associated premiums. In addition we estimate costs associated with our unit cost initiative to be a few cents per share higher in the fourth quarter as we execute on the final elements of this program.","I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Page 11. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $3.5 billion at September 30th, which is down from $4.2 billion at June 30th. Holdco cash decreased this quarter given the timing of subsidiary dividends and our capital management actions. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and common dividends in the quarter, clear evidence of our ongoing commitment to capital management.","Next, I would like to provide you an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, preliminary third quarter year-to-date 2019 statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.4 billion and net earnings were approximately $3 billion. Statutory operating earnings decreased by $195 million from the prior year period, primarily due to the impact of a prior year dividend from the investment subsidiary, partially offset by lower VA rider reserves and improved underwriting results.","We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $20 billion as of September 30th, 2019, up 9% compared to December 31st, 2018. The increase in operating earnings and derivative gains were partially offset by dividends paid to the holding company.","Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 896% as of June 30th, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife continued to deliver strong results leveraging our diverse market-leading businesses to drive capital-efficient growth, while maintaining expense discipline across the firm. We have been able to grow book value per share 13% year-over-year, while generating an adjusted ROE of 12.9% excluding notable items in the quarter, despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. In addition our cash and capital position as well as our balance sheet remains strong and resilient.","Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking will continue to create long-term sustainable value for our customers and our shareholders.","And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. So, I had a question on group insurance margins and if you could just discuss what drove your strong results this quarter? And then also relatedly, everyone's had pretty good margins in the last couple of years now, so have you seen companies start to reflect that in their pricing? And what have you seen as you're going through renewal season right now?","Ramy Tadros","Good morning, Jimmy. It's Ramy Tadros here. In terms of the margins this quarter and if you look at the year-on-year comparisons with respect to life, we're actually slightly up between this year and last year. We came in at 87% and slightly higher -- lower than our midpoint. And what drove the difference quarter-to-quarter -- quarter-on-quarter is the higher incidence.","With respect to the Non-Medical Health loss ratio, clearly that was below the low end of our guidance. And that's largely driven by the lower claim sensitivity -- severity rather with respect to disability and higher recoveries.","Look -- if you look at these ratios, they do fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. And we would expect generally to come in towards the middle range -- the middle part of our range. Having said that, I would emphasize that if you look at it year-to-date -- our year-to-date numbers in mortality -- if you look at last year for example, our year-to-date numbers for mortality came in -- we were below the bottom half of our range. And you looked at Q4 and we came in, smack in the middle of that range.","So if you think about the competitive environment, we still operate in a highly competitive environment. But when we look towards 2020, we're pleased with our rate actions and we're pleased with our renewal actions as well.","Michel Khalaf","Maybe -- hi, Jimmy its Michel. Maybe I just would add one comment with regards to Non-Medical Health, which is coming in favorable and below the -- sort of in the lower half of the range, which we think will continue for the year. And that's a combination of the favorable disability experience as well as the shift in product mix to voluntary, which has a lower benefit ratio and that we continue to see strong momentum in voluntary, and we think that will persist and continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. A couple of quick ones for you. Is there \u2013 John, is there any go-forward earnings impact from the actuarial review, is my first one. Second one is just, can you discuss how well hedged? Or to what degree you have hedges for your long-term care cash flows?","","John McCallion","Good morning, Tom.","Tom Gallagher","\u2026thanks.","John McCallion","Yeah. You broke up there. I think I got it. The first one, I think the quick answer is no. First, I think 100 of the 160 was right in line with what we shared back in 2Q with regards to the drop in long-term interest rate. So that came in as expected.","And then we had a variety of other items and it was mainly the regulatory closed block that drove the remainder there.","In terms of long-term care, we do have some quite a bit of hedges on. And actually I'd say, we've locked in kind of the investment returns for the next five years or so. We have a number of forward starting instruments that we've entered into over time. So we're kind of protected for the next five years. And obviously, we have hedges beyond that. But rollover reinvestment risk would persist beyond that.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kligerman","Hey, good morning. First question, Ramy could you elaborate on what you were saying about pleased about renewal actions. Could you give us a sense of maybe pricing? Is it up in group? Is it flat? What made you pleased?","Ramy Tadros","Good morning, Andrew. I mean, look if you think about by way of context as we just look into 2020, when we think of our business, we look at overall growth in the business across both renewals as well as sales. So sales are an important component of that growth but we also focus very heavily on renewals in getting our rate actions combined with strong persistency.","We're still in the midst of our 2020 sales and renewal season. It's more mature for national account less earlier in the season for regional and smaller accounts. But with respect to national account activity, strong quote activity. We're still winning our fair share. We're seeing less of the jumbos come to market and we're defining jumbos as sales over $20 million.","And we have expectations in terms of targets, in terms of renewal rates and sales and so far so good, where we're actually in line with our expectations. And we also continue to see strong momentum in voluntary, as Michel mentioned, and we continue to deploy new capabilities in the market, especially around enrollment and reenrollment in the voluntary space.","Andrew Kligerman","Okay. So -- all right. Well, as I go through the next question maybe Ramy you could just say up or down on pricing or neutral. But the next question would be with regard to capital. So you've guided to a 65% to 75% payout ratio. And last quarter the payout ratio was 88%. This year \u2013 this quarter it was 100%.","You're kind of at the midpoint of your liquidity at the parent company. So the question is, can you keep this payout ratio well above your guidance. And maybe you could give some color on redeployable capital at the subs in addition to what you have at the parent?","John McCallion","Good morning, Andrew. It's John. Let's just to kind of level set. I'd say our guidance has been a 65% to 75% free cash flow ratio on average over a two year period. And obviously, in any quarter that can fluctuate one way or the other.","In terms of \u2013 and what we've said in the past is without barring other strategic investments that would meet risk-adjusted returns that we believe would be appropriate, this capital in our minds belong to the shareholders. And Michel has talked about that quite a bit. And so all else equal, that would be used for dividends and share repurchases.","But to your point, I think Michel commented that in his opening remarks, we have accelerated a bit of that this year. I wouldn't consider this a run rate. And I think as Michel mentioned, we probably pulled -- we're opportunistic this quarter and given timing of cash flows and things like that.","Andrew Kligerman","So there's capital in the subs as well that might be re-deployable? Curious if there are any numbers you could give us?","John McCallion","Well, we have -- we've talked about our normal operating level and a minimum of 360% under an NAIC RBC ratio for the combined U.S. entities. Last year, we were above that. But I'd say I think about our 65 to 75 on average for a two-year period is the right number and it can be -- it can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. And then I referenced Michel's comments earlier that we were opportunistic this quarter and we accelerated some of the share repurchases in the quarter given market dynamics and timing of cash flows.","Andrew Kligerman","Got it. And just a quick up\/down from Ramy on the pricing in group?","Ramy Tadros","I would say in line.","Andrew Kligerman","In line. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. Just first on statutory results. John, any thoughts on AAT reserves as you go into the year-end filing?","John McCallion","Not at the moment. We're working through the process now. It's that time of the year and I don't -- there's nothing concerning at this point. We're just going through the process.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. And then on the RIS spread, I think you said still feel comfortable with the lower half of the 100 to 125 guide. Was that for the fourth quarter? Or was that sort of a full year expectation?","John McCallion","Yes. So, my commentary is regarding full year and we've talked about this guidance as a full year guidance. So, we said we'd be within the 100 to 125, albeit at the bottom half of the range.","And maybe just a little additional color because it's a good question. I think -- look, sequentially we're down about 17 basis points, 12 of that was in RIS which is the allocation of VII. They had actually a pretty high VII allocation in the second quarter.","And then the remaining drop was the function of just lower rates and the inversion of the curve as well as I mentioned just a little bit of the dislocation we saw in the repo market. But as we look forward and the projected forward curve does support a view that we're -- we believe we're at the bottom of the spread compression or near it, let's say, and at least for the near-term and maybe you say next several quarters.","And so maybe in other words to look at this you'd say that this spread is a decent run rate in our mind. And we think of that as VII which has been a heavy contributor probably normalizes some and we see an improvement at least based on the forward curve in the spread ex-VII over the next several quarters.","Suneet Kamath","Great. Thanks John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Outside of the few cents of higher expense initiative costs in the fourth quarter, can you help us think about the potential sizing of typical seasonality in the direct expense ratio for 4Q?","John McCallion","Hard to estimate exactly from a sizing perspective, but we do typically see it happen in the third and fourth. I\u2019d say, we did not see it come through yet in the third. So we do expect there to be an uptick in the fourth quarter on that direct expense ratio as you said ex the UCI onetime time costs.","It's not so predictable. It depends on some of the marketing costs that we deploy in our enrollment capabilities there, as we move through enrollment season and so it can vary. But I'd say, there's an upward trend and probably as I said heading -- it's ahead of what we've seen certainly year-to-date without question.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. Got it. And then on P&C, can you give a little bit more color on what you saw in the underlying loss ratio? And to what extent do you think it may remain somewhat elevated near term? ","Michel Khalaf","Yes. I mean, if you look at the year-on-year results with respect to P&C, I would say the drop is 50:50. We've had a -- 50% of the drop was due to the elevated cat losses this quarter. I'd remind you should compare that as -- compared to a fairly benign Q3 of 2018. But the losses this quarter were very much inline with our expectations for third quarter.","The other 50% of it is the higher severity in the auto liability coverages and particularly bodily injury cranes. This has been consistent with what many others have seen in the industry we continue to monitor these trends and we have a track record of adjusting our rate activity accordingly and looking to take rate actions to make sure we continue to remain within our target combined ratios. ","Ryan Krueger","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. Just curious how is low interest rate environment affecting product demand and new business margins in the RIS business? ","Michel Khalaf","Hi Erik. So the place where we felt it a bit this quarter is in the immediate annuity sales. We are the largest seller of the institutional income annuities and we've seen some softness in terms of sales this quarter. As the rates come down the value proposition for the individual buying those annuities decreases clearly. So we've seen some softness there in terms of sales.","In terms of PRT haven't seen it. We still are looking at a very robust pipeline into the rest of the year and into next year and in particular in the jumbo space where we are most active. Clearly of course, if you look at our liability balances in RIS lower interest rates actually grow these balances, if you think about the mark-to-market effect on the fixed income balances there. ","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you. And then one question on investments, in your alternatives portfolio, you talked about continued good performance, some private equity, like one that your competitors had and issue with mark down on a specific position. So just wondering, how much exposure you have to large single company positions, either in public or private securities? ","Steve Goulart","Well like our -- its Steve Goulart. Like our overall investment portfolio, it is broad and diversified. Recall our private equity portfolio is over $6.5 billion across dozens of different managers and more than that in funds. So it's fairly diversified. Obviously some managers may invest in similar investments. But we're scratching our head a little bit too and we can't figure out what might have happened in one of our competitors. We're certainly aware of nothing in our portfolio that would cause an action like that today.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Looking at sales in Japan, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about some of the moving pieces. But given the ongoing low interest rate, and I guess the uncertainty of some of the tax regulation, how should we think about the sales in Japan going into the fourth quarter, and I guess going into 2020?","Kishore Ponnavolu","Yeah, Humphrey this is Kishore Ponnavolu. There are two parts to this, right? One is the annuities that John referenced vis-\u00e0-vis the bank channel. Of all the channels we have that's probably the most volatile ups and downs. So we've had a couple of high watermarks in the past four quarters. So the year-over-year comparisons are going to be somewhat challenging for the next two to three quarters as far as the annuities are concerned.","When you think about the -- John referenced the interest rate is one driver. There are couple of other drivers as well. Seasonality is another driver and what's going on with the -- mutual fund sales is another driver. But the reality is the overall market is down and we're holding our share. And we'll go up and down with the market. And what we won't do is chase after market share by giving up value.","Vis-\u00e0-vis, the A&H side, as you're very well aware of the tax law clarification and changes and that has impacted some of our products, we withdrew a product in the second quarter. So essentially if you take that effect out, our A&H sales are actually up year-over-year. It's going to take some time to make up for a lost product and the lost sales associated with the product. But the fact is as Michel referenced, we're very proud to be very customer-centric and to take actions that are appropriate, that are the right things for the customer.","And there are a lot of actions that we have in place to come back up. But two to three quarters year-on-year comparisons again are going to be a little challenging, but we'll make up. There are a lot of other tools in our arsenal. Thank you.","Humphrey Lee","I appreciate the color. Just to revisit back on the Group Benefits margin. Like -- looking at the earnings growth, I think you were guided -- you're guiding for mid-single-digit growth for 2019 and year-to-date at 25%. Like while we understand that there is definitely favorable underwriting in the industry, but the magnitude definitely outpaces the rest of the industry. Like I guess, what do you think if the driver for your block strong performance compared to your peers? And how sustainable is that?","Michel Khalaf","Yeah. I mean if you just look at the overall earnings number, it's driven by three things. The solid underwriting results is one of them, and you saw us coming with strong underwriting results, but there are two other components to it. We've had also strong volume growth especially in voluntary. And we've also had favorable expense margins including positive market impact on some of our employee costs in the Group Benefits business. So it's a combination of the three.","I would still continue to guide you back to those ranges and to the midpoint of those ranges. We do operate in a competitive market. And over time, we expect to be back in the middle of those underwriting ratios that we look at.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Scott","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, when you guys had your outlook last year there was a stress sensitivity for interest rates that suggested about $200 million for 2020. So I'd just be interested if there's any action you've taken this year that would have changed that at all. Because, I mean, just looking at distressed scenario, it does look like we're about there or maybe even a little worse than the stress case that you outlined, so any color? And I guess additionally, how much of that $200 million would maybe already be in the result at sort of the 144 EPS that was reported? ","John McCallion","Good morning, Alex. It's John. Yes, we did give a sensitivity back in the outlook call. We showed a 100 basis point parallel shift in the curve from rates projected to based on the forward curve at that time. And as you said, we are well below that. I think the 10-year is probably down more like 150 and also wasn't parallel. We had a LIBOR drop of maybe 100 or so. So the dynamics are a little different in that sensitivity.","I think in general, I'd say that we feel that sensitivity was broadly in line but we've had some additional pressures come through that are in the numbers. For example, as we've mentioned before, SEC lending has not performed as well as it has in the past. It's still ROE-accretive and a good tool for us but maybe not as profitable of a tool as it has been in the past, which is a good reason to have a diversified book of market-leading businesses, right and to kind of have that at different times when we need it.","So I'd say that the impact of interest rates has probably been a little heavier than what that 100 basis point drop has shown. I'm not so sure that necessarily carries forward, based on what we see to next year. But I'd probably would all else equal go back and say that again, it was meant to be a drop relative to what you would have otherwise expected, not necessarily a year-over-year drop if you think of it that way. So you'd have to work off your own models there and think of it that way. But I think it's probably relatively in line and you'd have to apply some proportional approach to it. Hope that helps. ","Alex Scott","Yes that's very helpful. And then maybe a follow-up on just thinking through top line growth, you have some businesses growing nicely. Holdings obviously, running off. Sales may be slowing a bit in Asia. When I think about all of the puts and takes, do you expect top line to be growing over the next couple of years? And I guess related, do you think you can get any operating leverage coming through in the form of that direct expense ratio still maybe continuing to drop a little bit as you achieve that?","John McCallion","Yes, in a month or maybe less or a little over a month we'll be giving you an outlook. I think we can go business-by-business. It's a little hard to do things at an aggregate level when you think of PFO sometimes, right just because the accounting for instruments can vary. So you have to think about that volume growth or opportunity based on different metrics. Sometimes PFOs are really good. Other times assets under management are better. And I think you're going to have to think of it business-by-business. But I think we believe we have a diverse set of businesses that gives us the ability to compete and win in a variety of economic cycles. That's one.","Two, to your point of operating leverage, I think we've been showing that we can deliver despite -- in a variety of markets. We're well on track to meet our commitment by 2020 and I think if you did your own math today off of the annualized PFOs from a direct expense ratio, we're very close to the 800 I think mathematically already.","Alex Scott","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Josh Shanker","Thank you for taking my question. First question, I just want to understand the -- I guess the product introduction cycle and maybe the sales cycle in Asia. Obviously, we're seeing sales down in Japan, but up in other Asian countries? Are there new products coming in? Are the older products getting, sort of, I guess stable in the marketplace? What's happening in the various sales cycles?","Kishore Ponnavolu","So, this is Kishore. A couple of points. Overall, Asia, if you take Japan and Asia, the Other Asia together were down. Let's take Other Asia; we're up 8% on a constant currency basis. As John referenced Hong Kong, so if you exclude Hong Kong, which has now moved into discontinued ops, we're up 15%. And the three countries that drove that are Korea, China, and India.","Now, we have a portfolio of countries and that's the good thing about the resiliency, right? So, if you exclude Hong Kong, overall, John referenced that Asia is actually up 1%, right? So, that's how it works.","Now, with regards to each country, it's hard to go in and talk about product cycles because it's complicated per se. In Japan, generally speaking, our product cycles are longer because it's a more mature market and we take a little longer to react to changes in the marketplace or customer demands. But at the same time, these are all the things we're working on is to shorten that, increase our response time and to be able to react to these changes effectively. I hope that helps.","Josh Shanker","It helps. Great. Give more detail on the products, but I'll keep digging. And then in Property & Casualty, I'm trying to find out if 3Q 2018 was a light cash -- light catastrophe quarter or 3Q 2019 was a heavy? We haven't seen these kind of U.S. cat losses that some others, so trying to figure out how to think about that going forward?","Michel Khalaf","I would say Q3 2018 was a light one and Q3 2019 was right in line with expectations.","Josh Shanker","Okay, that's great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Barnidge from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","John Barnidge","Thanks. I understand the P&C business has more of a Northeast bend, but can you kind of talk about exposure to the California wildfires please?","Michel Khalaf","Sure. If you look at our exposure in Q3 of last year, it was pretty benign in terms of the fire exposure. And you're right in terms of our geographic concentration, if you look at our market share in California, in home and compare that to the average market share that we have nationally, our market share in California is less than 75% -- 75% smaller than our national market share. So we're relatively less exposed there.","John Barnidge","Okay. And sticking with P&C. I get that you're talking about the increase in cats. But backing out both cats and reserve development, the underlying combined ratio looks like an increase 250 basis points from a year ago and 91.4 versus 88.9. Can you talk about maybe social inflation you may be seeing?","Michel Khalaf","I mean it's really the two factors I've talked about. So if you back out the cats, if you look at the earnings number, that just \u2013 that explains about half the difference. And the other half is specifically inflation in bodily injury claims. And there you talk about medical inflation cost, more litigation, more attorney-represented claims. And that's the trend we're watching carefully and taking appropriate rate actions against it.","John Barnidge","Is there anything you can say around loss cost trends, peg it at a certain percent? Thank you.","Michel Khalaf","Yeah. Not really at the moment.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to John Hall.","John Hall","Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Have a happy Halloween. Talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

On this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and our quarterly financial supplements.","A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and have a significant impact on GAAP net income.","Now, joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer.

The content of the slides begins following the romanette pages that feature a number of GAAP reconciliations. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that given the busy earnings call schedule this morning will extend no longer than the top of the hour. So, in fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one followup.","With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.","Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion or $1.30 per share, up from $1.04 per share a year ago. Overall, it was another strong quarter in 2018, driven by solid underwriting and expense management across the company. Reflecting the strong results, adjusted return on equity in the quarter was 12.2%. After notable items, adjusted earnings were $1.36 per share. The only notable item in the second quarter was cost incurred to support our unit cost initiative, which totaled $0.06 per share.","Net income for the quarter was $845 million compared to $865 million a year ago. During the second quarter, MetLife successfully divested its remaining equity stake in Brighthouse.","Included in second quarter net income is a realized loss on our disposed Brighthouse shares, as well as other transaction costs, which, together, totaled $212 million. These items represent the largest portion of the difference between net income and adjusted earnings in the quarter. We are focused on delivering results where net income and adjusted earnings track more closely than in the past.","Turning to business highlights. Both Group Benefits and Retirement and Income Solutions reported good volume growth and solid underwriting. With Property & Casualty, lower catastrophe losses and improved auto underwriting contributed to solid adjusted earnings, which more than doubled year-over-year.","For our international segments, Asia benefited from volume growth, higher investment income and lower taxes. Latin America faced only minor currency headwinds and EMEA continued to benefit from expense management.","Moving to total company investments, recurring investment income was up 6.7% from a year ago, as the growth and higher interest rates account for the increase. In the quarter, our global new money yield was 3.98% in comparison to an average roll-off rate of 4.52%. Our new money rate was 68 basis points higher than a year ago due to higher interest rates and the significant amount of new money invested in the U.S. after winning the FedEx pension risk transfer deal.","Pre-tax variable investment income totaled $176 million in the quarter as private equity and hedge fund returns were down from prior periods. While pre-tax variable investment income is below our quarterly guidance range of $200 million to $250 million, on a year-to-date basis, VII is at the midpoint of guidance.","I would like to take a moment to frame our view of the U.S. economy and the current credit environment. U.S. macroeconomic performance has been strong, aided by tax reform, repatriation of corporate profits and regulatory relief. The momentum in corporate earnings, which began in late 2016, has continued into the second quarter. Although U.S. credit valuations have been on the tight end of historical range, spreads have widened more recently on geopolitical and trade concerns.","The timing and drivers of a potential economic downturn are currently an area of focus in the credit markets where corporate debt has continued to grow, primarily driven by M&A.","We have seen substantial growth in BBB rated corporate debt, as well as aggressive issuance in the syndicated bank loan market. While we do not believe a downturn is imminent, we are keeping a close eye on the evolving credit market.","With regard to specific fixed income classes, we remain largely neutral on U.S. investment grade bonds and municipals with dedicated revenue streams. We are more cautious on general obligation bonds of states and municipalities with large unfunded pension obligations, as well as certain parts of the high yield market.","We continue to favor private placement credit given our ability to structure deals, negotiate financial covenants, and receive yields above comparable publicly traded bonds. Beyond credit, we favor privately originated assets such as Residential Whole Loans, agricultural loans and commercial mortgages.","Over the last decade, the credit markets have become less liquid for a variety of reasons, including post-financial crisis regulation. We are mindful of this, understanding more time may be required to make portfolio changes. As a result, identifying market shifts and executing strategies early, traditional strengths of MetLife have become even more important in the current environment.","Turning to expenses. I want to provide an update on the progress we are making toward our commitment to realize $800 million in pre-tax savings by 2020. In the first quarter, we began publishing our expense ratio in a way that will allow you to track our progress against our expense target.","We indicated that to meet our goal, MetLife would need to reduce its direct expense ratio excluding PRTs and notable items by approximately 200 basis points versus our 2015 baseline of 14.3%.","In dollar terms, this means $1.05 billion of gross savings to get to $800 million net. The $250 million difference is a stranded overhead from the Brighthouse Financial separation. As you can see in our quarterly financial supplement, our direct expense ratio in the second quarter was 13.0%.","For the full-year 2018, we think the ratio will be slightly higher as expenses tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year. This was true in 2017 as well. Importantly, we remain highly confident that we will achieve a 200-basis point reduction by 2020.","As part of our ongoing process, MetLife has been engaged in an intensive effort to sharpen our focus on efficiency. Our goal is to build a margin safety above our $1.05 billion gross savings target to ensure that we succeed even if certain initiatives fall short.","To become more efficient, we are aggressively managing our spending in vendors and consultants, building out our digital, distribution, and service channels and automating processes. We have gone through every expense initiative line by line and provided detailed support for the saves. This rigorous exercise is what gives us confidence that we will reach our goal.","Just as important as reducing expenses is growing revenues. While the spinoff of Brighthouse Financial was a tremendous achievement, it should not create an impression that MetLife is more focused on exiting businesses than entering them. I am a strong supporter of growth that exceeds our cost of capital and provides a fair return to our shareholders, such as our Logan Circle Partners acquisition, our $2 billion purchase of Provida in Chile, and our $6 billion FedEx pension risk transfer deal. Our purpose at MetLife is to provide financial protection in people and their families. When we grow responsibly, our customers receive the help they need, our employees enjoy better career opportunities and our shareholders earn better returns.","Moving to capital management, we repurchased $1.1 billion of our common shares during the second quarter, completing our $2 billion buyback authorization. Also in the quarter, our board of directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program. Combined with our common dividend, total capital returned to the shareholders in the quarter came to more than $1.5 billion.","We continued buying back shares in third quarter, repurchasing another $236 million of common stock, leaving $870 million remaining on our current $1.5 billion authorization, which we anticipate completing by year end. MetLife's business is predicated on keeping the promises we make to policyholders. We view our commitments to our shareholders no differently.","On our last call, I spoke about how our clean first quarter represented a down payment on the improved performance expected of MetLife. We are pleased to make a subsequent payment in the second quarter. In addition to being a less complex company, we have made several significant financial commitments to our shareholders.","These include boosting our return on equity to 800 basis points to 900 basis points above the 10-year treasury yield and eventually to 1,000 basis points on a sustainable basis, generating a free cash flow ratio of 65% to 75% on average over a two-year period, achieving pre-tax net savings of $800 million by 2020, and returning roughly $5 billion of capital to shareholders in 2018. We are highly focused on meeting or exceeding these commitments. At the year's midpoint, we are well on our way to doing so, which we believe will lead to greater shareholder value over time.","With that, I will turn the call over to John McCallion to discuss our quarterly financial results in detail.","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I'll begin by discussing the 2Q 2018 supplemental slides that we released last evening along with our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. These slides cover our second quarter 2018 financial results and business highlights.","Starting on page 4. The schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the second quarter. Net income was $845 million, which included $159 million mark-to-market loss related to the disposition of our remaining investment in Brighthouse Financial.","In addition, costs associated with the debt exchange were $53 million after tax. Excluding these items, net income was $1.1 billion in the quarter or $269 million lower than adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion, primarily due to the results in our investment portfolio and hedging program.","Overall, the relatively modest net investment and net derivative losses in the quarter reflect MetLife's post-separation product mix and refined hedging program, as well as the continued benign credit environment.","Now, let's turn to page 5. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $42.76 as of June 30, down 1% versus $43.36 as of March 31. The decline was primarily due to a change in FCTA in the second quarter as the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against all major currencies.","As of June 30, FCTA was a negative $4.7 billion, which reflects a decline of nearly $1 billion or $0.96 per share from March 31. While the change this quarter was significant, it largely reverses the FCTA gain that we had in the first quarter of 2018 when the dollar had weakened. As we have seen in our results, the FCTA senses the movements in currencies and can fluctuate from quarter to quarter.","We only have one notable item in the quarter as shown on page six and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. Expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings by $62 million after tax or $0.06 per share. Adjusted earnings excluding notable items were $1.4 billion or $1.36 per share.","On page 7, you can see the year-over-year adjusted earnings excluding notable items by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 18% year-over-year and 17% on a constant currency basis.","On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 25% on both a reported and constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases.","Overall, positive year-over-year drivers in the quarter included favorable underwriting, solid volume growth, and lower taxes primarily due to U.S. tax reform. These were partially offset by weaker investment margins due to lower variable investment income.","Pre-tax variable investment income was $176 million, down $46 million versus the prior year quarter of $222 million due to lower private equity and hedge fund returns. Despite the weakness this quarter, year-to-date VII results are in line with our expectations and we are maintaining our outlook call range of $200 million to $250 million per quarter for the remainder of the year.","With regards to business performance, Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 29% year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting margins, volume growth, and the impact of U.S. tax reform.","Underwriting results were particularly strong in non-medical health. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for non-medical health was 73.1%, favorable to the prior-year quarter of 76.9% and below the low end of its target range of 75% to 80%. Non-medical health's favorable underwriting expense was primarily driven by disability, which had a higher net closure rate and lower incidence than the prior-year quarter.","The Group Life mortality ratio was 87.9%, which was within one standard deviation of the prior-year quarter of 87.3% and within its target range of 85% to 90%. Group Benefits continues to see strong momentum in its top line. Adjusted PFOs were up 4% year-over-year with growth across all markets and most product lines.","Year-to-date, 2018 sales were down 4% relative to first half of 2017, which had record jumbo case sales. Group Benefits continued its strategy to grow voluntary products, which were up double digit for the first half of 2018 versus the prior-year period.","In addition, we are also continuing to grow downmarket as regional and small market sales were above our target year-to-date. Adjusted earnings in Retirement and Income Solutions or RIS were up 32%. The key drivers were favorable interest and underwriting margins, volume growth, and lower taxes due to U.S. tax reform. This is partially offset by lower VII.","While the flatter yield curve has put some pressure on RIS adjusted earnings, this was more than offset by higher general account balances from continued growth in nearly all businesses, most notably in pension risk transfer. Growth is highlighted by the $6 billion FedEx deal that we closed in May. In addition, we have been able to maintain investment spreads, which were 129 basis points in 2Q and within our outlook call range of 110 basis points to 135 basis points.","Earnings from certain near expiring interest rate caps were a key contributor to spreads in the quarter, offsetting weakness in variable investment income. Excluding VII, RIS spreads were 113 basis points, which is up both year-over-year and sequentially.","RIS adjusted PFOs were $6.5 billion, up from $1.2 billion in the prior-year quarter due to the FedEx deal. Excluding FedEx and all other PRT deals in both quarters, adjusted PFOs were up 26% year-over-year, primarily due to strong sales of structured settlements and income annuities. On PRT, we continue to see a good pipeline of all sizes and structures. Our approach will continue to balance growth with an efficient use of capital.","Property & Casualty or P&C adjusted earnings more than doubled year-over-year, driven by favorable underwriting margins in both auto and home, as well as lower catastrophes. The auto combined ratio was 91.2%, down 5.3 points versus the second quarter of 2017 due to increased average premiums and expense management. Pre-tax catastrophe losses were $108 million in the quarter, but $19 million lower than the prior-year quarter. This improvement was due to lower cat activity, as well as management actions that we have taken over the last 12 months.","In regards to the top line, P&C adjusted PFOs were up 1%, while sales were up 23% versus 2Q 2017. We continue to see strong sales momentum in 2Q 2018, particularly through our Group channel.","Asia adjusted earnings excluding notable items were up 22% and up 20% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were volume growth, investment margin and lower taxes. This is partially offset by higher expenses. Asia adjusted earnings were aided by several one-time items in the quarter of approximately $20 million.","Asia sales were up 26% on a constant currency basis and Japan sales were up 42% driven by strong foreign currency denominated annuities as well as accident & health sales. FX in A&H products remain our primary focus in Japan as the shift away from yen life (21:09) products over the past three years is now complete.","We believe that we have a competitive advantage selling these products and continue to see solid momentum for the remainder of the year. Other Asia sales were up 3%, primarily driven by China.","Latin America adjusted earnings were down 6% and down 3% on a constant currency basis. Higher taxes in the region and the impact from U.S. tax reform offset solid volume growth. On a pre-tax basis, Latin America adjusted earnings were up 6% on a reported basis and up 9% on a constant currency basis.","Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 5% and up 7% on a constant currency basis due to volume growth across the region. Latin America sales were up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by higher direct marketing sales throughout the region.","EMEA adjusted earnings were up 19% and up 15% on a constant currency basis due to expense margin improvement, as well as volume growth in Turkey and Western Europe. This was partially offset by the impact of U.S. tax reform. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 8% and up 5% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth in Western Europe and Turkey.","MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings excluding notable items were up 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by the benefit from U.S. tax reform and favorable expense margins. This was mostly offset by less favorable life underwriting and investment margins.","In regards to underwriting, life claims were up relative to a very strong 2Q 2017, but the interest adjusted benefit ratio this quarter was at the midpoint of our target range of 50% to 55%. Our LTC results remain consistent with expectations, generating positive earnings and we continue to execute on our rate action plan. Corporate & Other adjusted loss excluding notable items was $157 million compared to an adjusted loss of $114 million in 2Q 2017. Primary driver of the year-over-year variance was the impact from U.S. tax reform.","Overall, the company's effective tax rate in the quarter was 15.4% due to a one-time reduction in the tax accrual of $36 million following a transfer of assets from a foreign subsidiary to its U.S. parent. Excluding this item and other one-time tax items in the quarter, the company's effective tax rate was 18.2%, which is within our prior guidance of 18% to 20%.","Turning to page eight, this slide shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2017 as well as the first two quarters of 2018. As Steve noted, we need to bring down our direct expense ratio by approximately 200 basis points from the 14.3% in 2015, which was the baseline year to realize $800 million of pre-tax profit margin improvement. As we noted last quarter, we believe the direct expense ratio on an annual basis is the best measure of our unit cost initiative progress as the ratio can fluctuate from quarter to quarter.","This ratio captures the relationships of revenues and the expenses over which we have the most control. We believe this best reflects the impact on profit margins. For this quarter, the direct expense ratio was 13%, excluding notable items and pension risk transfers. This is essentially in line with the first quarter of 2018 and below the full-year 2017 ratio of 13.3%. We continue to make good progress despite absorbing over 40 basis points of one-time expenses related to the remediation of our material weaknesses as well as the growth in our investment management business, which has a higher expense ratio.","Looking ahead to the back half of the year, we would expect our direct expense ratio to be modestly higher than the first half. This is a function of the strong growth we have enjoyed in our National Accounts business where we will incur enrollment and other costs prior to receiving associated premiums. For the full-year 2018, it's our objective to show improvement in the direct expense ratio compared to 2017.","Now, I will provide an update on our progress for remediation of the 4Q 2017 material weaknesses. First, let me discuss the RIS Group annuity reserves. We have now completed the root cause analysis. The findings from that analysis are being addressed by the ongoing remediation activities. This analysis further supports that the current remediation plan continues to be appropriate. Regarding the MetLife Holdings assumed variable annuity guarantee reserves, we have also completed the root cause analysis and incorporated financing to remediation plan. This also confirmed that the current plan continues to be appropriate. We believe the steps we are taking will further strengthen our internal control over financial reporting. While an observation period is required, we continue to work towards clearing the material weaknesses during 2018.","I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.4 billion at June 30, which is up from $5.1 billion at March 31. The $300 million increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend, holding company expenses, preferred stock issuance and liability management.","During the quarter, we issued approximately $800 million of preferred stock, bringing our total preferred stock issuance for the year to approximately $1.3 billion.","To divest our remaining Brighthouse Financial equity stake, we exchanged BHF stock for MetLife debt, which was a non-cash liability management exercise. The objective of this action is to continue optimize the capital structure in line with the rating agency expectations as well as provide further financial flexibility.","Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, preliminary year-to-date second quarter statutory earnings were approximately $2.7 billion and net earnings were approximately $2.2 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $792 million from the prior-year period, primarily due to dividends received from a foreign investment subsidiary, which had a corresponding offset in statutory adjusted capital.","We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18.2 billion as of June 30, 2018, down 1% compared to December 31, 2017. Net earnings were more than offset by dividends paid to the holding company.","Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 884% as of March 31, which is the latest public data. Overall, MetLife had a very strong second quarter in 2018 highlighted by favorable underwriting and solid volume growth. In addition, our cash and capital position remain strong and we remain confident that the actions we are taking to implement our strategy will drive free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value to our shareholders.","And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question is from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. John, you mentioned that in retirement there was some benefit from interest rate caps that were near expiration. Can you help us quantify that amount as well as think about when those will actually run off?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Hey, Ryan. So, let me just back up. On the outlook call, we indicated that a 10-basis point move would have a $5 million to $10 million impact on earnings. So, since that time, two things have happened. So, first, the three-month LIBOR has risen probably 60 basis points or 70 basis points above our expectations. It's actually up like 90 basis points year-to-date. And so, we did have some out-of-the-money caps that are now in the money. So, that's one.","The second thing I would also emphasize is there were certain management actions that we took on the liability side to reduce the exposure to our \u2013 to kind of the floating rate liabilities. So, that also had a modest improvement relative to the guidance. So, as a result, I'd say it's temporarily neutralized at this level of rates. I say temporarily because, as you point out, these caps will gradually roll off to the latter half of this year and into 2019. So, ex these actions and the caps, we think the sensitivity holds, but LIBOR has obviously increased outside of our expectations.","So, right now through the rest of this year, I would say at these levels we are less sensitive than previously disclosed. And I think what we'll do is we'll try to give you a more holistic update on the next outlook call.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. That's helpful. And then, just one on long-term care. I know that you've said your statutory reserves do not assume any benefit from future premium rate increases. Can you disclose if you assume morbidity improvement currently?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Sure. So, let me just start with a high level \u2013 a few high-level comments. So, first, yeah, we will be \u2013 we're starting our annual assumption view now. That takes place in the third quarter. So, as we speak, it's underway. And we'll obviously share the results when we get there.","I think until then, let me give you some additional color and maybe some guardrails. So, reminders, we have roughly $14.5 billion of statutory reserves. In there, we do not assume any rate increases and we do not assume morbidity improvement. So, that's on the statutory side.","For GAAP, we do assume some planned rate increases, but it's really over a short period of time and it's based on our experience to-date. As a reminder, we had roughly 7% rate increase off of 2017. On the premium that we got the rate increase, it was roughly 20% increases on \u2013 it was about $250 million of the $750 million of premium we had. So, I think from a GAAP perspective, we would track similar way. We're tracking that way in 2018 to similar levels.","Regarding morbidity for GAAP. We do include some assumptions for morbidity improvement. It's on roughly 20% of our long-term care block. So, if we were to eliminate that assumption, we would not incur an LTC charge. It would get absorbed by our loss recognition testing margin and we'd probably still have some left pretty significantly after that. So, hopefully, that gives you a little color.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks, John. That's really helpful.","Operator","Next, we go to line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. Thank you. I was just hoping you could comment a bit more on the pension risk transfer pipeline and the competitive environment, particularly for larger deals.","Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Erik. This is Michel. So, we continue to find the market opportunity attractive with a good pipeline. Last year was a record year for us from a PRT standpoint. This year, obviously, with the FedEx deal, we'll exceed that. So, we \u2013 I think we continue to be active. We continue to see opportunity on the market.","Our approach is consistent in terms of balancing growth with the efficient use of capital, also considering alternative uses of capital. So, we'll remain disciplined and consider the risk and pricing parameters for each deal, but we do think that the market opportunity continues to be attractive.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Got it. And maybe as a followup. Just given Steve's somewhat comment \u2013 or cautious comments on credit, do you have any concerns about taking on the asset leverage or just the investment funding needs associated with large PRT blocks?","Steven Jeffrey Goulart - MetLife, Inc.","Hi. It's Steve Goulart. The best answer is no. I mean, I think just go back to Steve's comments. I don't think we're sounding any alarm bells. But we're basically saying, hey, our job's getting tougher in this environment. But remember, we're investing billions of dollars a quarter and we're still finding sound, attractive investment alternatives.","It's just that market conditions remain tight. Market structure is different than it was years ago. So, we're spending more time just thinking about what happens in the next downturn and how do we position ourselves when we think it's coming. But we're still finding plenty of attractive investments. We are cautious, as Steve mentioned, on certain sectors. But I think our motto, I quote, one of my favorite investors who says, we're still in an environment of move forward with caution.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Good morning. Just a few on long-term care. Just given all the peer charges occurring around you, any reason to do a deeper dive for your 3Q review this year including third-party involvement?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Tom, it's John. I would say, we are normal course. We annually test our assumption rigorously, so we have in the past. We continue to do so and we will in the third quarter. I don't see anything changing in how we do things. So...","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","And my followup is, if you look at Met's development over the last few years compared to others, Met's have looked a lot better. You really have not seen the same level of adverse development that I would say the vast majority of peers are showing right now. Is it \u2013 and can you comment at all \u2013 I'm sure you guys have looked into this as well. So, can you comment at all about what you think is actually happening that is preventing Met from seeing the same deterioration that has now become pretty broad based?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah. I think I will just go back to maybe the risk profile that we articulated, I mean, over the last few quarters, right? So, I think part of it is when we exited, we exited in 2010. I think we have a \u2013 if you think about our block, it's pretty high percentage. Almost 40% of that block is in the Group space, which is generally the lower ages, smaller policies, less generous provisions than the individual. We've been doing a lot on getting premiums in. We've taken rate actions. We started early. I think that's a big component of that.","We have $750 million of premium coming in and we'd be getting rate increases and we're halfway through the actuarial justified rate increases. So, I think it's a combination of risk profile coupled with, I'd say, management actions that have occurred.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Next, we go to line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, thanks a lot. So, just kind of looking at slide 8, the direct expense ratio, and you want to get it from 14.3% in 2015, down by 200 basis points into 2020. Last two years, it was 13.3%. Now, it's kind of 13% and you're saying it's going to kind of come up a bit as we go to the second half of the year. So \u2013 and it was good that you pointed out the 40 bps of material weakness. So, does that come off next year once you kind of resolve the material weakness? And maybe you could give us a little color on the trajectory of this direct expense ratio over the next two years as it seems to have kind of leveled out over the last three years.","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, sure, Andrew. So, couple things I would just note to help with the trajectory comment. Don't forget, if you went backwards, we have the strand came in. So, that kind of offset some of the saves that we would have otherwise seen. So, I think the trend will look better if we normalize for the strand. That's one.","Two, just to edit one thing you said, the 40 basis points is combination of two things. It's the extra cost we have for remediating the material weaknesses coupled with our growth in the investment management business, which is high-returning business but has a higher expense ratio. So, we are \u2013 but that doesn't change our commitment. We're still committed to getting 200 basis points. I think I will go back to Steve's comments to assure you that we feel very comfortable about achieving that by 2020. This is a bigger exercise than just a cost exercise. This is a transformational exercise. We are investing for not \u2013 for this just to be completed by 2020, but investing so this is an ongoing platform that we can leverage for growth.","And so I think some of it will kind of start to trend in into 2019 and 2020 at a better clip. But a lot of this right now we're doing a lot of the investment now that will translate into the saves in the future.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. And then just to follow up on Asia. PFO were kind of \u2013 they were up about 1% year-over-year. Do you see that materially going up over time? Or are things a bit slower in Japan where it might be a bit mature?","Steven Jeffrey Goulart - MetLife, Inc.","Well, I think if we go back to our outlook call, Andrew, I think we're still in line with our expectations there and very comfortable with that. Japan actually continue to be very strong. We talked about that. And we're also seeing strong growth in other markets.","Remember, it's a portfolio of 10 different countries. They're not all going to perform the exact same at any point in time. But basically, that strong sales growth in certain other markets slower growth given some of the environment, including some regulatory changes in different markets. But all in all, I think we're still expecting \u2013 what we've seen is building momentum in the second quarter and we're very comfortable with what we've said for outlook call expectations.","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","I would just add, Andrew, just also if you think to the mix of business there a little bit. So, we're shifting quite a bit to the foreign currency denominated to FAS 97-type product. So, it's fee oriented as opposed to premium. So, we're seeing great growth there I think as Steve talked about. But you may not see it just in the premium line, but we're seeing it through margin.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. So, for guidance, low-single-digit PFO growth makes sense. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And next, we will go to line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jimmy S. Bhullar - JPMorgan","Hi. Good morning. First just on \u2013 I thought overall your international results were pretty good, but there were a few areas of weakness just specifically sales in ex-Japan Asia, Mexico sales, and then EMEA sales overall seemed weak as well. So, could you just give us some color on what drove that and what your outlook is?","Steven Jeffrey Goulart - MetLife, Inc.","Hi, Jimmy, it's Steve Goulart again. Just sort of picking upon what I just commented on really, again, there were markets outside Japan where we did see slower sales growth. But when I think about why that happened, I mentioned we saw regulatory changes in certain markets. We've been really sort of rebounding from those changes and I do see building momentum. So, I think we're comfortable with the full-year outlook in really all of Asia and ex-Japan as well.","Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.","And for EMEA, this is Michel, Jimmy. A couple of comments. One is keep in mind that our sales figure is influenced by the exit from the UK Wealth Management business last year. If you adjust for that, our sales are up 1%. That's still below the level that we'd expect for EMEA.","The main driver for that is the increasingly competitive pricing environment in the Gulf on the Group Medical business in particular. The margins are (42:12) on this business and we're holding firm on pricing and that's having an impact on our sales.","Jimmy S. Bhullar - JPMorgan","Okay. And then, Mexico, I guess, there was the sale there as well, so...","Oscar Schmidt - MetLife, Inc.","Hey, Jimmy, this is Oscar. Good morning. So, let me talk about sales first. So, sales year-over-year grew 6%, but if you adjust for the divestiture of our Afore business in Mexico, that's like three percentage points, goes to nine percentage points. So, well aligned with our high-single-digit expectation from outlook call. If you go to premiums and fees, which is at 7% year-over-year, you do the same, if you adjust for the Afore divestiture, it goes to 8%, which is again aligned with our high-single-digit expectation.","Jimmy S. Bhullar - JPMorgan","Okay. And then if I could ask another question on long-term care. You were pretty active at buybacks this quarter. Your review's coming up. How concerned are you or what's the likelihood of it being stat charge as well if you take the charge? And do you think under reasonable scenarios it could have an impact on your free cash flow or capital deployment strategy for this year and next?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, Jimmy in terms of stat reserves, we are comfortable at the present time. We're going through the assumption review as I said in the third quarter. But right now, there's no reason to believe or there's any concerns for changing our capital management plans.","Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","As I said in my remarks, we anticipate extinguishing the $1.5 billion authorization for share repurchases by the end of the year, so that's on track.","Jimmy S. Bhullar - JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we have a question from John Nadel with UBS. Please go ahead.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. So, this may be a little bit complicated to do on a consolidated basis, but it looks like investment income was up pretty significantly versus the level we've seen maybe the average of the last five quarters, 4% or maybe a little over 4% higher. And that really doesn't look like there was much of a corresponding offset anywhere in the interest credit line or otherwise. And I guess it's really evident in RIS, maybe a little bit in international, especially Asia. Just trying to understand the sustainability of this higher level of investment income. Are we already seeing the benefits of higher new money rates? And is this something \u2013 is this the new level we ought to think about from here?","Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","John, it's Steve. Again, let me \u2013 I'll start with just sort of investment performance and then let John talk more about it from a margin perspective. But put in the context of what's happening in the environment. Rates have, I guess, you could say steadily if you use the point-in-time. But rates continue to rise in general over time. We continue to see our new money yield rising along with it. I don't get hung up on quarter-to-quarter. We're really looking at trends.","But we do see the overall performance and yield in the portfolio rising. Is it sustainable? I think it depends a lot on the overall market, what happens with underlying rate levels and, of course, what happens with spreads. And then, I think I'll let John comment more about overall investment margin.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","But, Steve, if I can...","Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","...just follow up real quick. Was the new money rate \u2013 I know it's a global sort of approach, but was the global new money rate in the last couple of quarters above the portfolio yield?","Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","No. No, we haven't had our new money rate above the portfolio yield in years.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","But we're getting closer.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, I would just add, John, that I think it's probably always relative to expectations here, right? I mean \u2013 so, we did. We are starting \u2013 seeing a benefit from the rate environment and we've seen some benefits for some of the things I talked about earlier in RIS. We saw some initiatives in Asia that have helped us. So, I think it depends a little bit where you're referencing, but those are probably the two largest businesses seeing the benefit of some investment margin.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just real quick. I think you had mentioned one-time impact on the tax rate and I forget what the other one was. I think there was something in Asia. Could you just remind us of those real quick?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah. It's for taxes you're referencing?","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. I think you mentioned something on the tax rate. The underlying tax rate was a little over 18%.","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yes. So, it's 15.4%, but there's a one-time charge \u2013 or, sorry, benefit coming through in Corporate & Other relates to this one-time transfer that we had of some assets from a foreign subsidiary to U.S. parent really our effort to simplify some structure and it's just a release of an accrual that we had up in GAAP.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And in Asia, I think you mentioned 20 year a little over $20 million?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Those are \u2013 what we said there was really just some one-time items. It wasn't tax related. Half of it is \u2013 actually, it just \u2013 that region got allocated a higher level of VII this quarter. The other half, I would kind of put into campus and reserve refinements.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Got you. Okay, thanks.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just the first one on long-term care. Could you provide any clarity just on the mortality improvement that's assumed on statutory and GAAP?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, I don't think we're going to go through that right now. Just I think we're going to \u2013 obviously, we're going through our annual assumption review and that's not something we would disclose at this time.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then maybe just a followup. Just thinking about Holdings more broadly. It seems like the supply of reinsurance capital is pretty robust. Any updated thoughts on the potential for doing a risk reduction transaction or risk transfer transaction whether it be long-term care, annuity blocks, et cetera?","Martin J. Lippert - MetLife, Inc.","Alex, this Marty Lippert. We continue to look for economic deals that can help drive positive returns. And when we come across one that looks strong enough to us, we'll pursue it.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And would you guys expect a cash flow coming out of MetLife Holdings to remain the same, I guess, as you've kind of stated previously? Can you just remind us about what that cash flow would be relative to earnings and what you expect there?","Martin J. Lippert - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah. I would just say it's consistent with the guidance we've given. We see this \u2013 there's a little bit of a unique situation going in 2018 because of the change in taxes. But going forward, it's about a 5% runoff.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And would cash flow be greater than 100% potentially?","Martin J. Lippert - MetLife, Inc.","I don't know about greater. I'd say around 100%.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning, and thank you. Two questions on the Property Casualty (sic) [Property & Casualty] (50:13) segment. If you could just discuss pricing trends in personal auto. And then I think you referenced some management actions you've taken to lower catastrophes this year. If you could just give us a little bit of color on that and if possible how much it might have reduced your catastrophe load 2018 versus 2017?","Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Larry. This is Michel. So, on auto, I think we've seen loss trends that are more favorable generally speaking in recent quarters especially compared to 2015 and 2016. We think this is due to a number of factors, mainly the miles driven, which seemed to have flattened after several years of increase. I think this is reflected in the industry. If you look at rate taking, I think it slowed down. We had taken aggressive action from late 2016 onwards above industry level rate action. I think that's reflected in some of the improvement that you see in our auto loss ratios.","We think that going forward our rate action would be more in line with industry. And on the cat front, again we had taken a number of management actions mostly focused on reducing and lessening our exposure to areas where historically we had seen significant cat activity. And I think we see the benefit of that. If we compare our second quarter cats for this year compared to last year on a pre-tax basis, they were better by $19 million. So, I think that's reflective of some of the action that we've taken.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Is there a specific geography in terms of the actions on the cat side?","Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.","There are certain geographies where we were experiencing a high level of cat losses. Dallas-Fort Worth, for example, Colorado. So, we've taken action to \u2013 but not limited to those states, but we've certainly taken action to lessen exposure in those areas.","Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Next, we go to line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My question was answered. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we go to line of John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thank you. I know you guys have been focused on growing your investment management, asset management business. Could you talk about what percent, if any, of your assets under management are exposed to index funds?","Steven Jeffrey Goulart - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah. We do have a fairly large block of index funds, but they're all related to MetLife separate accounts. It is less than a quarter of our overall third-party assets if you want to include it in that and it's really not material from a revenue generation perspective.","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thank you. And then you talked about wanting to grow, not divest. What areas are you looking to grow through M&A other than asset management obviously? Thank you.","Steven Albert Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","Hey, it's Steve Kandarian. We look at opportunities in the marketplace that fit our strategy. And obviously, the areas we are in now in the United States are largely the Group area and the Retirement area. And of course, outside of the United States, we have a significant position in Latin America, Asia and Middle East. So, those been the logical places for us to be looking for opportunities. But as we've always said, we compare any acquisition opportunity against the share repurchase and doesn't mean we wouldn't do an acquisition or that has to be accretive day one, but it has to be accretive quickly for us to pursue something.","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thanks for the answer.","Operator","There are no other questions. You may continue.","John A. Hall - MetLife, Inc.","Okay. Great.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. Before we get started, I refer you to the cautionary note on the forward-looking statements in yesterday's earnings release. ","With that, I will turn the call over to John Hall, Head of Investor Relations.","John Hall","Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Before starting, I refer you to the information on non-GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portions of metlife.com and our earnings release and in our quarterly financial supplements, which you should review. ","Joining me this morning on the call are Michel Khalaf, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management. ","Last night, we released an expanded set of supplemental slides. They are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to those supplemental slides in his prepared remarks if you wish to follow along. The content for the slides begins following the romanette pages that feature a number of GAAP reconciliations. ","After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that, given the busy earnings call scheduled this morning, will extend no longer than the top of the hour. [Operator Instructions]. Finally, before we get started, I would ask that you save a date December 12 for us. We will host an Investor Day on that date here in New York City. More information on the agenda, which will include our outlook for 2020 and beyond, will follow. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Michel.","Michel Khalaf","Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. It's an honor to join you today as the 17th President and CEO of MetLife and the company's 151 year history. Before I talk about our first quarter results, I want to thank Steve Kandarian for everything he did over the past 8 years to help us build a better company. Steve tackled big challenges and made bold decisions. His actions strengthened our balance sheet, improved our free cash flow and gave us a solid platform for profitable growth. I'm grateful for his leadership and look forward to building on that foundation as we move toward the next horizon of our strategy. ","This company has a proud history of making and keeping promises. Through our work, we provide financial security for tens of millions of people and invest to support economic growth. It's a noble purpose, one that our employees carry out every day. Thanks to their efforts and dedication, MetLife is a trusted partner to individuals and institutions all around the world. Looking ahead, our task is clear: deliver great value for our customers, our shareholders and our people. That requires consistent execution across the board. Coming off a strong 2018, MetLife reported excellent first quarter results last night. Quarterly adjusted earnings totaled $1.4 billion or $1.48 per share, up from $1.36 per share a year ago. ","While variable investment income was lower as expected, adjusted earnings per share benefited from solid volume growth across all ongoing businesses, strong life and Non-Medical Health underwriting margins and Group Benefits, continued expense discipline and the cumulative impact of capital management. Reflecting the strong results, our quarterly adjusted return on equity was 13.2%. As for notable items, adjusted earnings were $1.54 per share. Notable items in the quarter included $0.06 per share of costs associated with our unit cost initiative, which remains on track to achieve $800 million of annual pretax margin improvement by 2020.","Net income was $1.3 billion or $1.40 per share, up from $1.19 per share a year ago. Our efforts to manage the sensitivity of net income through the capital markets and narrow the gap between net income and adjusted earnings continue to show progress. Moving to some business highlights. Within the U.S. business segment, Group Benefits reported very strong underwriting results for both life and Non-Medical Health coverages, reversing less favorable trends in the fourth quarter of 2018. Group Benefits also posted record sales driven by voluntary products, which we continue to see as a growth opportunity. ","In our Retirement and Income Solutions business, while we experienced good asset growth, adjusted earnings were adversely affected by lower variable investment income and investment spreads. Within Property & Casualty, good homeowners underwriting and modest catastrophe losses contributed to solid adjusted earnings. ","For our international segments, Asia benefited from volume growth and strong foreign currency product and A&H sales in Japan. Our Latin America results included a strong contribution from there in Kihei. And our EMEA business benefited from good underwriting and volume growth. These results provide further confirmation that MetLife strategy is working and that we're hitting our stride on delivering consistent execution. The strength of our last five quarters combined tells the same story. MetLife is a long-term business, and taking the long view is the best way to evaluate our performance. We are encouraged by our first quarter results, but we are even more encouraged by the last five quarters put together. ","My job as President and CEO is to continuingly ensure that we have the right strategy in place and the right people to make that strategy a success. I have made significant progress in establishing my senior leadership team following the recent appointments of, among others, Ramy Tadros as President of our U.S. business; and Marlene Debel as our Chief Risk Officer. I feel confident in the team we are assembling and excited about MetLife's future. On strategy, I believe we are on the right path while recognizing there is always room for improvement. As I mentioned on our fourth quarter earnings call, we are at an inflection point and I'm committed to MetLife's core goals of capital efficiency, strong risk-adjusted returns and profitable growth. While we have accomplished much in these areas, we still have work to do to accelerate revenue growth, further optimize our business and product portfolios and approach expense discipline as a journey of continuous improvement rather than a single destination. ","These goals informed our recent decision to move MetLife Holdings, which contains the closed block businesses of our former U.S. Retail segment, to our finance organization. This new arrangement will sharpen our focus on serving our customers and creating value for our shareholders. I believe the only way to achieve sustainable success is by staying laser-focused on our customers' needs and expectations. That is the bedrock on which MetLife has built a number of great businesses. Here in the U.S., annual adjusted earnings from our market share-leading U.S. group business have grown to more than $1 billion. Our average national accounts group customer has been with us for 22 years, and several customers are approaching the century mark. Overall, the business covers more than 40 million U.S. employees and their dependents. ","In Mexico, we are the #1 life insurer with a dominant business that serves millions of public sector workers and has made MetLife part of the fabric of Mexican society. In Japan, our largest business outside the U.S. and our largest retail life insurance business anywhere in the world, we pioneered foreign exchange products that have allowed us to grow in a mature market by meeting customers' needs for better returns on their savings. ","In China, one of the world's largest and most rapidly growing insurance markets, MetLife has grown rapidly as well. The Chinese municipalities and provinces where we operate are home to more than 0.5 billion people and account for 55% of GDP, positioning us well to serve the needs of China's growing middle-class. Businesses like these highlight MetLife's underlying strength and potential, but again, it all starts with how we serve our customers. I've been running insurance businesses since the early 1990s, and one of my core convictions is that only by creating value for customers can we create value for shareholders. ","Over the past few months, I've traveled to many of MetLife's key markets outside the U.S., including all the countries I just mentioned. Our people around the world take great pride in being there for MetLife's customers when they need us the most. I approach MetLife's challenges informed by certain guiding principles developed over a 25-year career, leading insurance businesses on 4 continents around the world. My leadership style is close to the ground and focused on winning. I believe speed, agility and innovation are critical to strengthening our competitive advantage. MetLife has reinvented itself multiple times over its 151-year history, and we will look to accelerate innovation as a driver of growth. ","I recognize that capital is precious and that our shareholders have choices about where to invest. MetLife's decisions on capital deployment will continue to be driven by what produces the best risk-adjusted returns. Everything we do, organic growth, capital return and acquisitions, will be viewed through the lens of value creation. To that end, we recently announced a 4.8% increase in our quarterly dividend while returning more than $900 million of capital to shareholders in the first quarter through common dividends and share repurchases. On my second official day leading MetLife, I want you to know that I'm starting this job with a real sense of urgency. The entire leadership team has a strong commitment to accelerating the pace of value creation for all of our stakeholders.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John McCallion to go through our first quarter results in greater detail.","John McCallion","Thank you, Michel, and good morning. I'll begin by discussing the 1Q '19 supplemental slides that we released last evening along with our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. Starting on Page 4. This schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the first quarter of 2019. In the quarter, net income was $1.3 billion or $75 million lower than adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. While this will change from quarter-to-quarter, the modest variance between net income and adjusted earnings reflects the progress we made to reduce the volatility of our business. Overall, the results in the investment portfolio and hedging program continue to perform as expected. ","We had one notable item in the quarter, as shown on Page 5 and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. Expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings by $55 million after-tax or $0.06 per share. Adjusted earnings excluding the notable item were $1.5 billion or $1.54 per share. On Page 6, you can see the year-over-year adjusted earnings excluding notable items by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 6% year-over-year and 8% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 15% and 18% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Overall, positive year-over-year drivers included solid volume growth, favorable underwriting, better expense margins and the impact from strong equity markets in the quarter. These were partially offset by lower recurring interest margins and less favorable variable investment income, which I will discuss in more details shortly. ","With regards to business performance, Group Benefits adjusted earnings were up 57% year-over-year. The key drivers were favorable underwriting, better expense margins and solid volume growth. With respect to underwriting, the Group Life mortality ratio was 85.3%, our best Q1 performance in over 15 years and at the low end of our annual target range of 85% to 90%. Favorable results were primarily due to low incidence and the mild flu season. ","The interest adjusted benefit ratio for Non-Medical Health was 72.9%, which was lower than the 75.9% in the prior year quarter and at the low end of our target range of 72% to 77%. The year-over-year improvement in the ratio was primarily driven by continued positive trends in disability while dental utilization trends were generally in line with expectations. Group Benefits continues to see strong momentum in its top line. Adjusted PFOs in the quarter were up 3,%, and 5% excluding participating customers, where PFOs can fluctuate with claim experience. Group Benefits sales in the quarter were a record up 11% versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to continued strength in voluntary products. Combination of our brand, product set, customer base and distribution reach positions us to leverage the ongoing shift of voluntary benefits in a differentiated way. ","National account sales and renewals were strong, and we continue to see double-digit growth in both regional and small market sales. While results for Group Benefits will show some quarter-to-quarter volatility, this combination of strong top and bottom line results is a testament to our compelling customer value proposition and disciplined approach to pricing. Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, adjusted earnings were down 16% year-on-year. The key drivers were less favorable investment margins partially offset by solid volume growth. RIS investment spreads were 96 basis points in 1Q '19, down 32 basis points year-over-year. The decline in the investment spreads were primarily due to ongoing pressure from the flatter yield curve as well as lower private equity returns in the quarter. ","For the full year, we expect RIS investment spreads to trend higher with full year coming in towards the bottom half of our 2019 guidance range of 100 to 125 basis points. RIS adjusted PFOs were up 64% year-over-year due to strong structured settlement sales. As for pension risk transfers, although we did not book any transactions in the quarter, we closed on a $500 million PRT deal in early April. We continue to see the PRT market as attractive with a strong pipeline. ","Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings were up 1% primarily due to favorable underwriting margins and volume growth. This was mostly offset by higher expenses primarily related to marketing costs. Pretax cat losses were $41 million in the quarter, which was $17 million lower than the prior year quarter. With regards to the top line, P&C adjusted PFOs were up 2% while sales were up 12% versus 1Q '18. Asia adjusted earnings were up 9% and 13% on a constant currency basis primarily due to strong volume growth in the region. The key drivers were higher accident and health sales and AUM growth in Japan as well as growth in Korea and China. This was partially offset by more favorable underwriting in the prior year quarter. Asia sales were up 9% on a constant currency basis. ","In Japan, sales were up 13% primarily driven by Accident & Health and foreign currency products. A&H and FX products remain our primary focus in Japan, and we continue to see strong momentum in the market. Other Asia sales were up 3%, primarily driven by growth in China and India. Latin America adjusted earnings were down 4% and 1% on a constant currency basis. The primary driver was higher expenses versus 1Q '18, which benefited from a litigation reserve release. This was mostly offset by the favorable impact from equity markets in our Chilean and Kihei as well as higher investment margins and volume growth across the region. Latin America adjusted PFOs were up 4% on a constant currency basis driven by volume growth across the region led by AFP Provida in Mexico. This was partially offset by the cancellation of government contracts in Mexico. Latin America sales were up 11% on a constant currency basis due to higher Mexico sales. ","EMEA adjusted earnings were up 6% and 23% on a constant currency basis primarily due to favorable underwriting and volume growth. EMEA adjusted PFOs were up 5% on a constant currency basis reflecting growth across the region. EMEA sales were up 3% on a constant currency basis due to higher volumes in employee benefits in the United Kingdom and Credit Life in Turkey. MetLife Holdings adjusted earnings excluding notable items in 1Q '18 were down 13% year-over-year. The primary drivers were lower investment margins primarily from weaker private equity returns and more favorable underwriting in the prior year quarter. This was partially offset by improved expense margins and favorable equity markets. ","In regards to equity market performance within MetLife Holdings, Retail Annuities separate account returns were up 10% in the quarter, which resulted in an initial positive market impact of approximately $15 million to adjusted earnings and an ongoing positive impact of approximately $5 million to adjusted earnings. These were roughly in line with our sensitivity guidance. Corporate & Other adjusted loss excluding notable items was $138 million. Overall, the company's effective tax rate on adjusted earnings in the quarter was 18.7% and within our 2019 guidance of 18% to 20%.","Now let's turn to Page 7 to discuss variable investment income in more detail. This chart reflects our pretax variable investment income for the past 9 quarters, including $174 million earned in the first quarter. ","You can see that variable investment income, as the name implies, can vary from quarter-to-quarter but tends to fall in proximity to our quarterly VII range of $200 million to $250 million. Our private equity portfolio, which is accounted for on a 1 quarter lag, was clearly impacted by equity market weakness in 4Q '18 although results were better than expected. We continue to expect full year VII to be within our 2019 guidance range of $800 million to $1 billion.","Now I will discuss recurring investment income. Our new money rate rose from 3.37% a year ago to 4.04% in 1Q '19. At the same time, our average roll-off rate has dropped from 4.38% a year ago to 4.15% in the first quarter. Although the gap between new money rates and roll-off rates has narrowed, we would not expect pairing to occur until we have a sustained U.S. 10-year Treasury yield of roughly 3% to 3.25%. In absolute dollars, recurring investment income was up 4% compared to a year ago, primarily due to higher asset balances, which offset the roll-off of higher-yielding securities. ","Turning to Page 8. This chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2018 as well as 1Q '19. As we have stated previously, our goal is to realize $800 million of pretax profit margin improvement by 2020. This would represent an approximate 200 basis point decline in our annual direct expense ratio from the 2015 baseline year. We believe the annual direct expense ratio best reflects the impact on profit margins as it captures the relationship of revenues and the expenses over which we have the most control. By successfully executing on our expense commitment, it will improve profit margins and provide additional capacity to fund future growth and innovation.","We continue to make consistent progress towards achieving our target by 2020. As the chart illustrates, we have already achieved 140 basis point improvement in the annual direct expense ratio from 2015 to 2018. For 1Q '19, the direct expense ratio was exceptionally strong at 12.1%. This was aided by favorable items including lower interest on tax reserves and lower employee benefits related to market movements in the first quarter. Overall, these favorable items totaled roughly 60 to 70 basis points. Therefore, we would expect our direct expense ratio to be higher for the remainder of the year but still show improvement versus 2018. ","I will now discuss our cash and capital position on Slide 9. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $3.2 billion at March 31, which is up from $3 billion at December 31. A $200 million increase in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend and holding company expenses. As we noted previously, we are comfortable holding cash at the low end of our $3 billion to $4 billion holding company's buffer given our low-risk profile and the modest amount of debt that we have maturing over the next few years including none in 2019. ","Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, our 2018 combined NAIC RBC ratio was 402%, which compares to our new target ratio of 360% following U.S. tax reform. For our U.S. company's, preliminary first quarter 2019 statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.2 billion, and net earnings were approximately $1.1 billion. ","Statutory operating earnings increased by approximately $600 million from the prior year quarter primarily due to improved underwriting results, lower operating expenses and lower VA writer reserves. These were partially offset by lower net investment margins. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $16.6 billion as of March 31, 2019, down 9% compared to December 31, 2018. Net earnings were more than offset by dividends declared to be paid to the holding company. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 803% as of December 31, which is the latest public data. ","Overall, MetLife had a very strong 2018, and execution continues in 2019 driven primarily by good fundamentals, solid underwriting, growth in our businesses and expense discipline. In addition, our cash and capital position, as well as our balance sheet, remains strong. ","Finally, we are confident that the actions we are taking will continue to drive free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value. ","And with that, I will turn back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW.","Ryan Krueger","Michel, could you discuss your M&A philosophy and if there's any areas of particular focus that you would look to add going forward?","Michel Khalaf","Sure. So we always look at M&A opportunities that fit our strategy and are accretive over time. We evaluate those opportunities on a consistent basis globally with a view on value and cash generation. These deals need to earn more than their cost of capital. ","We also evaluate M&A opportunities against alternative uses of capital. Obviously, we consider capital markets, the cost of raising capital and synergies in our assessment, and we will always look to achieve a healthy balance between returning cash to our shareholders and strategic M&A activity that can help us accelerate our growth. ","So hopefully, this gives you an idea about our philosophy on M&As. And again if you're looking at strategic fit, think about businesses and markets where we -- that are growth markets where we believe that potentially M&A can help us further drive our growths. Those would be the businesses and markets where we will consider such deals.","Ryan Krueger","And then just in regards to your comment on innovation, I guess things like that can come at, I guess, a near-term expense. So I just want to -- it sounds like you're pretty committed to the $800 million expense save target. But I just wanted to hear your thoughts and if there's any major areas of incremental investment that you think are required and if you can still achieve the $800 million in light of that.","Michel Khalaf","So I'm 100% committed to the $800 million pretax profit margin improvement by 2020 target, and we're fully on track to achieve that. I think we've done a good job over the last several years actually of repurposing some savings and reinvesting in technology and innovation, and we look to continue to do that. The other thing I will say here and I mentioned it in my remarks, is that we are making sure that expense discipline is a muscle, is part of our culture here. It's embedded in everything that we do, and we see this efficiency and expense discipline as a journey of continuous improvement as opposed to a single destination. So we are committed to our target and we believe that we'll have opportunities to continue to invest in innovation and in our growth.","Operator","And next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Andrew Kligerman","Michel, you made a comment that you want to accelerate the pace of value creation. And you also mentioned that you moved MetLife Holdings to the finance unit. Are there any implications there that you might be more inclined to divest of certain blocks of business in MLH, notably long-term care, but any blocks within that?","Michel Khalaf","So look, with Marty Lippert's retirement, we felt there was an opportunity to better align MetLife Holdings' reporting with our core objectives, and for me, there are 3 core objectives for the business. One is to deliver on our obligations to our policyholders. Two is to continue to reduce the risk and volatility of that business. And three is to optimize value. ","So we feel that having MetLife Holdings report to finance and to John will help us sharpen our focus on these objectives. And we've said before and I'll repeat that we will consider all options to optimize the value of the business, and we don't rule anything out. Any transaction that we believe makes sense economically is something that we would consider.","Andrew Kligerman","Great. And then just kind of shifting over to RIS, the investment yield came in at 4.52%, excluding variable investment income, and that sequentially was down from 4.8%, So I'm -- and I understand you had some extra cash on the balance sheet so that might have hurt it by 4 to 6 basis points. But it's a pretty big drop off, so I'm hoping that someone can give me a little guidance on where that yield is going. You also mentioned some roll-off of higher-yielding securities. So where do you see that going over the next few quarters in the RIS segment?","John McCallion","It's John. I would focus on the spread itself. And just for this quarter we -- there was a new accounting related to derivative hedging so there was a reclass between the yield and interest credited so that might just change the trend a little bit. But I think I would focus a bit on the spread itself. So let me talk about the spread. And obviously, we came in below the range we provided at the outlook call of 100 to 125, so a couple of things. ","First, the range and the sensitivities we provided, I would take those as full year ranges, and those can certainly deviate from any one quarter. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, while Q1 was below the range, we still believe and expect the full year to be within the range albeit maybe the lower half of that range. But there is two drivers to the Q1 underperformance. So first, we did have a slightly higher allocation to shorter-term assets during the quarter as we continue to look to shift out of certain assets that are more susceptible to a market downturn, and so we see this mostly as timing. And as rates declined that had about a 5 to 6 basis point impact. ","The second thing we saw was a good portion of our sec lending business does get allocated to the segment. And to the inversion of the short end of the curve relative to LIBOR has put pressure on our sec lending margins. And so if you think about where we were at the outlook call and where the treasury curve was there and LIBOR was at that time, the drop in the treasury curve has been greater than that of the 3-month LIBOR. And so that inversion has occurred over the last 3 to 4 months, and that's put some pressure on us. ","So overall, we think, certainly, the first one will we think reverse itself. We think of it as timing, and we'll have to monitor the margin pressure and sec lending and see what happens with the inversion of the curve. Right now if you follow the forward rates, it would imply that the relationship will improve throughout the year, but obviously, we know things can deviate from there.","Andrew Kligerman","Okay. So just staying with the bottom end of 100 to 125 basis points for the going forward versus 97 this quarter...","John McCallion","I would like to say bottom half.","Andrew Kligerman","Bottom half. Right. Right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.","Jamminder Bhullar","I had a question just on group insurance margin. They were obviously a bigger source of the upside in earnings this quarter. To what extent do you think it's -- it was just good experience this quarter versus the trend, especially in the Non-Medical business being sustainable?","Michel Khalaf","Let me give you a couple of quick comments and then Ramy can chime in as well. So if you think, obviously, we're pleased with our group performance in Q1, and I'd say this is building also on strong momentum from last year, but we should keep in mind that underwriting results do fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. So if you think about life, for example, it's at the very low end of the range this quarter. Very much flu season was the main contributor. ","But a few things I think related to what we discussed in the fourth quarter. One is that dental utilization has normalized so it's in line with expectations in Q1. As you recall, that was elevated in Q4. We said we didn't see signs of any trend. That was confirmed in Q1. And one of the things we did lower the Non-Medical Health ratio in our outlook call. That was driven by the view that disability is performing well given the healthy economy, the high levels of employment. So we continue to see positive outcomes there, but we also talked about the fact that we are seeing a business mix towards voluntary products, so with lower benefit ratios. ","And we're particularly pleased, our sales results for the quarter, were very strong, and those were really driven by voluntary sales, so that's as opposed to jumbo sales, for example, which is also typical in national accounts. So I think this speaks to the fact that our strategy is delivering in terms of this product mix shift, and we think we continue to see voluntary as an important growth opportunity. I don't know, Ramy, if you want to also add to this.","Ramy Tadros","Sure, thank you, Michel. Good morning, Jimmy. Again, just to emphasize, you know that these ratios can be volatile quarter-to-quarter. And for the course of the year, I would guide you to the middle of our guidance range across both the mortality and the nonmedical benefit ratio. With respect to the latter, and particularly your specific question, what we saw in this quarter on the nonmedical benefit ratio, the ratio came at the lower end of the range, as you know, and that's largely driven by a combination of lower severity of claims as well as more favorable claims recoveries. As Michel mentioned, over the medium term as our business mix shifts, we expect to also be continuing some positive trends on this ratio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore.","Thomas Gallagher","Michel, I'd just be curious on what your high-level thought is from the strategy standpoint. When I think of Steve and his legacy, I think it's risk reduction cash flow optimization. Are there any high-level issues that you would call out that you're focused on initially outside of those risk reduction or cash flow optimization?","Michel Khalaf","So look, I think we're on the right path in terms of core elements of our strategy, and you mentioned those, so capital efficiency, focus on strong risk-adjusted returns on strong free cash flow generation and profitable growth. And I can tell you that in all my visits to our key markets, I see a real focus on value creation that's now well embedded in pretty much everything we do. I do feel that we're at an inflection point. And while we've accomplished much in terms of our -- in terms of derisking action, I always believe that there's room for improvement. I've already started a review process with my team, and we are going to look for opportunities: one, to see how we can further optimize our portfolio, our products, our businesses, make sure that we are making -- we continue to make the right decisions and choices in terms of capital allocation; and then how we can also accelerate revenue growth, and as I mentioned earlier, make sure that expense efficiency becomes -- is more of a journey here as opposed to a single destination. So I'm excited. I think this is an exciting time for MetLife and I think we can -- I'm confident that we can build on the strong foundations that we already have.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay. And then just a follow-up on Group Benefits. It seems to me from what we're seeing in the industry that there's a lot more competition in voluntary benefits, you're seeing lapses escalating for certain carriers. It sounds like you're not seeing that. And you also -- John, I think you referenced Group Benefits sales up 11%, which is a good outcome. Can you talk sort of what you're seeing there competitively? Are there parts of the market that are getting heated from pricing or -- so anyway, yes. Any color you could give on that.","Ramy Tadros","It's Ramy Tadros here. So let me just give you some perspective on our voluntary strategy and the investments we've been making in that space over the last number of years, and they really fall in 3 categories. The first one is we were very early to recognize -- as you think about the voluntary space, this is not just about the traditional intermediaries and distribution channels. There's a whole benefit ecosystem that includes technology firms, benefit administrators, communication firms, and we've built an engagement model with each of those firms across the ecosystem. ","We've invested in integrating our systems with them, and that creates seamless interaction and ease-of-use for both the employers and the employees. And then beyond that, once we get to the employee, we also have a lot of discipline in terms of driving employee engagement and education around voluntary benefits to build awareness and therefore increase the higher enrollment rates. ","So what you're seeing here is the result of a very disciplined strategy with very focused investments that we've made over the last few years. From a competitive environment with respect to voluntary, we do see some carriers enter and they do try to compete on price to drive voluntary growth. I would say most of our growth that we've seen has actually come from expanding relationships with existing customers that value our brand and service and our ability to design flexible solutions for them. And then you're seeing a lot of growth, precisely from those investments that I'm talking about, that are driving enrollment and reenrollment rates, which enables growth outside of competitive bidding situations. And we're seeing very good bottom line results here and are very confident in the adequacy of our pricing in the voluntary space.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","For Asia, can you talk about how much runway there is to continue to grow sales of U.S. dollar-denominated products in Japan? And is this -- is the growth coming from kind of cash on the sidelines getting invested or money switching from other products? And just a little bit more color there would be helpful.","Kishore Ponnavolu","This is Kishore. As we discussed at the Investor Day last September, the low interest rate environment in Japan is a great fuel for the FX margin, right? That's driving a lot of customer demand across all of our distribution channels with our bank channel leading the way. In terms of our position, up until now we have been certainly expanding our share of the market. However, there are new entrants coming into that space. So if you think about this year, we had an 8% growth year-over-year, which is very, very strong. ","Looking forward to the second quarter, that was a pretty strong performance last year. So year-on-year for the full year, I'm very comfortable with the guidance for the overall Asia sales of mid-single digits, but we're very, very happy with the progress we've made so far.","Erik Bass","And then for Latin America, can you just provide some more color on the earnings drivers this quarter and if there's any seasonality in terms of expenses or other items we can -- should consider when thinking about kind of the run rate going forward?","\u00d3scar Schmidt","Sure. This is \u00d3scar. So let me start referring to the comparison against prior year quarter. So first, expenses were higher year-over-year primarily due to a litigation reserve release in the prior year quarter, so this quarter reflects a more normal level of expenses. And the second is we had a positive investment performance, especially the Chilean Kihei, which performed above last year and above expectations this year. These 2 effects merely offset each other. ","And finally, volume business growth year-over-year was mid-single digits. It was a bit lower than usual due to the loss of some Mexico federal government group cases but in line with our outlook whole discussion. But now let me refer to this quarter in particular against expectations. The way to look at it is that we have good cat results in Chile Provida but offset by a couple of old items. First, low quarterly inflation in Chile -- actually, inflation in Chile in the first quarter was almost zero, so that had an adverse impact the investments but in our life business in Chile as investment portfolio is indexed to inflation. That was the first impact related to low inflation in Chile. ","And the second one is that low inflation also has an adverse impact on taxes in Chile, that's because inflation impact on equity is deductible for tax purposes. So we expect these two items to recover during the remainder of the year because the full year consensus in Chile remains almost similar to expectations, meaning that inflation that didn't happen in the first quarter will happen during the remainder of the year. ","And finally, expenses were a little higher than expected in the quarter mainly due to some accounting adjustments that impacted expenses. So for the full year, we still expect our earnings to be in the range we provided on the outlook call on a constant currency basis. I hope this answered your question, Erik.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi.","Suneet Kamath","Just wanted to start with the RBC ratio. I think 402% is what you said, which is above your target of 360%. So would you expect -- I guess what I'm trying to get at is what is your expectations for dividends to the holding company in the balance of the year? Would you expect that excess to move to holdco or be consumed by growth in the business?","John McCallion","It's John. I would just -- I wouldn't comment specifically on dividend for a particular legal entity. I think we would just comment and refer back to the guidance that we've given, which is free cash flow ratio of 65 to 75 on average for the two year period. I think we're still on track to meet that target.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And then I guess for Steve Goulart. On the balance sheet, we have seen some derisking activities from some of the other life insurers that have reported so far. So any color in terms of any changes you might be contemplating there? And should we be thinking about any of the interest rate hedges rolling off, either later this year or as we get into 2020?","Steven Goulart","It's Steve. Regarding portfolio repositioning, I think we've talked about this on the last couple of calls and I think indicated also, we would continue to look at opportunities that we thought made sense given our outlook in the market particularly in the credit market. And we've continued to do some repositioning into the first quarter, mostly looking at again sectors that we think would be vulnerable in a downturn. So we've continued to lighten up our bank loan portfolio as well as lower investment grade rated corporate bonds. A lot of them may be involved in M&A and higher leverage and the like. We think those are -- continue to be 2 vulnerable sectors in the market, and so that's where most of our repositioning has taken place. ","And then regarding interest rates hedges and rolling off, again, I'd go back to how we think about all of our hedging policy in ALM, and it's always dynamic, and we will continue to review at that time and make the appropriate decisions then.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs.","Taylor Scott","First one I have is on MetLife Holdings. I'd just be interested if you had any commentary on what drove the sort of larger year-over-year decline in expenses, if there's anything specific related to the expense plan that occurred. And also on holdings, could you give us a rough way to think about statutory capital back in that segment?","John McCallion","It's John. On the first question with regards to expenses, yes, I think it's just been continued focus to optimize and the efficiency of that segment. We continue to focus there. And a lot of the efforts that we've been making over the years on our unit cost initiative, quite a few of that is allocated towards holdings so that's just kind of the natural progress that you would expect to see. Regarding allocation of capital, we haven't given that figure out, and we'll probably keep it that way for now.","Operator","And next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Just to circle back on RIS. John, you talked about the investment spread and how it's being negatively affected by the inverted yield curve for the for the sec lending book. I think in the other call, you provided guidance in terms of sensitivity to LIBOR, but I was just wondering if you can provide some sensitivity in terms of how do we think about the impacts from the yield curve, especially coming from the longer end of the curve.","John McCallion","Sure. We did give a sense it should be the LIBOR. LIBOR in and of itself actually performed as expected. But as I said, there was -- we didn't talk about a shift in the shape of the curve relative to LIBOR. So that inversion -- maybe I didn't give this number before, but in the quarter, it probably cost us about 3 to 4 basis points on the spread. So if you roll that forward, you can kind of come up with what the headwind would be if the curve did not kind of steepen at all from here.","Humphrey Lee","Remind us what is the size of your sec lending book right now sitting in RIS?","John McCallion","We don't give that allocation out, but it's a good percentage of our sec lending goes there.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. Got it. And then a follow-up question related to the expenses. You've talked about this quarter, you have a little bit lower than expected, employee benefits and deferred comp flowing through the numbers. Can you give us a sense where the geography of those lower expenses are in the segments?","John McCallion","They're just allocated throughout segments. You can follow up with John later, but it's not -- it's -- -- they're out there. They're allocated throughout the segments, I guess, would be the easy answer.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. Mr. Hall, please continue.","John Hall","Great. Before we close, I'd like to turn the call over to Michel for some closing remarks.","Michel Khalaf","Thanks, John. Let me close by saying we are starting 2019 on solid footing with a strong fundamental first quarter. MetLife is a company with great businesses, a noble purpose and an iconic brand. Looking ahead, I'm excited and energized by the task at hand: delivering great value for our customers, shareholders and people.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife.

Hall - MetLife, Inc.","Thank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's third quarter 2018 earnings call. On this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so-called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations' portion of MetLife.com, in our earnings release, and our quarterly financial supplements.","A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period-to-period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.","Now, joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John McCallion, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management.","Last night, we released an expanded set of supplemental slides, including substantial disclosure in the appendix on our long-term care book of business. The slides are available on our website. John McCallion will speak to the main body of the supplemental slides in his prepared remarks, if you wish to follow along. The content for the slides begins following the romanette pages that feature a number of GAAP reconciliations.","After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session that will extend no longer than the top of the hour. Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, in fairness to all participants.","With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.","Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. MetLife has been engaged in one of the most ambitious transformations in its history. For a number of years, much of our business was characterized by capital-intensive long-tailed liabilities with low levels of free cash flow. Our strategy has been to transform MetLife into a company with a different profile, less capital-intensive, with shorter payback periods, and higher cash flow.","While some of the business we wrote in years past will take time to run off our books, we believe we are now at an inflection point where the heavy lifting of our transformation is just about complete.","We are executing more consistently and the results in the quarter and for the year-to-date 2018 demonstrate that our strategy is working. We delivered third quarter adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.38 per share, up from $1.04 per share a year ago. Once again, our business fundamentals were strong: solid underwriting; good investment results; and disciplined expense management across the company. Reflecting our strong results, adjusted return on equity in the quarter rose to 12.9% from 9.1% a year ago.","After notable items, adjusted earnings were $1.53 per share. Notable items in the third quarter included a net charge of $0.07 per share associated with our annual actuarial review and other insurance adjustments, as well as $0.09 per share of costs to support our expense initiative.","MetLife's annual actuarial review, which we completed during the third quarter, examined the actuarial assumptions underpinning our insurance liabilities around the world. Going into the quarter, there was considerable market interest in long-term care. Our LTC review of all assumptions, models and the margin testing process, which incorporated a third-party actuarial review, concluded that no long-term care reserve unlocking was necessary.","Following the review, our long-term care loss recognition testing margin now stands at $2.1 billion. Along with other insurance adjustments, the impact of the actuarial review on adjusted earnings was negative $68 million. The incremental effect of the actuarial review on net income was negative $230 million. None of these amounts were associated with long-term care insurance.","The largest net contributors were assumption updates in Japan and the closed block. John McCallion will provide more detail on the actuarial review in his comments. Net income for the quarter was $880 million compared to a net loss of $97 million, which was driven by the separation of Brighthouse Financial a year ago. The largest items contributing to the difference between net income and adjusted earnings in the quarter, included net derivative losses in the annual actuarial review.","Increasing net interest rates in the U.S. and Japan, a rising U.S. equity market and a weakening yen combined to generate mark-to-market derivative losses of $299 million, while protecting our balance sheet. As I mentioned earlier, the non-adjusted earnings impact from the annual actuarial review totaled $230 million. We continue to focus on delivering results where net income and adjusted earnings are more closely aligned than the past.","Turning to business highlights, Group Benefits reported very good underwriting and solid volume growth, aided by the positive fundamentals of the U.S. economy. Retirement and Income Solutions also reported favorable underwriting and good volume growth. New pension risk transfer deposits in the quarter totaled $1 billion and we are seeing a strong pipeline.","With Property & Casualty, lower catastrophe losses and volume growth contributed to solid adjusted earnings, which were up 69% year-over-year. For our international segments, Asia benefited from volume growth offset by less favorable underwriting. Latin America was aided by business growth, offset by currency headwinds. And EMEA benefited from expense management, while absorbing underwriting and currency weakness.","Moving to total company investments, recurring investment income was up 6.7% from a year ago. Asset growth and higher interest rates account for the increase. In the quarter, our global new money yield was 4.04% in comparison to an average roll-off rate of 4.37%. Our new money rate was up 51 basis points from a year ago, reflecting higher interest rates.","Pre-tax variable investment income totaled $280 million in the quarter, driven by strong private equity returns and higher prepayment activity. Pre-tax variable investment income is above our quarterly guidance range of $200 million to $250 million and on target to meet our full year guidance.","Notwithstanding the recent market turmoil and concerns over geopolitical issues such as trade, MetLife's business growth has been helped by the favorable economic environment in the United States. GDP growth is on track to exceed 3% for 2018 and the U.S. unemployment rate in September dropped to the lowest level since 1969, a positive for our Group business.","In addition, higher interest rates are strengthening our recurring investment yields. It is difficult at this stage to know that if stock market is signaling an economic downturn. But as we have said before, our refreshed strategy was designed to allow MetLife to perform well across economic cycles.","Moving to capital management, we repurchased $636 million of our common shares during the third quarter. Combined with our common dividend, total capital returned to shareholders in the quarter came to more than $1 billion. We have $470 million remaining on our current $1.5 billion authorization, which we expect to complete by year-end.","Also, we announced last night that our board of directors authorized an additional $2 billion of share repurchases, bringing our current authorized buyback capacity to almost $2.5 billion. Over the three-year period from 2016 through 2018, MetLife will return close to $12 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and common dividends.","During that same timeframe, our share count will be down by more than 10%. The cumulative impact of our share repurchase program has had a meaningful and growing positive impact on our financial metrics, including earnings per share and return on equity. In the current quarter alone, share repurchases contributed $0.08 to earnings per share compared to $0.04 a year ago.","I would like to spend a moment talking about our Asia business. As many of you know, we hosted an Asia Investor Day in Tokyo at the end of September. Asia is our largest business segment outside the U.S. We have a strong franchise in the region, with a significant opportunity to generate growth and value for our shareholders. We have pursued a multi-year effort through Accelerating Value initiative to improve returns and capital efficiency.","Among the more nimble actions was our transition from yen-denominated Whole Life products in Japan to dollar-denominated products. Importantly, this transition was aligned with our enterprise strategy to deliver the right solutions for the right customers.","Over the past three years, MetLife has more effectively deployed capital in Asia at higher internal rates of return with shorter payback periods, which we expect will generate more value for our shareholders over time.","As I noted at the start of today's call, this is the approach we are pursuing across the company. We believe the attributes of a new MetLife are becoming clearer; leaner; less capital-intensive; more digital; more profitable, with strong free cash flow. This is our plan to grow long-term shareholder value. And we believe the results are clear in MetLife's improved performance. On December 14, we will host our 2018 outlook call and share our three-year roadmap for MetLife.","With that, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our quarterly financial results in detail.","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I will begin by discussing the 3Q 2018 supplemental slides that we released last evening, along with our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. These slides cover our third quarter 2018 financial results, including our actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments as well as business highlights. In addition, we are offering a deeper dive into our long-term care block, given its focus with analysts and investors.","Starting on page 4, this schedule provides a comparison of net income and adjusted earnings in the third quarter. Net income was $880 million, or roughly $500 million below adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion. The primary drivers for this variance were net derivative losses and the non-adjusted earnings impact from the actuarial assumption review.","Higher interest rates, strong U.S. equity markets, and the weakening of the yen combined to drive the net derivative loss. Overall, the results in the investment portfolio and hedging program performed as expected.","Now, let's turn to page 5. We have completed our annual actuarial assumption review during the third quarter. Before I speak to the total review, I would like to first address the review as it pertains to long-term care.","During the quarter, our actuarial team reviewed all LTC assumptions, models, and the loss recognition testing process. Our review was supplemented by a third-party actuarial review. The short-form conclusion was that no long-term care reserve unlocking was needed. We continue to have a substantial loss recognition testing margin associated with long-term care. As of September 30, this was $2.1 billion.","In addition, we increased the amount of disclosure regarding our long-term care block of business. The disclosure can be found in the appendix to the supplemental slides. Along with the granular detail on the long-term care block, we have provided the assumptions underlying our base GAAP and statutory reserves, as well as the assumptions supporting our GAAP loss recognition testing and our statutory asset adequacy testing.","Further, we provided a set of sensitivities associated with our GAAP loss recognition testing margin. Keep in mind that MetLife is not in loss recognition, so our LTC sensitivities relate to our loss recognition testing margin, rather than our base reserves.","Following the review, we continue to reflect improving morbidity in our loss recognition testing assumptions at a rate of 50 basis points per year. This judgment is supported by a third-party review of our actual morbidity experience, which is tracking at an annual rate of improvement of roughly 2%, more than the assumed rate, but still building statistical significance. It is important to note the removal of this assumption would be fully covered by our loss recognition testing margin.","Our statutory long-term care reserves total $14.7 billion. They do not assume any improvement in morbidity in the formulation of base reserves or in the statutory asset adequacy testing process.","Our statutory LTC reserves are $2.6 billion greater than our GAAP LTC reserves, which speaks to the strength of the protection provided to our long-term care policyholders. We take in roughly $750 million of long-term care premium each year, which is an important contributor to reserve growth and loss recognition testing margin over time. Importantly, premiums grew last year by 7% from rate increases. And we've achieved another 3% in rate increases year-to-date, which serves to better support our LTC block of business.","I will now briefly discuss the balance of our actuarial assumption review on page 6. During the quarter, the actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments reduced adjusted earnings by $68 million. There were a number of pieces that were largely offsetting and each segment was modestly impacted. Among the larger contributors were: lapse assumption updates in Asia and MetLife Holdings; as well as mortality updates; closed block refinements; and other life insurance reserve adjustments in MetLife Holdings.","The non-adjusted earnings portion of the assumption review was a negative $230 million and was driven by some of the same factors. We had two notable items in the quarter as shown on page 7 and highlighted in our earnings release and quarterly financial supplement. First, the actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments decreased adjusted earnings by $68 million after-tax, or $0.07 per share. Second, expenses related to our unit cost initiative decreased adjusted earnings by $88 million after-tax, or $0.09 per share. Adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were $1.5 billion, or $1.53 per share.","On page 8, you can see the year-over-year adjusted earnings, excluding total notable items, by segment. Excluding all notable items in both periods, adjusted earnings were up 29% year-over-year and 32% on a constant currency basis.","On a per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 39%, and up 40% on a constant currency basis. The better results on an EPS basis reflect the cumulative impact from share repurchases. Overall, positive year-over-year drivers in the quarter included: favorable underwriting; solid volume growth; better expense and investment margins, as well as lower taxes primarily due to U.S. tax reform. With respect to investment margins, pre-tax variable investment income was $280 million, up $44 million versus the prior-year quarter, driven by higher private equity and prepayment income.","With regards to business performance, Group Benefits adjusted earnings, excluding notable items in both periods, were up 38% year-over-year, primarily driven by: favorable underwriting margins; volume growth; better expense margins; and the benefit from U.S. tax reform. Underwriting results were particularly strong in non-medical health. The interest adjusted benefit ratio for non-medical health was 68.1% and 71.6%, excluding a favorable insurance adjustment. This result was favorable to the prior-year quarter of 74.7% and well below the target range of 75% to 80%.","Non-medical health's favorable underwriting experience was primarily driven by disability, which had strong renewal results, lower incidence and favorable claim recoveries versus the prior-year quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio was 85%, which was in line with the prior-year quarter and at the low end of the target range of 85% to 90%.","Group Benefits continues to see strong momentum in its top line. Adjusted PFOs were up 6% year-over-year, with growth across all markets and product lines. Year-to-date 2018 sales were down 2% relative to the first three quarters of 2017, which had record jumbo cases.","Voluntary products continued its momentum, with sales up double digits year-to-date in 2018 versus the prior-year period. In addition, we also continue to grow downmarket, as regional and small market sales were strong and above our year-to-date target.","Adjusted earnings in Retirement and Income Solutions, or RIS, were up 37%. The key drivers were favorable underwriting and volume growth, as well as lower taxes due to U.S. tax reform. This was partially offset by investment margins, as we had lower variable investment income in RIS compared to the prior year.","While the flatter yield curve has put some pressure on RIS adjusted earnings, this was more than offset by higher general account balances, which were up 7% versus the prior-year quarter. In addition, we have been able to maintain investment spreads, which were 125 basis points in 3Q and within our outlook call range of 110 to 135.","As we noted on our 2Q analyst call, earnings from interest rate caps contributed to spreads once again in the quarter. Excluding VII, RIS spreads were 104 basis points, which was up 5 basis points year-over-year, but down 9 basis points sequentially. RIS adjusted PFOs were $1.7 billion, down from $2.5 billion in the prior-year quarter, due to lower pension risk transfer sales.","Year-to-date, PRT sales are well ahead of 2017. And we continue to win deals, highlighted by two transactions in 3Q 2018 totaling $1 billion. Excluding PRT deals in both quarters, adjusted PFOs were up 2% year-over-year, primarily due to structured settlements and income annuities.","Property & Casualty, or P&C, adjusted earnings, excluding notable items in the prior-year quarter, were up 41%, primarily due to lower catastrophes in the current quarter. Pre-tax cat losses were $49 million in the quarter, which was $37 million lower than the prior year. With regards to the top-line, P&C adjusted PFOs were up 2%, while sales were up 23% versus 3Q 2017. We continue to see strong sales momentum in 2018.","Asia adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were up 11% and up 12% on a constant currency basis. The key driver was volume growth, which was partially offset by less favorable underwriting. Asia sales were up 29% on a constant currency basis. In Japan, sales were up 38%, primarily driven by strong foreign currency-denominated annuities, as well as Accident & Health sales. FX in A&H products remain our primary focus in Japan and we continue to see strong momentum in the market.","Other Asia sales were up 16%, primarily driven by China and a group case in Australia. Latin America adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were down 4%, but on a constant currency basis were up 4%.","The impact from U.S. tax reform has dampened Latin America earnings. For example, if we exclude notable items and the impact of tax reform, Latin America adjusted earnings were up 3% and up 13% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were solid volume growth, higher interest margins, and favorable underwriting.","Latin America adjusted PFOs were down 1%, but up 7% on a constant currency basis, driven by volume growth across the region led by Chile. Latin America sales were up 2% on a constant currency basis, due to higher direct marketing and group sales.","EMEA adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were down 1%, but up 5% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to expense margin improvement. This was partially offset by less favorable underwriting margins.","EMEA adjusted PFOs were flat versus the prior year and up 3% on a constant currency basis, reflecting growth in Western Europe and Turkey. EMEA sales were down 22% on a constant currency basis, due to lower volumes in the Gulf and the exit of the UK wealth management business in mid-2017.","MetLife Holdings' adjusted earnings, excluding notable items, were up 45% year-over-year, primarily driven by favorable underwriting, improved expense margins, and the benefits from U.S. tax reform.","With regards to underwriting, LTC was favorable versus the prior year quarter and remained consistent with expectations as we continue to execute on our rate action plan. MetLife Holdings' adjusted earnings were aided by several items in the quarter of approximately $30 million, which are not expected to repeat.","Corporate & Other adjusted loss, excluding notable items, was $149 million compared to an adjusted loss of $152 million in 3Q 2017. The primary drivers were higher variable investment income and favorable expense margins. This was mostly offset by the impact from U.S. tax reform and lower interest margins.","Overall, the company's effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.2%. Excluding a positive one-time tax item of $12 million, the company's effective tax rate was 17.9%, a fraction below our guidance of 18% to 20%.","Turning to page 9, this chart shows our direct expense ratio from 2015 through 2017, as well as the first three quarters of 2018. As we have stated previously, we believe this ratio best reflects the impact on profit margins as it captures the relationship of revenues and the expenses over which we have the most control.","We have also noted that we need to bring down our direct expense ratio by approximately 200 basis points from 14.3% in 2015, which was the baseline year, to realize $800 million of pre-tax profit margin improvement.","For this quarter, the direct expense ratio was 13.1%, excluding notable items and pension risk transfers. This is modestly higher than the first two quarters of 2018. As we have previously mentioned, we would expect our direct expense ratio to tick-up slightly in 4Q given business seasonality, but anticipate the full year direct expense ratio falling below the 2017 ratio of 13.3%.","I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.5 billion at September 30, which is down from $5.4 billion at June 30. The $900 million decrease in cash in the quarter reflects the net effects of subsidiary dividends, share repurchases, payment of our common dividend, holding company expenses and liability management actions.","Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. For our U.S. companies, preliminary year-to-date third quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.6 billion and net earnings were approximately $3.1 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $1.1 billion from the prior-year period, primarily due to dividends received from an investment subsidiary which had a corresponding offset in statutory adjusted capital, as well as the positive impact of U.S. tax reform.","We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $18 billion as of September 30, 2018, down 3% compared to December 31, 2017. Net earnings were more than offset by dividends paid to the holding company and by investment losses. Finally, the Japan solvency margin ratio was 808% as of June 30, which is the latest public data.","Overall, MetLife generated another very strong quarter in 2018, driven by solid business fundamentals. The highlights in 3Q included favorable underwriting, volume growth and improving margins. In addition, our cash and capital position, as well as our balance sheet, remain strong.","Yesterday's announcement of a new $2 billion buyback authorization is further evidence of MetLife's financial strength and our commitment to return excess capital to our shareholders. Finally, we remain confident that the actions we are taking to implement our strategy will drive free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value to our shareholders.","And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I had a question on Group Benefits. The underwriting performance has been very strong this year, for both MetLife and pretty much the entire industry. Can you give us some additional perspective on what you're seeing and, I guess, if we continue to stay in a good economic environment, if you think results can continue to trend more favorably than you would typically expect longer term?","Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, hi, Ryan. This is Michel. So, as Steve mentioned in his opening, obviously, the favorable economic environment does help in terms of the underwriting performance. If you think about disability, for example, where we've seen very good results this quarter, lower incidence, high recovery experience. So that's one factor.","We always like to be cautious and guide towards the range that we provide for our underwriting experience, but we do think that some of the benefit could be sustainable. I would also point out that if you look at our results over the last three quarters, the diversity of our business is an important factor.","In the first quarter, our dental performance was strong. Q2, life underwriting was strong. Q3, disability in particular, but also if you look at our life mortality, it's at the lower end of the range. So we think some of this is sustainable. I would also point out in non-medical health, in particular, that our shift towards voluntary benefits, accident & health, in particular, should over time also help lower our benefit ratio there.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. And then, just one on the interest rate caps in retirement, John, could you give us some kind of perspective on just how much that's contributing right now to spreads, so we can think about the impacts when it runs off?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Sure. So as I said last quarter, our interest rate caps, given where LIBOR is today, is providing a offset. And it's effectively neutralized the sensitivities we gave back in December of last year in terms of the outlook call. And I think the other aspect, we also said there were certain management actions we took in terms of how we manage the liability side of the balance sheet as well. So the combination of those has probably helped us in, call it, the 5 to 7 basis point range.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Good morning. Just a few long-term care questions, can you comment on what's going on with underlying long-term care claim trends? I know, John, you had mentioned you're seeing favorable experience. That probably puts you in the minority in terms of from everyone else we're hearing from on underlying claim trends. Is it frequency, severity, claim durations? Can you give a little color in terms of what you're seeing on the claims side?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yes, sure. I would probably just keep it pretty simple. I don't know if we're seeing favorable. I'd say they're in line with expectations. And I think just overall, the underwriting profit in the business is performing as expected. I'm not so sure I'd say they are favorable relative to expectations.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then, just on the disclosure that you put out for long-term care, I guess a few things that stand out is the fact that you're not in loss recognition testing and your loss recognition testing margin is over 10%. But is there anything other than those that you would point out that you feel like where your block stands out is less risky or in better shape than others?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yes. I think I would probably reiterate things we said in the past. We believe the profile of the block is in decent shape. Obviously, our relationship of group to individual, the amount of lifetime benefits we have, things like that and kind of things we've reiterated before. And then, I'd say the second thing that we talked about is just the work we've done on rate increases over the years has been beneficial. We have $750 million of premium in this block that we receive every year. We got a 7% increase last year. We've got another 3% through nine months this year. So, I think those probably at a high level are the two factors I would point to.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. I just had a question on your expectations for spreads, given what's happened with rates. Where do you think rates need to go for spread compression to sort of cease?","And then if you could quantify how much of a benefit you are getting from interest rate protection and any color on how these expire over time?","Steven J. Goulart - MetLife, Inc.","Hey, Jimmy, let me take the first one. This is Steve Goulart. And we'll just talk a little bit about spreads. Steve gave some of the statistics for what's happening in our overall portfolio. We've talked a lot in the past about the roll-off reinvest dilemma and we continue to see that spread narrowing as we see interest rates climbing. That's the outcome that we expected and obviously an outcome that we're very pleased to see happening.","So, we continue to see that happening. I think if we see interest rates behave as, say, the forward curve or our plan projects, we continue to see that gap narrowing and I think it's favorable. I think I'd even go so far as to say that in several quarters, we're likely to basically be at breakeven.","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","And, Jimmy, this is John. I'll take the second one. So, I would probably go back to the response to Ryan's comment. So, we certainly have some interest rate caps today, given where LIBOR has rose to and it hasn't changed much in the last three months. Those caps we have that are giving that protection today and really neutralizing the sensitivity in our RIS business, they will roll-off into the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2019.","Now, we have other caps in 2019, although they're at higher strikes. So, I think what we'll do on the outlook call is work through it and maybe a more robust sensitivity for you as we think about the outlook.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And your comments on spreads maybe neutralizing or spread compression neutralizing sometime in the next several quarters, does that take into account the expiration of the caps?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Right, so...","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Or is that just a differential between portfolio yields and maturing or new money versus maturing loans?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yes. So, spreads, I'm focusing on RIS right now.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes.","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","And we gave a sensitivity in the outlook call last December that indicated with a rising LIBOR rate, that we would have a negative spread compression.","And what I'm saying is that the caps, given how fast or how high it has risen, it's some of these out of the money caps are now in the money and they are neutralizing that sensitivity. So, we are not seeing that negative spread compression as a result of the caps and how high LIBOR has risen. That will roll-off, all else equal, in the next few quarters and then we'll have to give you an updated outlook for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, morning. First question is on the direct expense ratio. And it looks like you have another, I don't know, 80-plus basis points, 100 basis points to go that would be about $400 million. And this quarter, you spent $88 million on expense cost initiatives.","If the plan is to complete the direct expense ratio reduction in two years, could you talk about the geography of where you're going to see it, the timing of when we're going to see it? Are we going to actually see $400 million drop to the bottom-line?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Right. So, I would just reference back to the direct expense ratio slide. We've used a ratio. We believe that using the ratio of revenues to our fixed cost is an indicator of profit margin expansion. So I would argue that we have seen that already, but not all of it yet. Our target is to get to a net $800 million (39:38) by 2020. So that's roughly a 200 basis point reduction using the same revenues we have today. So I think the answer is yes. We expect to see that drop to the bottom line. And the reason we put the ratio out is to provide a metric that you can track to see that that has actually happened.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So we'll see it within two years. And any particular areas of the company where it will benefit most?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","We're focusing on our fixed costs across the firm. And it's everyone's contributing. This is a full team effort. We are obviously having to leverage and our goal here is not just to kind of do these things and then see expenses creep back up. This is a unit cost initiative. Our objective is to improve this direct expense ratio by 200 basis points and keep it there.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. And then...","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","And to do that, we're making quite a bit of investments around technology to build the platform to leverage that operational leverage.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it, thanks. And then, lastly on share repurchases, you've done $2.8 billion year-to-date. Now you've upped the authorization and you have about less than $2.5 billion on it, which is terrific. Do you think you'll do this over the course of now through 2019? Will it all get deployed?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yes. Our objective is to finish the remainder on the $1.5 billion authorization, which we will do by no later than end of the year. And then we'll reevaluate along the way. I think it's fair to say that the $2 billion would be done no later than end of year next year.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Terrific. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. And thanks for all the long-term care disclosures. That was helpful. In terms of the loss recognition testing assumptions, did you make any changes to those underlying assumptions as you went through this third quarter review?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, hi, Suneet, it's John. Yeah, we did make a few changes. So we dropped our ultimate lapse assumption roughly 20 basis points in the aggregate. We were at roughly 1% before. We're down to 80 basis points now. We probably made some changes to utilization, but it varied by block and so there was really probably nothing material in aggregate, but we did make some changes throughout. And I think other than that, those are probably the most material changes.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So that $2.1 billion margin, there is no big change to that in the aggregate?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","I would say not material. Yes.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then my quick follow-up is just on the morbidity improvement. I think you said in your prepared remarks that you're seeing maybe 2% morbidity improvement, which, again, is quite a bit different from what we're hearing from other companies. So any sense of like how much claims experience you've seen so far maybe relative to inception, and any sense in terms of why you're seeing it versus perhaps some other companies that aren't seeing it yet?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yes. I think I would reference, we still are building statistical significance in the data. So it's still relatively early. I don't think we could draw a conclusion that would cause us to change our current assumption. But what we're saying is early signs are indicating that it's higher than that. But we need to see the data emerge and kind of build that statistical significance, as I mentioned.","It's hard for me. I'm not going to speculate as to why we're seeing it and others are not. But I think it's important to leverage your own data and make the appropriate conclusions off of that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from UBS. Please go ahead.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, hey, thank you. Good morning. I guess a couple questions, just thinking about favorability of underwriting results. And I guess in particular on the group side, if you could characterize what portion of better results this quarter, you think, is just akin to more typical seasonal pattern. 3Q, I think, tends to be a little bit better anyway. And how much of that is more difficult to think about trending? And then the second part of the question is just to think about January 1, 2019 renewals. I think there's been an expectation that maybe the positive impact of tax reform and maybe some of the good underwriting results we've seen would maybe put some downward pressure on premium rates for renewal business heading into 2019. And can you sort of talk to what you're seeing, if anything, in that respect.","Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, hi, John. This is Michel. So if you think about our favorable underwriting results in the quarter, we mentioned disability. We had favorable renewal results, lower incidence and more favorable claim recovery experience. As I mentioned earlier, the healthy economy may be a contributing factor to this. So certain aspects of that we think are sustainable.","I also mentioned that as we continue to shift our business mix more towards voluntary, we are likely to see over time improvements in our non-medical health benefits ratio. So those are some elements. I should point out here that the return of the health insurance tax, the HIT, in 2018 that was out in 2017. It's back in 2018. It will be out again in 2019. It will create some volatility that helps our non-medical health benefit ratio in 2018.","So those are some of the elements that I will point out to. And on the life side, we mentioned that mortality was at the low end of our guidance range for the year. We think we'll be within that guidance range.","With regards to January 1, 2019, so what I'll say first is that we are, so far, pleased with our renewals and sales and the large case segment for January 1, 2019, where most of the renewals and sales are already done. I think those are in line with expectation. We are winning our fair share of new sales and we are renewing in accordance with expectation. Too early to tell, as far as the med and lower end of the market, but we continue to see very good momentum on the voluntary front. And we think that will continue into January 1, 2019.","As far as the competitive environment is concerned, we are seeing a aggressiveness, particularly in dental, I would say, somewhat in disability. But we continue to be able to compete, especially that we focus on customers and intermediaries that look beyond just the lower price and where our service capabilities, our product set are major factors in our ability to win.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you for that. I mean, if I could just sort of follow it up with what I think is my takeaway from your commentary, Michel. It sounds like we really shouldn't expect any significant difference or shift in margin for the business based on 2019 pricing, really more just the function of overall economic conditions. Is that a fair summary of your comment?","Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.","Yes. I mean, I think that the tax will impact the dental business in particular, but other than that, yes, I would say you're spot on.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. I guess the first question I had was just on MetLife Holdings, any color you can give around the life business, variable annuities? I guess, in particular, on the life side, if any of the action from reinsurers and repricing is impacting you guys at all?","And then on the variable annuity and fixed annuity side, if there's anything you learned through the actuarial process or just the experience that you can provide color on.","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Hey Alex, it's John. So, on the first one, I'd say no, nothing material that we're seeing in terms of the reinsurance pricing question you had.","In terms of the actuarial review, look, as we said before and you saw on the supplemental slide, it's a variety of things and that's no exception for MetLife Holdings. Actually, the largest item in there is the closed block. It was about half of it. And we just had update to our estimated gross margins and that had an impact on DAC that came through. So, it's a little over half of the actuarial update there.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then maybe just one quick one on LatAm, I think the growth rates on premiums have been sort of hitting your guide. This quarter, it was a little lower. Any kind of update around how you view that mid to high single-digit growth rate and sort of the impact that the political landscape's having across some of those geographies.","Oscar Schmidt - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, Alex, this is Oscar. So, let me start with premiums and fees. So, we have a 7% growth year-over-year on constant currency. But you need to consider the divestiture of our Afore in Mexico a year ago. If you adjust for that, it's one percentage above, which is 8% year-over-year, which we find good according to our expectations. If you go to sales, sales was also affected by the divestiture of Afore, but in this case, it's four percentage points. So, if you adjust for that, our sales growth is approximately 6% year-over-year on constant currency, which we find good.","Remember that our top-line growth, our revenue growth, for us, it's a combination of sales as well as higher persistency. We're putting a lot of attention on persistency.","Now, your second question is about the political landscape. So, I guess, let me answer two-fold. The two countries are weaker more on Chile and Mexico. Chile, the President announced last Sunday, the project for pension reform. We find it very positive in terms of reaffirming the system, reaffirming the private system, the AFPs in general. Now, obviously, this is going to take time, we think probably more than a year. The conversion or process may be 1.5 years. So it's going to be a long process, but this is the first obviously signed development in the Congress. We think it's a good project. (5:41)","Going to Mexico for a minute. In terms of the change in government, as you probably know, the new administration has been focused on fiscal discipline, which we find very positive in general terms. And as part of that, they are planning to reduce government spending. And that includes a reduction of benefits in particularly high senior officers in the government. And, as you know, we provide some solutions that we inherited from the acquisition of Hidalgo more than 15 years ago.","So, we think that it's something worth managing. But, as you know, those contracts have been subject to bidding process over the years. We've lost some. We recovered some. At this point in time, if you want to put a value to this, we think that the federal contracts that may be affected by the government account for less than 5% of LatAm earnings. And, of course, we are working to protect, mitigate that and we think it's going to be lower than that potentially.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I have a question related to the unit cost initiatives. So you have $184 million spent year-to-date on an after-tax basis or maybe roughly $230 million pre-tax. I'm just trying to see if you are still on track to your $330 million pre-tax target for the full year of 2018?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Yes, we are, Humphrey.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. And then a quick question for Michel, just to follow-up on the group pricing, you've talked about dental a little bit aggressive and then so is disability. I was just wondering for that aggressiveness, is it aggressive but rational or you are seeing some irrational behavior in the marketplace?","Michel A. Khalaf - MetLife, Inc.","Yeah, hi, Humphrey I think you always do see one or two carriers that are overly aggressive, potentially irrational. That's not unusual. We continue to be disciplined in our approach, selective in avoiding situations where pricing is overly aggressive. So that's been our approach and will continue to be our approach, but there is irrational behavior from time-to-time and, in particular, in dental.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thank you very much. I was curious about what kind of deployable cash you have on hand right now, the pace of dividends that will come from the subs over the next year. And if we can look out a year or two in advance if your financial leverage is going to change with the buyback.","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","Hey, Joshua, this is John. I would just reiterate our outlook guidance around free cash flow. It's 65% to 75% over the average of two years. So I would say there's no change to that. In terms of leverage, we've done quite a bit of delevering to-date. The guidance we had given was for 2018, we had net liability management of $1 billion to $2 billion, would take effect this year. We've done about $1 billion and we'll reevaluate whether we do any additional delevering to give ourselves some additional financial flexibility.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And in terms of cash on hand right now?","John McCallion - MetLife, Inc.","$4.5 billion as of September 30.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you,","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.","Randy Binner - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. This is actually picking up on Suneet's line of questioning. And the question is your view as a market leader on how this body of industry data and assumptions is coming together around long-term care disclosure. Your disclosures are good. And we're getting much more granularity and sensitivity from all the carriers. But I'm just curious if you have a view on kind of the progress and quality of the disclosures we're getting. And I think it's important what your view is, because this is become a gating factor for a lot of investors looking at the space. So just want to get your view on how you think the kind of body of industry disclosures coming together on long-term care?","Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","This is Steve speaking. It's difficult for me to opine on other people's processes, but we certainly looked at this very, very carefully. As we mentioned in our comments this morning, we brought in an outside actuarial firm to review what we were doing. We wanted to make sure we had access to benchmarking from others.","We looked at our models. We made sure they were validated. And we examined all of our actuarial and morbidity trend experience and so on. So we know the sensitivity around this issue in the industry with investors, with analysts and that's why we spent the extra time and effort, both internally and bringing an external firm to validate all these measures.","Randy Binner - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","I mean, with that external firm, is your sense that you're conservative to what has become the industry baseline or just are more in line with it?","Steven A. Kandarian - MetLife, Inc.","I'm not going to opine on as to others, but I'll simply say that we benchmarked against others in terms of our own assumptions to make sure that what we were using was appropriate.","Randy Binner - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Barnidge from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thank you. Japan annuity sales essentially doubled in the quarter and has been a material grower recently. Can you talk about why you're comfortable with pricing of that product? Is there something like where participants have exited and you're filling a role and where is the share coming from? Thank you.","Kishore Ponnavolu - MetLife, Inc.","Hi, this is Kishore Ponnavolu. If you look at our annuity sales, they're up 91% quarter-over-quarter. And you take the annuity sales and break them out, single premium sales account for 80% of the overall sales. And then, also, the growth rate for single premium is much higher, at least in this quarter, than level premium. And so, let's spend a little bit time about on the single premium products per se. These are five and 10-year products, tightly duration matched. So, if you look at the ALM risk, there's nothing there.","And also, these are foreign currency products. So, these are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated, where we have considerable experience in terms of investment for matching liability. These policies also have an MVA and that certainly ensures that there's appropriate risk sharing from market risk perspective. So, overall, we are very comfortable with these products.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions.","John A. Hall - MetLife, Inc.","Great, that brings us to the top of the hour.

After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Steve.","Steven A. Kandarian","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another good quarter. Third quarter 2013 operating earnings were $1.5 billion, up 6% over the third quarter of 2012, and operating earnings per share were $1.34, a 2% increase over the prior year period.","Growth on a per-share basis was dampened by the conversion of equity units issued in 2010 to fund the acquisition of ALICO. Operating return on equity was 11.4% in the quarter. Operating earnings exceeded our plan but were down from the level reported in the second quarter. As anticipated, certain favorable developments highlighted in the second quarter did not repeat in the third quarter. For example, we said on the second quarter earnings call that variable investment income was expected to decline in the third quarter. Pretax variable investment income was $236 million in the third quarter versus $312 million in the second quarter, a reduction in operating earnings of $0.04 per share.","Despite this decline, investment margins were favorable again this quarter. The average investment spread across all U.S. product lines was 221 basis points, which is in the middle of the approximately 200- to 250-basis-point range on the past few years.","MetLife's investment spreads have been resilient despite a prolonged period of low interest rates. This performance has resulted from an effective asset liability management, good variable investment income and income from derivatives, many of which were purchased in the mid-2000s to protect earnings under a low-interest-rate scenario.","Our strategy to right size the variable annuity business and grow emerging markets was evident in the third quarter results. Variable annuity sales were down 41% from the prior year period, while emerging market sales rose 21% in our Europe, Middle East and Africa segment and 4% in Latin America. Growth in Latin America was below trend as a result of a large case sale in the prior year period. Excluding this large case, sales growth would have been 11%.","In addition to higher sales from existing businesses, our grow emerging market strategy will benefit from 3 recent developments. The first, our acquisition of AFP Provida in Chile, will have an immediate positive impact on earnings. The other 2, a start-up operation in Vietnam and a representative office in Myanmar, are consistent with our long-term strategy to expand MetLife's footprint in Southeast Asia.","We closed on the acquisition of Provida, the largest pension provider in Chile, on October 1. Our accretion estimate is roughly $0.15 per share in 2014, consistent with the outlook we provided when the deal was announced in February. Accretion in 2013 will be less than anticipated because the deal closed 2 months later than we had assumed. As a result of this transaction, MetLife's earnings from emerging markets are expected to increase from 14% of total company earnings to 17%, putting us well on the way to our 2016 goal of 20%.","In late September, we signed an agreement with the Bank for Investment & Development of Vietnam, or BIDV, to establish a life insurance joint venture in Vietnam. This joint venture with Vietnam's third-largest bank includes an exclusive bancassurance distribution agreement to sell MetLife products through BIDV's 120 branches and 500 transaction offices.","In addition, on October 7, we received approval from the regulatory authority in Myanmar to establish a representative office in the country. While these developments in Southeast Asia are immaterial for earnings in the near term, we are excited about the long-term potential in these fast-growing Southeast Asian markets.","Let me now turn to a discussion of risk and return. Without upward moves in equity markets and interest rates, we have been asked recently if better return prospects and variable annuities increase our appetite for this business. Given this question, it is timely to provide perspective on how we think about risk and return overall at MetLife. We know we must accept risk to earn an appropriate return for our shareholders, but determining the type of risk is a critical management decision. Relative to a few years ago, we have been actively diversifying MetLife's risk profile. Our strategy to grow emerging markets and shift the sales mix away from market-sensitive products to protection-oriented products should translate to a more balance risk profile. Less concentration of risk and reduction in so-called fat-tail risk should result in a lower cost of equity capital. A lower cost of equity capital, coupled with targeted ROE improvement, should be positive for our valuations over time.","We want to limit our exposure to any one risk factor, even if current returns are attractive in the related line of business. For example, while we are pleased with new business returns in variable annuities, we have to be mindful of the size of our in-force business when we establish our risk budget for future sales. While balance sheet risk is a primary consideration for capital-intensive products such as variable annuities, we think that earnings volatility is a primary risk factor for protection products and that political risk is a primary consideration for emerging markets.","For protection products, policyholder claims will sometimes exceed pricing expectations and cause an earnings shortfall. For example, this quarter, we had below planned underwriting results in Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits and a reserve increase on group disability contracts in Australia. While protection-oriented businesses may miss earnings from time to time, we believe that these businesses pose modest balance sheet risk relative to more market-sensitive, capital-intensive products.","Furthermore, returns are very attractive in a number of our protection lines of business. For example, Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits is one of our highest-return segments, even with less favorable underwriting performance of this year.","For emerging markets, political factors will sometimes generate earnings headwinds. Recent examples would be the potential loss of future earnings related to proposed changes in Poland's pension system, which we discussed on the second quarter earnings call and fiscal developments in Mexico, which John Hele will discuss later on this call.","We're willing to accept political risk in emerging markets because we believe this risk is diversifiable and because the products sold in these markets generally have a more favorable risk return profile and growth outlook than products sold in developed markets. Importantly, a balanced approach to risk should produce better and more predictable free cash flow, which is a critical driver of shareholder value.","Next, I'd like to provide a brief update on U.S. regulatory matters, which impact the level and timing of capital management. As we discussed last quarter, MetLife remains under Stage 3 review by the Financial Stability Oversight Council for a potential designation as a non-bank systemically important financial institution, or SIFI. While we do not believe that MetLife is systemically important, we continue to make the case to policymakers that applying bank-centric rules to the business of insurance will constrain our ability to issue guarantees and increase the cost of financial protection for consumers.","In light of Prudential Financial's decision not to challenge its SIFI designation in federal district court, I suspect you may be wondering what MetLife intends to do. Although it is too early for us to make that decision, we were not ruling out any of the available remedies under Dodd-Frank to contest a SIFI designation.","Finally, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing plans for our December investor call. We are taking a different approach this year and will no longer give earnings per share guidance. Instead, the call will provide information that should improve the market's understanding of MetLife's businesses, including our outlook over a multi-year period. I do not believe that we should continue with the practice solely because it is the way it has always been done.","After careful study and deliberation, we have determined the EPS guidance no longer makes sense. Others in the financial services industry seem to share this view. Half of our North American peers and most of our global peers do not provide earnings guidance. In addition, the largest U.S. banks do not provide earnings guidance.","Our new approach for the December call will be consistent with our internal emphasis on long-term strategic and financial goals and then should shift the discussion to our business model, which is the real driver of shareholder value over time. Also, it is difficult to predict earnings for life insurers with large capital-market-sensitive businesses. So guidance has historically had limited value. While we are rebalancing our business mix, we will still have meaningful exposure to the capital markets for the foreseeable future. We will continue to provide the investment community with our view of run rate earnings along with important earning sensitivities. In addition, we will increase transparency by expanding our discussion of key financial metrics and business drivers. In total, all of these inputs should create a more informed view of MetLife's future prospects.","In closing, let me say that after several consecutive quarters of solid performance and results this year that are above plan, we feel very good about our fundamental business prospects.","With that, I will turn the call over the John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?","John C. R. Hele","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our third quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.","As Steve noted, MetLife reported operating earnings of $1.5 billion, up 6% year-over-year and operating earnings per share of $1.34, up 2% year-over-year. This quarter included 3 notable items. The first relates to our group insurance business in Australia. As Steve referenced, we have strengthened group total and permanent disability, otherwise known as TPD, claim reserves in Australia, which reduced operating earnings by $57 million net of reinsurance or $0.05 per share. Our decision to increase the TPD reserve by 45% this quarter was based on the review of our own recent claims experience and consideration of the worsening trend for the industry. We believe there are several factors driving this trend, including economic stress, increased claim size and greater awareness of benefits.","The second notable item resulted from our annual actuarial assumption review, which we accelerated from the fourth quarter to the third quarter to be in line with our annual goodwill testing. While there was no charge related to goodwill, there was a modest above- and below-the-line impact from the assumption review. The portion related to operating earnings was a favorable $28 million or $0.03 per share. However, the total impact, including the favorable impact to operating earnings, was a $69 million reduction of net income.","Although we had various assumption changes in the quarter, the only meaningful update was in retail annuities. Assumption changes in retail annuities resulted in a $41 million increase in operating earnings and a $48 million reduction of net income. The positive impact above the line primarily relates to an increase in some of our persistency projections and lower expenses. Higher persistency is a positive for operating earnings because of higher expected base contract fees but can be a negative for net income because of potential claim from living benefit guarantees.","We have made no further changes to our GMIB dynamic lapse function, and emerging experience is still consistent with the change that we made last year.","The third notable item was in our P&C business. We had lower-than-budgeted catastrophe losses of $14 million after tax and a favorable prior year reserve development of $7 million after tax. Therefore, the total benefit to operating earnings was $21 million or $0.02 per share.","Turning to our bottom line results. Third quarter net income was $942 million or $0.84 per share and included net derivative losses of $355 million after tax. The net derivative loss in the quarter was driven primarily by 3 items that we consider to be either noneconomic or a cause of asymmetrical accounting treatment: number one, an increase in interest rates; number two, changes in foreign currencies, principally the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British pound and euro; and number three, the MetLife own credit impact associated with our VA program.","Changes in interest rates in the quarter contributed about 60% of the net derivative loss, while foreign currency and MetLife's own credit impact combined for most of the remaining balance. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, was $47.99 at September 30, up 2% from $47.20 at June 30.","Turning to margins. Underwriting was mixed but generally unfavorable again this quarter. The mortality ratio in group life was 90.3% in the quarter, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 88.1% and at the top end of the target range of 85% to 90%. The less favorable mortality was driven by large claims in Group Universal Life and Variable Universal Life.","The mortality ratio in retail life was 73.1%, better than our expectation and the 91.3% ratio in the third quarter of 2012. This result was due to favorable direct claims experience in both variable and universal life and traditional life. However, the benefit accrued more to reinsurers than MetLife in the quarter because of the nature of the claims. We expect both the direct mortality ratio and the percentage of claims reinsured to return closer to plan levels in the fourth quarter.","As a reminder, useful rules of thumb are a 1% point change in the mortality ratio equals to a quarterly operating earnings impact of $8 million to $10 million for group life and $2 million to $3 million for retail life. Retail life underwriting margins in the quarter were not as favorable as the direct mortality ratio would suggest, partially because of the reinsurance impact and adverse experience in individual disability.","The non-medical health benefit ratio was 90.5%, up 2 percentage points from the prior year quarter of 88.5% and just above the top end of the targeted range of 86% to 90%. The primary driver for the increase in the ratio was weaker underwriting results in group disability due to higher severity. Incident rates were generally in line with the prior year quarter and plan. As a reminder, a 1-percentage-point change in the non-medical health benefit ratio equates to an operating earnings impact of approximately $10 million on a quarterly basis.","In our P&C business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 92.6% for retail and 90.2% for group. Year-over-year results were better in retail and somewhat weaker in group. Overall, as mentioned earlier, catastrophes were lower than budget in the quarter by $14 million or $0.01 per share. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 86.3% in retail and 87.5% in group.","Next, let me turn to investment spreads. As Steve noted, investment spreads have remained strong and within the range of the past few years. However, we did experience a sequential decline in 3 of the 4 product spreads reported in our quarterly financial supplement, with the simple average declining 23 basis points including variable investment income and 8 basis points excluding variable investment income.","In the third quarter, pretax variable investment income was $236 million or $153 million after DAC and taxes, slightly below the midpoint of our 2013 quarterly guidance range. Variable investment income was down from the second quarter, which was at the top end of our guidance range, primarily due to weakness in hedge fund performance and a return to more normal private equity returns, partially offset by higher bond prepays.","With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 24.3% in the quarter versus 24.4% in the year-ago period. Excluding the impact of pension and post-retirement benefits and closeouts, the operating expense ratio was 23.6% versus 23.8% in the year-ago period. We are pleased with this performance, as it reflects progress in our strategic goal to reduce gross expenses by $1 billion and net expenses by $600 million.","Through 9 months of 2013, gross expense saves were $394 million, while net saves were $269 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $28 million and onetime cost of $97 million.","I will now discuss some of the business highlights in the quarter and focus on areas where our results seem to differ from analyst expectations. Retail operating earnings were $659 million, up 34% versus the prior year quarter, driven by strong performance in both life and other and annuities.","Life and other reported operating earnings of $237 million, up 16% year-over-year. The primary drivers were lower DAC amortization and lower policyholder dividends. These are partially offset by less favorable catastrophe loss experience from an exceptionally good prior year quarter and lower variable investment income.","Annuities reported operating earnings of $422 million, up 47% versus the prior year quarter. The drivers included higher fees from separate account growth, resulting from strong investment performance, lower ongoing DAC amortization and favorable assumption unlockings. The initial market impact was favorable to operating earnings by $27 million after tax, which was $3 million less in the prior year quarter. As a forward-looking rule of thumb, a 1-percentage-point change in the S&P 500 equates to approximately $5 million to $7 million of operating earnings annually.","Variable annuity sales were $2.7 billion in the quarter, down 41% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. We expect full year VA sales to be at the top end of our $10 billion to $11 billion target. As of September 30, the net amount of risk for all of GMIB riders was down to $931 million, which compares to $2.5 billion at March 31 as presented at our May investor day. The net amount of risk for all GMIB Max contracts is only $2 million. In addition, only 7.3% of total GMIB contracts were in the money as of September 30, which compares to 17.9% at March 31, which is also presented at investor day.","Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits reported operating earnings of $226 million, down 20% year-over-year. The primary drivers were weaker underwriting results in group life and disability, higher expenses due to reinvestment in the business and less favorable catastrophe experience versus a favorable result a year ago.","Latin America reported operating earnings of $133 million, down 13% year-over-year and 8% on a constant currency basis. These results reflected the impact of favorable onetime adjustments, particularly in the prior year, higher expenses due to sales initiatives in the region and weaker underwriting results partially offset by net favorable market impacts. Premium fees and other revenues were up 14% year-over-year and 17% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth across the region. Sales growth was only 4%, but excluding 1 large group case in the prior year quarter, growth would have been 11%.","I want to comment on 2 topics that are important to consider for future earnings for Latin America: Provida and fiscal policy changes in Mexico. As Steve noted, we closed on the acquisition of Provida. With the completion of the tender offer on October 1, we currently own 91.4% of Provida at a cost of approximately USD 1.85 billion. Provida is performing well and in line with our expectations. Our ownership percentage is less than we had modeled, but this is fully offset by a lower opportunity cost of funds.","In Mexico, we are assessing the potential impact from fiscal policy changes currently being implemented. We believe the annual impact could dampen operating earnings by approximately $25 million.","Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $257 million, down 1% year-over-year but up 7% on a constant currency basis. Operating earnings were dampened by the previously discussed reserve strengthening in Australia and an unfavorable impact from the assumption review, partially offset by a tax benefit in Japan. Adjusting for these items, operating earnings were 17% driven by business growth and lower expenses. While we were pleased with the underlying performance in the quarter, we do not believe that 17% is a sustainable growth rate. As anticipated, surrender activity of non-yen fixed annuities in Japan returned to a more normal level in the third quarter. We believe a more normal level of quarterly earnings for Asia is approximately $280 million to $300 million.","Finally, in EMEA, operating earnings were $85 million, up 37% year-over-year and 28% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by business growth across the region, especially in Russia, Poland and Turkey, lower expenses and certain onetime items. This was a strong quarter for EMEA. A more normal level of quarterly earnings is in the low to mid-$17 million range.","Premium fees and other revenues were 8% -- were up 8% year-over-year and 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong growth in Russia and the impact of the Aviva acquisition in the third quarter of 2012. Overall sales growth for EMEA was 10%, driven by emerging market growth of 21%, most notably in the Gulf, Turkey and Russia.","Now I will discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.8 billion at the end of the third quarter. As you know, we report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the third quarter.","In Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 913% as of the second quarter of 2013.","For our domestic insurance companies in the third quarter, preliminary statutory results are operating earnings of $720 million and net income of $475 million. Statutory operating earnings were down $382 million from the prior year, primarily due to higher taxes of $365 million in the current quarter as a result of various tax adjustments.","For the first 9 months of 2013, statutory operating earnings were $2.1 billion and statutory net income was $1.2 billion. Total adjusted capital for our domestic insurance companies is expected to be approximately $27.6 billion as of September 30, down 5% from December 31, primarily due to dividends paid of $1.3 billion, unrealized losses essentially offset net income.","And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with Dowling & Partners.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","I had a question about Health Care Reform. Wondering how meaningful of an opportunity you think that could be for MetLife over the next several years and also, what your strategy is to participate in private exchanges.","William J. Wheeler","Ryan, it's Bill Wheeler. So there's a lot of aspects to Health Care Reform, so I'd break it down in a couple of ways. One is we are -- our dental product is on a number of the state exchanges that are up now or selling now. Obviously, our sales there are pretty nominal. But -- and we have also put our products, not just dental but a broad array of products, on a number of private exchanges. I think we are up to 10 private exchanges. And our expectation has been for a number of years is that employers are going to start and employees are going to start using these exchanges to buy benefits and to give employees more choice in the type of voluntary worksite benefits they provide. And so a big strategy for us, which we've laid our previously, is to expand our product set and our enrollment capabilities in the voluntary worksite aspect of the business. And so we think that is a big opportunity for us and a big source of growth in our group area. Now I guess, I will also just say that the last thing that I think is happening right now is, of course, the Affordable Care Act is having a lot of difficulty, and I think one interesting aspect is I believe that you're going to see a lot of employees really start to value their employee benefits and the benefits they get from their employer and I think be -- and value them more highly. And I think in the long run, that's going to be a really good thing for our group business.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","And just a follow-up, in addition to your typical suite of group and voluntary benefits, will you be looking to be a bigger player in supplemental health as well?","William J. Wheeler","Well, yes. So labels are -- let's be careful. So we definitely will be a bigger player in critical illness and accident and health products. But I would -- the true med supp kind of products, I don't think we're going to be entering.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to first touch just on VA. Obviously, you and the industry have done a lot in terms of managing down sales, done everything from increasing fees, lowering guarantees, et cetera, and yet, these things still kind of seem to stick and sell. And you just saw a competitor look at doing a reinsurance transaction or announce a reinsurance transaction to keep capacity in the market. I'm wondering if this is something you would consider potentially as you continue to work on customer centricity.","William J. Wheeler","Chris, it's Bill again. Sure, I mean, I think we'll look at this transaction. I mean, this is -- and we obviously read that announcement with interest. And the devil's in the details and we will try to understand the details of that trade. Look, we always look at ways to manage our capacity and capital. But I think Steve made it pretty clear earlier in the call. We've -- we're going to rebalance the risk profile of MetLife, and that means we are going to stay in the variable annuity business, but we're going to run it a certain way. And I think that's -- and I think that way is working.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one for Steve and maybe Chris. If you can comment just on the operations in Japan. I guess, there's been some increased press and chatter around maybe some elevated turnover of management, certainly changes in commission structures that you guys have talked about in the past. So I just wanted to kind of get your assessment of the strategy for the reason -- in the region and what you guys are doing to kind of continue to accelerate growth while maintain good returns.","Christopher G. Townsend","Sure. Let me take that. It's Chris Townsend here. So first of all, in terms of the management changes, yes, we have changed some of the management there. The -- Sachin Shah is our CEO of that business. He's been the COO of that business for approximately 3 years, and has a very deep life insurance background and has good tenure in Japan as well. The bench in Japan is very deep, and we supplemented that in terms of some of the new areas we're looking to build capability in with some strong external hires. So we're very comfortable with the management team we have in Japan. If you look at the business overall in Japan, we've said to you for a number of quarters that our bank sales are soft given the fact that the Nikkei and TOPIX have performed so well, and all that volatility in the yen, what that's led to is rather depressed sales in the fixed annuity foreign currency products. That's actually bounced back this third quarter now. Bank sales were up about 54% sequentially, but they're still down 20% year-on-year. And what that's meant, overall, is that Japan is down on sales about 4%. What I would say is that A&H sales in Japan are up, and across the region, we're up about 9% on A&H. So again, we feel pretty good in terms of the mix of the business we've got. The A&H portfolio overall is competitive. You'll hear that from a number of others, who are approaching this market, but we feel that the deep experience we've got plus that multi-channel platform, which is rather unique for us in the Japanese market, gives us a great ability to grow that business very well in terms of the bundling ratio we have across the other life products.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just new business returns, any sense of kind of what you're pricing for or seeing?","Christopher G. Townsend","Yes, we're pricing for a 15% EC ROI we -- as we've told you a number of times before, and that's across the portfolio. So clearly, there's going to be some products, which perform better than others in different cycles, and we're continuing to tweak that portfolio in line with some of the volatile macroeconomic conditions. So as interest rate changes, reserve rate changes, we'll tweak our portfolio. But overall, our portfolio is exceeding the 15% EC ROI.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question for Steve, just the decision to discontinue the explicit earnings guidance. Can you give a little more color behind that decision in terms of why discontinue it? And relatedly, are there any meaningful changes to the growth rates that you had previously discussed, either domestically or internationally, as we think about '14, '15. Because that's obviously a logical question as part of what's behind us, the fact that the news may not be as good.","Steven A. Kandarian","We really looked at all the literature that was written -- that has been written on this issue of giving earnings guidance. There's some literature that says you should give it. There's a lot of literature that says you shouldn't give it, and they give kind of the pros and cons and so on. But the bottom line really from our perspective was if earnings guidance really provides information that's useful in investors and analysts better understanding our business and earnings for the coming year, then we should give it. And our view was because of the capital market sensitivity of our overall business and the impact of things like the equity market returns, this wasn't all that useful to people to get our earnings guidance on a specific point or number for EPS in the coming year. We thought that if we gave you further information, more information on other parts of our business and sensitivities, that people could build their own models based upon their view of, let's say, what the S&P 500 will do next year or what interest rates will be or other factors that could influence the short-term earnings of MetLife. There is some literature that says that those who drop earnings guidance do so in some cases because their prospects aren't as bright as they had been or they're going through some transition in their business model. That is not the case for us. This really was a fresh look at should we give guidance or not give guidance as if we were just starting off as an IPO. Would you -- should you really do this in our business or not? We looked at our peers, like we said in the script earlier, that it's pretty split in the United States in terms of providing guidance in our industry. In Europe, most don't give guidance in our industry. And then other financial institutions, especially the larger banks that have the same kind of sensitivity to capital markets, virtually none of them give guidance. They give a lot of components that allowed people to come up with their own numbers. We just thought that was a better way to do it, and we thought if we were starting off today fresh, that's what we would do.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Understood. Yes, appreciate that response. The next question I had is for John or Bill. The higher severity of claims in group life and disability, is there a chance that this might continue, that this might be a sign of some pricing actions you need to take? Any clarity there?","William J. Wheeler","Tom, it's Bill. Well, when we have a chance to reprice cases, we obviously look at the individual experience, and I'm there'll be some cases we'll reprice and raise prices. That's just the nature of the beast when the -- in the pricing cycle. But because the underwriting results were really about incidents, not -- or really about severity and not incidents, that kind of tells you it's more than likely more random and -- than expectations. And we do see this occasionally. I guess, we feel that -- and it was severity, higher severity in both group life and disability. So I think we feel that it's a sort of normal underwriting volatility if you will and doesn't cause us to think that we're going to have to significantly change our pricing expectations.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just one last one. The Mexico, the comment on fiscal policy changes having a $25 million negative impact, is that going to impact your goodwill related to that some prior acquisitions at all?","John C. R. Hele","Yes. Tom, this is John. No, we don't believe this would impact our goodwill.","Operator","Next we'll go to the line of John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I just have a question for you on the regulatory front. So recently the Fed, among some others, issued a proposal that looks like it's going to further increase the liquidity requirements for some of this -- or for the systemic banks. But that proposal, at least by our read, seems to specifically exclude the -- this requirement for SIFI insurance companies. And I guess, my question is twofold. Is that consistent with your read as well that it would exclude insurers? And second, do you think it's going too far if we read into that exclusion of insurers and increasing recognition by the regulators of some of the key differences between traditional banks and insurance companies at least in terms of balance sheet and liquidity profiles? I guess, I'm asking, Steve, you mentioned continuing to sort of work to educate regulators, so do you feel like you're making any real progress in that front?","Steven A. Kandarian","We've read that rule as well, and that is our interpretation that designated non-bank SIFIs in the insurance space would not be subject to that rule. That's our interpretation of what we read. It's consistent with what you said. And in terms of what we should we interpret from that, I think it's a positive. I don't want to read too much into it, but clearly, regulators are looking at the differences in the business model of banking versus the business model of insurance. There are significant differences. Banks rely upon much more on short-term funding. They have more asset liability mismatches as part of their business model, and we rely upon largely longer-term funding sources. Overall, we match our assets and our liabilities and just kind of run on the bank issues that can exist in a crisis situation don't really apply to the insurance industries. I think there's becoming greater recognition of the differences in the business model between our 2 industries in Washington. And we worked hard as others have as well in the industry to try to provide insights and help in Washington in terms of understanding our business model, and we have to all acknowledge that insurance has been regulated now for decades at the state level, not the federal level. So they're starting from a point in terms of overseeing our industry that's fairly new for them. So it's understandable that there is kind of a education process going on. I think this is a positive sign, but again, I don't want to read too much into it.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, I understand. And then I just have one question on pension closeouts. Given, obviously, some great equity market strengths and good investment performance and at least here recently, some slightly higher longer-term rates, it looks like funding status sort of across of the Fortune 500 defined benefit pension plans has really gotten much, much better. I'm just wondering, maybe for Bill, if that's helping to improve the dialogue and the opportunity set and what your outlook is there.","William J. Wheeler","Well, yes, with regard to pension closeouts, I don't think there's any doubt that the environment is getting better. And so -- and we see that in our, what I would call, our normal business, new business pipeline. It's growing. It's -- in terms of the amount of the transactions that are out there to do. But they're not jumbo deals. I mean, the jumbo deals are -- I mean, obviously, by their very nature, they're kind of one-off, and we don't have visibility on big jumbo deals right now. But I would say the more traditional smaller cases, the pipeline is large. And so we -- our expectation is, is that there's going to be more volume there.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. So -- and that's what I was sort of most curious about, as these funding gaps sort of get closer and closer to 0, or at least lower, with company CFOs and Treasurers essentially decide, \"Hey, look, this is getting much better. We don't need to pursue this.\" Or would they go the other way, and it sounds like you're saying it goes the other way.","William J. Wheeler","I think so. We're seeing a number of transactions. Sizes are getting a lot little bigger. There's clearly a lot of activity.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Mark Finkelstein with Evercore.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Wanted to ask a question about the annual assumption review. John, I think you talked about, particularly on the VA business, a good guide above the line and a $90 million kind of hit below the line. I was wondering if you could just expand on really what drove maybe the $90 million. And I assume it was the lapse rate assumption. And does it in any meaningful way change kind of the all-in economics of the in-force VA block in your view?","John C. R. Hele","This assumption review, we included some GMWBs that we have and some LWG,, and we are now more experienced on those and looked at the lapses and installed a lapse function closer to what we did a year ago for the GMIBs. We didn't have enough experience on this block until this year on that block, and so it drove the same sort of structure where you saw more persistency expected over time, which drives higher core fees in the business. So you amortize over longer period of time, but then you have higher cost of the benefit below the line, which is where the fees, the rider fees for these benefits feed below the line into net income to match against the derivative hedging that we do against it. So we try to match the revenues in net income with the costs there, and that's why there's a higher net present value of future costs for those withdrawal benefit costs.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I guess, any change in how kind of how you view the economics of the business?","John C. R. Hele","No, I mean, this changes it a little bit, but in terms of the overall book, we view the new business as well priced. the older book needs capital and has a lower ROE than the new business. I would like to point out that in this whole assumption review across the U.S., there wasn't any change to our thinking of long-term interest rates, and we did adjust our maintenance expenses in the retail annuity business. We're a little lower. We've got a larger book, and that helped a little bit. The other major assumption that we haven't looked at yet that we spoke about at investor day is what we do with annuitization rates and we still -- although those are favorable, we haven't made any assumption changes on those yet. We're leaving that. We need some more time before we would think about changing those.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Just a quick question on the Australian business. I guess, when you talked about Mexico, you talked about a $25 million potential kind of hit to earnings going forward. You took a charge in Australia similar to what others have seen. I'm just curious what the delta on earnings of the Australian block kind of from what you've experienced to what you'd expect going forward will be.","John C. R. Hele","We don't expect a dramatic change to the ongoing profits in Australia. That makes $20 million, $30 million a year. And we did a reserve charge on this business. This business has been around for a while. It's a rider to people's pension savings programs, and there's been an industry change in the incidents in this business. We only had a few cases, a handful of cases where we've had to adjust. And 2, in particular, drove most of the reserve change. We've done an extensive work on this. It's been reflected across the industry, and we set the reserves appropriately.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So the $20 million to $30 million of contribution should still hold going forward essentially?","John C. R. Hele","Yes.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just had a question on spreads and thinking about kind of the modest declines on a adjusted basis. Corporate Benefit Funding, that's been a segment that's been a positive offset there. Could you just remind us sort of the liability and asset structure of Corporate Benefit Funding in terms of why spreads there have positively increased over the last 4 or 5 quarters?","William J. Wheeler","Sure. So Corporate Benefit Funding, the liabilities are very long, and they're often fixed in terms of the interest rate assumptions that are embedded in the liability. So it's a very fixed-rate liability, and it's long. So the way the target investment portfolio there would have more variable investment income in it, more private equity investments, real estate, et cetera, so if those investments perform, which they have, obviously, and we've had outsized performance in that particular part of the portfolio, it will do well. The other thing, too, is the only place where -- so we have the ability to invest very long and obviously, match quite well, and I think that's why that portfolio holds up much better than others, which I think are shorter-term liabilities.","John C. R. Hele","I'm going to add to that because we have quite a deal of assets in here, we often use this for securities lending programs. And so far this year, we've had a pretty steep yield curve on the short end, and that's benefited the additional benefit we get from securities lending in this portfolio. So that's a function of just the very steep yield curve on the short -- on the very short end.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just in terms of thinking about the volatility on the adjusted spread, is that mostly from bond prepays, this is looking across the 4 different units? Or are there other elements that could cause the adjusted spread that you now provide us to bounce around?","Steven Jeffrey Goulart","It's Steve Goulart. Just on -- if you look at the quarter, John went through some of the details on VII, but -- so we did see hedge funds and private equity kind of returning to normal or even lower than planned. But bond prepayments have been strong for the year and particularly for the quarter. And again, because of the process, the time it takes to complete a prepayment, we actually have pretty good insight into what the fourth quarter will look like as well. And so I think we're anticipating prepayments to be a good contributor to our of VII for the fourth quarter and why we'll probably be near the top of the expected range then as well.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First question for John on holding company cash. I think you said $4.8 billion down from $6.5 billion in the second quarter. I'm guessing most of that is the Provida payment. Just wondering, as you look across the fourth quarter, should we expect any big pluses and minuses with respect to the holding company cash.","John C. R. Hele","We expect to be at the high end of our range we gave you on investor day. So you're pretty close there.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And is there anything in particular that's sending you to the high end of the range or just better earnings?","John C. R. Hele","No, there's -- no big -- there's some plusses and minuses always we have in cash in the company of this size, so it just -- it trends along. With dividends paying out, we have cash coming in. So it should end up to be at the high end of our range we had.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, more of a philosophical question for Steve on the divided. Obviously, earlier this year, you increased your dividend, I think, to a payout ratio of around 20%. As we think about what -- how you're thinking about dividend growth going forward, should we anticipate that, that dividend will probably grow in line with earnings, meaning you'll kind of be at a stable payout ratio? Or do you anticipate that, that payout ratio might start to climb in the future?","Steven A. Kandarian","Suneet, Our goal is to increase dividends at a fairly steady pace over time along with our earnings. But as we've mentioned before, because of the uncertainty around regulation, we have to take into account whatever it is we learn from potential new capital rules that might apply to MetLife, in fact, into our consideration, in our judgment in terms of how to handle dividends going forward.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last question, I wanted to follow up on, I think, one of Tom Gallagher's questions that I'm not sure you answered about the -- anything changing in terms of the guidance. I guess, if I think back to November of 2011 when we did the interest rate discussion, you talked about sort of an 8% earnings growth rate in a normal environment, maybe 4% excluding -- in a low-interest-rate environment. I know we're going to get a lot more detail in December in terms of sensitivities, but at a high level, would you argue that, that guidance would still be appropriate, particularly given some of the changes you've made in the U.S. business around shrinking the variable annuity business and making some adjustments on the UL with the no lapse guarantee?","Steven A. Kandarian","Well, we're on track in terms of our strategy that we've outlined a number of times to you. In terms of specifics around guidance, we'll provide that shortly in the December call.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I had a couple of questions. First, on the assumptions amendment embedded in your Australia charge, you took a pretty large charge. But what gives you the comfort that you're adequately deserved there? And the reason I'm asking is other companies have taken similar charges as well, some before you guys, and in many cases, they've taken repeated charges. So -- and then secondly, you mentioned the $20 million -- $25 million impact from the fiscal changes in Mexico. Can you just discuss this in a little bit more detail and the potential steps that you could take, if there are any, to mitigate the impact?","John C. R. Hele","Jimmy, this is John. So this has been an industry trend, and of course, some reinsurers who can see across the whole industry reacted last quarter. As I said, we only had a handful of cases, although they were larger cases where we've been looking at this trend. So we've studied it very carefully. We've benefited from speaking to the reinsurers and thinking about this across the board. We've done extensive studies on this, and we believe we're adequate -- adequately reserved. However, if things change again in the future, you can always -- you may have to relook at it again if trends change from where they are. But we believe we've captured the current trends underway in Australia, in this area.","William J. Wheeler","Jimmy, it's Bill. With regard to Mexico, what's going on there is they -- the Mexican Congress has been going through a series of fiscal reforms or approving a series of fiscal reforms announced by the Mexican President, Pe\u00f1a Nieto. And I guess, I would say that we believe some of those changes with regard to taxes, we can mitigate. And some, we probably will not be able to. And the -- and so there are -- sort of our best guess, but we're not done with our work yet. Is it -- the impact might be $25 million after tax next year. And it's -- there's taxes on corporate income. There's taxes on dividends. There's other government programs with which we participate in that might be changed. So there's sort a package of things going on. And my guess is, is we'll give you a little more color on that in December.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then maybe if I could ask just one more on guidance, and I think there's always skepticism when a company withdraws guidance on whether it signals that things are getting worse, at least, in the short term. And you gave reasons, which are all valid, but -- especially that it's difficult predicting where the markets are quarter-to-quarter and having to adjust. So people could always use their own market assumptions anyway. So that was the case even when you were giving guidance before. And even though most of the banks don't give guidance, most insurance companies do. So I was wondering if there's anything more behind that. Maybe like, obviously, if a company does give guidance and sort of forces management to focus on the short term a little bit just to be able to hold the results up to that. So maybe discuss a little bit more why this is not a signal that things are getting worse, and there were something else besides the items that you mentioned that went into your decision?","Steven A. Kandarian","I think you hit one of the items that is worth highlighting, Jimmy, which is sometimes, giving a point estimate, even a range for next year's earnings, can make management teams and companies focus too much on short-term results. So our goal here is to increase shareholder value over time, and when I say, over time, I don't mean over a decade. I mean, over the next few years. And we had to just make sure that, that's our focus as a company. We're going to give a lot of inputs for all of you in December on our investor day call to construct your own models in terms of your assumptions around interest rates, equity values for next year and so on, to create your own number that you come up with. But as we look back and we look at our own earnings guidance numbers over the last decade and sort of how close were we to what the actual results turned out to be, what did The Street come up with on their own after we adjusted of guidance. And we weren't that great in terms of predicting, frankly. So our view as we're spending way too much time on factors that really are not within our control, like equity values in the coming year and so on. And rather than have that be such a big piece of the conversation, let's kind of shift it to our business model, our strategy, the things that really matter, the sensitivity analysis that we go through. So I think you'll see in December, we're going to give you more information you've gotten before from us, but you're just not going to get a point estimate for next year's earnings.","Edward A.

After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. In fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported third-quarter operating earnings per share of $0.62, which included a pre-announced non-cash charge of $0.70 per share related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned, UK-based investment subsidiary. Adjusted for this and other notable items, operating earnings per share were $1.36 in the quarter which compares to $1.51 on the same basis in the prior-year period.","Adjusted for notable items, operating return equity was 10.7% and tangible ROE was 13.1% in the quarter. While operating EPS adjusted for notable items, we're down this quarter, our nine-month results on the same basis were up 3% with an operating ROE of 11.5% and tangible ROE of 14.2%.","Macroeconomic factors, foreign currency, equity markets and interest rates explain the year-over-year decline in third-quarter operating earnings per share adjusted for notable items. Broad-based strength in the U.S. Dollar reduced operating earnings for international businesses by $0.09 per share with significant weakness in the Mexican and Chilean Pesos, the Aussie Dollar and the euro.","Equity market performance relative to the prior-year quarter hurt operating earnings by $0.04 per share. Most of the negative impact was in retail annuities. The poor equity market performance also hurt the co-investment related earnings from ProVida AFP.","The persistent low interest rate environment remains challenging and reduced operating earnings adjusted for notable items by $0.03 per share relative to the third quarter of last year.","Investment margins have been resilient in recent years as a result of affected asset liability management, low interest rate hedges, and variable investment income. However, we face ongoing headwinds from new money yields that are 100 basis points to 150 basis points below the portfolio yield and from the gradual expiration of derivative protection.","From a balance sheet standpoint, we believe low interest rates are a manageable risk. For example, we completed our annual actuarial assumption review in the third quarter and the negative impact from low rates on net income was less than $180 million. A key driver of this charge was an assumption change on how long it would take for the 10-year treasury yield to reach a normalized level. We are now assuming it takes 11 years for the 10-year treasury yield to increase to our normalized assumption of 4.5% versus three years previously.","Turning to regulatory issues, we recently received a clearance indication to date regarding the Federal Reserve's thinking on capital rules for federally regulated insurance companies. In a speech delivered in late September, Federal Reserve Board Governor, Dan Tarullo, commented on the importance of a liability side of insurance company's balance sheet when constructing capital rules.","He said, \"Traditional insurance liabilities argue for lower capital requirements that might be required for hypothetical bank holding a similar portfolio of assets.\" These are welcome comments made possible by the enactment of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act in December of last year.","At the same time, Governor Tarullo said the balance sheets of many large life insurers contain liabilities that he does not consider traditional. Our takeaway is that while the Fed clearly recognizes the difference between the bank business model and the insurance business model, we still need to see draft capital rules before we can draw any firm conclusions about the impact on our business.","On a parallel track, international regulators are developing capital rules for global systemically important insurers. Here too, the news is mixed. On October 5, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors released its proposal for higher loss absorbency capital requirements or HLA. While MetLife holds capital comfortably above the levels prescribed by the IAIS, we have two concerns with the methodology.","The first is that the required capital levels in the international framework are pro-cyclical and potentially volatile because they are based on a mark-to-market approach that ignores the ability of insurers to hold assets for the long term. The second is that the IAIS proposes to apply higher capital charges to so-called non-traditional, non-insurance activities. Certain products with guarantees such as variable annuities are deemed non-traditional while other products with similar guarantees sold by competitors elsewhere in the world are deemed traditional. This highlights the risk that MetLife has consistently identified in determining what is systemic that regulators will inadvertently pick winners and losers in the life insurance industry.","The good news is that the IAIS has said the higher loss absorbency rules will be subject to revision before the target effective date of 2019. In fact, the IAIS is launching a review this month of the definition of non-traditional insurance. It has said that any changes will flow through to the HLA rules.","Another regulatory issue MetLife is following closely is the Department of Labor's proposed fiduciary rule. As drafted, the rule would make it significantly more difficult for life insurance companies to sell variable annuities. MetLife has shared its concerns with the DOL in comment letters. And a majority of members in both the House and Senate had asked the department to make changes to the rule. In addition, several members of Congress are beginning to work on a legislative alternative to the DOL proposal which underscores the growing awareness that the proposal will harm consumers by reducing choice and limiting access to financial education and investment advice.","I would now like to comment on cash distributions to shareholders. As you know, on September 22, we increased our share repurchase authorization from $261 million to $1 billion. We are comfortable with this authorization given our current capital position which we continued to maintain above historical levels because of uncertain capital rules.","Since the announcement, we have repurchased $261 million of stock, including $107 million in the third quarter, and we plan to remain an opportunistic buyer of our shares. In the first nine months of 2015, our total payout to shareholders was $2.3 billion, with roughly an even split between share repurchases and dividends. This total payout equals approximately half of our nine-month operating earnings adjusted for notable items and is in line with our guidance of a 45% to 55% ratio of free cash flow to operating earnings. MetLife's philosophy remains unchanged. Excess capital belongs to our shareholders.","In my annual letter to shareholders this past March, I said that free cash flow generation has become an enterprise-wide imperative for MetLife, one that will form all of our major business decisions in the months and years ahead.","As mentioned during our second quarter earnings call, we've undertaken a granular analysis of the cash and capital characteristics of our business. This ongoing work is helping us improve our capital allocation process, which we expect will drive more value for shareholders over time.","In closing this morning, I want to provide an update on the management structure of our Americas region. MetLife is taking a deliberative approach to find the right leadership for the Americas. While our search continues, we have named Eric Steigerwalt as interim head of the U.S. business reporting to me. In addition to retail, Eric will oversee our other U.S. businesses: Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, Corporate Benefit Funding, and U.S. Direct.","Oscar Schmidt will continue in his role as head of our Latin America business, also reporting to me. Both are strong leaders focused on generating long-term value for MetLife's shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Steve and good morning. Today I'll cover our third quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses, and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.","Operating earnings in the third quarter were $705 million or $0.62 per share. This quarter included five notable items which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement or QFS.","First, we had a previously announced non-cash charge of $792 million or $0.70 per share related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.","Second, as a result of our annual actuarial assumption review and other insurance adjustments, we had an after-tax charge to operating earnings of $92 million or $0.08 per share. The total after-tax charge to net income was $210 million. Retail accounted for $228 million, partially offset by modest positive earnings impact in Asia and EMEA. The impact in retail was mainly due to the change in our assumptions to reflect the persistent low interest rate environment and our current view that rates will remain below normal levels longer than we had originally assumed. As you heard from Steve, we are now assuming that it takes 11 years for the 10-year treasury yield to reach 4.5% versus three years previously.","We've also lowered our long-term earned rate assumption for annuities from 5.25% to 5%. Our long-term earned rate assumption for life insurance is unchanged at 5.75%, and our long-term separate account return assumption remains 7.25%.","Third, variable investment income was $174 million after taxes and DAC, which was $37 million or $0.03 per share, below the bottom end of our 2015 quarterly guidance range. Fourth, we have favorable one-time tax items in the Americas, which increased operating earnings by $72 million or $0.06 per share. Finally, we had lower than budgeted catastrophe losses in favorable prior-year reserve development, which increased operating earnings by $21 million or $0.02 per share. In total, notable items included in operating earnings were $828 million or $0.73 per share.","Turning to our bottom line results: Third quarter net income was $1.2 billion or $1.06 per share. Net income was $492 million higher than operating expenses, primarily because of derivative and investment portfolio net gains. The derivative net gains were driven by lower interest rates and strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain currencies. The investment portfolio net gains were mainly the result of real estate sales.","The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $568 million related to asymmetrical and non-economic accounting after tax. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $51.11 as of September 30, up 3% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $42.21 as of September 30, up 6% year-over-year.","With respect to third-quarter margins, underwriting, primarily in the U.S., was less favorable than the prior-year quarter by $0.03 per share after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Retail life and other and property and casualty were the primary drivers of the year-over-year result.","Retail life's interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 53.4%, excluding a 4% point impact from the actuarial assumption review. The ratio was less favorable than the prior-year quarter of 51.0% on a comparable basis but within the expected range of 50% to 55%. Average net claims from large based policies were higher than the prior-year quarter but within the normal range of expectations. The group life mortality ratio was 86.1% or toward the low end of the expected annual range of 85% to 90%. The ratio is favorable to the prior-year quarter's 87.8% due to better claims experience.","The non-medical health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 80.7%, approximately in line with the prior-year quarter of 80.5% and within the targeted range of 77% to 82%. In property and casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 90.9% in retail and 97.7% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 84.0% in retail and 92.7% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting was unfavorable versus the prior-year quarter. We experienced higher non-catastrophe claim costs primarily due to higher frequency and severity in our auto business as well as higher catastrophes.","Turning to investment margins; the average of the four U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 202 basis points in the quarter, down 28 basis points year-over-year. Pre-tax variable investment income was $267 million, down $157 million versus the prior year quarter due to weak hedge fund performance and lower prepayment income. Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 172 basis points, down 13 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline as a result of the low interest rate environment.","With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 24.2%, unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 23.0%. There was an interest-related component of the non-cash tax charge that flowed through expenses. Excluding this item, the operating expense ratio was 21.4% or 160 basis points better than the prior year, primarily driven by strong pension closeout sales.","I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $523 million, down 33% versus the prior-year quarter; and down 10% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Life and other reported operating earnings of $183 million, down 50% versus the prior-year quarter and down 14% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were lower expense margins, less favorable underwriting primarily in P&C and lower recurring investment income.","Life and other PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 3% year-over-year as growth in the open block was more than offset by runoff of the closed block. Core retail life sales were up 36% year-over-year primarily driven by whole and term life.","Annuities reported operating earnings of $340 million, down 19% versus the prior-year quarter and down 8% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were less favorable initial market impact, higher expenses, and taxes. The separate account return was negative 6% in the quarter. Total annuity sales were $2.4 billion in the quarter, up 20% year-over-year.","We continue to see good momentum with our index-linked annuity Shield Level Selector and we expect this product to exceed $1 billion in sales this year. Also, our new VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, continues to gain acceptance in the market and drove VA sales to $1.8 billion this quarter, an increase of 15% year-over-year.","Group, Voluntary, & Worksite Benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $238 million, down 1% versus the prior-year quarter and essentially flat after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Business growth in the quarter was offset by less favorable underwriting in P&C primarily in the auto business.","GVWB PFOs were $4.4 billion, up 2% year-over-year. Sales were down 12% year-over-year as we continue to see an impact from increased competition in life and dental. Sales of voluntary products increased 24% due to growth in property and casualty.","Corporate Benefit Funding or CBF reported operating earnings of $326 million, down 17% versus the prior-year quarter and down 13% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key driver was lower investment margins.","CBF PFOs were $1.7 billion, up significantly year-over-year due to strong pension closeout sales in the quarter. Excluding closeouts, PFOs were down 15% due to lower structured settlement sales.","Latin America reported operating earnings of $176 million, up 44% in the prior-year quarter and 100% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, primarily Chile taxes, Latin America operating earnings were down 4% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were less favorable underwriting and unfavorable market performance, partially offset by growth in the region.","U.S. Direct which is included in Latin America's results had an operating loss of $7 million versus $15 million loss in the prior-year quarter reflecting lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $940 million, down 18% and essentially unchanged on a constant currency basis as growth in ProVida and Argentina was offset by lower single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile. Total Latin America sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis primarily due to direct marketing across the region, partially offset by lower 40%s (22:59) sales in Mexico and single premium immediate annuity sales in Chile.","Turning to Asian. Operating earnings were $338 million, up 9% from the prior year quarter and up 26% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 22% on a constant currency basis driven by favorable business growth, $21 million in investment income from a loan sale and an unusual low tax rate.","Asia PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 13% from the prior-year quarter but up 3% on a constant currency basis driven by higher A&H in Japan. Asia sales were down 10% on a constant currency basis due to two large group cases in Australia in the prior-year quarter. Excluding these cases, sales were up 6%. A highlight in the quarter was a 23% increase in Japan A&H sales as we continue to benefit from a refurbished product portfolio.","EMEA operating earnings were $66 million, down 15% year-over-year, but up 14% on a constant currency basis, adjusting for notable items in both periods. Operating earnings were up 25% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth, particularly in the Gulf and the U.K. and favorable tax items.","EMEA PFOs were $618 million, down 15% from the prior year period and down 1% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact from the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter, PFOs were up 4%. Total EMEA sales declined 8% due to strong employee benefit sales in the Middle East and the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter. Adjusting for these items, sales were up 3% driven by A&H, partially offset by lower than expected life and retirement sales.","I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.5 billion at September 30. The decrease from the previous quarter was driven primarily by the payment of our quarterly common dividend, interest expense, and share repurchases.","Turning to our capital position, we report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the third quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin was 959% as of the second quarter of 2015, which is the latest public data. For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary third quarter statutory results are an operating loss of approximately $900 million and a net loss of approximately $700 million. As previously disclosed on a statutory basis, the non-cash tax charge was $911 million in the quarter. Of this charge, $972 million (sic) [$792 million] (25:57) went to the statutory earnings and $119 million directly into surplus.","In addition, earnings were negatively impacted by the stock market decline in the third quarter. Our strategy is to under-hedge for smaller market moves and accept the resulting volatility while ensuring we have sufficient hedges to protect against extreme shocks. We estimate our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $29 billion as of September 30, which was comparable to December 31.","In conclusion, third quarter operating earnings had several notable items that negatively impacted results, and market factors were unfavorable relative to the prior year. However, quarterly volatility is to be expected. While we were short of analysts' expectations in the third quarter, we exceeded expectations in the first two quarters of the year. We are striving to create long term sustainable growth and value and improvement in our free cash flow generation and material increase in distributions to our shareholders highlight this commitment.","And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. One moment, please, for the first question. Your first question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Steve, I would like to start with the comment that you made about \u2013 and I guess it was a backward-looking comment how you were indicating you have returned roughly 50% of normalized GAAP earnings to shareholders through buybacks and common dividends. Is that a reasonable expectation going forward from here? Because you obviously still have uncertainty with regard to the lawsuit with the government and SIFI rules but is the plan in place that you have and the expectation that we should have that 50% type distribution while you are in this state of limbo?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Tom, let me answer you in one second. But John just wants to make a quick correction to his comments.","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. As I was going through my script, I said one number slightly backwards. Of the statutory charge in the quarter, of the $911 million of the charge, it's $792 million went to statutory earnings. I believe, and it was pointed out to me, I said $972 million. So it's $792 million went to statutory earnings and $119 million went directly into surplus","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Tom, things \u2013 obviously, I'm moving around as we hear from policymakers in Washington around the capital rules. As of now, there's no draft capital rules out for us to look at and consider with respect to our business. So while we thought these rules would be out well before now, we're still waiting. And our decision a couple years back was to begin returning capital to shareholders, excess free cash flow, and we built up what we believe is a good buffer but again, it's uncertain and we don't know how this will all play out. So right now it's a little bit of a judgment call. And we are in this year looking to return to shareholders the free cash flow that the business generated.","I think if nothing changes in the external world, that'd be the pace we'd be on going forward in 2016 as well but I have to put some caveats in here because there could be a change in the environment that we learn about at some point in the future but that is our current thinking.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. So the 50% if nothing else changed, let's say it continued to be delayed for whatever reason, you'd be comfortable with the 50% based on what you know today?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We'd be comfortable with what we're generating in terms of free cash flow and we are targeting at the 45% to 55% levels so assuming we achieve that, that would be a fairly good number to think about and if draft rules come out next year, that could impact our thinking, of course.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then the changes or the charges that you had this quarter related to both the tax item as well as the change in RBC coming from some adjustments to the variable \u2013 the onshoring of the variable annuity business, so the impact from that, would that affect the way you're thinking about returning capital and cash flow or no?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi. This is John. Our guidance of the 45% to 55% is still within the RBC and the tax charges that we've already spoken about.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then one last one if I could sneak it in, the cash flow project, can you comment on what should we be thinking related to this? I presume the goal is to move it higher but are we talking about, from the 45% to 55%, are we talking about potentially moving it meaningfully or do you think it's going to be very marginal in terms of where this might go?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Tom, we're in the process of finalizing our analysis on this so it's too early to say how that number would be impacted. But the goal clearly is to raise the number and we are looking at all of our businesses by product, by geography, by customer. There's a great deal of very granular analysis that's ongoing and we are looking at a number of factors as we think of our businesses including quicker paybacks on our products. So the goal here is to improve free cash flow and I should mention that companies that have undergone this process in the past and primarily in Europe took a number of years to go through this process. We are trying to condense that to a shorter period of time but it's not an exercise that one could go through in a couple of quarters.","So we'll have more to say about it clearly next year but you can be assured that we are working very hard on driving higher our free cash flow ratio and as we learn things along the way here with our analysis, we're making adjustments on an ongoing basis.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. So the first question I had is just on yours spreads. Even if we exclude the variable investment income, spreads came down a lot especially in the corporate benefit funding business I think they are 117 basis points versus almost 150 basis points in the second quarter and the third quarter of last year; so what drove the decline, and is this the normal base that you are looking to grow off of or was there something abnormal in the second quarter that would have pressured your results beyond the variable investment income impact?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Jimmy. This is John. So, CBF spreads, look in our quarterly financial supplement, do bounce around quarter to quarter. We had in December 2014, in our guidance call, said our spread outlook would be between 150 basis points to 170 basis points with 30 basis points to 40 basis points from VII, if you look at it for the nine months, we're at 173 basis points with 39 basis points from VII. But the third quarter was at the low end at 149 basis points with 32 basis points from VII, so you can see how this moves around quarter to quarter, a lot of VII second quarter. Remember we pointed out an accounting change that we did to also give a boost to the second quarter of CBF but within this guidance, it still makes sense for the 150 basis points to 170 basis points.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then on the $900 million statutory charge from foreign tax credits, I think you mentioned previously that the impact on your dividend capacity for 2016 would be around $90 million. Should we assume a commensurate impact in future periods as well beyond 2016?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","This is a one-time charge, remember statutory dividends are determined a year after the fact. The reason why it is not a larger impact is we are up against the lesser than rule of the New York which is dividends are the lesser of 10% of surplus or your earnings in the year. So this did affect as I said our statutory earnings, but it did not affect the dividend capacity for next year because we are bumping up against a 10% number, the 10% limitation.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you and just lastly on variable investment income, the weakness this quarter I'm assuming it's hedge fund driven and maybe the other private equity and prepayments were somewhat normal but maybe if you could give us some color on what drove the downside this quarter?","Steven J. Goulart - Chief Investment Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Jimmy. It's Steve Goulart. In looking at variable investment income for the quarter, most of the decline relative to plan in our range was in hedge funds. I think if you just look at what's happened in the market hedge funds had a pretty weak quarter and we saw it come through. I think John mentioned prepayments in some of his remarks but prepayments were still in line with plan, they were just down from a high quarter on a year-over-year basis. So it's really all about hedge funds and VII. And as we look forward to the fourth quarter we are comfortable that we will be back in the range that we have set out the $325 million to $425 million per quarter that we gave originally.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS. Please go ahead.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Just a question John, I was writing down numbers pretty quickly did you say \u2013 can you go over the stat earnings in the quarter again on an operating basis?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Happy to. Let me just look at that page. For our U.S. insurance companies, our statutory results were an operating loss of approximately $900 million and a net loss of approximately $700 million. And of course this has the non-cash tax charge, it was $911 million on a statutory basis, $792 million went through statutory earnings and $119 million directly into surplus.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","So if we think about that $900 million loss, so you got $792 million of it from the charge so then there is a $108 million loss beyond that. I mean is that \u2013 essentially are all the stat earnings being offset by the fact that you have under-hedged on the equity side?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, that was one of the major impacts and it's not under-hedged, we don't fully hedge on smaller market moves but we have a macro hedge that protects against larger market moves, so we're trying to be cost-efficient in how we do this. We're willing to take some statutory volatility quarter to quarter to have an economical return on this product line but we're well protected if larger shocks kick in.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then my second question for Steve I guess is, in the press release you talk about the ROE, ex AOCI and other FCTA of 10.7% and I know you don't give guidance on ROE but as we think about kind of the trajectory of this, does it feel like the ROE is sort of bottoming at this level or could we see some continued pressure on that ROE?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Suneet, obviously, the external pressures on us are significant and we've discussed that. I'd say in the near term given current interest rates and the macroeconomic factors, in that high 10%, 11% range is probably what we're looking at.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Steve, I wanted to return to your comments regarding Fed regulations specifically Tarullo's comments on non-traditional activities. I know earlier in the summer you spoke about funding agreements, commercial paper, securities lending and guaranteed investment contracts in terms of an area that the Fed may be looked closer at. If these were deemed non-traditional and were holding you up for the SIFI designation, how quickly would you be able to exit these businesses and would you consider doing that if it would have a substantial regulatory benefit?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Those are short duration businesses and liabilities. So we could move pretty quickly. What we would do is once the capital rules came out, we would look at the cost and benefits to the company overall and we have to make a decision based upon that analysis. So until then, it's hard to say what we actually would do but in the day, it ended up being a fairly straightforward analysis for us.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. And regarding variable annuities, do you have any hints if this is something the Fed considers non-traditional similar to how the international regulators are looking at it or is this something that the Fed has perhaps shown some comfort around?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi. Seth, it's John. The Fed has given no guidance as to what they're considering to be weighted in different ways. They're looking at all aspects of the insurance business and the industry is in discussions with them but they really have given us no indication at this time as to how they'll view any line of business.","Seth M. Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks for the comments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. With regard to the pushing out the long-term 10-year treasury rate assumption to 11 years from three years, what are the implications on that for future margins? It seems like it would be less of a drag going forward.","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Jay. When we say less of a drag, I mean, it's just a slope, takes longer. We think a GAAP charge in that today as you can see and then it just \u2013 the earnings flow through over time. So I guess maybe I could follow up if you clarify your question a little bit?","Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure. It seems that if the assumption was \u2013 previously it was going to be three years to get there and now we're talking 11 years, there might be less additions to reserves going forward? Is that \u2013 am I thinking about that the right way?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well it would be now set, if interest rates go up exactly according to this slope, then you'd have normal profits coming through and no changes to DAC amortizations. This is primarily a DAC change. You have less profits in the future, so you need to adjust your DAC today and the patterns go out in a consistent manner.","Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then on the \u2013 I guess, a follow-up on the ROE comment, if I plug in 11% return on equity, I guess, around $6.0 in earnings next year, that seems to be perhaps a little bit less than consensus was expecting. Any potential offsets to that that we should be thinking about?","Edward A. Spehar - Head of Investor Relations, MetLife, Inc.","Hi, Jay. Well as I'd like to remind you, we don't give forward guidance. We've given you our views and I guess you can do your calculations so thanks.","Jay H. Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on the higher P&C auto claims. It seems like you are experiencing the same issue some others in the industry are going through. Is this something that you'd expect to recur for a period of time before you can get rate increases pushed through?","Eric Thomas Steigerwalt - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut","Hi. It's Eric. We probably are. I think it's fair to say we're experiencing reasonably what the rest of the industry is. You've heard from other companies that they've been talking about more miles driven, as a result, higher accidents. You heard John say that overall our results frankly in both group and retail is slightly higher frequency and severity. So we're not sure if this is going to continue for quarters and quarters and quarters. We are all over price increases. When we feel we have to take them, as we have in this year, we will. And over time, we'll let you know what our decisions have been going forward. So right now, we don't see anything far out of line with what we've been expecting. But if we continue to see pressure, then you can be assured that we will take increases.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then for John; do you have any preliminary expectations for the impact of year-end statutory asset adequacy testing?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, that would be done at the end of the year. It depends on where interest rates end up and other factors. So I can't give you, I can't predict where interest rates will be at the end of the year. And that's one of the most sensitive points.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. I got it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Thank you. In the past you've talked about a potential present value GAAP hit from sustained 2% rates is I think $3 billion. Are there any changes to that expectation or should we just think about the rate adjustment this quarter of the approximately $180 million is just subtracting from that amount?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi. This is John. That would be correct. We view the changes we made this quarter were consistent within that overall guidance that we've given.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks. And then on Japan, just one question. You mentioned the third sector sales being up 23% this quarter. Can you comment on the competitive trends in that market and how long of a sales cycle you see for the new products that you introduced?","Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region","Yeah. Sure. Chris Townsend here. So we introduced those new products in the beginning of the fourth quarter last year. And as you can see, we've had pretty good growth right through the first three quarters of this year. So overall, third sector was up 23%. We've got a tough comparison coming up against the fourth quarter of 2014, but I think overall, the prior guidance we've given you in terms of sales in the third sector was that we would grow it mid to high single digits this year. Given the performance we've had so far, we can lift that guidance now to a full year at about 10% to 12%. So the new products are progressing really well. They give customers good choice. They're simple products, they got segmented pricing. And all four of our key distribution channels are up, so we feel pretty good about that third sector right now.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. I actually want to follow up on Erik's question on the assumption review. So looking at this $3 billion in present value that you had talked about in the past from the low interest rate environment forever and comparing it to the $180 million in losses we saw this quarter, I was under the impression in the past that you had expected to see a lot of the charges coming in the first three years to five years. And in that sense I was a little surprised to see a relatively small impact from the new assumption this quarter and just wanted to square the two.","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think what we had said before when we gave this guidance about $3 billion, most of it is in DAC. And as you change your assumptions, that tends to be immediate of course on your DAC amortization. There's also U.S. GAAP loss recognition testing that if you need to increase those, that's done over time. What I had said was I didn't expect to change assumptions immediately. To go right down to flat 2% forever would take some time for us ever to change our view on that as the world might change. Because for 10-year treasuries to remain at 2% forever means either no inflation or there's very little growth in the U.S. economy. We don't believe long term that that is the case, but we now believe it will take a lot longer to get there from where we are today. So that's the assumption change. And as I said, the calculations we have done are consistent with the prior year guidance that I've given.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay then that's helpful. And then turning back to P&C for a second, I was just wondering what was causing the more elevated or the greater deterioration, I guess, in group P&C versus retail, bearing in mind the industry trends that we're seeing in frequency and severity?","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Are you talking about \u2013 we didn't quite hear your question. Are you talking about the differential between group and retail? Was that part of your question?","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. That's right.","Steven Albert Kandarian - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, buried in there as we add a little IBNR change so that's why the subtlety of my previous answer might have been missed but if you think about it, if I were to normalize that IBNR change, I would say that the hit to group and retail was roughly the same and completely driven by, as we already said, miles driven, both frequency and severity in both businesses. So that's a little bit more of a normalized answer there.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kovac from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Mike E. Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. With the equity market volatility, clearly you saw the impact in the annuities segment for you and your peers. I am wondering if you can discuss some of the moving pieces particularly around how managed volatility products and your hedge program performed in the third quarter versus both your expectations and maybe some other market downturns?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Michael. This is John. As I said, the separate accounts were down about 6%. Our managed vol funds actually did a little better than that but were still negative. They were just around 4.5% \u2013 was about the amount for the target vol funds. So target vols are supposed to be better but to react in a quick quarter like this, it's harder for these so they did perform a bit better than what the S&P did which is down about 7% and our separate account returns in total were down about 6% but not flat or anything. It was a pretty rough quarter for the equity markets.","Mike E. Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then as you think about variable annuity sales going forward, I know you had guided to 50% and then 20% in this quarter came in about 15%. Any thoughts on the outlook?","Eric Thomas Steigerwalt - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, MetLife Insurance Company of Connecticut","Yeah, this is Eric. The number that I've been looking at \u2013 so you are quoting the pure variable annuity number. When I look at VAs and our Shield product, in the third quarter, we were up 26% and that is quite a good result. Our Shield sales continue to increase quarter-over-quarter, after quarter, sequentially and I think we are going to see the same thing generally in VAs. Certainly as we moved from 2014 \u2013 frankly from the 2012 through 2014 period of decreasing sales, 2015 was that inflection point and honestly very hard to project. So we are below what we had thought we would be able to do. There is a number of reasons for that. This quarter obviously volatility in the equity markets, state approvals throughout the year play a big part; certain key states came a fair amount later than we had thought they would. However at this point, sales are looking pretty good, the Flex product continues to take hold both in our captive channel and in all of our independent channels. So I am confident going forward that we will see good sales results, certainly double-digit sales results.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, everybody. A lot of questions asked and answered. You have a wide range for the loss expected for the corporate segment for the full year. I think if we make all of your normalizing adjustments you're around a $420 million loss but you have a range of I believe it was $550 million to $750 million. Can you give us some help on what end of that range or where in that range you expect to end the year given you have got just a few months left?","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'd still stick with that range. We have timing of preferred dividends now. We refinanced one of our preferred dividends and there's a gain this quarter because it's now a semi-annual dividend and it'll hit the fourth quarter so there's going to be some bumpy timing as we look quarter to quarter now. The old preferreds that we took out were quarterly dividends so it's smoother. The new piece that we did, it is a net savings to us by doing this but it'll be more bumpy.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay, that is helpful. And then I wanted to think about the \u2013 on a normalized basis the Asia segment has seen a reasonable amount of volatility in earnings for a business that I think should generally versus more of your capital markets sense of the businesses, I would expect it to be a bit more stable and predictable. That range is pretty wide on a quarterly basis. So just thinking about second quarter and third quarter here in particular, which one of those normalized numbers do you think is a better true indication of the earnings power of that business that you're annualizing?","Christopher G. Townsend - President-Asia Region","Hi. It's Chris Townsend here. We gave some guidance previously in terms of the range. It was a low single to sort of high single to low double digit earnings rates on a constant rate basis for Asia and we're still sticking with that in terms of the year for 2015. If you look at this quarter, for instance, obviously last quarter we had that very high one-off tax issue in Japan which threw the numbers out. But for this quarter, the constant rate growth is 26% and there's three main items in that. One is business growth which accounts for about 11% or 12% of that. One is favorable investment income of $21 million which is about 7% and then there's a couple of one-off tax items. So you should probably think about 310 to 320 (54:53) plus or minus 5% is the sort of average run rate for the Asia business.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","That's very helpful. Thank you, Chris.","Operator","And your final question today comes from the line of Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much for including me at the end here. A couple of quick questions. The increase in the number of years that you expect to be 10-year to reach 4% I think in the quarter from 3 years to 11 years strikes me as a major change. And so my question is at least it strikes me that way. So my question is, is this something that you have decided recently that you have been thinking about for a while? And given that interest rates have actually risen this year, treasury yields are flat but credit spreads have widened. As you think about what has happened in the world, what has prompted you to make what seems to be such a dramatic change in your outlook for interest rates? Thanks.","John C. R. Hele - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Eric. This is John. So obviously, where interest rates go long-term is very important for us in how we price, how we think and how we account for our business. We spend a lot of time thinking about 4.5% is still the correct long, long-term assumption and when I say long-term, we're putting liabilities in the books today that may last for 100 years given life expectancies of young people. So it's a very long-term assumption.","So that we think about that and the question is how fast will we get there and I would say currently and we talked to a lot of economists and academics on this and looked at the global economy, I think given this year compared to even a few years ago where there was much more optimism about the recovery of the world economies, we see a much slower growth for now and for the foreseeable future. And that's why we put a longer slope going out on the treasury rate which is the risk-free rate. When it comes to credit spreads, we really normalize those over the entire credit cycle and the fact they're up in the quarter or down in the quarter doesn't really impact our thinking over a very long-term cycle.","And we study credit spreads over decades and that's how we set these long-term assumptions and we're lucky we have experience of credit cycles over decades and have very good experience in this. So that's of our thinking and behind how we set these assumptions.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, John.","Operator","And there are no further questions.","Edward A.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Before we get started, I\u2019d like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements related to trends in the Company's operations and financial results and the businesses and the products of the Company and its subsidiaries.","MetLife's actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties, including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors section of those filings. MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.","With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations.","Edward A. Spehar","Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to MetLife's fourth quarter 2014 earnings call.","We will be discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income.","Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of Americas; Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer; Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA; and Chris Townsend, President of Asia.","During the Q&A session, in fairness to all participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.","Steven A. Kandarian","Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report solid results for the fourth quarter of 2014. Operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 2% from the fourth quarter of 2013. And operating earnings per share were $1.38, a 1% increase over the prior year period.","Full-year 2014 operating earnings were $6.6 billion, a 5% increase over 2013. In operating earnings per share we are up 2% from the prior year period. Operating return on equity was 12% for the full-year 2014 and tangible operating ROE was 15.2%. We believe tangible ROE is a better measure of the business returns for MetLife, because it excludes purchase accounting adjustments, primarily goodwill.","Our strong 2014 operating earnings came on top of above plan results for 2013. And we once again achieved an operating ROE at the low end of our 2016 target of 12% to 14%. I am even more pleased with MetLife's multi year performance which is a better measure of success in our long-term business.","MetLife's operating earnings increase at a compound annual rate of 12.1% from 2011 to 2014. Over the same period, operating EPS grew at a compound annual rate of 9.6%. Operating return on equity averaged 11.8% from 2012 through 2014, only slightly below the low end of 2016 target range.","Close to double-digit operating EPS growth, and 12% operating ROE, during the past three years our noteworthy accomplishments given that the 10-year treasury yield has averaged 2.2% since the summer of 2011 and our capital management actions have been conservative due to regulatory uncertainty.","With a 10-year treasury yield now at 2%, the low interest rate environment remains a challenge for life insurance -- for the life insurance business. Over the long-term, we believe the 10-year treasury yield should be 4% to 4.5%, based on the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% inflation target and expectations for long-term economic growth.","However, if interest rates remain low indefinitely, there would likely be a downward reset in return expectations across asset classes. Because equity returns are measured against a risk-free rate, the spread between MetLife's operating ROE and the 10-year treasury yield is a key metric.","From 2012 to 2014, the spread between MetLife\u2019s ROE and the 10-year treasury yield has averaged 9.6%. This compares favorably to an average spread of 6.9% from 2000 the year MetLife\u2019s initial public offering to 2011.","I\u2019d now like to comment on capital management. We repurchased $557 million of stock in the fourth quarter, completing the $1 billion share repurchase program we announced in June. For the year-to-date, we\u2019ve taken advantage of share price weakness and repurchased $693 million of the $1 billion program we announced in December. Given where the stock is trading today, it is likely that we will complete this $1 billion program soon.","While we continue to believe that MetLife is well capitalized, uncertainties surrounding potential capital rules makes us cautious about share repurchases in excess of $1 billion in 2015.","Turning to strategy. In 2014, we achieved two key elements of the strategy that we announced in May of 2012. We have derisked the retail business, which was a large part of our refocus the U.S business cornerstone of our strategy and we achieved net expense savings of $600 million pre-tax.","Our retail business has undergone a transformation during the past few years as we\u2019ve worked to reduce risk, create a more efficient operation, and improve the productivity of our distribution force. Derisking meant pulling back from the variable annuity market and exiting the lifetime secondary guarantee universal life market. Both of these initiatives had a material negative impact on sales.","We believe that 2014 will prove to be an inflection point for annuity sales and anticipate profitable growth in 2015 and beyond. In variable annuities I am pleased to announce that we will launch a new guaranteed lifetime minimum withdrawal benefit product, Flex Choice on February 17. The income benefit for this product meets the current expectations of the marketplace.","As we communicated on our December outlook call, we anticipate more than a 50% increase in total annuity sales in 2015. However, a projected rebound in annuity sales does not mean we are changing our overall strategy, which is to emphasize growth and less capital intensive protection oriented product lines.","First, the projected sales increase is from a low base. Variable annuity sales were $6.3 billion in 2014, down dramatically from $28.4 billion in 2011. Second, we estimate that retail annuities will count for a smaller percentage of enterprise capital over time.","Another key strategy milestone in 2014 was achieving our net expense savings targets of $600 million pre-tax. Our gross expense savings were $910 million last year close to the $1 billion strategy target. We are highly confident that we will realize the $1 billion gross savings target in 2015. The difference between gross and net savings in 2014 was a combination of one-time costs and reinvestment in the business. One-time costs will fade, but there will be a substantial increase in the reinvestment spend, which is largely technology related.","Expenditures that represent an investment in the future including much of the work we are doing to update our technology may reduce current period earnings, but are necessary to drive profitable growth over time.","Turning to regulatory issues, as you know MetLife has filed a legal challenge to its designation as a systemically important financial institution by the Financial Stability Oversight Council.","As I said when we filed the challenge last month, MetLife had hope to avoid litigation in light of the substantial and compelling evidence we presented to FSOC demonstrating the company is not systemically important. The Dodd Frank Act is clear that size alone does not make a company systemic and we believe FSOC erred in designating MetLife.","We believe we\u2019ve a strong legal case to present to the court and look for to its eventual decision. As a former regulator, I want to emphasize that MetLife as always supported robust regulation for the life insurance industry. It has operated under a stringent state regulatory system for decades. However, adding a new federal standard for just the largest life insurers, while retaining a different standard for everyone else will harm competition. This will drive up the cost of financial protection for consumers without making the financial system safer.","We believe the government should preserve a level playing field in the life insurance industry. If additional regulation is necessary, the government has a superior tool at its disposal, an approach that focuses on potentially systemic activities regardless of the size of the firm.","FSOC has already embraced this activities based approach for the asset management industry. Litigation takes time to resolve. In the meantime, the Federal Reserve is now one of MetLife\u2019s regulators. We are cooperating fully with representatives from the New York Fed, as they carryout their supervisory duties.","At the same time, we continue to discuss with regulators and lawmakers in Washington the need for capital rules that reflect the business of insurance. With the enactment of the Insurance Capital Standards Clarification Act in December, the Federal Reserve now has the flexibility it needs to properly tailor capital rules for life insurers.","In closing, let me reiterate MetLife's commitment to creating long-term value for shareholders. We are focused on maintaining the appropriate risk profile, selling business at attractive rates of return relative to our cost of capital and most important improving free cash flow so MetLife can return additional capital to shareholders.","With that, I'll turn the call over to John Hele, to discuss our financial results in detail. John?","John C. R. Hele","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our fourth quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I\u2019ll then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.","Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.6 billion, up 2% from the prior year period. And operating earnings per share were $1.38, up 1%. This quarter included 4 notable items, which were disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement or QFS.","First, consistent with the guidance from our December outlook call, we\u2019ve strengthened our asbestos legal reserves in the quarter to reflect higher frequency and severity of claims. This resulted in an after-tax charge of $170 million or $0.10 per share.","Second, we had favorable one-time tax adjustments in Latin America and EMEA, which increased operating earnings by $27 million or $0.02 per share.","Third, we had lower than budgeted catastrophe experience and favorable prior year development, which increased operating earnings by $16 million or $0.01 per share.","Finally, we had three actuarial related items that increased operating earnings by a net $5 million or less than a penny per share. The first actuarial related item a $66 million reduction in operating earnings was related to interest on unclaimed funds from life policies where we cannot locate the beneficiaries. These unclaimed funds are held by state government and a multi-state audit determined that MetLife owed interest on these policies. The impact was a $57 million in retail life and other and $9 million in group voluntary and worksite benefit.","The second, a $48 million benefit to operating earnings was a reserve adjustment to correct the treatment of the disability premium waiver wider in a number of term life contracts in retail life and other. You may recall, we had a positive adjustment for this item in the second quarter of 2014 as well.","The third, a $23 million benefit to operating earnings in Asia was an unlocking of deferred acquisition costs or DAC. This unlocking resulted from a lower expense assumption for certain life products in Japan. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 5% year-over-year and 9% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers on a constant currency basis were underwriting improvement, business growth, and lower taxes, which were partially offset by less favorable equity market performance.","Turning to our bottom-line results. Fourth-quarter net income was $1.5 billion or $1.30 per share. Net income was $93 million, below operating earnings in the quarter. Four items that explain most of this difference are: number one, charges of $140 million after-tax associated with asymmetrical accounting treatment for insurance contracts and other market value adjustments. Number two, derivative net losses of $40 million after-tax, which reflects changes in foreign currencies partially offset by gains from lower interest rates in the quarter.","Number three, a loss of $25 million after-tax related to certain variable annuity guarantees where the hedge assets are more sensitive to market fluctuations than the GAAP treatment for guaranteed liabilities. And these were partially offset by number four, investment portfolio net gains of $129 million after-tax as credit related losses continue to be modest in the portfolio.","Book value per share excluding AOCI other than FCTA was $49.53 as of December 30, up 5% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $40.36 at year-end, up 9% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, operating ROE was 11.3% and tangible operating ROE was 14.1%.As Steve noted, we believe tangible operating ROE provides a better measure of the underlying business returns for MetLife.","Turning to fourth quarter margins. Underwriting results improved sequentially and year-over-year by approximately $0.06 after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Year-over-year highlights include improvement in mortality and morbidity experience in the U.S., as well as strong results in property and casualty.","Retail life's interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 53.9% in the fourth quarter, and 53.0% after adjusting for the net impact of the notable items discussed earlier. This result compared favorably to the prior year quarter of 54.2% and within our targeted range of 50% to 55%. This marked the second consecutive quarter of normal claim activity for retail life after four volatile quarters.","The mortality ratio in group life was 88.4% and 87.4% after adjusting for the interest and unclaimed funds. The adjusted ratio was favorable to 87.9% in the prior year quarter as well -- and well within the targeted range of 85% to 90%.","The non-medical health interest adjusted loss ratio was 77.4%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 80.9% and the low end of the targeted range of 77% to 82%.","Disability underwriting improved, while dental margins were favorable to the prior year as utilization returned to a normal level. In our P&C business, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 85.8% in Retail and 92.3% in Group. The combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 81.5% in Retail and 90.8% in Group. Overall, P&C underwriting results were favorable versus the prior year due to the lower non-cat losses and expenses as well as favorable prior year reserve development.","Moving to fourth quarter investment margins, the average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 215 basis points, down 26 basis points year-over-year and 21 sequentially. Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 186 basis points, down 13 basis points versus the prior year and five sequentially.","The sequential decline in spreads can be attributed to three primary factors. First, pre-tax variable investment income was $325 million at the top end of our 2014 quarterly guidance range. After taxes in the impact to DAC, VII was $211 million, down $62 million sequentially due to weaker private equity and hedge fund returns. Second, core yields declined as a result of the low interest rate environment. Average new money yields are running roughly 100 to 150 basis points below the average roll off yield on the portfolio.","And third, there was a transfer of cash into retail annuity upon the completion of the four-way merger in November, which accounts for the majority of the 20 basis point decline in deferred annuity spreads in the quarter. We would expect to reinvest this cash in [indiscernible] securities over time.","With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 25.0% in the fourth quarter as compared to 25.3% in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for asbestos and other legal reserves in both quarters, the operating expense ratio was 23.7% in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 23.6% in the prior year period.","Gross expense saves were $259 million in the fourth quarter, and net saves were $163 million after adjusting for reinvestment of $33 million and one-time costs of $63 million.","I\u2019ll now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $683 million, up 4% versus the prior year quarter and up 7% after adjusting for notable items in both periods.","Growth in Retail was driven by Life & Other, which reported operating earnings of $321 million, up 13% versus the prior year quarter and 14% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were lower expenses and favorable underwriting.","Life & Other PFOs were $2.2 billion, up 2% year-over-year primarily due to growth in the open block and P&C, partially offset by the run-off of the closed block. Annuities reported operating earnings of $362 million, down 3% versus the prior year quarter and essentially flat after adjusting for excess variable investment in the prior year. Annuities PFOs were $1.2 billion, up 7% year-over-year primarily due to the higher income annuity sales.","Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $235 million, up 2% versus the prior year quarter and 9% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting was the key driver with improved results in disability, dental, group life and P&C. GVWB PFOs were $4.2 billion, up 3% year-over-year and sales increased 17% due to strong growth across all products.","Corporate Benefit Funding reported operating earnings of $374 million, up 5% versus the prior year quarter and 10% after adjusting for notable items. The key drivers were favorable underwriting and business growth.","CBF PFOs were $1.5 billion, down 5% year-over-year due to lower income annuities and pension closeouts. On closeouts, we remain active, but disciplined and continue to see a good pipeline of small to mid-sized cases.","Latin America reported operating earnings of $187 million, up 8% from the prior year quarter and 26% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for the notable tax item in this quarter, operating earnings were up 17% on a constant currency basis driven by business growth across the region partially offset by higher expenses. Overall, Latin American taxes were unusually low in the quarter even after adjusting for the notable tax item.","Latin America PFOs were $1 billion, down 5% from the prior year quarter and up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region.","Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $335 million, up 3% from the prior year quarter and 9% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both quarters, operating earnings were up 7% on a constant currency basis. Improvement in investment margins and business growth in the region were the primary drivers.","Asia PFOs were $2.3 billion, down 3% from the prior year quarter, but up 6% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to growth in Japan, Korea, and Australia. Asia sales were down 30% from the fourth quarter of 2013. The decline was expected. As the prior year quarter had a large group employee benefit sale in Australia and elevated yen life sales in Japan in advance of pricing changes. Adjusting for these items, Asia sales were up 1%.","In Japan, total A&H sales were up 21% year-over-year and 52% sequentially. We have seen good traction from our two new medical products launched in September which we announced touring the 2014 Asia Investor Day.","In EMEA, operating earnings were $85 million, down 4%, but at 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable tax items in both periods, operating earnings were up 7% on a constant currency basis due to business growth in the Middle East and a $7 million from the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting.","EMEA PFOs were up $671 million, down 4% from the prior year period, but up 3% on a constant currency basis. Total sales increased 22%, with 40% growth in emerging markets, including strong employee benefits sales in the Middle East and A&H across the region.","Finally, the operating loss in Corporate & Other was $316 million, as compared to an operating loss of $278 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusting for the increase in asbestos legal reserves this quarter, the operating loss was $199 million, which was within the $175 million to $225 million operating loss range that we guided to during our third quarter earnings call.","I\u2019ll now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.1 billion at December 31. In addition, our 2014 free cash flow ratio was 44% better than our updated December estimate of approximately 40%.","Next I\u2019d like to provide you with an update on our capital position. While we have not yet completed our risk-based capital calculations for 2014, we estimate our combined RBC ratio will be in a range of 400% to 420%. Our Japan solvency margin ratio which we file quarterly was 1,003% as of the third quarter and we estimate that our fourth quarter ratio will be comparable.","For our U.S insurance companies preliminary fourth quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $2.4 billion and statutory net income was approximately $1.7 billion. For the full-year of 2014, statutory operating earnings were approximately $5.2 billion and U.S statutory net income was approximately $3.8 billion. U.S statutory operating earnings on a comparable basis were down $1.2 billion versus the prior year primarily due to less favorable equity markets and reserve strengthening.","We said in our December outlook call, that we thought statutory insurance reserve increases at our New York subsidiary would be $400 million to $600 million more than we had initially contemplated. Although we\u2019re still finalizing year-end statutory statements, we anticipate the increase in reserves will be in line with its revised expectation. Even though the assumptions for cash flow testing reflected the lower interest rate environment since the December outlook call.","The year-end financials will also show capital contributed to our life insurance captives driven by low interest rates. This increase in capital will be funded by $670 million of cash from the holding company with a $225 million contribution last year and a planned $445 million contribution in 2015.","Despite this cash contributions from the holding company, free cash flow was better than our forecast in 2014 and we still believe a 45% to 55% ratio is a reasonable expectation for 2015. We estimate that our total U.S statutory adjusted capital was approximately $28 billion as of December 31, up 13% on a comparable basis to the prior year.","In conclusion, MetLife had a good fourth-quarter to close out a strong year. Investment margins remain healthy despite pressure from low rates. Expenses are well controlled and underwriting improved for the second consecutive quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong and we continue to successfully execute on our strategy as we seek to maximize shareholder value.","And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator, for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Ryan Krueger, KBW.","Ryan Krueger","Hey, thanks. Good morning. MetLife is unique among the public U.S life insurers, in that your largest subsidiary is domiciled in New York and subject to some more conservative reserving standards. We\u2019ve seen a lot of life companies in the last couple of years take statutory charges in New York that they do not have to take in their other subsidiaries. So I guess, given that it seems like your 400% to 420% RBC ratio might not be directly comparable to the other company, so I was hoping can you give us any sense of how much more is statutory reserve that you hold at this point, because you\u2019re domiciled in New York? Is there anything you can help us quantify there?","John C. R. Hele","Hi, Ryan. This is John. Well, as we\u2019ve mentioned I think on prior calls, New York we believe is more conservative than other states. And we have had added reserves over the years. We haven\u2019t exactly quantified that for the market, but suffice to say that our 400% to 420% we believe is quite strong.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. All right. I guess, second one on the variable annuity hedging strategy so -- now that you can got rid of the captive and you have to use traditional statutory VACARVM rather than the modified GAAP I think that you used in the captive. Have you changed your hedging strategy at all because of that?","John C. R. Hele","Hi, Ryan. This is John again. We\u2019ve changed it slightly sort of to optimize for the VACARVM and how it moves. But much of it remains the same with some regular delta hedging as well as some tail type hedging going on, on an ongoing basis. The overall cost of program has not materially changed. We fine tuned it as we have done continuously since the start of the program.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. And is it accurate to say to think about it as the traditional statutory rules are less sensitive to interest rate movements than kind of a fair value GAAP approach?","John C. R. Hele","Yes, that is true.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas Gallagher","Hey, good morning. John, you discuss the capital ratios in the subs, can you comment on the holding company cash liquidity position capital that sits there right now?","John C. R. Hele","Hi, Tom. As I said, we\u2019ve got approximately $6.1 billion of cash at our holding companies and this is the amount that\u2019s free and clear. We have not given what is capital or required capital or excess capital; because we really don't know what the binding capital rules will be on us. And so our strategy has been to be conservative when it comes to overall capital management and to have a good balance in cash at the holding companies.","Thomas Gallagher","And when you say that\u2019s $6.1 billion, that's free and clear. Just remind us what your -- the buffer that you typically hold given interest coverage and debt considerations?","John C. R. Hele","Well, prior to MetLife being, considered to being a SIFI, and now been a SIFI I believe sometime ago MetLife did give some numbers. But since we\u2019ve been under a review and now that we\u2019ve been picked, we\u2019ve not given a target number because we really don\u2019t know what the binding constraints will be, we don\u2019t understand the capital rules. We of course do our own internal stress testing, and we have some number in mind. But to give you guidance on it would be misleading, because we just don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to be. So, with regard to that we have just been conservative in how much we hold both thinking through a strong capitalized position within all of our insurance entities as well as having a strong cash position at the holding companies.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay. And just one follow-up for, Steve, though I guess the way you described the fact that you\u2019re going to complete the $1 billion buyback program soon, but then you\u2019re cautious of doing more in lieu of uncertain regulation. It\u2019s a bit of a change in tones, and maybe it\u2019s just that. But is there something new that\u2019s occurred, and obviously the law suite is out there. But is there anything else going on behind the scenes that we should be thinking about if why there\u2019s more caution now, because I think the last couple of times you\u2019ve described capital management its been somewhat more constructive.","Steven Jeffrey Goulart","Tom, I think I\u2019ve been pretty cautious right along. We didn\u2019t engage in share repurchases for some time. Then given how long it took for the capital rules to come forward which they haven\u2019t come forward yet. We decided to do a relatively conservative share repurchase program in 2014 of $1 billion, and we announced another $1 billion for 2015. The completion of that program will probably occur faster than we had anticipated when you put that program in place, because our share price had dropped in the marketplace or the drop in a 10 year treasury, and that accelerated our purchases because we kind of -- our purchases are based upon our view of value in the marketplace of our stock. So, I think it\u2019s really consistent what we\u2019ve been saying to you. I think its pretty consistent right along.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay. And lastly, is there any formality right now -- since the fed is you regulator now but you have this other issue going on. Is there any formality that is required to execute on our capital return programs or you just share information with them at this point?","John C. R. Hele","What we share -- this is John with our fed regulator now all capital management actions we are planning to do, and we\u2019re in active discussions with them at all times. So, if we were to at some point consider doing capital management actions we will be informing them.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath with UBS. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. A quick follow-up to Ryan\u2019s question on the RBC; so first of all -- so what's now in that RBC? Is it basically everything that you have in the U.S. x the XXX and AXXX captives? That\u2019s my first question.","Steven A. Kandarian","Yes, it would be everything in the U.S. with the exception of the XXX or AXXX life captives and -- well everything material there may be some immaterial little about there, but it\u2019s everything that is material U.S. business.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And then, the 400% to 420% just based on your comments about the conservatism in New York, should we just -- should we assume that that\u2019s a level that you\u2019re comfortable running with. I know a lot of companies talk about a 400% minimum but then tend to hold more than that. But should we expect you to run at 400% to 420%?","Steven A. Kandarian","We do try to target about 400%, so that\u2019s where we are. But we do also think about the strength of the overall balance sheets that we have in particular having the New York Company.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And then I guess for Steve, I just wanted to get a sense of where you\u2019re going with your commentary in your prepared remarks about ROE versus 10 year treasury. You kind of gave us two numbers the 2012, the \u201914 and then the 2000 and 2011, and then there is obviously a delta between those. So, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re trying to suggest that we should be thinking about the 2000 to 2011 range relative to the 10 year or the \u201912 to \u201914 range. Just want to get a sense of where you\u2019re going with that?","Steven Jeffrey Goulart","Suneet, my comments really were not MetLife specific. They were really more in terms of what investors should be thinking about in terms of return expectations by any asset class right now. I think people have now locked into certain numbers of ROE expectations for equities that may have made sense in a different environment than where we\u2019re in today. If you have low interest rates for a long period of time, those expectations should come down. That was really my comment.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. But not reflective of your ROE, I guess that was my mistake.","Steven Jeffrey Goulart","No, it would be reflective, I think of every ones ROE. The all asset classes, that\u2019s my point.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. I mean, I guess, so if we\u2019re in 4% to 4.5% 10 year treasury world then using your guidance, I guess we should expect 14% to 14.5% kind of returns?","Steven Jeffrey Goulart","We said 12% to 14% in a normal 10 year treasury environment, and 4%, 4.5% treasury yield when there is 2% inflation which is the feds target. And I would say roughly 2.5% underlying real GDP growth would result in that kind of a level of a treasury. And then you expect something like 12% to 14% for MetLife, a large life insurance company with a diversified group of businesses, but still a large business in the United States which is a moderately growing market.","Suneet Kamath","All right. Thanks.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to come back to the interest rate disclosure you\u2019ve given in your outlook presentation where you show the potential present value GAAP interest rate charge of $3 billion if rates stay at 2% forever. Just had two questions there, I guess first, how narrowly do you define interest rate impact and is it just the direct impact of low rates on reserves or do you also include DAC and second derivative impacts like policy holder behavior? And then secondly, how sensitive is that number to a drop in interest rates below 2%?","John C. R. Hele","Hi, Erik, it\u2019s John. So that number is total GAAP impact. It would include DAC. It would include any GAAP reserve strength in that might be required. Policy holder behavior is I don\u2019t know how people annuitize more or less or enact their rights more or less depending upon where the 10 year treasury is. We haven\u2019t seen any indication of that so far in our experience. So that\u2019s something that we would just have to see how things develop on that. And we haven\u2019t given more sensitivities to this than the two, it\u2019s highly complex to do calculation and get all this done. We think this is pretty good disclosure giving you a sensitivity.","Erik Bass","Okay. I appreciate that. And I guess, just the one follow-up. How do movements in interest rates affect your expected free cash flow generation in 2015 and I know you reiterated the 45% to 55% target range. I believe in the past there has been some fluctuation based on kind of derivative marks and other things that have had an impact. So, is this how should we think about that?","John C. R. Hele","Well clearly a big piece of our free cash flow comes in particular from our U.S. statutory entities, and the statutory accounting, the operating earnings is more sensitive to movements in interest rates due to derivative movements than say GAAP is. So, that does impact it. It impacts at the following year though, because our dividend capacity is based on your earnings in a year, and that\u2019s how much you can take up the next year. So, it\u2019s kind of a bit of a delayed item. So in any one year interest rate moves will have an impact on the following year. That\u2019s why we give you a range around this, but over a two or three year period we believe these things average out. Once you have the derivative gain or loss, if rates stay the same then you don\u2019t have that repeating. But as we\u2019ve seen rates have gone up and gone down in the past few years. So, there\u2019ll always be some fluctuation with regard to this and that\u2019s why we give you a range.","Erik Bass","Got it. But the 45% to 55% is still a pretty comfortable range for 2015?","John C. R. Hele","Right. As I said we are even with the reserved strengthening that we\u2019ve taken due to low rates. We are still at the 45% to 55% for 2015.","Erik Bass","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions on your group business. First, if you can just discuss your comfort with your GAAP and stat reserves for the long-term inner block. We have seen a number of companies take actions recently. And then, second on the disability business, it seems like your non-medical claims, margins were actually pretty good. So maybe if you could talk about claims, incidence and recovery trends in that market -- in the disability business?","John C. R. Hele","Hi, this is John. I\u2019ll do reserves, and turn it over to Bill for the claims. So, we have a closed block of long-term care, and we in stat the reserves are significantly higher than the GAAP reserves due to conservatism typically from the New York accounting and how we have to abide for this. The stat reserves do not assume future rate increases other than what have been already approved in the states. The GAAP assume a best estimate where we do expect to get some rate increases, but it\u2019s not really a very material amount compared to the enforced reserves from the rate increases. And we have reserve adequacy in both the stat and GAAP reserves as of year end 2014.","Jimmy Bhullar","And the interest rate and assumptions embedded in those; are you assuming a pick up in rates over the next few years?","John C. R. Hele","Our GAAP reserves do assume a mean reversion, and the stat reserves of course are subject to cash flow testing that have a range of interest rates.","William J. Wheeler","Jimmy, it\u2019s Bill Wheeler, with regard to kind of what's going on in -- long-term disability, group disability, the number itself is quite good this quarter. It\u2019s much better than we have had for really any quarter in the last over a year. And I guess, I would describe the pieces of it are, incidence is stable, claims revolution is much improved as you would hope given the changes we put in place regarding our claims operations because I think I talked about it couple of quarters ago. And so, that\u2019s good news. Its somewhat offset by social security offsets are soft. And they have been soft for a while now, and I think that has a lot to do with what's going on in the social security administration more than it does with MetLife. So, those are kind of it, that I would say the big pieces that are moving around. But the net result is it\u2019s -- it was a good number this quarter.","Jimmy Bhullar","And pricing in that market, as you\u2019ve gone through the renewal season for the beginning of the year, like how were overall pricing trends?","William J. Wheeler","Very favorable. We asked for significant renewals obviously based on our experience we thought that was appropriate, and I would say our achievement of those renewal rate increases was very successful with very modest lapse rates.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning. I have a follow-up question for Steve on the interest rate environment and kind of thoughts on ROE. I think in the past you had said that in the low ROE -- in the low interest rate environment there\u2019s a 12% to 14% long-term target really moves down to 11% to 13%. Is that still the way we should be thinking about it? Hello?","John C. R. Hele","Hi. This is, John, I\u2019ll just answer that. Yes we had tried to give you some guidance that if rates stayed low for a long period of time that it would be slightly lower by 2016.","Yaron Kinar","All right. Can you quantify that?","John C. R. Hele","It was about a 100 basis points.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Nigel Dally","Great, thanks. On annuities, can you provide some more details on your new Flex Choice product with high guarantees; is it fair to say that it has a lower return than your previous product? And if that\u2019s true, if can you discuss where those anticipated returns come out?","Steven A. Kandarian","Nigel, I\u2019m sorry. Can you just do that one more time?","Nigel Dally","Sure. With your new Flex Choice product with a high guarantee, is it fair to say that it has a lower return, and if that\u2019s true can you discuss where those anticipated return to come out?","Steven A. Kandarian","Well, Nigel its -- so we are raising the underlying roll up rate from 4% to 5%, obviously on the 4% was our old [ph] GMIB and this is a withdrawal benefit. It does not -- we have not compromised the return on our variable annuity products. This product as you would hope meets our return expectations because there are a bunch of other features in the product which allow us to lower the capital charge, and so we\u2019re excited about it. With the GMIB as you know there are, the policy holder has more choices about, what he wants to do. And of course we have to make assumptions about policy holder behavior and hedge accordingly, and that\u2019s really not the case with the GMWB. There is less optionality in the product and therefore the hedging is much more straightforward. And so, and that contributes I think to the improvement in the return to lower capital allocation to the product.","Nigel Dally","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Seth Weiss","Hi, good morning. A question on the asset adequacy testing, you mentioned in line with expectations. Can you give us any color by products, how that asset adequacy testing looks?","Steven A. Kandarian","Hi, Seth. Well I\u2019m sure our actuaries would love to give you all sorts of details on this. But for the second time, New York requires us to do cash flow testing separately for long-term care because it is a closed block, and that\u2019s driving some of the numbers that I mentioned at our December outlook calls having to raise reserves due to the asset adequacy -- the reserve testing. But we do this across all of our businesses. We use the New York seven scenarios not only in all non New York companies, but even our life insurance captives, and that again -- I mentioned some more capital that we are putting up there for lower interest rates. We did use rates that were actually lower than where we saw year end 10 year treasuries. But it\u2019s a little more complex than that because it\u2019s not just a 10 year treasury it\u2019s the shape of the yield curve and the reinvestment curve. And actually compared to few years ago we actually have a flatter curve, and the 30 year treasury is actually lower than we saw even a couple of years ago when we saw low interest rates prior. So that has impacted the asset testing because of these long dated contracts, it\u2019s a very long reinvestment fund, so it does have an impact. So, as we mentioned, the testing that we\u2019ve now just completed for yearend does reflect some more recent conditions, and it\u2019s within the range that we had talked about in December.","Seth Weiss","Okay, great. And to clarify the 400 to 600 that\u2019s on top, the 200 that you expected right? So 600 to 800 is the range we should think about?","Steven A. Kandarian","Yes, exactly.","Seth Weiss","Right. Thank you.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Eric Berg with RBC. Please go ahead.","Eric Berg","Thanks. So, I just wanted to return to an earlier question and clarify the response of share repurchase. Is the point Steve that you have announced two share repurchases each for $1 billion, and that its your intention at this point to complete both but that with respect to the second it would be unrealistic to expect sort of an increase on top of that. Second, share repurchase, is that what I heard?","Steven Jeffrey Goulart","Hi, Eric. What we said is that we are going to remain cautious given the capital rules have not been drafted yet or issued by the fed. So, we have not completed the second $1 billion repurchase program. So we haven\u2019t made a final determination. We\u2019ll see when that program concludes, what we know more about the capital rules at that point in time. But I was signaling that we\u2019re going to remain quite cautious here until the capital rules come out. And my best guess is those rules will not be out before the second program concludes.","Eric Berg","Thank you.","End of Q&A","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions in queue.
