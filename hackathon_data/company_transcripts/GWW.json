Grainger (NYSE:GWW) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 16, 2013  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Laura D. Brown - Senior Vice President of Communications & Investor Relations","William D. Chapman - Senior Director of Investor Relations","Laura D. Brown","Hello, this is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's 2013 third quarter results. Please also reference our 2013 third quarter earnings release issued today, October 16, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this podcast.","Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.","For purposes of this podcast, we are excluding the $76 million in reserves, or $0.66 per share, we announced in last year's quarter related to litigation with the General Services Administration and United States Postal Service. Today, we narrowed our guidance for the full year and now expect sales growth of 5% to 6%, and earnings per share of $11.45 to $11.65. While we expect to achieve record results for the year 2013 with 10% to 12% EPS growth, this year has been a tale of 2 halves. In the first half of the year, we experienced solid operating margin expansion, increased gross margins and strong earnings leverage. As our growth initiatives and IT projects spending have accelerated and our gross margin expansion has eased, the second half of 2013 is resulting in more modest operating leverage. For the 2013 third quarter, we were pleased with the volume growth in our U.S. business, given the challenging economic environment. Earnings growth in the United States was in line with our expectations. However, our businesses outside of the United States remain affected by weaker macroeconomic conditions and unfavorable foreign exchange rates, and performed below our expectations.","With that as a backdrop, let's review the 2013 third quarter. Company sales increased 5%, 4% on a daily basis. There were 64 selling days in the quarter, 1 more than in 2012. Operating earnings increased 5% and net earnings increased 4%. Earnings per share were $2.95 for the quarter, an increase of 5% versus the 2012 third quarter. We also narrowed our guidance ranges for both 2013 sales and earnings per share, which Bill will cover in detail at the end of the podcast.","Let's walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins increased 20 basis points to 43.8% versus 43.6% in 2012, primarily driven by Canada and the Other Businesses. Company operating margin was flat, with the prior year at 14.5%. Operating expenses increased 6%, including $40 million in incremental growth-related spending versus the 2012 third quarter. These growth investments include additional sales coverage, eCommerce, inventory management, advertising, IT systems and expansion in the company's distribution center network. We are currently forecasting approximately $36 million in growth spending in the 2013 fourth quarter, which brings our full year forecast to $135 million. In the quarter, we added approximately 100 new sales representatives in the United States, bringing our year-to-date total to nearly 200. eCommerce sales continued to grow faster than the rest of the business, and currently represents 33% of total company sales. We also added more than 4,000 KeepStock installations in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to more than 11,000 installations in the United States. These KeepStock installations include Vendor Managed Inventory, Customer Managed Inventory, and Vending solutions.","Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter in the month of September; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2013 guidance and other key items.","As mentioned earlier, total company sales for the quarter increased 5%, 4% on a daily basis. The 4% increase in daily sales in the quarter consisted of 4 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline attributable to unfavorable foreign exchange. By month, daily sales increased 4% in July, 4% in August, and 2% in September.","Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations, located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, are reported under a grouping titled, Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 78% of total company revenues in the quarter, increased 7%, 6% on a daily basis. This daily sales growth was driven by 5 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from acquisitions. Daily sales increased 6% in July, 5% in August, and 5% in September.","Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States for the quarter. Light Manufacturing was up in the high single digits. Heavy Manufacturing, Commercial and Natural Resources were up in the mid-single digits. Government, Contractor and Retail were up in the low single digits, and Reseller was down in the low single digits.","Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 11% of total company revenues in the quarter. For the quarter, sales in Canada decreased 1%, 2% on a daily basis in U.S. dollars. In local currency, sales increased 4%, 2% on a daily basis. The 2% daily sales growth consisted primarily of 2 percentage points from volume. By month, daily sales on local currency increased 2% in July, 4% in August, and were flat in September. Sales performance in Canada was led by solid growth to customers in the oil and gas, forestry, light manufacturing and utilities end markets. Volume growth in Canada continues to be negatively affected by the weak global demand for Canadian commodities and the general softening of the Canadian economy.","Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, and represented 11% of total company sales in the quarter. Sales for this group were up 1%, flat on a daily basis and consisted of 7 percentage points from volume and price, offset by a 7 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The sales increase was primarily due to revenue growth in Mexico and Europe, along with the strong growth from Zoro Tools, our U.S.-based online business. Sales for the business in Japan grew in the mid-teens in local currency. Due to the significant weakening of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar, sales for this business decreased in the high single digits in U.S. dollars.","Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for July and August and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at September. There were 20 selling days in September of 2013 versus 19 days in the same month of 2012. Company sales increased 2% on a daily basis in September of 2013 versus September of 2012. The daily sales growth in September included 3 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from the Techni-Tool acquisition, partially offset by a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. In the United States, September's daily sales increased 5%, driven by 4 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from Techni-Tool. September customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Light and Heavy Manufacturing were up in the high single digits; Commercial and Natural Resources were up in the mid-single digits; Retail was up in the low single digits; Contractor was flat, and Government and Reseller were down in the low single digits. Sales performance for our federal government business, which represents approximately 25% of our government business in the United States declined in the high single digits. Sequestration and the government shutdown remain significant headwinds for our federal government business. In contrast, sales for our state and local government businesses grew in the low single digits in September. Daily sales in Canada for September decreased 6% in U.S. dollars, and were flat in local currency. The sales performance in Canada was led by solid growth to customers in the oil and gas, light manufacturing and agriculture end markets, offset by a decline in sales to the heavy manufacturing, construction, retail and commercial end markets.","Daily sales for our Other Businesses decreased 4% in September, consisting of 3 percentage points from volume and price that was more than offset by a 7 percentage point drag from unfavorable foreign exchange.","October will be the first month with sales contribution from the E&R Industrial Inc. acquisition completed in the 2013 third quarter. This business is expected to add approximately 200 basis points to company sales growth for the next 12 months. Excluding the incremental sales from E&R, daily sales growth in the month of October is currently trending above the 4% daily sales growth rate reported for the third quarter.","Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.","William D. Chapman","Thanks, Laura. Since we've already analyzed company operating performance, let's jump right into performance by a reportable segment. As a reminder, results in this discussion will exclude the $76 million in reserves or $0.66 per share we announced in last year's quarter related to litigation with the General Services Administration and the United States Postal Service.","Operating earnings in the United States increased 6% versus the 2012 third quarter. This performance was driven by the 7% sales growth and positive operating expense leverage. Gross profit margins for the quarter decreased 30 basis points versus the prior year driven by strong growth and share gain among large customers, which carry lower margins. In addition, unlike the past 2 years, the company did not implement mid-year price increases due to a lower inflationary environment in 2013. Operating expenses grew at a slightly slower rate than sales, despite the increase in incremental growth-related spending of $36 million, on areas such as new sales representatives, eCommerce and advertising. The operating margin for the U.S. segment decreased 20 basis points to 18% versus the prior year.","Let's move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings decreased 7% versus the prior year in U.S. dollars. The lower operating performance was primarily the result of approximately $3.5 million in incremental spending for the new IT system scheduled for installation in late 2014. Excluding the IT investment, the business generated positive operating leverage. Gross profit margins increased 40 basis points. The gross profit margin improvement was due to cost savings from freight consolidation and higher supplier rebates. The operating margin in Canada decreased 80 basis points to 11.7% versus the prior year.","The Other Businesses generated $6 million in operating earnings in the 2013 third quarter versus $9 million in the 2012 third quarter. The earnings decline for the quarter was primarily driven by weaker performance in Mexico, Colombia and Brazil, partially offset by improved earnings from Zoro Tools. Strong earnings growth in Japan was essentially offset by the relative weakness of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.","Below the operating line, interest expense, net of interest income, was $2.9 million in the 2013 third quarter versus $4 million in the 2012 third quarter. The tax rate in the quarter was 38% versus 37.1% in the 2012 quarter. The increase was primarily due to lower earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. We are currently projecting an effective tax rate for the full year 2013 of 37.4% to 37.8%.","Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $354 million, up 5% versus $33.8 million in 2012. Cash flow in the 2013 quarter benefited from higher earnings and lower inventory purchases versus the prior year. The company used the cash to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $65 million versus $59 million in 2012. We paid dividends of $65 million, reflecting the 16% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in the April of 2013. In addition, we bought back 300,000 shares of stock for $77 million and ended the quarter with 4.2 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $142 million to shareholders in the quarter.","As reported in our 2013 third quarter earnings release, we narrowed our sales and EPS guidance for full year 2013. We now expect 5% to 6% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.45 to $11.65. This guidance includes E&R Industrial, which we will begin reporting in the 2013 fourth quarter. As a reminder, we expect E&R to be earnings neutral in 2013, but will result in gross and operating margin dilution as we will detail in just a moment.","For purposes of comparison, we have excluded the $0.25 per share in restructuring charges recorded in the 2012 fourth quarter. With that as a backdrop, let's take a look at our current expectations. We'll begin with sales. The primary changes since July relate to slower growth outside the United States, and lower expectations for price inflation. We now expect price inflation to only contribute 1 percentage point to sales growth versus the 2 percentage points included in our previous guidance. Price in the 2013 third quarter rounded down to 0 and we do not anticipate any interim price increases in 2013, unlike the past few years. The new guidance implies roughly 6% to 8% daily sales growth in the fourth quarter, including $50 million in revenue from the E&R Industrial acquisition. Excluding E&R, sales are expected to grow 4% to 6% in the fourth quarter.","Moving on to gross profit margins. We are forecasting gross margin expansion of about 30 basis points for the full year versus 2012. Keep in mind that much of the gross margin expansion was realized in the first half of the year, when gross margins increased 60 basis points over prior year. We are expecting gross margins in the fourth quarter to decrease by 40 basis points. If you exclude E&R, our guidance includes approximately 20 basis points of gross margin expansion.","We anticipate that our share gains will continue to come from our larger, lower margin customers. While the resulting earnings growth is substantial, it continues to create negative mix. Lastly, we are squarely in a period of low inflation and are not seeing much product cost inflation. As a result, we are also not expecting any price inflation for the remainder of 2013.","Let's take a look at company operating margin. We expect full year operating margin expansion of 40 to 60 basis points. Again, this expansion was front-end loaded, with 95 basis points of improvement coming in the first half of the year. For the 2013 fourth quarter, we are forecasting that operating margins will decline 20 basis points on the low end, and increase 50 basis points on the high end. Excluding E&R, operating margins are expected to increase 10 basis points on the low end, and 80 basis points on the high end. Keep in mind, the relatively wide range of outcomes in the 2013 fourth quarter is a reflection of the direct relationship between our volume growth and our ability to generate productivity savings. The better the growth, the stronger the productivity. Our assumptions include $36 million in incremental growth spending in the fourth quarter. Details are provided in Exhibit 3.","As we noted in the 2013 third quarter release, work is underway to build out a new enterprise system for the businesses in Canada and Mexico. Although the majority of the cost for this project will be incurred in 2014, margins in Canada are expected to decline given $4.5 million in IT spending forecasted for the 2013 fourth quarter.","Finally, we are forecasting foreign exchange to represent $0.09 per share drag for the full year, including $0.03 per share in the 2013 fourth quarter.","Looking at the full year, 2013 should be another record year with earnings per share growing at twice the rate of sales under both our high and low guidance scenarios. Keep in mind that 2013 will be the tale of 2 halves, with strong margin expansion in the first half, followed by much more modest expectations in the second half tied to limited gross margin expansion and higher spending on growth and infrastructure initiatives. And those investments, over the long term, will better position Grainger to gain more share, build additional scale and lead the consolidation of the large and fragmented MRO market.","To conclude, please mark your calendar for the following important dates: on Tuesday, November 12, we plan to release October sales. And on Wednesday, November 13, we will host our Annual Analyst Meeting. This year's event will be held at our new national distribution center in Minooka, Illinois.

Grainger First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations for W.W. Grainger. Thank you, Ms. Brown. You may begin. ","Laura Brown","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Laura Brown. Welcome to Grainger\u2019s Q4 earnings call. With me are D. G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO and Tom Okray, who will assume the CFO role on May 2nd.","As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with the corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q1 press release, which is available on our Investor Relations Web site. D.G. will be covering the performance for the quarter, as well as give an update on our 2018 guidance. After that, we will open for questions. D. G. to you.","D. G. Macpherson","Thank you, Laura. Good morning, thanks for joining us everyone. Earlier this month, we announced that we had concluded our CFO search. And I'm excited to welcome Tom Okray to Grainger. Tom brings great combination of finance and operations experience with him. He knows our industry well and we're glad to him as part of team.","So moving on to the quarter. The momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2017 continued into the first quarter of 2018. In the U.S., the volume response to our pricing reset was strong; the demand environment continued to improve. We estimate market growth in the quarter was closer to 4% versus our expectations for 2% to 3% growth for the year. What's encouraging is we're strengthening relationships with both large and mid-sized customers, the pricing reset is allowing us to reestablish trust and gain share by focusing on creating value for our customers.","In Canada, our actions related to the turnaround led to gross profit and operating earnings improvement, and our business model reset is on track. Finally, our single channel online and our international businesses expanded operating earnings in the quarter. All this resulted in performance that was better than our expectations. We're raising our full year guidance based on our performance in the first quarter and our confidence moving forward.","On Slide 4, let's take a look at our results. Q1, 2018 reported results included restructuring charges of $8 million and an $0.11 negative impact to EPS. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results, which exclude the items outlined in our press release. Total Company sales in the quarter were up 9%. Volume was up 8%. We had positive seasonal sales of 1%, mostly in the U.S., offset by 1% decline due to our Techni-Tool divestiture last July. Price was down 1% in the quarter and we have currency favorability of 2% in the quarter driven by strengthening of almost all international currencies in the markets that we participate.","Our normalized gross profit rate declined 30 basis points after adjusting for the revenue recognition, accounting change and a benefit from the timing of our national sales meeting. GP rate was better than expected, driven by U.S. mix, price cost spreads and some Canada price increases, which I'll describe in a bit. We continue to realize operating expense leverage on higher volumes. This all led to operating earnings growth of 19% in the quarter.","One note, despite the operating earnings growth in the quarter, operating cash flow declined approximately 19%. This was primarily due to full bonus and incentive payments relative to the prior year. This is specific to the first quarter and we expect cash flow to be strong throughout the balance of the year.","I'll cover other businesses category first. As a reminder, other businesses include our single channel online model and our international businesses. Sales for this group were up 18% in the quarter, 12% of that was price volume and 6% was currency. Our online businesses continue to drive strong growth and profitability. And our international businesses performed ahead of our expectations as a group and continue to operating margin expansion in the quarter.","Turning to Canada, sales were down 2%, and down 6% in local currency. We introduced price increases in the fourth quarter of last year, and as result, price was up 7%. This helped gross profit by 400 basis points in the quarter. Volume was down 13% due to the planned price increases and branch closures. As we've talked about before, this is going to be a smaller but more profitable business when we\u2019re through with the reset and before we can start growing again.","Operating margin was better than expected due primarily to a higher GP rate and cost management. Everything that we've seen so far in Canada tells us we\u2019re on the right path. We\u2019re improving our large customer profitability. We've continued our restructuring actions, including closing 17 unproductive branches in the quarter, and we expect to see expenses come down more through to remainder of the year as we structure and create North American centers of excellence. We're also improving service while doing this. Direct-to-customer shipping was at an all-time high in March in Canada. We are making strong progress on all of our initiatives. And while it's too to declare victory, we remain committed to the plan that we laid out in November.","Turning to the U.S., both the volume response to our pricing actions and the demand environment was better than we expected. Sales in the U.S. were up 8%. This included volume of 9%, intercompany sales of 1%, seasonal sales of positive 1% and that was offset by the 1% decline due to the Techni-Tool divestiture last July. Price deflation in the quarter was 2%.","Our normalized gross profit rate in the U.S. declined 60 basis points after adjusting for the revenue recognition change, and a benefit from the timing of our national sales meeting. Our gross profit rate benefited from volume mix and price cost spread in the quarter. Large customer gross profit was better than we expected, we\u2019re not having to deeply discount any frequently repurchased items as much as customers get more comfortable with our pricing level, and our customers are starting to trust that our prices are relevant and understand the value that we provide. Operating expenses in the U.S. were up 2% once we include the revenue recognition change, and operating margin was better than expected in the quarter as expense leverage on 9% volume growth more than offset the GP rate decline.","So turning to our performance in the U.S. and focusing on margin and mid-size customers. We are continuing to see that our value proposition resonates with both large and mid-size customers when we remove pricing as a barrier. We're gaining share and seeing volume growth with all customer groups. U.S. large volume increased 7% versus the prior year, which was above our expectations. Mid-size customer volume also exceeded expectations with growth of 30% over the prior year. With mid-size customers we\u2019re seeing progress with our marketing efforts.","We\u2019re further penetrating existing customers, re-engaging lapsed customers and starting to acquire new customers. What's also encouraging is we\u2019re starting to see increased traffic in our branches and our sales reps are now having more value based conversations with customers, which help us solidify our relationships. We remain optimistic for the U.S. business in 2018.","Turning to guidance. Page 10 covers our updated guidance for the year. In January, we had shared what was on the left side of the chart. For the year, we had expected 3% to 7% sales growth, minus 2% to 6% operating earnings growth and 13% to 24% EPS growth. We now expect sales growth of 5% to 8% for the year, operating earnings growth of 6% to 14% and EPS growth of 25% to 33%.","The new revenue guidance is driven by better price deflation on market based price increases and better mix, along with improved currency. The strong volume performance in the U.S. will be offset by lower volume in Canada as we execute the turnaround. Operating margin is now expected to be 11.1% to 11.5% on improved GP rate and expense productivity.","I wanted to give a little bit more detail on our performance in Q1 versus our new guidance for the year. For simplicity, I'll refer to the midpoint of our guidance ranges. We expect momentum to continue in 2018. The shape of our growth curve hasn't changed. We still expect higher growth in the first half of the year; although, a whole curve has risen on higher expected sales growth for the year.","Some of the favorability that we saw with GP expense in the first quarter was one-off in nature, and we don't expect it to repeat. I'll talk about that in a minute. And we decided to maintain our expectations for Canada's 2018 operating margin despite better performance in Q1. We are cautiously optimistic about Canada, but it's too early to adjust our expectations.","So let's take a closer look at our performance in Q1. EPS exceeded our expectations by $0.75 in the quarter, $0.20 was U.S. volume and price, and we expect that to repeat each of the next three quarters. Another $0.45 was one-off in nature, and we expect it not to repeat. That include the tax benefit from stock-based awards some international business favorability, the timing of certain contract negotiations and a change in accounting estimate in the U.S. And finally, $0.10 of our beat is timing related and will reverse in the year and this includes Canada's favorability. So this gets us from the original 13.55 to 14.08 at the midpoint.","And finally, before opening up to questions, I wanted to spend just a moment on price cost spread in the U.S. We previously had expected a price headwind of 2% for the year, that 2% was a net number composed of negative 3% from the wrap round of our August 2017 pricing reset, which was offset by plus 1% from favorable mix and market based price increases.","Today, we are updating the total price headwind to minus 1.5%. The make-up the still minus 3 from our pricing actions, but we now expect the price mix to improve. We still expect 50 basis points of COGS deflation for the year, driven by our internal product cost initiatives like PPO as same as we indicated with our prior guidance. COGS deflation was much more favorable in the quarter due in part to timing from our national sales meeting. We expect COGS deflation to moderate through remainder of the year.","In summary, overall, we're very pleased with our progress. Our pricing changes in U.S. are resulting in strong growth with gross margin rates above our expectations. We're developing strong relationships with customers of all sizes. We're moving very fast in Canada and seeing signs of progress. Our online model continues to drive strong revenue growth and margin expansion, and our international businesses are contributing to earnings.","We continue to get strong expense leverage across the business, and we are on track to achieve the productivity targets that we laid out at Analyst Day in November. And we are well positioned to gain share and improve our economics going forward.","So with that, I'll open it up for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Glynn","Digging into the U.S. medium customer, I was interested in the staging of the customer acquisition levers that you plan to pull, what's the attraction there so far versus the reengagement what you've felt dormant customers.","D. G. Macpherson","As I mentioned, there are really three sources to that growth; one is getting more share with active customers; another is reengaging lapsed customers who've been customers in the past; and the third is the acquisition piece. We're going to spend time talking about more details in the near future. But we\u2019re seeing growth across all three of those. I would say we\u2019re still fairly early days in the new customer acquisition piece, but we have dedicated some marketing dollars to acquire new customers, and we've seen we've seen good response with that.","Christopher Glynn","And then the U.S. margins up 120. Just wondering if you could disaggregate that beyond how we could triangulate from the slide, just in terms of the ongoing upside versus the timing of the contract negotiations? And I think you said the accounting change had a little more impact in the first quarter?","D. G. Macpherson","So the accounting change does not have an impact on operating earnings. It's just shifts from GP to expense. When we look at what we saw in the first quarter, we're obviously happy with the expense leverage we're getting. And we're happy with what we're seeing from the customer response, both from a volume and from a price point level. So without going into too much detail, there were some elements that we talked about in detail that will not repeat that are in that number, but a lot of the benefit we think is real from the U.S.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Manthey from Baird. Please proceed with your question.","David Manthey","Am I understanding it right that your net pricing is coming up a bit, because market pricing is higher and some of your prices to your customers change contractually. Is that what you just say?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes. So it's not all contractual, but what we've seen is, given some commodity price increase, we've seen some market prices creep up, and we've been able to take those. And our COGS performance has been better than those price increases. So effectively for us, that shows our best price cost spread and we think we\u2019re going to have a little favorability for the year relative to what we originally expected.","David Manthey","And then as it relates to your price reset parameters. If market prices, more broadly adjust over the year, does that incrementally make your level of pricing more competitive and could that be some of what we're seeing or is it just too early to say that that's what's going on or to small in magnitude?","D. G. Macpherson","So just as a reminder, so our pricing philosophy is to price to market and we've gotten prices to what we think are the right market levels. If market prices go up, we will watch that closely and make some adjustments. We're seeing two benefits, one is a little bit of inflation and the other is from our customer mix where we're seeing growth with attractive customers at higher margins and with attractive volumes sources within existing customers as well. So there is really two going on, one is the inflation benefit that we get and the other is customer mix benefit.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions.","Ryan Merkel","So first question for me just back to the non-repeating items that you called out. Can you just add a little more color to each piece? And then I'm hoping that you can quantify each component of the $0.45?","D. G. MacPherson","So let me just describe. So tax benefit from stock-based awards, that's pretty clear. I think the one that's probably not, maybe not as obviously, is we had a change in accounting estimate, that's really we had a number of customers who have been on cash accountings, because we were very conservative. And when we looked at their credit risk, it's similar to rest of the business. We made a change that's going to now be an accrual system. So that's a modest portion of the $0.45. But that's the one that probably is a little bit odd, the others are fairly self-explanatory. And we're not providing necessarily the detail on the each -- the impact of each of those at this point.","Ryan Merkel","And then on gross margin, the quarterly cadence for year is a little different than I was thinking. There is some noise I guess in the first quarter\u2019s gross margin. But can you just clarify, how much gross margins declined sequentially into the second quarter? And then could you also comment on the trend line, is it stable to slightly rising sequentially from the second quarter?","D. G. MacPherson","So the things that were unusual in the quarter, Ryan, one is the timing of our sales meeting. And so we would expect the second quarter to be slightly lower, because that benefit was in the first quarter and won't be in the second quarter. It will be an offset effectively. Other than that, things are actually I think pretty stable with our GP rate.","Ryan Merkel","So just one more follow up, I guess. So should mix and improving price help gross margins as we think about the second half of this year and entering 2019, is that still the plan?","D. G. MacPherson","Well, that's why we changed our expectations on GP, because of the customer mix and the inflation and that's why we've raised the U.S. 0.5 percentage point. So yes, that's absolutely the expectation for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions. ","Robert Barry","I just wanted to actually follow up on that. I mean, big picture it doesn't seem like your view on the gross margin performance is changing that much. Is that right? I mean, you still expect it down 110 and that was 130 last quarter?","D. G. MacPherson","Yes, that's right. ","Robert Barry","And I think the math, if you were down 60 in the first quarter, would actually imply a fair amount more pressure in the remaining quarters to be down 110 for the year. Your answer to the last question about just a modest, what sounded like a modest noise from the prior accounting suggested that in fact it could be a lot better than that. So I'm just trying to understand, I guess just a clarification on the cadence?","D. G. MacPherson","We actually think it\u2019s going to be fairly stable. It's all really the sales meeting driving that difference. So it was a fairly significant benefit in the first quarter. And so when you take that out, there is really not sequential down really.","Robert Barry","So just to clarify, you do think the gross margin will be down a little bit in the second quarter versus or maybe fair amount in the second quarter versus first quarter. And then it will remain stable?","D. G. MacPherson","No, we\u2019re not. And we\u2019re not giving quarterly guidance on GP, we don\u2019t do that. So we\u2019ll talk more about it as we go forward. But we would say that the one thing we wanted to highlight is the timing of the sales meeting. We also had some benefit from COGS deflation in the quarter that was better than we had expected. Some of that is actually timing as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. ","Scott Graham","I wanted to beat the dead horse here, the $0.45. How does the timing of contract negotiations -- how specifically does that translate into something positive? Is there some backdating there or how does that work?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, if the contracts push out and we don\u2019t get them completed, then we haven\u2019t lowered the price for our customer yet. And so that\u2019s why it\u2019s a benefit that we don\u2019t expect to continue, because we will complete those contracts.","Scott Graham","And it looks to me like your revenue recognition change analysis in the back is exclusively about the revenue recognition. So the gross profit that you show here is not reflective of this, whatever piece of the $0.45 is, yes?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, right. We\u2019re only talked two separate things, we\u2019re talking about revenue recognition in the back that\u2019s the accounting standard change that we talked about before. I think you are asking a question about the accounting change for revenue recognition for some form of the cash based customers, that\u2019s a very -- that\u2019s a small piece of the $0.45, it\u2019s separate.","Scott Graham","That\u2019s a small piece, which would make the timing of the contract negotiations a larger base?","D. G. Macpherson","There is a number of pieces that add up to the $0.45 and that does all contribute.","Scott Graham","And my last question is I don\u2019t know how closely you guys have looked at some of the tariffing, I\u2019ll call it, going on out there, U.S., China, even a little bit of Russia. I was just wondering if you guys are looking this lay of the land, how this affects you?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, so we have looked at it. We will continue to look at it. It\u2019s a little bit unclear yet that the impact it\u2019s going to have on some of categories we participate in. We look at it two ways; one is understanding the financials the other is making sure that we\u2019ve got the right decision on sourcing. And depending on certain tariffs, we may lose suppliers as well. So we don\u2019t have a conclusion. Obviously, certain tariffs will be very inflationary for the market and others might not. And so we\u2019re looking at the specifics to understand what we will need to do.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Robert McCarthy","Well, what a difference a year makes. Good job in the quarter, and I don\u2019t want to be a Grinch, but I feel get asked some questions along those lines. I guess, the question I would have is how should we think about your embedded guidance in the back half of the year for revenue growth around anniversarying these compares, particularly as your pricing reset. And then I guess the question is, how do you think the situation? Do you think you\u2019re going to have to have some further price cuts as you get price discovery or what\u2019s embedded in your guidance with respect to further pricing actions if you anniversary volumes and you don\u2019t see quite the demand response you saw for the first half of the year?","D. G. Macpherson","So let me break that in two buckets. I would say one of the things we're seeing is that for large contract customers, our pricing has always been competitive and so we're not seeing substantial GP rate contraction with large customers. I think it's relatively business as usual. I think we're going to execute well, and we still have a lot of growth with large customers.","Mid-size customers, what were findings is that price points we\u2019re at are actually good for both acquiring customers and reengaging relapse customers, and we have not reached yet a large portion of that market. So I feel like we have a fairly long runway to grow with midsize customers, and certain large customers where we haven\u2019t historically had contract. So while we've always said the back half of the year will be lower revenue growth, because of the comparisons, we feel like we\u2019re well positioned to continue to gain share.","Robert McCarthy","And just as a follow-up in terms of brass packs, I mean what are do you expect -- what you can share about the business, the EPG time frame, because I think you are not disclosing monthly sales anymore. You will be out at some of the conferences. But what do think will be the mid quarter update topic around, we\u2019ll be traction of U.S. medium-size, we\u2019ll be talking about Gamut, we\u2019ll be talking about the back half. Just try to set this table for what are going to do the key topics, because we're stuck because the submarine goes down for about a month and a half before we -- or a months before we speak with you again.","D. G. Macpherson","So I think the two topics are going to be; one mid-size customers understanding a little bit more detail what we're seeing with that with that group; and the other will be around digital broadly. So I think those will be the topics that we focused on that will be additive and new.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Baumann","Can you just talk about -- looks like that the slides you pulled out the commentary on monthly daily sales by segment. I'm just curious has U.S. segment progressed by month through the quarter? And really the question along the lines of your commentary around the expected second half volume slowing and I'm guessing that's just comps. But I was just curious if you saw anything intra-quarter that makes you stick with that forecast?","D. G. Macpherson","No, I mean they really were very minor changes in terms of the demand environment and volume throughout the quarter, throughout the entire business.","Patrick Baumann","On the MRO market, you said up 3 to 4 now versus 2 to 3. Is that really what's driving the increase in the U.S. volume growth expectations from 6 to 7, it's the market?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes. So the market is a big portion of that and we're also seeing some higher share gain with midsize customers for sure than we expected, and with large customer as well. So it's a bit of market and share gain.","Patrick Baumann","And then on the price cost, the change from 1.5% to 1%. What's the U.S. segment margin guidance now for the year? Is it just 50 basis points better than it was before? And just curious on that price cost. Is that going to exit the year in your current planning as a positive contributor in the fourth quarter?","D. G. Macpherson","So in terms of GP rate, we're 20 basis points better than we were previously in terms of what we expect for the U.S.","Patrick Baumann","In GP, but I was talking total segment margins?","D. G. Macpherson","On earnings\u2026","Patrick Baumann","Margin guidance for the year segment, you gave guidance\u2026","D. G. Macpherson","We haven't given margin guidance for the year for the U.S. segment. No, we're anticipating -- no, we're obviously encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing.","Patrick Baumann","And then price cost for the year exiting 4Q. I mean, do you think it will be positive?","D. G. Macpherson","I think you may be asking two questions simultaneously. So what we talked about is our reset this year is going to be 200 basis points decrement. And then we talked about positive price cost above that. And so yes, price costs are going to be positive for the year for sure. It will happen to going into next year, we'll start talking about that later in the year as we would expect that 300 basis points to go -- hoping much smaller and we\u2019ll probably won't talk about that really until November.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dean Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray","I wanted to follow up -- what's also interesting from this call I feel little badly for D.G., because you have to answer as a CEO and CFO at the same time. So I appreciate that, it\u2019s a little more challenging but lot of good color here. I want to go back to price cost, if I could. Just to reference early in your prepared remarks about mix has had a benefit here. And maybe give us some examples of how mix enters into this. I guess, intuitively you would think that you're not selling as much as of those products that have the deepest price discounts. But maybe you can just clarify provide some color there, please.","D. G. Macpherson","Deane, I think most of the benefit we're actually seeing is customer mix. So the fact that mid-size customers have generally higher GP rates and are less on negotiated prices than large customers. And so historically the last six or seven years, we've been growing large contract volumes faster than mid-size customers that has reversed, and so you get some positive mix benefit on the GP.","Deane Dray","And then in Canada, the ability to put 7% price increase. How does that compare or maybe it's completely different market, but you pricing power in Canada compared to the market and versus pricing strategy in the U.S. Where is the breaking point for you in Canada?","D. G. Macpherson","So I think it's really not even close to a comparison. The reality is that as we went through our ERP implementation in Canada and the Canadian dollar few years ago went down, we did not pass through price increases that the rest of the market did. So we got to a position where prices are well below market. And as we've improved our service and come out of that, we've been able to pass some of those prices through. So it's really not even analogous situation at all today.","Deane Dray","Just let me -- if I can sneak one more in. Any color on Cromwell?","D. G. Macpherson","Cromwell is performing as expected at this point. We've made a bunch of changes to that business. We've read on the supply chain, which is performing much better, put in a new Web site and that's performing better. But it's performing as expected.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Cieslak from Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Ryan Cieslak","My first question, D.G., is when you look at the guidance on the price COGS or the gross margin I think you guys are looking at price deflation or COGS deflation around 50 basis points. It seems like that\u2019s consistent now for the balance of the year. Is that the case? And if it is, can you just help us maybe understand maybe some of the offsets that you\u2019re able to deploy as it relates to maybe as we\u2019re hearing more about inflation pressures throughout the industrial supply chain right now?","D. G. Macpherson","And I\u2019ve talked about this before. If we had not have the initiatives we had, we would have had COGS inflation this year of 2%, 3%, 4%, somewhere in that range. And so our own efforts around line reviews, managing COGS, PPO, we call PPO that\u2019s basically going through and understanding the cost of our products and working with suppliers to get the right assortment and the right cost. Those efforts have had a significant impact, and that\u2019s why we expect slightly negative COGS inflation this year.","Ryan Cieslak","And D. G., I mean would it be fair to assume though you\u2019re having maybe better benefits from some of stuff considering it seems like inflation over the last couple of months has picked more and certainly maybe some of the tariffs that could be rolling through as well?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, and so I think I would probably tease those into two. One is I think we\u2019re getting the benefit we expected. I don\u2019t know that\u2019s necessarily better than we expected, it\u2019s quite an important benefit or one that the team has done a nice job of. I think in terms of things like tariffs that would be something the whole market would see and we would then be raising price to offset those if in fact those tariffs were to become reality. So we\u2019re watching those closely. That would be a separate issue generally.","Ryan Cieslak","And then for my follow up and thinking about the incremental gross margin or gross profit contribution from medium size volume growth for you guys. Does that change at all going forward as you start to see new customer acquisition pick up in that overall mix of incremental volume, meaning maybe cost to serve those new customers is going to be a little bit higher than gaining incremental volume from existing customers? Thanks.","D. G. Macpherson","We\u2019ll probably talk about that as we go forward. I think the incremental margins on that mid size customer are strong obviously, which is great. New customer acquisition does have a little bit different economics, although it would still be very positive to the business we believe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Dankert","Just want to get quick update on Canada. I believe the expectation was getting margin to a positive number, and exiting the year on a run rate basis. Is 4% still the bogie or just given how that\u2019s rolled out, that\u2019s have been pushed further into \u201919 at this point?","D. G. Macpherson","No that\u2019s still -- we have the exact same expectations we had in November for the Canadian business at this point. That has not changed.","Chris Dankert","And then I guess if you just expand a bit on freight. Obviously, we\u2019ve seen those numbers go up quite a bit. Has any of the cost indications then on that aspect how successful that has been? And then just any color around freight would be really helpful?","D. G. Macpherson","So I think to understand freight impact, you have to understand how our freight works. In U.S., most of our orders actually go through parcel, although not necessarily most of the dollars. And we do not own our own fleet. So we use third parties. We have contracts with third-parties. Certainly, for truckload and less than truckload volume, there is a lot of upward freight pressure right now. We don't do a whole lot of truckload and we do some LTL. And so we are actively managing that. Certainly, there's some upward pressure. We probably have managed it well, so far, I would say and we\u2019re watching it very closely.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Evelyn Chow","This is actually Evelyn Chow from Goldman. Maybe just starting on 1Q, I just want to make sure we have a good handle on the moving parts on gross margin. So specifically as it relates to the trade show and the COGS deflation, what benefit did you actually get in the quarter from that?","D. G. Macpherson","About 20 basis points in the quarter from that.","Evelyn Chow","And then just turning to the timing of the contract renegotiations, it would be helpful to get some rationale as to the decision to defer. Is it decision to maybe think about different customer accounts that you\u2019re targeting, is it a reflection of the pricing or demand environment? It would be helpful just to understand what push that out.","D. G. Macpherson","This is not our decision at all. This is just customer processes potentially taking longer than we have thought they might take. So we aren\u2019t deferring anything. These are customer processes that are taking time to work through.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner from Gabelli and Company. Please proceed with your question. ","Justin Bergner","Maybe you could just talk about the other businesses a bit. How is Zoro performing, any trends there or any of those sub components?","D. G. Macpherson","I would say that the online businesses continue to grow very strongly, and continue to have strong margins. They\u2019re performing as we would expect. The international piece of the portfolio really is a much narrower piece of the portfolio, it's Cromwell, Fabory, China, Mexico and some export business at this point. So we've gone through a fairly long process of cleaning up that portfolio. And the good news is that is all profitable and contributing to profitability for the company. So we feel good about having the right portfolio at this time.","Justin Bergner","And then any change to your long-term capital allocation, medium term capital allocation plans with this improved guidance. I know that you continue to repurchase shares fairly actively. But any change there?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, I'm going to let Tom get more than three days under his belt before we dive into that. But we\u2019re not changing anything right now, but we will continue to talk to our board about long-term capital allocation as we move forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Hamzah Mazari","The first question, D.G., is just you mentioned you have not reached a large portion of the medium customer market, which suggest you\u2019re in early innings of share gain. I was hoping you could maybe share some data points around maybe what was your market share in 2011. Last time you grew with medium customers, or maybe some other data points to verify that you haven't reached the large portion of that market, what's your customer account versus overall medium customer account. Any data points to help us understand sustainability of share gains in that segment?","D. G. Macpherson","I think I would point to a couple of things. One is we were $1.5 billion to $2 billion in mid-size customers at one point, which is probably 3% or 4% market share, we\u2019re down to 2% now. So that's -- it's small in either case but we think we can certainly grow share. We think there are $0.5 million of attractive mid-size customer we have relationships with $60,000 plus of them. So we feel like there is a long runway of mid-size customers to acquire and to build relationships with.","Hamzah Mazari","And then just on the COGS deflation. Is the PPO project covered all your SKUs? Is that project behind you? I know we didn't have this project in 2016. I don't know if we had it last year. But just any color as to -- is that project behind you now and we\u2019re seeing the benefits of that or is there more room to go in terms of other SKUs or revenue to cover?","D. G. Macpherson","So it\u2019s been ongoing for several years. And it was a little bit new way of thinking about how we manage our assortment in COGS. I would say that every year, we run different processes for different parts of the portfolio. In some cases, the much simpler part of the process and some cases, it's more involved like PPO. But we're certainly not done, we're going to continue to work on the assortment and we always start with the assortment, and the cost of that assortment. And so that will be a consistent process for us.","Hamzah Mazari","And just to follow up. Did you guys have any impact from -- I know you don't give much details. But any impacts from Easter or weather in your Q1? Thank you.","D. G. Macpherson","So Easter would have been a very small impact and probably not worth talking about. I would say, the weather, we had 1% increase in seasonal sales a lot of that was nor Easters it\u2019s just pounding or I guess the East. So that was most of that in March.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Duncan with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions. ","Matt Duncan","So first thing I've got, I'm hoping you can give us a little bit of clarity here on gross margin. So your guide before has been a 130 basis point decline with the 70 bp drag from the accounting change, it\u2019s now 110 basis point decline with only a 50 bp drag implying that the underlying gross margin hasn't really changed. And yet you're updating in a positive way the price cost spread in the U.S. So how do we reconcile those two things together?","D. G. Macpherson","So net-net the expectation is that the underlying GP will be 20 basis points better than we had said back in the fourth quarter.","Matt Duncan","But there is a 50 bp better in U.S. price cost spread. So is there somewhere else in the business where gross margins are a little lower than you thought before?","D. G. Macpherson","No, that\u2019s just the impact of that 50 bp. 50 basis points of price equals 20 basis points of GP.","Matt Duncan","And then just in terms of what you're seeing so far D. G. with organic Gamut. Can you give us any update on where you are in the roll-out of Gamut and what you're seeing in there?","D. G. Macpherson","Well if you call, we're actually merging Gamut and Grainger.com and building a lot of those capabilities into Grainger.com at this point. The team is working to build those capabilities and we'll provide a bit of an update at EPG in May.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with Keybanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. ","Steve Barger","With medium customer growth running the way it is, I'm curious if the incremental volumes coming through the digital channel are more through inside sales reps and how much room do you have in terms of inside sales capacity?","D. G. Macpherson","So it\u2019s coming in both places and we\u2019re seeing nice growth with the covered customers through inside sales. But we\u2019re seeing very high growth through digital channels as well, so it\u2019s really coming in both places. We have capacity in inside sales and we will add capacity if that makes sense, so we are not constrained if we\u2019re getting profitable growth. But so far, we\u2019re seeing it both places and really just continuing to dive and understand the sources of benefit.","Steve Barger","And based on the 4Q presentation, free cash flow guidance $810 million to $850 million for the year. 1Q came in it at $97 million even with less than 25% of the projected CapEx for the year. I know it typically ramps through the year. Can you talk about how you see free cash flow coming in given the early trends?","D. G. Macpherson","We expect it to be at the higher end of that range for the year, the range we talked about before.","Operator","Our next question is a follow up question from the line of Justin Bergner with Gabelli and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Bergner","On the gross margin 20 basis points improvement. Is that almost all mix towards medium customers or is some of that general price cost?","D. G. Macpherson","It\u2019s a little bit of both. It\u2019s a combination of both.","Justin Bergner","And then what\u2019s driving the price cost just the better end market environment that\u2019s allowing you to get a better spread there or are there other factors?","D. G. Macpherson","Market price increase is due to inflation and our ability to not take those in product cost that difference.","Operator","We have a follow up question from the line of Patrick Baumann with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Baumann","I just have one more and I know this question has been asked a bunch of times in the call, and I am not sure I quite understood the answer yet. So the U.S. segment margin in the first quarter was 16.7 and it does include some favorability from items that you don\u2019t expect to repeat for the year. is this timing related or something? What\u2019s the underling margin in the first quarter ex those items, can you give color on that?","D. G. Macpherson","We don\u2019t give color on that typically, it was good though.","Patrick Baumann","And maybe just last question just on the capital allocation priorities. Will there be a relook for the new CFO coming in, or how does that typically work?","D. G. Macpherson","I would assume that the CFO we want to relook at pretty much everything. So yes, I would expect it would be a relook. I don\u2019t know when the timing will occur.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Belfiore with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Belfiore","So I just wanted to touch on a couple of things that have - you talked a little bit about. So just in terms of the pricing increases versus mix and on the 1.5% full year. Can you provide a little bit of color in terms of the mix portion of that versus the price?","D. G. Macpherson","No, I mean both are significant contributors but we\u2019re not providing that level of detail.","Chris Belfiore","And then in terms of reaching the larger remaining portion of the medium customer base. What are the initiatives that gives you the confidence that that\u2019s achievable? And how much of that is factored into longer term 6% plus volume growth that you guys are expecting?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, I mean our expectation is that a lot of that will be through digital means initially where we acquire customers through digital meter and then figure out how to best serve them. I think what we're seeing with some other digital efforts so far gives us confidence that that will be a positive contributor. And certainly, we made the change with the idea of reengaging existing customers and driving more volume through existing customers, and we reengaging lapse customers and acquire new customers, so all of that is important to our expectations going forward.","Chris Belfiore","And that\u2019s factored into the volume growth expectations that you guys have given or is that like above and beyond that?","D. G. Macpherson","It's factored in although it's not a big portion of the 6% in the next couple of years, the expectation is longer term and that will become a bigger portion of it.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to hand the call back to Mr. Macpherson for closing comments.","D. G. Macpherson","Thanks everybody for joining us. Obviously, we're very pleased with our progress in the U.S. We're pleased that pricing changes are resulting in strong growth with gross margin rates above expectations. I think we're probably most pleased with the fact that we\u2019re really developing stronger relationships with customers and all different types of customers.","In Canada, we like the progress we've made to-date, still a lot of work to go, but we really see signs of progress and we're excited to get that business back to a profitable state. And then our online model continues to drive great revenue and profitable growth, and our international businesses are all contributing. And we\u2019re very happy with the expense leverage we've seen and continue to focus, we will continue to focus on making sure that we spend money wisely to drive growth and to serve our customers, and to improve our productivity. So we feel like we are really well positioned to gain share, improve our economics going forward. And thanks for being with us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."],"10059":["W.W. Grainger, Inc. (NYSE:GWW) Q3 2015 Earnings Conference Call October 16, 2015  7:30 AM ET","Executives","Laura Brown - SVP, Communications and IR","Bill Chapman - Senior Director, IR","Analysts","Operator","Laura Brown","Hello. This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's 2015 third quarter results. To supplement this podcast, please also reference our 2015 third quarter earnings release issued today October 16th, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations Website.","Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions, and competitive and regulatory expectations, and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our SEC filings including our most recent periodic reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q which are available on our investor relations website for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.","I\u2019d like to begin by providing some context regarding the current environment for industrial companies. We\u2019ve talked about the impact of oil and gas prices, the strong U.S. dollar and China\u2019s economic slowdown on our performance. In addition, the performance of the following key indicators over the past 12 months further illustrates these challenges.","The ISM purchasing managers index was 50.2 in September down versus last year indicating an economy no longer in expansion mode overall. The industrial production index has fallen for most of the year as well. The Canadian dollar has fallen 21%, copper prices are down 22%, cold roll steel prices are down 25%, and crude oil prices are down 60%.","The drop in the price of raw materials underscores the weak demand environment and oversupply of commodities and in many cases the weakness has sped up in the past three months. As these economic indicators decline, we\u2019ve seen that downturn take hold in the industrial economy. In response, we have begun the process of bringing our cost structure in line with current trends and activity levels.","We announced the closure of 26 branches and eliminated 170 field positions in the United States. In Canada, we have eliminated more than 100 roles and closed four branches since the beginning of June. We have substantially completed the closure of our business in Brazil. We continue to restructure our Fabory business in Europe which is expected to be completed this year. And we decided to transition our business in Costa Rica from a local branch based model to being served via our U.S. based export operations.","These actions resulted in $0.11 charged earnings per share in the quarter. You can expect more actions in the fourth quarter and into next year. At the same time we took advantage of our strong financial position to invest in the future growth and performance of the business as follows. We added more than a 100 sales representatives in the third quarter and 300 year-to-date to better serve and penetrate large customers. We created a team to focus solely on our medium sized business. We acquired Cromwell Group Holdings Limited in the U.K. to further our growth in attractive MRO markets and leverage our internet expertise.","We took advantage of our improved capital structure and weakness in the stock market to aggressively buy back stock and we have made investments that lower our tax rate. You can expect us to share additional information at our analyst meeting on November 12.","So let\u2019s take a look at our 2015 third quarter results and our revised sales and earnings guidance. Please note that the following analysis excludes the $0.11 per share of charges unless specifically noted. Please see exhibit one for detail on these charges. Company sales declined 1%, operating earnings were down 9%, net earnings decreased 13% reflecting higher interest expense. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.03 for the quarter, a decrease of 8% versus the 2014 third quarter.","Now let's walk down the operating section of the income statement on an adjusted basis. Gross profit margins in the quarter decreased 110 basis points to 41.9%, versus 43% in 2014, primarily driven by faster growth with lower margin customers, lower supplier rebates tied to volume than expected volume and price deflation versus slight cost inflation due to the higher cost of imported U.S. sourced products for the business in Canada.","Operating expenses excluding charges were down 1% in the quarter, driven primarily by lower payroll and benefits and included $43 million in incremental growth in infrastructure related spending versus the 2014 third quarter. The company operating margin decreased 110 basis points to 13.9% versus 15% in the prior year primarily due to lower gross profit margins.","Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics. First, sales by segment in the quarter in the month of September; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2015 guidance and other key items.","As I mentioned, total company sales for the quarter were down 1%. The sales performance included 2 percentage points from acquisitions and a 3 percentage point reduction from unfavourable foreign exchange, excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales were flat consisting of 1 percentage point from volume and a one percentage point decline from price. By month, daily sales declined 1% in July, 2% in August and were flat in September. Sales in September included a 4 percentage point contribution from Cromwell.","Let's move on to sales by segment. We report two business segments: the United States, and Canada. Our remaining operations located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled \u201cOther Businesses\u201d.","Sales in the U.S. segment which accounted for 78% of total company revenues in the quarter were flat. This comprised of one percentage point from inter-company sales to Zoro, and a one percentage point decline from price. Daily sales increased 1% in July, were flat in August and declined 2% in September.","Let\u2019s review U.S. sales performance by customer and market for the quarter. Commercial, light manufacturing, retail and government were up in the low single digits. Contractor was down in the low single digits. Heavy manufacturing and reseller were down in the mid-single digits and natural resources were down in the high teens. Low oil prices continue to affect our natural resources and heavy manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 1% drag on U.S. sales in the quarter.","Now, let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 8% of total company revenues in the quarter and decreased 23% down 8% in local currency. The 8% sales decrease consisted of 17 percentage point decline from volume, partially offset by 4 percentage points from acquisitions and 5 percentage points from price.","Sales performance in Canada was driven by declines in the construction, oil and gas, retail, commercial, transportation, government and heavy and light manufacturing end markets. By month, daily sales in local currency declined 4% in July, 7% in August and 13% in September. We also lapped the acquisition of WFS Enterprises Incorporated on September 2.","Let\u2019s wrap up our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the other businesses. The other businesses represented 14% of total company sales in the quarter. Sales for these groups were up 18% and consisted of 12 percentage points of growth from the Cromwell acquisition and 22 percentage points from volume and price partially offset by a 16 percentage point decline from unfavourable foreign exchange. The organic sales increase was primarily driven by the single channel online businesses in Japan and in the United States.","Earlier in the quarter, reported sales results for July and August, and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at September. There were 21 selling days in September 2015, the same as the prior year. Company sales were flat in September of 2015 versus September of 2014. The sales performance included 4 percentage points from acquisitions and a 3 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange.","September was the first month to include sales from Cromwell and we left the WFS acquisition. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange organic sales declined 1% primarily driven by lower volume.","In the United States, September sales declined 2% which included a 2 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price partially offset by 1 percentage point from intercompany sales to Zoro. Let\u2019s review sales performance by customer end market in the United States for the month of September.","Government was up in the mid-single digits, light manufacturing and commercial were up in the low single digits, retail was down in the low-single digits, contractor re-seller and heavy manufacturing was down in the mid single digits, natural resources was down in the low 20s.","In the government end market, we saw strong performance from state customers as we focussed on two large departments of state budgets. The department of corrections and the department of transportation. For the month of September the direct and indirect effect of the energy sector accelerated to a 2% drag on sales.","Sales in Canada for September declined 28% in U.S. dollars and were down 13% in local currency. The 13% decrease consisted of an 18 percentage point decrease from volume partially offset by 5 percentage points from price. On an organic basis sales performance was driven by declines in the construction, oil and gas, commercial, light and heavy manufacturing, retail and transportation end markets partially offset by growth in the utilities, government, mining and forestry end markets.","Sales for our other businesses increased 40% in September consisting of 36 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition and 18 percentage points from volume and price partially offset by a 14 percentage point drag from unfavourable foreign exchange from the other businesses.","Similar to the quarter, organic sales growth in September was driven by the single channel online businesses in Japan and the United States. Daily sales in the month of October are currently down in the low single digits including the benefit from Cromwell. Excluding Cromwell sales performance is currently down in the mid single digits. As a reminder, October 2014 included 1% of sales from Ebola-related products.","Now, I'd like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.","Bill Chapman","Thanks, Laura. Since we've already analyzed company operating performance, let's jump right into performance by reportable segment. As a reminder, all the figures exclude the $0.11 per share of charges unless specifically noted.","Operating earnings in the United States decreased 5% versus the 2014 third quarter. This performance was driven by lower gross profit margins partially offset by lower operating expenses.","Gross profit margins in the quarter decreased 120 basis points versus the prior year, primarily driven by price deflation exceeding cost deflation and higher sales to Zoro reflecting the lower transfer price used to account for these intercompany sales.","Excluding Zoro, gross profit margins were down 90 basis points versus the prior year. Operating expenses decreased 2% in the quarter versus the prior year. Expenses were driven primarily by lower payroll and benefits which were partially offset by incremental growth and infrastructure spending of $30 million.","The operating margin for the U.S. segment decreased 80 basis points to 18.1% versus 18.9% in the prior year. In the absence of the growth spending we realized attractive operating leverage.","Let's move on to results for our business in Canada, adjusted for restructuring. Operating earnings were down 83% in U.S. dollars versus the prior year. The lower operating performance was primarily the result of lower sales, lower gross profit margins and higher operating expenses as a percent of sales driven by incremental cost from the WFS acquisition and SAP implementation.","Gross profit margins declined 130 basis points primarily due to unfavourable foreign exchange from products from U.S. based supplier in the lower margins at WFS, partially offset by price increases.","The operating margin in Canada for the third quarter was 2.2% versus 9.9% in the prior year. Incremental cost from the SAP implementation were $6 million in U.S. dollars, excluding SAP cost operating earnings were down 61% in U.S. dollars and the operating margin was 5%.","On an adjusted basis the other businesses generated $15 million in operating earnings in the 2015 third quarter versus $5 million in the 2014 third quarter. The operating earnings increase for the quarter versus the prior year was driven by strong results from the single channel businesses in Japan and the United States and included a $2 million contribution from Cromwell, partially offset by an incremental $2 million in start up cost for the single channel online business in Europe.","Other income and expense was a net $21 million expense in the 2015 third quarter versus a net $3 million expense in the 2014 third quarter. The increase in expense was driven by $12 million in higher net interest expense and $6 million in losses on the company\u2019s clean energy investment.","The incremental $12 million in net interest expense was driven by the $1 billion in long-term debt issued in June to buy back company shares. Beyond 2015, the company intends to issue new permanent debt of $400 million in both 2016 and 2017 to continue the share buyback program as announced in April.","Our investment in a limited liability company established to produce clean energy generated a loss of $6 million in the quarter. As part of supporting the operations of this entity, Grainger receives its share of energy tax credits.","For the full year, energy credits are expected to result in a reduction of approximately 1.3 percentage point in the company\u2019s effective tax rate. The company\u2019s tax rate for the quarter was 38.4% compared to 39.1% in the 2014 third quarter.","The lower tax rate in 2015 reflects the benefit of the energy tax credits partially offset by a higher proportion of earnings from the United States versus other jurisdictions with lower tax rates. The company is currently projecting an effective tax rate of approximately 37.2% to 37.6% for the full year 2015.","Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $366 million versus $329 million in 2014. The company used the cash generated and cash on hand to invest in the business and return cash to shareholder through share repurchases and dividend. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $82 million versus $84 million in 2014.","Our full year capital spending range is now $300 million to $350 million driven by postponing the construction of a new Edmonton distribution centre, moving SAP in Canada to 2016 and the timing of other supply chain infrastructure projects. We paid dividends of $77 million, reflecting the 8% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2015.","In addition, we bought back 3.4 million shares of stock for $735 million and ended the quarter with 10.3 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $82 million to shareholders in the quarter.","As reported in our 2015 third quarter earnings release, we lowered our sales and earnings guidance for the year given the performance to date and the expectation of continued economic weakness. With the change in the industrial economy, our guidance reflects what we\u2019re seeing in our customers\u2019 business.","Let's take a look at our current expectations. All figures include Cromwell and all comparisons are to prior year unless otherwise noted. We'll begin with sales. For the full year, we now expect sales growth in the range of down 0.5% to up 0.5%. Excluding Cromwell, we expect sales to be down 2% to down 1%.","For the fourth quarter, the new guidance implies a sales range of down 3% to up 0.5% sales growth. Excluding Cromwell, we expect sales to be down 7% to down 4% in the quarter. Also in the fourth quarter, we are up against difficult comps as 2014 included a 1 percentage point lift from sales of Ebola-related safety products.","Let's move to gross profit margins. For the full year, we are forecasting gross margin contraction of about 80 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting gross profit margins to decrease 150 basis points.","The price deflation and the mix of faster growth with lower-margin customers are driving the decrease. The Cromwell acquisition also contributes lower gross profit margins by 20 basis points.","Let's take a look at operating margins, which are adjusted to exclude charges. Keep in mind these margins are inclusive of the gross profit factors discussed above. For the full year we expect operating margin contraction of 85 basis points to 100 basis points. This includes incremental growth and infrastructure spending for the year at the high end of our range, as detailed in Exhibit 4.","For the fourth quarter, we are expecting operating margin contraction of 195 basis points to 250 basis points. The contraction in gross margin drives most of the change, with the lack of operating expense leverage a factor based on a more conservative view of sales volume. Cromwell represents about a 50 basis point drag on operating margin in the quarter, due to mix and eCommerce-related investments.","Next, the tax rate. We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 37.2% to 37.6% for the full year and for the 2015 fourth quarter. This range is higher than we forecasted in July because earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions represent a lower percentage of total company earnings. Clean energy investments are expected to contribute $0.09 per share to earnings for the full year.","Please mark your calendar for the following important dates. On Thursday, November 12th, we plan to release October sales, and we will host our Annual Analyst Meeting at our headquarters in Lake Forest.","On Tuesday, November 17th, Will Lomax, Vice President and Controller, and Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations, will participate in the Barclays Select Series: Industrial Distribution Forum in New York City.","Thank you for your interest in Grainger.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.","Laura Brown","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Grainger\u2019s Q4 earnings call. With me are D. G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Ron Jadin, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today maybe forward-looking based on our current view of future events, actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings.","Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with the corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q4 press release, which is available on our Investor Relations web site. D.G. will be covering the performance for the quarter, as well as give an update on our 2018 guidance. After that, we\u2019ll open for questions. D. G. to you.","D. G. Macpherson","Thanks, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. We know it is a busy earnings day and we appreciate you being on the call. So, 2017 was an important year for Grainger. We took action to become more relevant to our customers and to compete more aggressively in the market. We also saw the market grow for the first time since 2014.","In 2017, we announced a significant change to our pricing structure in the U.S. Pricing has been a barrier to our growth both with large and mid-size customers. This was a very complex change that required a lot of work, lot of collaboration, and great execution to pull off.","I am extremely proud of our team members for executing the way that they have this year and the results show clearly in the fourth quarter 2017 numbers. We saw our performance accelerate through the back half of the year, which is very encouraging. We executed the pricing change, while continuing to focus on making sure we create value for our customers.","In 2017, we also launched a new R&D website called Gamut, with a new way to think about product search. Given the positive early customer feedback we plan to combine the capabilities of Gamut with those of our industry-leading website Grainger.com to create the most powerful industrial website in the market.","In Canada, we laid the foundation for a complete business model reset and that began in late 2017. We are improving our service to customers, do more consistent direct-to-customer shipping. We are improving Canada\u2019s cost structure through branch reductions and the creation of North American centers of excellence, and we are improving our profitability to price increases and improve large customer solutions. We are now starting to see the benefits of that work, which I\u2019ll discuss later in the call.","Finally, in 2017, we announced a plan to take $150 million to $210 million of cost out of the business from 2018 and 2019. We continue to make strong progress on that plan. The actions and execution in 2017 reflect the culture we are reinforcing at Grainger. Everything we do is focused on delivering value to our customers in the most efficient and effective way possible. We are entering 2018 with a solid foundation.","With that, let\u2019s take a look at our results for the year. 2017 reported results included adjustments resulting in $112 million impact to operating earnings and a $1.44 impact to EPS. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results, which includes the items outlined in our press release. Looking at a total company adjusted results, sales increased 3% versus the prior year and gross profit dollars were flat. Operating expenses increased 3%, operating earnings were down 8%, and operating cash flow increased 3% for the year.","Turning to the quarter, our adjusted results for the quarter were better than expectations, total company sales in the quarter were up 7% that was made up of volume of 11% that was partially offset by price, which was down 3%. We also had a 1% decline due to our specialty businesses divestiture in the U.S. Gross profit dollars increased 4% as volume growth outpaced price deflation. Gross profit margin was better than expected due to the U.S. performance and Canada price increases.","We also realized expense leverage on higher volume. Operating expenses increased 4% on volume of 11%. All of that led to operating earnings growth of 4% in the quarter. I\u2019ll start by covering our other business category first. Other businesses include our online model and our international businesses. Sales were up 16%, which was almost entirely volume.","Our online businesses, which include Zoro in the US and MonotaRO in Japan continue to drive strong growth and profitability. Our international businesses performed in line with our expectations as a group and contributed to operating margin expansion in the quarter.","Turning to Canada, sales were up 5%, were flat in local currency. We introduced price increases in the second half of the quarter and we\u2019re happy with the response. Price was up 4% for the quarter, volume was down 4% for the quarter. Volume was down due to price increases and branch closures in the quarter. Overall, revenue was slightly better than our own expectations.","Operating expenses increased 2% in local currency versus the prior year as we made investments initiating the turnaround in Canada. Operating margin was better than expected in the quarter, due primarily to a higher gross profit rate as a result of the price increases and a benefit from inventory adjustments.","As you know, we are in the midst of a substantial transformation of the business in Canada. We are moving very quickly to reset the business. We are closing unproductive branches. We are leveraging the U.S. business more to North American centers of excellence. We are improving service by leveraging our distribution network in Canada and the U.S.","We are improving our large customer contact performance. I would say we\u2019re making strong progress on all of these initiatives. We remain committed to the plan we laid out in November for 2018 for the business. We did get more benefits earlier than expected in the quarter.","Turning to the U.S., we continue to see strong volume response to our pricing actions and we continue to see an improved demand environment. Sales were up 5%. This included volume growth of 11%, and price deflation of 5%. The demand environment has been consistently strong the last few months. Operating expenses in the U.S. were up 2%, showing leverage on 11% volume growth. Operating margin was better than expected in the quarter as expense leverage partially offset the decline in the GP rate.","Turning to more specifics in the U.S., we\u2019re continuing to see that our value proposition resonates with both large and mid-size customers when we remove pricing as a barrier. U.S. large customer volume increased 8% versus the prior year and 300 basis points sequentially. We ended 2017 having renegotiated about 80% of our contract revenue. We will continue to work on the remaining contracts in 2018. As planned the remaining contracts will be negotiated as renewals come up.","Large customers spot by and large noncontract customers both had stronger volume growth than the average for large customers in the quarter. U.S. mid-size customers continue to exceed our expectations, mid-size customer volume increased 26% over the prior year at 800 basis points sequentially.","We\u2019re seeing progress with our marketing efforts and progress against all mid-size customer groups. We are further penetrating existing customers. We are re-engaging lapsed customers, and we are acquiring new customers. For the first time in a long time, we are seeing significant mid-size volume growth at attractive margins.","Overall, we remain quite optimistic for the U.S. business heading into 2018. I wanted to briefly remind you of our expectations for driving productivity in the business, while improving the customer experience. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to get strong expense leverage in the quarter driven by strong volume performance and our diligent managing expenses.","We continue to be focused on improving our cost structure and focusing on the things that matter the most. Our targets for cost takeout have not changed. We continue to expect cost takeout and productivity of $90 million and $120 million in the U.S.; $50 million to $70 million in Canada; and $10 million to $20 million in the other areas of the business. Based on our performance in 2017 and our momentum, we\u2019re on track to achieve our productivity targets going forward.","Now, let\u2019s take a look at 2018 guidance I\u2019ll talk about the midpoint of guidance on this slide. If you recall, we shared at the Analyst Day in November, on the left side on the chart, from 2017 to 2018 at that point we expected 5% sales growth, 5% operating earnings growth, and 5% EPS growth. As we discussed, our 2017 actual results exceeded expectations that coupled with tax reform has altered our outlook for 2018.","We still expect sales growth of 5%, but now we anticipate operating earnings growth of 2% that\u2019s due to two things. The first is our decision to increase our digital investments with the portion of the excess cash that will result from a lower tax rate; and the second is our decision to maintain our expectations for Canada\u2019s 2018 operating margin despite better performance in the fourth quarter, just too early to build in that benefit in 2018.","The bottom-line is that we expect both higher sales and earnings dollars and a higher operating margin in 2018 and we suggested in November given the momentum that we\u2019re seeing. In addition, our EPS is now expected to grow 18% versus prior year. In the appendix you will find a slide that outlines the new revenue recognition accounting standards that requires to reclassify certain service costs from operating expense to cost of goods sold beginning in 2018. There is no impact to operating margin as a result of that change.","Taking a closer look, a little bit more detail on our operating margin and EPS guidance for 2018 compared to what we showed in November. If you look at our 2017 performance, our outperformance in the second half of Q4 resulted in a 0.4% benefit to operating margin and an almost $0.60 benefit to EPS.","As I mentioned, we decided to maintain our expectations for Canada\u2019s operating margin, despite our strong performance in the quarter that resulted in an operating margin of 11%, and an EPS of 11.70%. From there we factored other income incremental items that will occur in 2018.","We are expecting a lower tax benefit from our clean energy investments in 2018 then what was originally anticipated, that will be roughly $0.10 negative impact. That will raise our base tax rate from 35% to 36%. So, our corporate tax rate on that base is expected to go from 36% to 24.5% at the midpoint as a result of the new U.S. tax legislation that resulted in a $2.15 benefit to EPS.","We also, as I mentioned plan to increase our investments in digital. We will sell accelerate actions to combine Gamut capabilities with Grainger.com and accelerate our progress with our digital offering overall, that has a negative 0.2% impact on operating margin and a negative $0.26 impact to EPS.","Finally, we expect to have a $0.06 EPS benefit from additional share repurchases. At the end of all those adjustments, we expect 2018 operating margin to be 10.8%, and earnings per share to be $13.55.","Given the changes to the tax rate, we\u2019re updating our cash flow projections for 2018. We now expect to generate $1.1 billion to $1.18 billion of operating cash flow. As I mentioned, we will use some of that excess cash to make investments in our digital platform. The remainder will be used to repurchase additional shares, which reflects our confidence and our strategy going forward.","So overall, to summarize, we are very pleased with our progress. We have executed our pricing changes in the U.S. and are seeing strong growth with gross margin rates at our expectations. We are moving fast in Canada and starting to see some early signs of progress. Our online model continues to drive strong revenue growth and margin expansion. We\u2019re laser focused on driving performance in our core business. We continue to get strong expense leverage across the business.","Our team members have demonstrated throughout this year their ability to create value for our customers even in the midst of what has been a very complicated pricing change and while we still have the financial challenge of lapping our price changes in 2018, we are well positioned to gain share and improve our economics going forward.","So, with that, I will open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead with your questions.","Ryan Merkel","Hi thank you, good morning and congratulations on a nice quarter.","D. G. Macpherson","Good morning Ryan. Thank you.","Ryan Merkel","So, first question, the 11% volume growth really stands out. You\u2019ve been talking about 6% to 8%, so two-part question, first, do you view the upside as more a response to your price cuts versus the macro? And then secondly, are you just being conservative by not changing the sales guidance for 2018 at this early stage?","D. G. Macpherson","Right. So, thanks Ryan. I would answer those in succession. So, when we look at the 11% growth in the U.S. certainly part of that is an improving demand environment. It is a meaningful part, but not the majority. The majority is our own pricing and marketing actions driving that. So, certainly there is some demand tailwinds, which are great, but lot of this is just the changes we\u2019ve made.","The second part of that is, we're not going to change our projections this time. We are still four months in, five months in understanding what\u2019s going on with the volume response and so we\u2019re going to keep to our projections this time.","Ryan Merkel","Fair enough, but would you also say that there\u2019s no reason you see nothing out there that the 11% or something near that wouldn't be sustainable based on what you\u2019re seeing today?","D. G. Macpherson","What I would say is that, the demand environment has been very consistent the last three months heading into this year. So, there is nothing to suggest things are changing.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. And then, just second question on gross margin and the outlook there down 70 basis points, excluding the accounting, is there any upside from improved price cost? Are you starting to see some inflation from your suppliers?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes. We are starting to see some inflation from suppliers and we expect to have some price cost. We\u2019ve already built that in to the projections. I think a lot of what happens with GP rate in the U.S. will be determined by the mix of growth that we get. If we continue to see the mid-size customers and the large non-contract customers grow faster than the average we may have some upside, but we just have to wait and see.","Ryan Merkel","Very good. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","Our next questions come from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your questions.","Christopher Glynn","Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to ask another one on gross margin, you know with commodities and supplier inflation on an uptick here, in the context of your repricing strategies is pricing to inflation at odds with continuing to execute the volume response side of pricing?","D. G. Macpherson","No, not really. We will separate those two. So, the pricing actions we have taken, we really are tagging to the market and making sure we are market competitive, and then if market prices increase we will be able to realize that as well, if it is based on inflation. So, we view them as independent. We\u2019re focused on being competitive, but certainly as inflation comes we would expect to realize that as well.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. So, you\u2019re not nervous about a squeeze there, even if it is short lived, it doesn't sound like. And then just a housekeeping item, does the 2018 tax rate guidance reflect the full impact of the bill or is there a more mature run rate that we would pencil in for 2019?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, we are calling this provisional at this point. This is the best to our knowledge at this point, and we think we\u2019ve captured the key elements in the rate.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks.","Operator","Our next questions come from the line of Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead with your questions.","Adam Uhlman","Hi, good morning. I was hoping if you could give us some more color on the acceleration and sales growth with the medium-sized customers that you saw? Could you share any data on the active customer count, the re-engagement that you had with customers that had fallen off, has there been any change in the average order sizes, maybe just a little bit more detail so we can better understand the moving pieces there?","Ron Jadin","Yes. So, I won\u2019t provide too much detail on that. I will say that, if you recall, we have a fairly small portion of mid-size customers as customers today. The price change has had more impact with the existing mid-size customers early days, but we are starting to acquire new customers, but I would say our customer acquisition is still pretty nascent. So, it\u2019s really been mostly around existing customers buying more and then what we would call lapse customers, people who knew Grainger rebuying, but we are starting to acquire some new customers as well.","Adam Uhlman","Okay, thanks. And then D. G. could you comment on what you\u2019re seeing so far in your January sales, there has been some difficult weather and government shutdown impacts, maybe how we should be thinking about in the quarter, the cadence as we move through the year?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, I mean it\u2019s too early to comment much about January. We don't feel like the government shutdown is going to have much impact if it gets funded going forward. Obviously, if there is another shutdown that would change things. And the weather events are normal for this time of the year, I think certainly we\u2019ve had days when there has been some impact, but overall, we don\u2019t expect any of that to have a huge impact at this point.","Adam Uhlman","Thanks.","Operator","Our next questions come from the line of David Manthey with Baird. Please go ahead with your questions.","David Manthey","Hi good morning. D. G. your plan seems to be coming together better than most believe that it would, when you look at the current quarter outperformance what do you feel were the biggest contributors to that outperformance relative to your expectations going in?","D. G. Macpherson","I would say that almost all of the outperformance came in two places. One is the U.S. and the other is Canada. So that contributed about $0.60 of the outperformance. Obviously, given the U.S. size most of it was there. I would say, a little of that outperformance would be the market strengthening and the rest would really be around price and marketing and some of our sales activities with large local customers that are really getting traction. So that\u2019s where we could see most of the outperformance right now. And then Canada was - the rest of that and that was getting some traction on the price increase, which was a really important.","David Manthey","And just to be clear, did you say that the price increase was in the second half of the quarter or\u2026?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, it was.","David Manthey","Okay, and then a follow-up question. Was there something about the operating outperformance that you saw that $0.50 or so in the fourth quarter that leaves you to believe it was unsustainable into 2018? The reason I ask is that, given that all that outperformance was concentrated into one quarter, it just seems like the guidance might have stepped up by more than the $0.50 assuming that outperformance would have been spread out more evenly in 2018 than it was in 2017. So, is there anything about it or are you just being cautious here as you look out to 2018 and everything that\u2019s going on?","D. G. Macpherson","I think short-term we would expect, like I mentioned the demand environment continues to be strong. Lot of uncertainty of course to what happens throughout the year and so we built in the outperformance from the U.S. into the guidance, but we didn\u2019t assume that all of that continues throughout the entirety.","David Manthey","Okay, thanks to D. G. Good luck.","D. G. Macpherson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Please go ahead with your questions.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning everyone. How are you today?","D. G. Macpherson","Great.","Robert McCarthy","Good. So, I think - two questions or two sub questions, how are you want to typify, I think the first question is building of some, what David asked about, I mean clearly perhaps your conservatism could be due to the fact that the back half of 2018 will provide a very interesting compare environment, because you will be anniversarying the price comps and the volume response, so is that really where the base is of your caution with respect to right raise in the guidance further, is really the rubber hits the road in the back half of 2018, and will have a better sense than because then you will start to anniversary some of these actions?","D. G. Macpherson","Well I think, as I mentioned before, if you look at mid-size customers for example, most mid-size customers have not yet engaged with us, so I think there is probably a longer run way than just through the end of July to grow with mid-size customers and you would expect to continue to grow there. I think if we\u2019re being cautious, it\u2019s just, we don't have enough time history here to know exactly how this is going to play out. So, we are - we have got our targets and we are holding to our target, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.","Robert McCarthy","And then on the 2019 targets, I mean, any thoughts about how you're cadence and how that\u2019s looking there, is there any source of potential upside from those targets or do you at least think those targets remain very firm?","D. G. Macpherson","We\u2019re still very comfortable with those targets. We don't change long-term guidance at the quarter and we will continue to talk about that certainly in November when we [indiscernible].","Robert McCarthy","The final question obviously given the stock move and the fundamental performance improvement the CFO job is looking increasingly attractive or is there any updates as to when we will see a new CFO put in place?","D. G. Macpherson","I would say the process has moved along very, very well and we are deep into that process at this point. We will let you know.","Robert McCarthy","Best wishes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your questions.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning. Thank you. The first question is just around the portfolio and the question really is, does repatriation or tax reform longer term make you take a fresh look at the portfolio, whether it\u2019s the MonotaRO business or any other pieces of the business, just in terms of whether they belong or don't belong or whether the tax rules sort of change your view on monetization longer term?","D. G. Macpherson","So, I think the first thing I would like to say - Hamzah thanks for the question - is that we have gone through a lot of work over the last three years to get our portfolio to be where we think it needs to be, and so the business that we have that remain we think can be very successful. It\u2019s still early in the tax reform cycle to understand whether there will be significant implications throughout the portfolio, but right now we think the portfolio we have is the right one. We think we have competitive advantage in the places where we think we can grow the businesses and grow them profitably and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused on.","Hamzah Mazari","Got it. And just a follow-up question, if you could just remind investors on your government business and how that did and clearly the shutdown was only three days, but since it\u2019s topical and we saw some impact in 2013 in your business, I know federal is a smaller piece, but just any view on how that government business did and what we should be thinking about?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, so I think our government business is very strong. When you think about the government, if you're talking about the government shutdown, typically certain parts of the government sales and so as the military continues to buy and it continues to buy, they are a big part of our federal government. It has some impact, but for us if there is a shutdown that\u2019s short lived, it won't have tremendous impact. If it is long-lived, of course, all bets are off. But it's a fairly small - the part that was affected by the most recent shutdown was a pretty small portion of our portfolio.","Hamzah Mazari","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next questions come from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Please go ahead with your questions.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone. I was hoping to get some more color on the capital allocation decisions that you\u2019re making here with regard to the benefits of tax reform. So, to start with the spending on digital, with this in a plan before tax reform and maybe just give some color as to where and how this money will be spent?","D. G. Macpherson","Sure, thanks. So, for us as a company, the most important thing for us is to be successful and drive success over the long term. We took a look at the tax bill and took a look at where we might accelerate investment to ensure that we are successful. There is a host of things around digital. We\u2019ve certainly developed a lot of capabilities. This is really moving things forward in the cycle, and so accelerating things that we probably would have done over a longer time horizon and we feel like now is the time to do that, and there will be no regrets for making these investments and they are important to creating competitive advantage longer term. And so, we decided to pull this forward.","Deane Dray","Is there any way you give us some examples of what type of spending in the lines of digital?","D. G. Macpherson","So, we're not going to talk about specifics today, but we have a plan. We are likely to talk about that more around the EPG timeframe.","Deane Dray","Got it. And just last question is, can you provide any specifics on what the adjustments where to - or the add backs where to adjusted gross margin?","D. G. Macpherson","What do you refer\u2026","Deane Dray","I know you exclude restructuring, is there anything else?","D. G. Macpherson","Go ahead Ron.","Ron Jadin","Most of it is op expense. The ones that affect the cost of goods sold or GP would be the ones that have do with inventory primarily. So, as we go to close a branch we will increase reserve because some of the inventory that we would have sold over time now, we have to accelerate that process. So, we end up taking a hit to cost of goods sold as we increase that provision. That\u2019s predominantly what it would be. So, most of it is in expense out of that 112 million we talked about, we could do the math on that, but it\u2019s - I think it\u2019s 10 million, 15 million that would COGS.","Deane Dray","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Duncan with Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.","Matt Duncan","Hi good morning guys congrats on a great quarter.","D. G. Macpherson","Thank you.","Matt Duncan","So, first question I have got, D. G. I was hoping maybe you could give us just a little bit more granularity on the external ratio and volume you saw with U.S. large customers, you did mention that the spot buy volume and the non-contracted large customer volume both grew faster than the average, could you put some numbers on that by chance and sort of help us gauge what the acceleration was from the third quarter to the fourth quarter in those two categories?","D. G. Macpherson","I think the important point there, Matt is that, those two pieces of volume had been shrinking for several years. And now they\u2019re actually contributing to the growth and so both were - they were slightly better than the average, but that really jumped sequentially from what we have been seeing with both large local and spot buy. So, we saw, I think spot buy grow roughly 10, and large local grow roughly close to 10, little less than 10. So those were the numbers we saw.","Matt Duncan","Okay that\u2019s very helpful, thank you. And then another one on gross margin, sorry to keep beating you over the ahead with this, but just on the supplier price increases that you are seeing, what are those sort of on average and then historically one thing that I\u2019ve thought you guys have always done well over time is use inflation to help get a little bit of gross margin? Although this seems like a strange conversation to have right now, is there any chance that you might benefit a little bit as you sort of time how you increase your pricing around inflation or is that just not the way we need to be thinking about it, given the dynamics in your business right now?","D. G. Macpherson","No, I think it is the way to think about it. I think net, net of the repricing, we do believe that we will be able to benefit from inflation. To your question about what we\u2019re seeing from suppliers it\u2019s all over the map depending on what type of supplier they are, but, you know low single-digit inflation is kind of what we are seeing at this point on average. And so, we would expect to benefit some from that.","Matt Duncan","Okay, thanks D. G.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh with MRC. Please go ahead with your question.","Sam Darkatsh","From Raymond James hopefully. So, hi D. G., good morning. So, two questions if I could, your original guidance for pricing in North America, I\u2019m sorry in the U.S. was down 6% for both 3Q and 4Q and they ended up being down 5 in both quarters, was that due to a change in the pricing strategy or FX or was that you being conservative, or what was the reason for the delta between your actual pricing in U.S. and what you originally guided for?","D. G. Macpherson","It\u2019s pretty much all customer mix or type of buy mix. So, when spot buy and large local and mid-size grow as fast as they have then that is the benefit.","Sam Darkatsh","Got you. And then second question, I mean you still have 250 million in debt pay down anticipated for 2018, I\u2019m trying to understand why that is preferable over share repurchase, given the fact that your debt-to-EBITDA is still away about a turn or so, why is that an attractive use or use of cash?","Ron Jadin","Hi, Sam it\u2019s Ron. You know, I have to apologize that\u2019s a short-term debt and other, and by the end of next year it is really other. Our short-term debt at the end of this year is less than $50 million. I think it\u2019s about $40 million, and by the end of next year it\u2019s, a similar very small number. So really that 250 million, probably 200 million of it is cash, it\u2019s excess cash. So that could be applied to many things.","In November, I mentioned that that number was about 100. So that number is growing in part because of improved performance and tax change. So, we\u2019re reinvesting 40 million of that in CapEx as D. G. said and 80 million in share repurchase and there is more of that we could do with the excess cash that\u2019s still there assuming we deliver on that plan.","Sam Darkatsh","Thank you, gentlemen appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your questions.","Robert Barry","Hi guys good morning, and I\u2019ll add my congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to follow-up on the comments about benefiting from inflation, do you think you actually be pricing ahead of seeing it or is that a comment more due to like timing of inventory turns or something like that?","D. G. Macpherson","So, historically we\u2019ve seen benefits from our ability to manage COGS better than inflation that we have seen, and so I think that\u2019s probably the source of the benefit that we typically have had historically.","Robert Barry","That you think will occur again?","Ron Jadin","Well, in fact I just want to add, D. G. mentioned before low single digit inflation, on the items we are seeing inflation, but our plan for this year is still negative half a percent deflation given all the actions we take and continue to take to reduce cost with other suppliers where we're not seeing inflation.","D. G. Macpherson","I think the principle we always have as we price the market and then we get the best COGS and service we can. And so, if the market is increasing price and we\u2019re able to manage COGS better that\u2019s the benefit that we have seen historically that people refer to.","Robert Barry","Got it. And then you said the strong performance on the topline was mostly on your actions, the price cuts, the marketing, but anything you would call out in terms of end-markets did get notably better and may be in that commentator you could speak specifically about resellers just because it\u2019s especially strong? Thank you.","D. G. Macpherson","I think the strength is across the board, and I think you are always looking at sort of what\u2019s happened in the past, I think heavy manufacturing was strong. You know resellers were strong, it\u2019s still a pretty small portion of our overall mix though. So, I wouldn't really point to anything that unusual was in the end-markets.","Robert Barry","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner with Gabelli. Please go ahead with your question.","Justin Bergner","Good morning D. G. and congratulations on the good quarter as well. First question just relates to understanding sort of the break-out between - among the $0.50 that sort of better than expected earnings that Grainger delivered in the fourth quarter, I\u2019m just trying to sort of decompose that a bit, I mean it seems like about half of that is coming from the better sales growth, maybe some from mix, some from Canada, are those sort of the right buckets in the right general proportions and are there other drivers in that $0.50 be it versus your own expectations that you guys should be thinking about?","D. G. Macpherson","The bulk of that comes from the U.S. it is volume and expense leverage, so strong drop through rates on the volume and it\u2019s Canada. The Canada GP improvement. Those are the primary levers.","Justin Bergner","And then was mix also beneficial, given the medium customers are accelerating?","D. G. Macpherson","Mix is beneficial on the gross profit line for sure. Yes.","Justin Bergner","Okay. Another question I had is, as you think about the acceleration or large customers and medium customers and higher share wallet from your pricing changes, do you have a sense as to who your increasingly taking share from, is it sort of mom and pops and regionals or is it larger national players that you think are the share donors?","D. G. Macpherson","I think, historically and I think it\u2019s probably no different today. We\u2019re still on a very, very fragmented market, and so when we\u2019re gaining share typically it\u2019s from a very fragmented set, whether it\u2019s mom and pops or mid-size distributors or others. Mid-size customers, I think it\u2019s even probably more diverse in the sense that there is, they use retail sometimes and so if we\u2019re able to get that business than we might be taking it from other sources, but it\u2019s very fragmented.","Justin Bergner","Okay great, and then just finally quick clarification question, so between the P&L investments in digital and increased CapEx which seems mainly digital related as well, you\u2019re spending sort of an additional $50 million to $60 million on digital on 2018 versus where you are expect it to be before?","D. G. Macpherson","No, just the 40 that we're talking about.","Justin Bergner","Okay. So, the P&L impact of the increased investment is non-digital or\u2026?","D. G. Macpherson","So, the 40 is capital, probably more like 15 of expense and the depreciation on the 40 is - gets you to the 20 million impacts.","Operator","Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your questions.","John Inch","Thank you. Morning everyone. Hi D. G. and Ron, the gross margins were better in the fourth quarter and I was wondering if there was perhaps some more favorable benefit from say the rebates, and the reason I ask that is, the question is because it is the fourth quarter does it cause for some sort of a true-up for the year? So, if you\u2019re getting more rebates, do you have to actually recognize disproportionately more gross margin benefit because you have to average it over the course of the year, if that makes sense?","D. G. Macpherson","No, it\u2019s a great question and certainly with the additional volume we would be getting additional rebates, but that volume is brought into inventory, so those rebates are capitalized. We would see those rebates shortly in the P&L next year.","John Inch","Okay. So, there is no - in other words the gross margin improvement in the fourth quarter was all volume metric, there wasn't any other, some sort of accrual accounting impact that would not repeat?","D. G. Macpherson","No.","John Inch","Okay. Pricing was better or sort of down five versus down six, why was that again, was it just mix, I mean you\u2019ve answered a couple of questions saying it\u2019s mix, but was there some other phenomenon in the way the quarter played out?","D. G. Macpherson","Just customer mix, and volume mix.","John Inch","Okay. One more question from me, it looks like the trajectory or transportation cost UPS, freight and the like that seems to be sort of having significantly higher in the short term. How do you, just describe Grainger, like how do you actually pass through those costs to customers. I know that you sort of build UPS on top, but - maybe if you could just explain sort of what\u2019s going to be the impact of these costs and how you manage them?","D. G. Macpherson","I think we\u2019re actually doing quite a good job of managing our transportation cost and I won't go into details of where we expect those to go now. In general, to your question, it just depends on the customer. For many customer, we actually take the burden of transportation cost and it\u2019s included in their contract. Some do pay freight. We feel that\u2019s the best environment because we feel we could manage those costs, as well or better than anyone and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on there.","John Inch","Just one last thing, government, I mean you basically said D. G. the government is pretty strong or was pretty strong, MSC called out weak government in December, it sounds like you did not [indiscernible] what their excuse was, but it sounds like you [indiscernible].","D. G. Macpherson","I think some of that question goes to what we saw over November and December. For us the demand environment has been very, very consistent. 2016 was a little unusual on the sense that November I think was bad for everybody and December was good for everybody, so the compares can make you think that December wasn't as good well in fact, relative to our forecast and expectations, December was every bit of strong, if not stronger than November. And so, we didn\u2019t see anything from shutdown that caused any problems for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of indiscernible with Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your questions.","Patrick Baumann","Hi guys, good morning. Quick question on the segment margins for the U.S. Exiting the year to you guys were at 15%, I don't think you have changed the 2018 guide for U.S. segment margin, I think it\u2019s still 14.7% I guess at the midpoint. It\u2019s just another question trying to get at the conservatism or the guidance and why you\u2019re just following through the 4Q [ph] be through 2018 ops guide? So, just looking historically, the first quarter margin typically improves versus the fourth quarter. In the U.S. segment, can you remind me why that is and is there any reason this year would be different from previous years?","D. G. Macpherson","No. I mean. So, I'm just trying to understand your question. So, you are asking a historical or were the first quarter margins typically higher? [indiscernible]","Patrick Baumann","What is that?","D. G. Macpherson","That\u2019s related to price increase cycles typically. So, often we take - we have taken price increases early in the year, and so that has typically been the pattern that we have seen. This year, we - the patent will be similar since we are taking to price increases drops offset, which is price reset that we are going through.","Patrick Baumann","Got it, got it. Makes sense. And also, where is the digital investment, is that in other businesses, will that show up there?","D. G. Macpherson","No that is in the U.S. We\u2019re putting in the U.S.","Patrick Baumann","Okay, got it. And then, last question for me, just the volume pickup for mid-size and large spot noncontract that you saw through the quarter, I mean versus what you said at the mid-November investor meeting, it seems like, I guess you had it grown 6% for large, and 15 to 20 I think for mid-size and it was 8 for large and 26 for mid-size, was that just being conservative at the November meeting, was that just you guys being conservative or what was the growth, the pickup really back half weighted in the quarter, so it just surprised you there?","D. G. Macpherson","It\u2019s been better than our expectations and in November we had very short time horizon of working at that data. So, I think we\u2019re starting to get a better sense for what\u2019s going on now.","Patrick Baumann","Okay, got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your questions.","Andrew Buscaglia","Hi guys, congrats on your quarter.","D. G. Macpherson","Hi, thank you.","Andrew Buscaglia","Just wanted to dig into Canada a little bit more, I mean definitely better than expected, what end markets are really driving that and I think you mentioned things are still strong just generally on a monthly basis, but it pulled back in December, is that just like comp and remind us what the comp, why that was strong last year at this time?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes. So, I think for the second part question you\u2019re asking, I think you\u2019re asking overall. Last year there seem to be, people are talking about budget flush and such things. It seems like customers last year spent a lot of money at the end of the year, and I don't know that we know exactly why that happens, but it made November - November was not strong, December was very strong. So, from us that compare is the only reason December looks like it\u2019s slightly slower at this point.","In terms of Canada, I think the turnaround effort we\u2019re talking about probably is independent of end market segments. It\u2019s more - making sure that we have the right service model, the right pricing, the right cost structure. So, the improvement wasn\u2019t because we saw great things in any specific end user segment, it was because we focused on providing good service at the lowest cost and improving our pricing.","Andrew Buscaglia","Okay. Got it. So, more Grainger specific. And then one other question I had was, part of your strategy I think with Gamut was learning more about the market, and then I think your plan was to roll that into Grainger.com, can you tell us where you stand with that, is that going to be part of the additional investments you plan to make?","D. G. Macpherson","So, we are developing more detailed plans as we speak. We will provide more updates later in the year, probably, as I mentioned before, probably the EPG timeframe.","Andrew Buscaglia","Alright, thanks guys.","D. G. Macpherson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next questions come from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Evelyn Chow","Good morning guys. This is Evelyn Chow on for Joe. I like to touch first on Canada. I understand the prudence in maintaining the guide right now for 2018, but just curious to understand, you had great price increases, your expense leverage in 4Q was very impressive, what more do you kind of need to see out of this business, either from the market or your own strategic actions to making confident that this could turn profitable in 2018?","D. G. Macpherson","I mean, I think we\u2019ve got a plan that basically lays out what we expect to get by quarter and we\u2019re on that plan, and we have a set of initiatives that we are executing with high intensity and if we continue to execute as we started to execute I think we\u2019re going to be in good shape. So, we are watching things very closely if you might suggest and we\u2019re going to make sure that we execute this well, but there is no structural reason why the Canadian business cannot be very profitable and get back to growth once we get through the reset.","Evelyn Chow","That makes sense. And then maybe just, almost a conceptual question, I think a lot of sceptics that figures look at the benefits from tax reform not just for your business, but across distributors in general, kind of points an idea that what if these tax benefits can get competed away? I guess I would infer from your increased digital investments that you believe these are benefits that are here to stay. I\u2019d just be curious to understand your response to that kind of pushback both for the industry and for your business in particular?","D. G. Macpherson","I think over the very long term, I think we don\u2019t know what benefits will be sticking. Right now, certainly it\u2019s a benefit to us and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in things that make us successful that help us compete differentiate us from our competitors, create value for our customers and that\u2019s really our focus, so I won\u2019t comment or speculate on what happens with the benefit of tax over the long term.","Evelyn Chow","Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next questions come from the line of Chris Belfiore with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions.","Chris Belfiore","Good morning. So, I understand that Grainger is historically been able to pass inflations through at a higher rate, but the competitive environment has changed, so do you have a sense of the acceptance of a higher price with the U.S. government, customers given that they may have other options and then all the pricing actions you guys wanted to share?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes. So, as I mentioned, we tend to think of managing price as a market competitiveness effort. So, we will look very closely at what happens with market prices. Historically, we had seen inflation pass through two customers. We don\u2019t really see any reason or anything different in the market price structure now than we did two years ago. Most of the changes, all of the changes we made have been because of our own structure, not really because market prices have been increasing or decreasing. And so, I don\u2019t think the dynamics actually changed all that much. We don\u2019t have any evidence that it has changed all that much and so I don\u2019t know why we would think that it\u2019s an inflationary environment and we manage COGS where we wouldn\u2019t get to benefit.","Chris Belfiore","Okay. And then just going up to Canada, with regard to the volume price relationship there was there any demand weakness or was it just a function of lower volumes on the higher pricing?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, I think the lower volume is only partially because of the pricing. Lower volume is also because we removed a bunch of branches. So, we will go from 170 branches to 35 or something like that over the course of two years and that is taking away some unprofitable volume, but certainly taking away a little bit of volume.","Chris Belfiore","Thanks.","D. G. Macpherson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next questions come from the line of Ryan Cieslak with Northcoast. Please go ahead with your questions.","Ryan Cieslak","Hi, good morning guys, congrats on the quarter. My first question, D. G. you mentioned that, with regard to the mid-size customers the new customer acquisition still is early innings and maybe somewhat slow, but at this point what most of the pricing actions having been taken, what do you need to do or what you think is the trigger to really start to see some new customers come through to the model?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, just to be clear we are seeing some new customers come through, but it\u2019s a smaller portion initially there, existing our lapse customers. So, we have a lot of experience with acquiring new customers in some of the online businesses, it just takes time. You just keep acquiring, acquiring, acquiring, and so we are not going to - the reality is the customers are not Grainger customers, you have to get to them through, usually through digital solutions and if you - if they find that the prices are competitive when they get the service that we provide they often come back and so we\u2019re really focused on acquiring new attracted business customers and I think that'll just continue to build over time.","Ryan Cieslak","Okay and then for my follow-up question, going back to the question and the comments about passing along inflation for you guys in some of the supplier inflation that you have already seen, have you already started to pass that along and been successful, just want to be clear there, and if not when does that actually or do you start to do that, is that something you're going to wait a quarter or two to do, or is that something you guys are already starting to implement and progress through here in the first quarter? Thanks.","D. G. Macpherson","We\u2019ve already started it very recently, but we\u2019re able to change price multiple times during the year. We\u2019ve already started that process. So, we will start to see some of that benefit in the first quarter.","Ryan Cieslak","Okay. Best of luck guys.","Operator","Our next questions come from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Chris Dankert","Good morning guys thanks for fitting me in here. Just thinking about the digital strategy, obviously that\u2019s doing quite well, but are you willing to comment on success of kind of your endless selection strategy versus more approaching Gamut and Grainger.com is there any kind of difference in trends that we should be thinking about?","D. G. Macpherson","I think - we will talk a lot about this in May. I think the differences might include some subtleties. I would say that the endless sort of model tends to be attracted to smaller customers, less complex customers, and the solutions that we provide on Grainger.com Gamut tend to be more attractive for, certainly more industrial customers and bigger customers or more complex customers. So, we see acquisition and growth rates that are different across the customer base, across those two solutions typically.","Chris Dankert","Got you. I will wait until the EPG I guess. And then thinking about Cromwell, getting digital getting online that was a big focus when that was brought on board, I guess any comment on how that progress is going?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, so we\u2019ve replumbed the website for Cromwell core business and started Zoro U.K. Zoro U.K is certainly early days, but starting to get some traction. Too early to tell how fast that\u2019s going to grow, but we'll certainly start to see some growth in U.K. The market seems to be there for that offer, so we're pretty excited about what we're seeing early.","Chris Dankert","Got it. Thank you so much guys.","D. G. Macpherson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back to D. G. Macpherson for closing comments.","D. G. Macpherson","Alright. I will close very quickly here. Thank you for your time and attendance today. As I mentioned, overall, we\u2019re very pleased with our progress. I think we\u2019ve done a lot of heavy lifting this year to get not only pricing right, but to get our portfolio to be as clean as possible and we are really focused now on creating value for customers in U.S. turning around Canada, continuing to accelerate growth with the online model, and given all the changes, given our team members efforts this year, we feel like we\u2019re much better position than we were certainly a year ago. So, we\u2019re pretty optimistic about where we're heading and really [indiscernible] execution. So that\u2019s where we're going to focus on. So, thanks for your time and thanks for following us.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."],"9903":["W.W. Grainger, Inc. (NYSE:GWW) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 18, 2012  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Laura D. Brown \u2013 Senior Vice President, Communications","William D. Chapman \u2013 Senior Director, IR","Analysts","[No Q&A Session for this event].","Laura Brown","Hello.  This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations.","With me today is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. We are pleased to share with you some information regarding Grainger\u2019s second quarter 2012 results via this audio web cast.  Please also reference our 2012 second quarter earnings release issued today, July 18th, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website, to supplement this web cast.","Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information.  These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty.  Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.","Healthy sales growth, consistent execution, and impressive margin expansion was the storyline for the quarter.  This performance was largely driven by continued enhancements to the foundation of our business and aggressive investment in our growth programs. ","As a result, we reiterated our 2012 sales growth guidance of 12 to 14% and raised the bottom end of our earnings per-share guidance as referenced in today\u2019s earnings release. We will now expect EPS of $10.50 to $10.80 for the full year 2012.  At the end of this recording we\u2019ll talk more about our guidance and related assumptions.","We\u2019ll start with total company results, and then take a closer look at our segments.","Company sales increased 12% versus the 2011 second quarter. We had 64 selling days in both quarters.   Operating earnings increased 18 %, while net earnings increased 12 %.","As highlighted in the earnings release, earnings per share of $2.63 for the quarter represents an all-time company record and represents a 12% increase versus 2011.  The 2011 quarter included a $0.12 per-share benefit from the settlement of tax examinations; excluding this benefit, the earnings per share increased 18 % versus 2011.","In a few moments we\u2019ll analyze our sales results for the quarter.  Let\u2019s now walk down the operating section of the income statement.","Gross profit margins increased 40 basis points to 43.5 %.  Our purchasing scale enables us to manage price changes in line with the market and ahead of product cost inflation.  We\u2019ll provide more detail when we review the business by segment.","It is important to note that our gross profit margin follows a fairly consistent annual pattern with generally the highest gross margins in the first quarter of each year.  This is primarily driven by supplier funding for our annual customer trade shows early in the year, which is accounted for as a credit to cost of goods sold.","So the sequential decline in our gross profit margin from 44.4% in the 2012 first quarter to 43.5% in the 2012 second quarter is normal and expected.","Our company operating margin increased 80 basis points to 14%.  This improvement was driven by solid sales growth, gross margin expansion and positive expense leverage.  Operating expenses grew 11%, including $24 million in incremental growth-related spending in the quarter, and the operating expenses from the businesses in Europe and Brazil, which we acquired during the last 12 months.","Let\u2019s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter.  In doing so, we\u2019ll cover the following topics:  First, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of June.  Second, operating performance by segment.  Third, cash generation and capital deployment.  And finally, we\u2019ll wrap up with a discussion of our 2012 guidance.","As mentioned earlier, company sales increased 12% for the quarter.  Daily sales growth by month was as follows; 12% in April, 13% in May, and 12% in June.  The 12% sales growth for the quarter included 5 percentage points from acquisitions and a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange.","As a point of reference, foreign exchange represented a 1 percentage point headwind in the 2012 first quarter.","On an organic basis, sales for the quarter increased 9% including 6 percentage points from volume and 3 percentage points from price.","Let\u2019s move on to sales by segment.  We report two segments; the United States and Canada.  Our remaining operations in Asia, Europe, and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses.","Sales in the United States, which accounts for 77% of total company revenue, increased 7% in the quarter, consisting of 4% volume growth and 3% from price.  Despite the hot weather in late June, sales of seasonal products were not a factor in the quarter or the month of June.  Daily sales in the United States increased 7% in April, 8% in May and 7% in June.","Let\u2019s review sales performance by customer and market in the United States.  Our growth drivers, which include increasing our product line, expanding customer sales coverage, enhancing our eCommerce capabilities, and increasing our inventory management solutions are enabling Grainger to grow faster than the economy and gain additional market share.  This is evident when you look at the variety of customer end markets we serve in the United States and performance for each.  Heavy Manufacturing was up in the high-single digits;  Light Manufacturing, Commercial, Retail, Reseller and Natural Resources were up in the mid-single digits;  Government was up in the low-single digits; and Contractors declined in the low-single digits.","Now let\u2019s turn our attention to the Canadian business.  Sales in Canada represent 12% of total company revenues.  For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 9% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency.  The 14% local currency sales growth in the quarter consisted of 12% volume growth and 2 percentage points from price.","From a customer standpoint, sales performance in Canada was driven by strong growth in the Commercial, Oil & Gas, Utilities and Contractor end markets.  On a daily basis in Canadian dollars, sales increased 13% in April, 14% in May and 14% in June.","Let\u2019s conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses.  Again, this group includes our operations in Asia, Europe and Latin America and currently represents about 11% of total company sales.","Sales for this group increased 84%, which consisted of a 75-percentage-point contribution from the acquired businesses in Europe and Brazil, 21 percentage points from volume, led by strong growth in Japan, partially offset by a 12-percentage-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange.","Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for April and May and shared some information regarding performance in those months.  Let\u2019s now take a look at June.","There were 21 selling days in June of 2012, one less than in 2011.  Total company sales were up 12% on a daily basis in June of 2012 versus June of 2011.  The daily sales growth in June included 5 precentage points from acquisitions and a 2 percentage-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange.  Organic sales increased 9% on a daily basis, consisting of 6% volume growth and 3 percentage points from price inflation.","In the United States, June daily sales were up 7%.  This growth consisted of 4 percentage points of volume and 3 percentage points from price.  We saw positive daily sales growth in all but one of our U.S. customer end markets as follows:  Heavy and Light Manufacturing increased in the low-double digits; Government, Commercial, Reseller, Retail and Natural Resources increased in the mid-single digits; and Contractor was essentially flat.","The mid-single digit sales growth to our Government customers is worth noting.  As we shared with our May sales release, the fiscal year end for many state and local governments end in June.  Thanks to our strong relationships with these government agencies, coupled with the value of the service we provide, we enjoyed a strong finish to the month.","This level of growth to the Government was achieved despite a 25% decline in sales to the U.S. Postal Service, related to their aggressive restructuring program.","Daily sales in Canada for June increased 8 % in U.S. dollars, up 14% in local currency.  The 14% local currency daily sales growth consisted of 12 percentage points from volume and 2 percentage points from price.","Similar to the quarter, sales growth in Canada was driven by strong performance in the Commercial, Oil & Gas, Utilities, and Contractor end markets.","Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 86% in June, consisting of 75 percentage points from acquisitions, 25 percentage points from volume, partially offset by a negative 14 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange.","Sales in the month of July are off to a good start.  Despite the challenges of having the Fourth of July on a Wednesday, daily sales growth to date is trending in line with the 12% growth in June.","Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.","Bill Chapman","Thanks Laura.  Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let\u2019s jump right into performance by reporting segment.","Operating earnings in the United States increased 15% versus the 2011 second quarter.  And the U.S. operating margin increased 120 basis points to 17.8%.  This impressive performance was driven by 7% sales growth, higher gross margins and positive expense leverage.","Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 20 basis points driven by price increases exceeding cost inflation, partially offset by unfavorable customer and product mix.","Expense leverage in the United States was positive despite $24 million in incremental growth-related spending on areas such as new sales representatives, eCommerce and advertising.","Let\u2019s move on to our business in Canada.  Operating earnings increased 15% versus the prior year, up 20% in local currency.  Strong sales growth, coupled with higher gross profit margins and positive expense leverage contributed to operating margins increasing 60 basis points to 12%.","Gross margins increased 10 basis points, primarily driven by improved customer mix.","Operating performance for our Other Businesses improved versus a year ago, the result of our focus on enhancing growth and operating performance.  This group posted operating earnings of $11 million for the quarter versus $9 million a year ago.  Strong operating performance in Japan and Mexico was responsible for this improvement.","In addition, approximately $1 million in operating earnings from Fabory in the quarter were offset by losses from the acquired business in Brazil.  Consistent with our expectations, investments in expanding the sales force and product offering are creating some near-term headwinds for our business in Brazil.","Below the operating line, interest expense, net of interest income, was $2.3 million in the 2012 second quarter versus $1.5 million in the 2011 second quarter.  This increase was primarily attributable to interest on the debt of \u20ac120 million incurred in 2011 to finance a portion of the Fabory acquisition.","The effective tax rate for the 2012 second quarter was 37.9% versus 38.3% in 2011, adjusted for the $0.12 per-share benefit noted earlier.  The lower rate was primarily due to higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a lower blended state tax rate.","Lastly, let\u2019s take a look at cash flow for the quarter.  Operating cash flow was $132 million versus $191 million in 2011.  The year-over-year reduction in cash flow was driven by higher investments in receivables and inventory tied to sales growth along with a reduction in current liabilities tied to higher payments for income taxes.","We used the cash generated during the quarter, along with cash on hand, to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends.","Capital expenditures for the quarter were $56 million versus $52 million in 2011. We paid dividends of $58 million in the quarter, reflecting the 21% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of this year.  In addition, we bought back 760,000 shares of stock and ended the quarter with about 6 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization.  In total, we returned $207 million to shareholders in the quarter.","As reported in our 2012 second quarter earnings release, we reiterated our 2012 sales guidance of 12 to 14% and raised the low end of our 2012 earnings per-share guidance by $0.10.  We now expect earnings per share of $10.50 to $10.80.  Keep in mind, if economic growth slows and the dollar continues to strengthen, the lower end of our sales range is more probable than the higher end.  If that happens, we plan to reassess and adjust spending levels.","Let\u2019s look more closely at the underlying elements of our current expectations.   First, sales in the back half of the year are expected to grow in the 10 to 13% range.","As a reminder, we reach the anniversary of the Fabory acquisition at the end of August.  In addition, we will lose a selling day in the 2012 third quarter and gain it back in the fourth quarter versus 2011.","Second, we continue to forecast operating margin expansion, over prior year, in the remaining quarters of 2012.  Gross profit margins for the remaining quarters should remain relatively consistent with the 43.5% reported for the 2012 second quarter.","Incremental growth related spending in the 2012 third quarter should be in line with the $24 million incremental spend in the 2012 second quarter.  Better expense and earnings leverage should come in the 2012 fourth quarter as we lap some of the aggressive growth investments in 2011, such as new sales representatives and eCommerce, and benefit from having a full quarter of Fabory in the base.","Although comparisons will be easier in the 2012 fourth quarter, we plan to continue to invest in our growth drivers given the opportunity to gain share in this large, fragmented market.","Third, our Other Businesses have posted improved performance, which should continue to be driven by our business in Japan.  As for our newest businesses, we continue to expect AnFreixo to be slightly dilutive in 2012, while Fabory may post a small loss if the economy and currency in Europe weaken further.","Fourth, we now expect foreign exchange to be a headwind on both the top and bottom lines for the full year.  Given the relative strength of the U.S. dollar, foreign exchange could represent as much as a 1 percentage point drag on sales and $0.04 to $0.06 per share in earnings dilution for the year.","Finally, our 2012 guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 37.4 to 37.7%.","Thank you for your interest in Grainger.  Please mark your calendar for the release of July sales on Friday, August 10th.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Laura Brown at 847-535-0409 or me at 847-535-0881.","Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","[No Q&A Session for this event]."],"10377":["W.W.

Grainger Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode and a brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Irene Holman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.","Irene Holman","Good morning. Welcome to Grainger\u2019s Q2 earnings call. With me are D. G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO and Tom Okray, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking statements based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of the slide presentation and in our Q2 press release. Both are available on our Investor Relations Web site. D.G. will cover our performance for the quarter, and Tom will give an update on our 2018 expectations. After that, we will open the call for questions. D. G., to you.","D. G. Macpherson","Thank you, Irene. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. So the second quarter marked our third consecutive quarter of strong results and the results certainly beat our expectations. Our volume growth significantly outpaced the market, driven by actions to consistently deliver value to our customers at relevant prices. The demand environment remains strong.","Our sales performance was driven largely by the strength of the U.S. business and our single channel online businesses. In the U.S., we continue to see a solid response to our pricing actions with total volume growth of 11%. We saw growth across all of our major end markets, including manufacturing, commercial, healthcare and government. We know that customers value the relationships they have with Grainger, our customer service, technical support and fulfillment capabilities. When we couple that with the relevant pricing our offer is very compelling. And as a result, we\u2019re growing faster and more attractive parts of the US business. This is not only driving GP dollar growth but also resulted in better than expected gross profit margin for the quarter.","In Canada, the execution of our turnaround is progressing as planned and our actions there led to GP and operating earnings improvement. Our single channel online and international businesses both had nice growth and expanded operating earnings in the quarter. Based on our performance and continued momentum, we\u2019re raising our full year guidance. Tom will share the details of our updated guidance later in the presentation.","Turning to reported results, Q2 2018 reported results include restructuring charges of $15 million and $0.21 impact to EPS. Now, this morning's call will focus on adjusted results, which exclude the items outlined in our press release. Total Company sales in the quarter were up 9%. Volume was up 9%. Price was flat as price deflation in the U.S. was offset by price increase increases in Canada. We had foreign exchange favorability of 1% in the quarter. That was offset by negative 1% impact from the divestiture of Techni-Tool in the U.S. We have now lapped the Techni-Tool divestiture as of mid-July.","Our normalized GP rate declined 30 basis points after adjusting for the revenue recognition accounting change and the timing of our annual sales meeting. We continue to realize operating expense leverage on higher volume. This all led to operating earnings growth of 23% in the quarter. I'll cover our other businesses first. As a reminder, other businesses include our single channel online model and our international businesses. Sales for these businesses were up 18% in the quarter, 14% was price volume and 4% was from currency. Our online businesses drove 25% sales growth and continue to be a profitable growth driver. Our international businesses had solid organic growth in the quarter and contributed to operating margin expansion. We are happy with where our international portfolio is today.","In Canada, sales were down 6% and down 10% in local currency. We introduced price increases in the fourth quarter of last year, and are renegotiating pricing on large customer contracts. As a result, price was up 10% and contributed to GP rate expansion of 455 basis points in the quarter after adjusting for the revenue recognition accounting change. Volume was down 20% due to the planned price increases, branch closures and sales covers optimization activities. As we talked about before, this is going to be a smaller but more profitable business when we're through with the reset.","Operating margin improved 290 basis points due to higher GP rate and cost management. The turnaround is progressing as planned with several activities running ahead of schedule. Much of the heavy lifting is behind us and we\u2019re encouraged by the improvement and profitability. We believe we\u2019ll be in a good position to exit the year profitably and go on offense in 2019.","In the U.S., both the volume response to our pricing actions and the demand environment was strong. Sales were up 9% in the quarter. Total volume was up 11%, including seasonal sales and holiday timing at positive 1%. Volume growth was partially offset by price deflation of 1% and negative 1% impact from the Techni-Tool divestiture last July.","Our normalized GP rate decline 65 basis points after adjusting for the revenue recognition accounting change at the timing of the sales meeting. Operating expenses in U.S. were up 2% after adjusting for revenue recognition accounting change. Operating margin was better-than-expected in the quarter as expense leverage on total volume growth of 11% more than offset the GP rate decline.","Now as we look at growth in the U.S, we\u2019re continuing to see that our value proposition resonates with both large and midsize customers when we remove pricing as a barrier. We are gaining share and seeing volume growth with those customer groups. Our digital marketing activity is also having an impact, and overall returns on both digital and off-line marketing are improving.","U.S. large customer volume increased 9% in the quarter above expectations. We\u2019re seeing increased share gains with large customers as they buy more infrequently purchased items and consolidate their purchases with Grainger. U.S. mid-size volume also exceeded expectations with growth of 29% over the prior year. We\u2019re seeing meaningful growth with both new and existing customers. Existing mid-size customers, including lapsed customers are buying more; we\u2019re seeing that in our volume; in the number of transactions per customer; and in the number of customer contacts that are buying.","We\u2019re also acquiring net new mid-size customers for the first time in a long time. When we look at the mid-size business growth, the meaningful portion of it is coming from new customer acquisitions. Overall, we remain optimistic about the U.S. business in 2018. I'll now turn it over the Tom who will discuss our expectations for the year.","Tom Okray","Thanks, D. G. I want to start by adding some commentary on our results for the quarter. Let's take a closer look at gross profit. We normalize Company gross profit rate in the quarter for two items; one, a change in revenue recognition accounting standards; and two, the timing of our Annual Sales Meeting. As a reminder, due to a change in accounting standards related to revenue recognition, we were required to reclassify certain KeepStock service costs from operating expense to cost of goods sold beginning in 2018. We have slides in the appendix that outline this change at the Company and U.S. level.","Separately, suppliers provide funding for our Annual Sales Meeting. This funding benefits gross profit margin and is spread over three consecutive months, beginning in the month of the sales meeting. In 2017, the sales meeting occurred in March and in 2018, the sales meeting occurred in February. The Company normalized gross profit rate of 39.2% was down 30 basis points, which was better than our expectation. This was driven by price cost spread and mixed favorability in the U.S., and the price increases in Canada.","U.S. normalized gross profit rate of 39.8% declined 65 basis points. As D. G. mentioned earlier, in the U.S., we\u2019re growing in areas we want to be growing. With large customers, price deflation is improving as we aren\u2019t deeply discounting infrequently purchased items, and customers are more comfortable with our pricing level. Some of the gross profit favorability in the quarter was also due to the delayed timing of our large customer contract negotiation. We\u2019re now through almost 90% of our contract revenue and expect to get through the majority of the remaining contracts by the end of this year.","We did see some supplier inflation in the quarter, partially due to tariffs. And we\u2019re able to pass through price while maintaining market competitiveness. Company operating margin was 12.6%, up 150 basis points, driven largely by expense leverage on strong sales performance. Earnings per share of $4.37 in the quarter was up 59% versus the prior year, primarily driven by higher operating earnings and lower corporate tax rate. Operating cash flow of $248 million was up 30% versus the prior year and free cash flow of $211 million was up 32% versus the prior year. The increase in both cash flow number was driven largely by higher earnings and lower tax rate.","Page 13 covers our updated guidance for the year. What we shared in April is on the left side of the chart and our updated guidance is on the right. We outperformed our internal expectations by about $0.60 in Q2 that flows through to the updated guidance for the year. In addition, we are also adding $0.15 of favorability to the second half, largely as a result of the momentum we are seeing, including lower than expected price deflation. As a result, we are taking both the high and the low end of the EPS range, up $0.75.","We now expect revenue growth to be in the range of up 5.5% to 8.5%. We expect an operating margin of 11.5% to 11.9% which is 50 to 90 basis points higher than the prior year. We expect EPS to be between $15.05 and $16.05 or 32% to 40% higher than the prior year. From a sales perspective, we continue to believe that our volume growth will outpace the market by 300 plus basis points this year.","With respect to gross profit margin, after normalizing for the 50 basis points related to the revenue recognition accounting change, the rate is expected to decline between 15 and 20 basis points versus the prior year. Further, we expect our gross profit rate to follow the normal sequential trend in 2018. For 2019, we expect the gross profit to be relatively stable versus 2018.","I want to spend a moment on price cost spread in the U.S. We previously expected a price headwind of negative 1.5% for the year. That value was a net number comprised of negative 3% from our August 2017 pricing reset, partially offset by a positive 1.5% from favorable mix and market based price increases. Today, we are updating the total price headwind to be negative 1%. We now expect price deflation related to the reset to improve due in part to timing of contract negotiations. We expect to complete a majority of the contracts this year.","Our expectation for COGS deflation remains unchanged at 50 bps, driven by our internal product cost optimization initiative. We expect that we will see some supplier inflation related to tariffs in the second half. And we are confident in our ability to pass on price Increases. I think it\u2019s helpful to point out that the current market dynamic is similar to past periods of inflation. Grainger has historically done well in managing cost and getting price realization through these periods. I\u2019ll now turn it back to D. G. for closing remarks.","D. G. Macpherson","Thanks, Tom. So overall, we\u2019re very pleased with our continued strong momentum. Our value proposition is resonating in the U.S., resulting in strong growth with gross margin rates above expectations. And we are developing stronger relationships with customers of all sizes. We are executing our turnaround as planned in Canada, and expect to exit the year profitably. Our online model continues to drive strong revenue growth and margin expansion, and our international businesses are contributing to earnings.","We continue to get strong expense leverage across the business and are on track to achieve the productivity targets we laid out at Analyst Day in November. We\u2019re well positioned to gain share and improve our economics going forward.","With that, I'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ryan Merkel","So first question high-level question on the cycle, D. G. There has been increasing talk and worry about peak cycle and what tariffs may do to demand. You just put up a very good quarter obviously. But what are you hearing from customers about the second half? And are there any signs of slowdown anywhere that you can see?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, through the quarter, we haven\u2019t seen any signs of the slowdown at this point. There are certainly conversations with customers. I would say most of those conversations, tariff related, tend to be longer-term. So questions about whether or not product will actually be -- end product will be made in China and shipped over given the way the tariffs are structured. I have talked with couple of customers about that. But in the short-term, we feel like there hasn\u2019t been a lot of action yet, and we don't see any slowdown at this point.","Ryan Merkel","And then secondly, OpEx growth has been very well controlled for few quarters now, up low single digits. So two questions; how long can this last; and then could you comment on what is normal OpEx growth?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, I think if you looked over our history, normal probably would -- you have to have it in quotes. I\u2019m not sure you have anything that\u2019s exactly normal. I would say we feel like, for this year and next at least and in 2020, we have the opportunity to get pretty significant leverage. Our expectation is that our OpEx will cover merit for folks every year there is built in productivity every single year. And so if the market -- if we grow 6% volume, we would expect our OpEx to be three or something like that or less in general.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","So as you talk about the U.S. large customers finishing their round of contract negotiations. Just curious what happens next as you would envision it, assuming contracts renew on a rolling basis over time, you finish now maybe it starts up again. Do subsequent rounds tend to include some additional price concession versus volume trade-ups?","D. G. Macpherson","I think any time you are in a negotiation for a contract, it\u2019s a competitive situation that has not changed at all, that will continue to be the case moving forward. What we do feel like is off of the price reset, we are competitive. I think what you\u2019re seeing with large customer GP is -- gross profit is that it's not down very much, because we\u2019ve always been competitive with those customers. And we feel like we\u2019re well positioned to go through whatever cycles come up in the future. And our focus to those negotiations is typically how we save customers\u2019 time and how we save him money. And if we focus on that, we have the ability to continue to have really strong economics at the other end if we do the right things.","Christopher Glynn","And then on Canada, just wondering your comment go on offense in 2019. You clearly see volume impact from the price reset. But could you elaborate on what you mean by go on offense?","D. G. Macpherson","Turn the situation from shrinking to growing. We are through -- teams have done a really nice job there getting through the vast majority, if not all, the restructuring and the changes we have to make. We\u2019re stabilizing the business with certain customers and then we\u2019re going to grow. We\u2019re going to grow in a way that allows us to be profitable as we grow. And so when we talk about going on offense, it\u2019s actually what we mean grow profitably.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird.","David Manthey","D. G., about a year ago, you declined to refine your 2021 margin goals and I assume that\u2019s still the case. But first off, the 12% to 13% overall operating margin target for 2019. Should we assume that\u2019s still in effect?","D. G. Macpherson","Until we change it, yes, you should assume that still in effect.","David Manthey","Second, as we look at that prior 2021 range, especially for Canada, you were looking at 7% to 9%. And I believe your 2019 goal is 4% to 8%. When we think about Canada, should we assume that structural operating margins are limited to high single digits, or changes you've made to the footprint and the model here just recently? Can you ultimately start to approach double digits and maybe even get closer to U.S. levels?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, I think I\u2019d answer that with two comments. The first one is we don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything structurally that should keep us from having double digit margins in Canada if we do all the right things. So we do believe that. Given where we\u2019re sitting, we\u2019re really focused on getting to the improvement goals we set in the next year, that's really, really important. And so we view that as a step on the path to improving growth and profitability of the business. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason why we couldn\u2019t be low double digit earnings in Canada at some point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow. Please go ahead.","Chris Dankert","I guess first off, D. G., would you mind kind of like highlighting what we\u2019ve see as far as restructuring savings in the first half versus the back half. It seems like it should be a little bit back half weighted here, and just your confidence in hitting those targets?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, really confident in hitting those targets, mostly because most of the actions that we have to take have already been taken, or were just completed in the last quarter. So we feel like the Canada targets are going to be -- we\u2019re going to hit those, and the U.S. targets most of the actions we\u2019ve already taken. So we are highly confident in what we\u2019re seeing.","Chris Dankert","And then just looking at 2Q here, it seems like the loss on your investment in clean energy was quite a bit lower 2Q versus last year and the last quarter. I mean, any -- and if you stake out for us expectations there going forward, should we expect that the losses there just will be structurally smaller now?","D. G. Macpherson","We\u2019ve got no change in terms of our guidance on coal investment. We\u2019re keeping $0.05 to $0.10 EPS range.","Chris Dankert","So that even just might what we saw in the second quarter here?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Baumann, JPMorgan.","Patrick Baumann","A quick question on the margins, you guys made a 12.5% total company margins in the first half full year that is I guess 11.5% to 11.9%. So it implies -- the second half implies margins that\u2019s a little bit worse than normal sequential deterioration versus the first half. Historically, it\u2019s about 100 basis points. This year it seems like you're embedding 150 basis points of degradation versus the 12.5% you did in the first half. And I\u2019m just curious if there's anything that stands out that's driving that? And I know you mentioned large contract renegotiations maybe that\u2019s the factor, I\u2019m just want to help with the math there if you can.","D. G. Macpherson","I think that the reality is that we still are, in many ways, in waters in certain places. So to the extent we saw mid-size customers continue to grow like we\u2019ve seen them grow, we saw large local customers grow, like we\u2019ve been seeing, but certainly there is a chance for us to do be better than what we\u2019ve talked about. But it\u2019s so early on many things that we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re still getting a rough handle on that. We feel like we want to stick with the wide range at this point, and we\u2019re optimistic about the path along.","Patrick Baumann","And can you talk about your direct exposure to China sourcing, and I assume some of the private label products you sell come from there. I am just not sure, if you can quantify. And also how you're approaching the tariff situation just from a risk mitigation perspective for some of that stuff?","D. G. Macpherson","The vast majority of our source items come from China up to two thirds or even more than that at this point. There's also -- so there\u2019s two things\u2019 one is our private brand products that come from China; the other is branded products that come from China, both have the potential to be impacted here. If I focus on our private branded products, so we\u2019ve been looking very closely at alternative sources and understanding what we can do and how we can shift.","And so if we think about private brand, we have 23% private brand. Most of that\u2019s China for every item that is -- that you could, we have an alternative source effectively and we can shift if we need to. We haven't seen yet the economics to make that work but we are looking at consistently. And we feel like we\u2019re in a good shape to really understand what to do.","Patrick Baumann","And then last one for me, the buy back in the quarter slowed down a bit, any reason to that. And is there any update to cash flow expectations or buyback for the year?","D. G. Macpherson","No, we\u2019re just looking at our model and opportunistically buying back. For the year-to-date, we bought back over 760,000 shares just really looking at the price, the stock in the market. No intentional slowdown.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Could you comment on your business with the U.S. government and specifically exposure on Section 846 of the NDA contract?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, so 846 is still -- I think you know this is still under study. So there's actually absolutely no implementation of that at this point. Our business with the government, the U.S. government has been very strong this year, continues to be strong. We have great relationships across a number of different organizations, the military organizations and beyond. And we\u2019ve seen really strong results with what we do. In many cases, we are really helping military bases and other federal government to manage their inventory, and that's a big part of what we do for them. And so we haven\u2019t seen any impact yet from that bill, and I think there is uncertainty around what that bill is actually going to look like at the end.","Deane Dray","And then just in terms of where we are in the cycle. Are you seeing or feeling pressures, let's say freight? Are you able to pass that -- types of incremental charges to your customers? And any issues with labor shortages in your organization?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, certainly I would say that the labor market is tight and the freight market is tight. So there is no question about that. We haven't seen labor shortages taking the second of those two. With freight, our team has done a really nice job of looking at alternatives, our initiatives that more than offset the pressure for price increases at this point. Certainly, there's pressure, particularly with truckload and LTL where drivers are the shortage and there\u2019s all kinds of issues that are challenging in that market. But so far we\u2019ve managed through that really well.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","I just wanted to go back to the OpEx control, and appreciate the details D.G. But can you just maybe give us an update on where you are with the sales force expansion, sales force effectiveness and also your marketing strategies? And maybe just go in a bit more detail, obviously, you\u2019re investing in certain categories. What are the offsets to SG&A to enable you to get that leverage into 2019?","D. G. Macpherson","Nigel, I didn\u2019t understand. You said -- I didn\u2019t fully understand the question. You said sales force expansion and you had another thing in that that I didn\u2019t understand.","Nigel Coe","Yes, marketing so online marketing and traditional\u2026","D. G. Macpherson","So when we think about OpEx control, we look at the entirety of our spend. We get very strong productivity typically in pockets that have very big populations that includes our distribution centers, our contact centers. We continue to see that go well. We\u2019re continuing to get productivity in our sales force. And putting in the CRM has helped our sales force to have the right conversations, go to the right customers and its improving. We expect to \u2013 we're learning and we expect that to continue going forward. We\u2019ve added some sellers and we are adding sellers, I\u2019d say, at a modest level consistently. And the sellers that we do have are going to be more productive, and that\u2019s the way we think about that.","Nigel Coe","And then just picking up on the 301s, I think you said 22% of your sales are private label products, bulk of that comes from China. Is that right?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Nigel Coe","So based on the current CapEx that we have, the initial 50 and then the next 200. Have you been in any way concerned about how much of that 20% is currently wrapped into those?","D. G. Macpherson","So far, it\u2019s a small portion of it and our team is working very hard to make any changes we need to make with that portion. We\u2019ll have -- obviously it\u2019s just expands and the next tranche comes in, we\u2019ll have more to tell you about that as we learn more.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Evelyn Chow of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Evelyn Chow","First question, just thinking about the medium customer volume growth, still very strong and you noted that you\u2019re finally seeing new customers acquired after a long time. What are those new customers responding to most, out of your offerings and initiatives?","D. G. Macpherson","So I would say that the interesting thing about our performance for the last few years with mid-size customers has been, when we\u2019ve talked to them, they have been very positive about their perception of Grainger. But pricing has -- their comments have been well the price is not for me; you aren\u2019t for me. And so I think what we\u2019re seeing now is our technical product support our assortment our performance. The basics that we provide customers are really, really valuable to mid-size industrial customers. We can help them find the right product. We\u2019re very easy to deal with if they can get somebody on the phone to understand things they can\u2019t. And so what we're seeing is price is not a barrier. And so the things we\u2019ve always done and we continue to do better are really resonating with those customers.","Evelyn Chow","And then I just want to make sure I understand the components of the back half guidance raise. So I know of those roughly $0.75 raise that you put up today for the full year, you said $0.60 was from 2Q and then $0.15 in the back half. Am I correct in understanding that is; A, OpEx performance better than you expect there\u2019s perhaps upside to that; and then secondarily, I think in your prior guide there was about $0.10 of timing related negative impact in the back half. Could you just update that for us, as well?","Tom Okray","Evelyn, you\u2019re correct. We basically took the $0.60, which was our forecast versus our EPS and took that through to the guide and then put another $0.15 in the back half related to price -- price volume in the U.S. And as D. G. said earlier, we\u2019re intentionally keeping the range wide. It's early days dealing with customers we haven't dealt with in a while, so intentionally keeping the range wide. But as D. G. said, we\u2019re very optimistic in terms of how we\u2019re performing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Hamzah Mazari","The first question is just around the medium customer business. D. G. is there anything preventing your market share in medium customer being similar to large customer? Is there any underlying dynamics in that medium customer market that, either make it more competitive or different from the largest customer market, any color there? Thank you.","D. G. Macpherson","Well, I think the competitiveness is different. I think if you\u2019re serving large complex customer, the set of customers that can\u2019t even do the same things that you want to do -- I\u2019d say our competitors that can\u2019t do the things you want to do are probably narrower. That said, I don't know that there's any gate to us achieving similar share with mid-size customers we have with large, primarily because of how much they value our assortment, our tech support, our search, our ability to help them get what they need. But that\u2019s an interesting question for the future, Hamzah, we\u2019re looking at that really closely and we\u2019ll see the trajectory as we get on and we\u2019ll figure that out.","Hamzah Mazari","And just a follow-up, you talked about stable gross margin in 19, maybe for Tom. Do you assume that the COGS deflation that you guys are seeing, even though there\u2019s an inflation in the market today that that\u2019s structural and that's sustainable in \u201919 when you talk about stable gross margin?","Tom Okray","I think we've got many levers we can pull in \u201919, going forward. Our PPO organization really I think is very, very good process and is going to enable us to have deflation going forward. So there is other opportunities as well as in the supply chain for gross margin. And we\u2019re comfortable that the gross margin, going forward, is going to be a stable.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Cieslak with Northcoast. Please go ahead.","Ryan Cieslak","Just take on that last question there. If price cost is improving for you guys and certainly feels like mix is also moving in the right direction. I\u2019m just trying to understand why you wouldn\u2019t be able to expand gross margins in 2019, or maybe you just trying to be conservative just given timing right now. As you said, it\u2019s still early days. But maybe talk a little bit about ultimately what would offset your ability to expand gross margins in 2019?","D. G. Macpherson","I think on a like for like basis, we would expect to have slight GP expansion in 2019. I think that what you\u2019re probably not accounting for is there are a number of contracts, large contracts that are going to be implemented in the back half of this year that will have some impact on GP. And we\u2019ve talked about that before. But it\u2019s 10% of the contracts or something that we still have to do roughly, and some of those are fairly large. So that's going to be the drag in 2019 that we\u2019ll need to overcome.","Ryan Cieslak","And D. G., just sticking with 2019 thought process. Is 6% to 8% volume growth still the range that we should be thinking about? Or is there any change and how to think about that, either from one, the fact that volumes are running ahead of your expectations, but also that also makes the comp little bit more difficult now going into \u201919?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, we haven\u2019t changed that. I think what I would say is that as we look at all the different sources of our growth right now, we\u2019re getting a better understanding of what we think next year will be and we\u2019ll talk about that as we get more refined and understanding. We\u2019re growing with it -- are now faster and growing with it.","Ryan Cieslak","And then my last question and I\u2019ll get back in line. The digital marketing initiatives you guys deployed. If I remember right, that was something that really was deployed more so in this past quarter. Just can you help me thinking about the timing of that, maybe we have half of a benefit do you think from those initiatives or meaning did you get a bigger benefit as go here into the third quarter as it relates to potential new customer growth in the back half of the year? Thanks.","D. G. Macpherson","So we\u2019ve been fairly consistent in the investments we\u2019ve made in digital marketing throughout the year. We stepped it up a bit. I think we\u2019ll get more benefits because I think we\u2019re going to get better at, and we\u2019re learning as we go. And so I think it won't necessarily be because we spend the whole lot more, but as we understand what customers respond to, we\u2019re going to keep getting better and the effectiveness of that will increase.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO. Please go ahead. ","Scott Graham","I am hoping and this is maybe a question for Tom to maybe square my math here. Last quarter, the U.S. business price mix was again away from the resets, was plus 1.5. And this quarter, it looks like its plus 1.5 again. I'm assuming that price was more of a component of the 1.5 in this past period, which would suggest that the mix actually deteriorated, if my math is square. Whereas the areas where you're getting the better volumes off of the price reset are mix positive. Could you maybe walk us through that?","Tom Okray","I\u2019m not sure I fully understand the question. Can you take me back again and repeat please?","Scott Graham","So you\u2019re showing on your slide -- in your slide deck here Page 14 that price mix this past quarter thereabout was up 1.5 and last quarter 1.5. Assuming that price increases has accelerated modestly as the year progress, which suggests that the mix component of that 1.5 has actually deteriorated. Yet the areas where you\u2019re lowering prices, including the large customers on the spot buy business and medium-size customers which are much higher gross margin sales, those are accelerating. So where is the mix negative coming from, because it doesn\u2019t appear to be coming from those areas, in fact those areas go the other way.","Tom Okray","Yes, I think your first assumption in terms of the comparable mix I mean the comparable price increase is not fully accurate for Q1 and Q2, because we are seeing favorable mix related to gross profit in terms of certainly our medium size customers which have higher gross profit. Now, it\u2019s a much smaller amount of the total. We do see minor deterioration related to product mix and that's probably a function of our customer mix. But we're not seeing large deteriorations associated with customer mix, we\u2019re seeing favorable with customer mix.","Scott Graham","Yes, as I would have thought, I guess maybe I\u2019m just still having trouble squaring the math, but I\u2019ll take that with Irene offline. My follow up question is simply on the tariffs and how you source and what have you. And I guess it's good news you\u2019re not seeing a lot of the proxy you saw on the list. But I guess what I'm wondering is, are you implying that, and your competitors have said the same thing. We\u2019re ready to alternate source if needs be this kind of thing. But that that alternate source thing would obviously come at a higher cost. So are you implying that you're not concerned about it, because you\u2019ll get the price to compensate for that?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. If the market price of items goes up because of the tariffs, we will be able to pass that, our history suggest that is true.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner with Gabelli.","Justin Bergner","First off, I just want to make sure I understand that the $0.60, I guess, better performance versus expectations, doesn't include any pull forward from the second half in terms of the $0.15 that you\u2019re guiding better for the second half?","D. G. Macpherson","It does not.","Justin Bergner","And then on the cost inflation side, you\u2019re keeping that at negative 50 basis points. Is that because the cost inflation won\u2019t really come through until 2019? Or is it because it\u2019s coming through in the second half, but you\u2019re taking better actions to offset some of that?","D. G. Macpherson","It\u2019s the latter, yes. It\u2019s the latter. We\u2019re taking better actions to offset some of that.","Justin Bergner","And can you clarify what you\u2019re able to do more on the cost side to improve the price cost dynamic?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, a lot of that has to do with the process that Tom mentioned, which is really understanding -- working with suppliers to understand what the costs should be. And making sure we get the right assortment, which can be at the right cost. So I would say that the process, as we use, consistently drive COGS improvement and we continue to see that.","Tom Okray","I mean, one of the things coming into Grainger and I was very pleasantly surprised looking at the clean sheet approach that they do related to working with the suppliers. I would think it would be up close to being industry benchmark in terms of clean sheet and looking at replicating the suppliers; income statement, et cetera. So it's really a top-notch process in place.","Justin Bergner","And then just lastly if I may, I assume that some of the higher earnings is going to translate into better free cash flow. Any comments on how you\u2019d intend to deploy that better free cash flow versus the view you set out in the last year?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, we\u2019ll have more to say about that at a later date. But I mean just to touch on it briefly, I mean obviously, we like our investment grade credit rating and that's important to us. Following that, we\u2019re going to invest in the operations. We've got opportunities to have a lot of high-ROIC projects, which we\u2019re sorting through right now. And then third, we\u2019ll give the money back to shareholders, dividends and buybacks. I wouldn't expect any dramatic change in the current capital allocation process.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker with UBS.","Steve Winoker","So I just wanted to follow up a couple of questions. One is on the whole sourcing discussion and tariffs. Just to be clear, the comments that you made were about the first $50 billion tranche in terms of what\u2019s effective to you, not the $200 billion correct?","D. G. Macpherson","That is correct. That is absolutely correct, yes.","Steve Winoker","And then do you see in that -- should this continue to escalate and obviously, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around that. Is there actually a share gain opportunity for you here as you look at customers? Or is this hard to see through some positives in this?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, I\u2019d have to ask you what you mean by share gain opportunity and how that would come about. But generally, as you know, it\u2019s just an inflationary action and so we would expect that to be the outcome here.","Steve Winoker","Well, let me take it offline. On the medium customer comments that you made on the daily volume growth, now that those are comping against more difficult numbers, but still accelerating significantly or significantly higher. How much, when you think about the reengagement versus the customer acquisition growth that you\u2019ve been commenting on. Where do you see this settling out over the next three or four quarters when you\u2019re passed the tougher comp given the rate of growth that you\u2019re seeing on the customer acquisition side?","D. G. Macpherson","I think we\u2019ll give a lot more detail on that as we move to the next couple of quarters. What we said at this point is we are having a meaningful portion of this that is actually new customer acquisition. We\u2019re trying to understand exactly where we think that settles. We don't have enough months and quarters behind us to be completely sure yet. But as we do and get more certainty, we will be sharing that.","Steve Winoker","But just again back to some of the comments you\u2019ve made versus your 2% versus your 4% share historically, even if it is a more competitive dynamic, reasonably that 4% is really the feeling there, I would assume.","D. G. Macpherson","Right exactly.","Operator","We reached the end of our question and answer session. I would like to turn the floor back to D. G. Macpherson for closing comments.","D. G. Macpherson","All right, thanks everybody for joining us today. As you probably gathered, we\u2019re very pleased with the momentum of the business and where we\u2019re headed. In U.S., our value proposition is really resonating with customers of all sizes and types, and we\u2019re getting strong tractions with those customers. The turnaround in Canada is going as we expected it to go, lots of reason to be optimistic there.","Our online model continues to drive strong revenue growth and margin expansion. And our international portfolio is much stronger, it\u2019s contributing to earnings and we\u2019ve seen decent growth there as well. And we continue to get strong expense leverage across the business and we\u2019re on track to achieve the targets we set for ourselves last November. So all-in-all, we feel very positive. We\u2019re well positioned to gain share and improve the economics of the business going forward. And we appreciate the time today. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"10063":["W.W. Grainger, Inc. (NYSE:GWW) Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call October 18, 2016  7:30 AM ET","Executives","Laura Brown - Senior Vice President Communications and Investor Relations","Bill Chapman - Senior Director of Investor Relations","Analysts","Laura Brown","Hello, this is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger\u2019s 2016 Third Quarter Results.","This podcast supplements our 2016 third quarter earnings release issued today, October 18th and other information available on our Investor Relations website. This material contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current view of the competitive market and the overall environment. Future risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please see our SEC filings, including our most recent periodic reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which are available on our Investor Relations website for a discussion of factors that may affect our forward-looking statements.","Today we reported results for the 2016 third quarter and updated our sales and earnings per share guidance for the full year to reflect our performance to-date and the challenging industrial economy.","Before we begin our review of results, I\u2019d like to remind you of the adjustments to reported results in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015. In general, we adjust the reported results to exclude any items that are unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business. We believe this gives investors a better view of our core operational performance. ","Tables reconciling reported to adjusted results and other non-GAAP measures accompanying today\u2019s earnings release and the transcript of this podcast, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website.","The 2016 third quarter included restructuring charges in the U.S. and Canadian segments. In both countries, we are closing branches and reducing headcount to proactively address changes in customer buying behavior and better position the business for profitable growth. These actions had a net charge of $0.01 to earnings per share. ","In 2015, we took restructuring actions that resulted in net charges of $0.11 per share. All figures from this point forward represent adjusted amounts unless specifically noted.","With that as a backdrop, let\u2019s look at our results for the 2016 third quarter. Company sales for the quarter increased 3% versus the 2015 third quarter. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales were flat. There were 64 selling days in both quarters. Operating earnings decreased 5%, and net earnings decreased 6%. Earnings per share were $3.06, up 1% versus the prior year.","Bill will cover our revised guidance in detail at the end of this podcast. We now expect 2016 sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5% and earnings per share of $11.40 to $11.70. Our 2016 guidance issued on July 19th 2016 was 1% to 4% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20.","Let\u2019s now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins in the third quarter decreased 180 basis points to 40.1% versus 41.9% in 2015, due primarily to unfavorable customer mix and modest negative price-cost mix in the United States and price deflation versus product cost inflation in Canada. ","Operating expenses for the company were essentially flat. We attained positive expense leverage as operating expenses as a percent of sales were 27.3%, down 80 basis points versus the prior year. The third quarter benefited from operating expense favorability from the timing of certain professional expenses and other program-related expenses. ","Total company operating earnings were $332 million, a decrease of 5% versus the prior year. Company operating margin for the quarter was 12.8%, a decline of 110 basis points versus the 2015 quarter.","Let\u2019s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we\u2019ll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of September, second, operating performance by segment, third, cash generation and capital deployment and finally we\u2019ll wrap up with a discussion of our 2016 guidance.","Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. Despite this, we use the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales.","As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 3%. Daily sales performance by month was as follows: up 3% in July, up 4% in August and flat in September. Excluding the Cromwell acquisition in the first two months of the quarter, sales performance by month was down 1% in July, up 1% in August and flat in September. ","Results for the quarter included two percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, which we anniversaried on September 1st, and 1 percentage point contribution from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales were flat consisting of a 1 percentage point contribution from sales of seasonal products offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price.","Let\u2019s move on to sales by segment. We report two business segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations are reported under Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 74% of total company revenue in the quarter, decreased 1%. ","Results for the quarter included a 1 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro.","Let\u2019s review sales performance by customer-end market in the United States: Government and Retail were up in the mid-single digits; Light Manufacturing was up in the low single-digits; Commercial was flat; Heavy Manufacturing and Contractor were down in the mid-single digits; Reseller was down in the low double-digits and Natural Resources was down in the mid-teens.","We believe that growth in the Government and Retail end-markets was primarily a function of share gains as we outperformed our estimated growth of the market.","Now let\u2019s turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 7% of total company revenues. Sales for the quarter decreased 16% in U.S. dollars and local currency, consisting of a 15 percentage point decline in volume and a 1 percentage point decline in price.","All end-markets in Canada were down for the quarter. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 22%, compared to all other provinces which were down 12% in aggregate. In addition to a challenging economy, we are aggressively working through process standardization and change management related to the new IT system and expect improvement in the coming months.","Let\u2019s conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses, which represented 19% of total company sales. Sales for the Other Businesses increased 36%, consisting of 16 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, 15 percentage points from volume and price and 5 percentage points from foreign exchange. ","The organic sales increase was primarily due to growth from the single channel online businesses of Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO. Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for July and August and shared some information regarding performance in those months. ","Let\u2019s now take a look at September. There were 21 selling days in September of 2016, the same as 2015. Company sales were essentially flat in September versus the prior year. The sales performance consisted of 1 percentage point from volume offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price.","In the United States, September daily sales were flat, driven by a 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro, offset by a 1 percentage point decline from price. September customer end-market performance in the United States was as follows: Government and Retail were up in the low single-digits; Light Manufacturing was flat; Commercial and Heavy Manufacturing were down in the low single-digits; Contractor was down in the mid-single-digits and Natural Resources and Reseller were down in the low double-digits.","The benefit often seen from federal government customers at the September fiscal year end appears to have been realized a month early, as we saw strong growth to that end-market in August. ","In addition, the strong sales of seasonal products that benefited August did not continue into September. Sales in Canada for September were down 14% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency. The 15% decrease was driven by a 15 percentage point decline in volume. All end-markets except Light Manufacturing were negative. ","From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 22%, compared to all other provinces which were down 13% in aggregate. As mentioned in the quarter recap, we are aggressively working through process standardization and change management related to the new IT system.","Sales for our Other Businesses increased 17% percent in September, consisting of 14 percentage points from volume and price and 3 percentage points from foreign exchange. September was the first month where Cromwell sales were already included in the base results. The organic sales increase was primarily due to strong revenue growth from Zoro U.S., MonotaRO in Japan and the business in Mexico.","Sales growth in the month of October to-date is slightly below the sales performance in September. Multiple branches in the southeast and the distribution center in Jacksonville, Florida were closed earlier this month due to Hurricane Matthew. We believe there may be an effect on October sales, but it is too early to quantify that impact or any possible cleanup benefit. ","Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.","Bill Chapman","Thanks Laura. Let\u2019s talk about performance by reportable segment since we have already analyzed company operating performance. As a reminder, all figures below represent results adjusted for restructuring charges that Laura discussed earlier.","In the United States, operating earnings decreased 6% in the quarter, driven by lower sales and lower gross profit margins. Gross profit margins for the quarter declined 130 basis points, primarily driven by negative customer selling mix and price deflation exceeding product cost deflation. ","Operating expenses were down 2% due to lower payroll and benefits costs. The operating margin for the U.S. segment was 17.2% versus 18.1% in the 2015 quarter.","Let\u2019s move on to our business in Canada, which had an operating loss of $11 million in the quarter, versus operating earnings of $5 million in the 2015 third quarter, primarily driven by lower sales and lower gross profit. ","The gross profit margin in Canada declined 520 basis points versus the prior year, driven by product cost inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States. Due to service gaps stemming from the systems transition, we have not passed on price increases to customers this year and this is putting pressure on our gross profit margins. ","Operating expenses were down 9% versus the 2015 quarter driven by lower SAP costs and lower headcount. The new IT system continues to be a change management challenge for this business. However, we are making progress in areas such as direct-to-customer shipping, which has already increased each quarter for the year.","In the third quarter, 38% of shipments went direct to the customer, bypassing the branch network. We will provide more detail about the Canadian business at our Analyst Meeting in November.","Operating earnings for the Other Businesses were $25 million in the 2016 third quarter versus $15 million in the prior year, representing an earnings increase of 68%. Results included strong performance from Zoro U.S. and Japan and the earnings contribution from Cromwell.","Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net $29 million expense in the 2016 third quarter versus a net $21 million expense in the 2015 third quarter. The increase was driven by higher interest expense from the company\u2019s $400 million debt offering in May of 2016. ","Operating losses from the clean energy investments were higher as a result of higher demand from a warm summer resulting in a higher overall benefit to the company, net of tax credits.","For the quarter, the reported effective tax rate in 2016 was 34% versus 38.4% in 2015. The year-over-year decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to a higher benefit from the company\u2019s clean energy investments, partially offset by a larger proportion of earnings from higher tax rate jurisdictions. ","The 2016 third quarter also included a benefit from the conclusion of the federal income tax audit for the years 2009 through 2012 and other discrete items. Excluding the discrete items, the company\u2019s effective tax rate was 36.1%. ","We currently project an effective tax rate, excluding discrete items of 36.1% to 37.1% for the full year 2016 versus 36.8% to 37.8% provided on July 19, 2016. This decrease is driven by the expectation of higher benefit from the clean energy investments, partially offset by a larger proportion of earnings from higher tax rate jurisdictions.","Lastly, let\u2019s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $344 million versus $366 million in 2015, primarily the result of lower net income. We used the cash generated during the quarter and proceeds from the May 2016 debt offering to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. ","We returned a total of $275 million to shareholders in the quarter including $74 million in dividends, reflecting the 4% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2016. ","In addition, we bought back 887,000 shares of stock for $201 million in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $108 million in the quarter, versus $82 million in the third quarter of 2015. ","As reported in our 2016 third quarter earnings release, we updated our 2016 guidance. For the full year 2016, we now expect 1.5% to 2.5% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.40 to $11.70.","Let\u2019s look more closely at our current expectations. We\u2019ll begin with sales. For the full year, our guidance is lowered to reflect year-to-date performance and the expectation of continued modest sales growth in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we will have 63 selling days in the 2016 fourth quarter, one fewer than the 64 selling days in the 2015 fourth quarter.","Moving on to gross profit margins, for the full year, we expect gross profit margins to be down 170 to 180 basis points. We continue to see gross profit pressure due to unfavorable price-cost spread for the businesses in the United States and Canada, along with faster growth with the lower margin single-channel businesses. We expect gross margin pressure to continue into the fourth quarter.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at operating margin expectations. For the full year, we now anticipate operating margin of 12.3% to 12.5%, down 100 to 120 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we expect operating expenses to increase as a percentage of sales versus the 2016 third quarter, reflecting the following: number one the loss of a selling day; two, three months of depreciation for the new distribution center in New Jersey versus two months in the 2016 third quarter; three, the hiring of 30 new inside sales representatives in the fourth quarter to call on medium-sized customers given the success of the 275 inside sales reps added in the 2016 second quarter and fourth, the operating expense favorability in the 2016 third quarter related to the timing of program-related expenses and professional services that are not expected to repeat in the 2016 fourth quarter.","Finally, earnings per share. As noted earlier, we expect 2016 EPS of $11.40 to $11.70. For the full year, we now expect a $0.10 benefit to earnings per share in 2016 from the two clean energy investments, compared to our prior projection of a $0.07 benefit on July 19, 2016. Through the first nine months of the year, we have realized $0.06 per share of benefit from the investments. Please see Exhibit 4 for more detail. ","Finally, please mark your calendar for the following important dates: we will host our Annual Analyst Meeting on the morning of Friday, November 11th, which will be held at our headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois. We also plan to release October sales on November 11th. On Tuesday, November 15th, we will participate in the Barclays Select Series Industrial Distribution Forum in New York, New York.","If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Laura Brown at 847-535-0409, Michael Ferreter at 847-535-1439 or me, Bill Chapman, at 847-535-0881.

Chapman - Senior Director of Investor Relations","Laura D. Brown","Hi, this is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's 2013 Second Quarter Results. Please also reference our 2013 second quarter earnings release issued today, July 17, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website, to supplement this podcast.","Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.","Today, we reported results for the 2013 second quarter. Company sales for the quarter increased 6% versus the 2012 second quarter. There were 64 selling days in both quarters. Operating earnings increased 11%, and net earnings increased 14%. Earnings per share were $3.03 for the quarter, an increase of 15% versus the 2012 second quarter. The 2013 second quarter included a $0.03 per share tax benefit, which we will discuss later in the podcast. Excluding this benefit, earnings per share increased 14%. We also narrowed our guidance ranges for both 2013 sales and earnings per share, which Bill will cover in detail at the end of the podcast.","Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins increased 50 basis points to 44% versus 43.5% in 2012, primarily driven by Canada and the Other Businesses. Company operating margin increased 70 basis points to 14.7% versus 14% a year ago. Both reportable segments and the Other Businesses contributed to the increase in company operating margin, which was driven by the 6% sales increase, higher gross margins and operating expense leverage.","Operating expenses increased 5%, including $37 million in incremental growth-related spending versus the 2012 second quarter. These growth investments include additional sales coverage, eCommerce, inventory management, advertising, IT systems and expansion of the company's distribution center network.","We are continuing to aggressively invest in our growth drivers and are now estimating incremental growth-related spending of $150 million for 2013, $10 million less than we forecasted in the first quarter. The $10 million reduction in our estimate is largely driven by timing.","Given that we are at the midpoint, we thought it would be helpful to provide an update on our growth drivers. We added approximately 75 new sales representatives in the United States and expect to hire another 100 by year end. In addition, we've aggressively expanded our sales force in several of our international businesses, including Canada, Brazil and Mexico, where we've hired more than 70 new sales representatives year-to-date.","Our eCommerce sales continue to grow at twice the rate of our other channels. For the first half of 2013, eCommerce sales represented 32% of total company sales, up 200 basis points from full year 2012. We added more than 6,200 KeepStock installations in the United States in the first half of the year and are still targeting 10,000 installations for the full year. Outside of the United States and primarily in Canada, we added nearly 1,400 new KeepStock installations in the first 6 months of the year.","Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter in the month of June; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2013 guidance and other key items.","As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 6%. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 8% in April, 5% in May and 5% in June. As a reminder, April included a 2 percentage point benefit from the timing of the Easter holiday. The 6% increase in sales in the quarter included 4 percentage points from volume, 2 percentage points from price and 1 percentage point from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1 percentage point drag from unfavorable foreign exchange.","Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled, Other Businesses.","Sales in the United States, which accounted for 77% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 7%. This sales growth was driven by 4 percentage points from volume, 2 percentage points from price and 1 percentage point from the Techni-Tool business acquired on December 31, 2012. Daily sales increased 9% in April, 6% in May and 6% in June. The timing of the Easter holiday contributed 1 percentage point to daily sales growth in April.","Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Light Manufacturing was up in the high-single digits. Heavy Manufacturing, Commercial, Contractor and Natural Resources were up in the mid-single digits. Government and Retail were up in the low-single digits, and Reseller was down in the low-single digits. Our continued success with manufacturing customers further reinforces our commitment to add products and services to best serve customers in this important end market. The addition of more sales representatives, more products and more KeepStock installations are all contributing to share gain.","Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 12% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 3% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency. The 3% sales growth in U.S. dollars consisted of 2 percentage points from volume, 2 percentage points from favorable timing of the Easter holiday and 1 percentage point from sales of products used by customers following the flooding in Alberta, partially offset by a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange.","By month, daily sales in Canadian dollars increased 9% in April, 2% in May and 3% in June. The timing of the Easter holiday and an extra selling day in Canada versus the prior year contributed 5 percentage points to daily sales growth in April. Sales performance in Canada was driven by strong growth to customers in the Forestry, Construction and Light Manufacturing end markets.","Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, and represented 11% of total company sales in the quarter.","Sales for this group increased 5%, which consisted of 9 percentage points from volume and price and 2 percentage points from the acquired business in Brazil, partially offset by a 6 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The sales increase was primarily due to solid revenue growth in Mexico and the timing of the Brazil acquisition in the 2012 second quarter. In local currency, sales for the business in Japan grew in the high teens, but that growth was offset by the weakening of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.","Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for April and May and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at June. There were 20 selling days in June of 2013 versus 21 days in the same month of 2012. Company sales increased 5% on a daily basis in June of 2013 versus June of 2012. The daily sales growth in June included 4 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from price, 1 percentage point from the Techni-Tool acquisition, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange.","In the United States, June daily sales increased 6%, driven by 4 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from price and 1 percentage point from Techni-Tool. June customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Light Manufacturing and Commercial were up in the high-single digits; Heavy Manufacturing, Government and Retail were up in the mid-single digits; Natural Resources and Contractor were up in the low-single digits; and Reseller was down in the low-single digits.","June is the fiscal year end for many state governments. Our Government business benefited from strong growth among state government customers. In fact, daily sales to state and local government grew in the high-single digits for the month of June. Sales performance for our federal government business improved sequentially, but declined in the low-single digits. Sequestration remains a headwind for our federal government business.","Daily sales in Canada for June increased 3% in U.S. dollars and in local currency. The 3% daily sales growth consisted of 1 percentage point from volume and 2 percentage points from sales of flood-related products. Sales growth in Canada was driven by solid performance in the Forestry, Government and Light Manufacturing end markets.","Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 4% in June, consisting of 11 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 7% drag from unfavorable foreign exchange. In local currency, daily sales for our business in Japan grew in the mid-20s, but were offset by a weaker Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.","Daily sales growth in the month of July is currently trending below the growth rate reported for June, primarily due to a very light selling day on Friday, July 5.","Now, I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.","William D. Chapman","Thanks, Laura.","Since we've already analyzed company operating performance, let's jump right into performance by reportable segment.","Operating earnings in the United States increased 9% versus the 2012 second quarter, while the operating margin increased 40 basis points to 18.2%. This performance was driven by the 7% sales growth and positive operating expense leverage.","Gross profit margins for the quarter were essentially flat versus the prior year. We were able to increase prices above product cost inflation. However, this was effectively offset by unfavorable selling mix tied to stronger sales to large customers.","Operating expenses grew at a slower rate than sales and included $33 million in incremental growth-related spending on areas such as new sales representatives, eCommerce and advertising.","Let's move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings increased 11% versus the prior year in U.S. dollars. The improvement in operating performance was driven by higher sales and higher gross margins. Gross margins increased 140 basis points to 39.9%. The gross profit margin improvement was due to cost savings from freight consolidation, higher supplier rebates and favorable mix. Approximately half of the improvements are expected to continue into future periods.","The operating margin in Canada increased 90 basis points to 12.9%. The Other Businesses generated $13 million in operating earnings in the 2013 second quarter versus $11 million in the 2012 second quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by earnings growth in Japan and Europe, partially offset by lower earnings, and in some cases, larger losses for some of the smaller businesses in Asia and Latin America.","Below the operating line, interest expense, net of interest income, was $2.4 million in the 2013 second quarter versus $2.3 million in the 2012 second quarter. The tax rate in the quarter was 36.5% versus 37.9% in the 2012 quarter. The 2013 second quarter tax rate reflected a benefit from a resolution of foreign tax matters in the current period that resulted in a benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.03 per share. Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.3%. The company continues to project an effective tax rate for the year of 37.3% to 37.7%.","Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $210 million, up 59% versus $132 million in 2012. Cash flow in the 2013 quarter benefited from higher earnings and lower inventory purchases versus the prior year. The company used the cash to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","Capital expenditures for the quarter were $40 million versus $56 million in 2012. We paid dividends of $67 million, reflecting the 16% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2013. In addition, we bought back 521,000 shares of stock for $133 million and ended the quarter with 4.5 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $200 million to shareholders in the quarter.","As reported in our 2013 second quarter earnings release, we lowered the top end of our 2013 sales guidance by 1 percentage point and raised the bottom end of our 2013 earnings per share guidance by $0.10 per share. We now expect 5% to 8% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.40 to $12.","Let's look more closely at our current expectations. And let's begin with sales. The primary change since April relates to foreign exchange. We are now forecasting foreign exchange to be a 1 percentage point drag on sales for the full year versus the 0 to negative 1 embedded in our previous sales guidance. The new guidance range implies roughly 4% to 10% daily sales growth for the remainder of the year. We have 1 additional selling day in the 2013 third quarter, although selling days for the full year are equal to 2012.","Moving on to gross profit margins. We are forecasting gross margin expansion of 30 to 40 basis points for the full year. Keep in mind that much of the gross margin expansion was realized in the first half of the year, with gross margins increasing 60 basis points. Therefore, we are expecting gross margins in the back half of the year to increase a more modest 10 to 20 basis points. Unlike 2012, we are not planning any interim price increases for the remainder of the year given the low inflation environment for commodities. As we saw in the U.S. business during the second quarter, stronger sales growth to larger customers with lower pricing will continue to create some headwinds.","We expect full year operating margin expansion of 35 to 65 basis points. This expansion was front-end loaded, with 95 basis points of improvement coming in the first half of the year. For the second half of the year, we are forecasting that operating margins will decline 25 basis points on the low end and will increase 40 basis points on the high end. Incremental growth spending, now estimated to be $150 million for the year will accelerate. Details are provided in Exhibit 3.","Work is underway to build out a new enterprise system for the businesses in Canada and Mexico. Costs for the project are back-end loaded, but could reduce second half 2013 operating margins in Canada by 100 to 150 basis points depending on the pace of spending.","Finally, we are now forecasting foreign exchange, primarily related to the Japanese yen, to represent a $0.07 to $0.10 per share drag for the full year.","To summarize, 2013 will be a tale of 2 halves. In the first half of the year, we enjoyed nice operating margin expansion, fueled by robust gross margins and strong earnings leverage. As our growth initiative and SAP project spending accelerates in the back half of 2013, coupled with limited gross margin expansion, we are expecting much more modest operating leverage.","Finally, please mark your calendar for the following important dates. We plan to release July sales on Monday, August 12. We are scheduled to report third quarter results on Wednesday, October 16. And finally, you are invited to attend our Annual Analyst Meeting on Wednesday, November 13, which will be held at our brand new distribution center in Minooka, Illinois. This new facility is 1 million square feet and is highly automated.","Thank you for your interest in Grainger.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded.","I would now turn the conference over to our host, Irene Holman, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Irene Holman","Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Q2 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, CFO.","As a reminder, some of our comments may be forward-looking based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q2 press release, which is available on the IR website.","Reported results in the second quarter included a $3 million benefit to operating earnings and a $0.03 benefit to EPS primarily related to a reduction in lease obligations in Canada.","This morning's call we will focus on adjusted results which exclude the items outlined in our press release. Please also note within our comments we have removed the favorable timing impact of the North American sales meeting from gross profit margin and operating margin.","The sales meeting had a positive 20 basis points impact on total company gross profit margin and operating margin and a positive 25 basis points impact on U.S. gross profit margin and operating margin.","Now, I'll turn it over to D.G.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks, Irene. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today.","I'm going to discuss our first half and second quarter results and share an overview of what we're doing to drive growth in the U.S. and through our endless assortment model. Then Tom will provide details on the quarter, and we'll open it up for questions,","The demand environment has softened throughout the year. Having said that, our strategy is grounding -- and grounded and having a value proposition that resonates through economic cycles.","Through our high touch solutions model, we provide services and products to customers that help save them money, help them consolidate MRO spend, we manage their inventory, we provide solutions to simplify their purchasing process, we offer product substitution recommendations, we enable standardization across sites, and we help them keep their operations running and their people safe.","In times of slower growth, we partner with our customers to lower their costs, which strengthens our relationships. We're confident in our ability to gain share in both up and down cycles with this model. With our endless assortment model customers value are streamlined search experience and expensive assortment. We're investing for growth through this model and are bullish on the path ahead.","Turning to our performance so far this year, we delivered strong operating results in the first half of 2019, despite a slower global economy and significant investment in our endless assortment model. Year-to-date total company operating margin was 13%, up 50 basis points, and we've driven incremental margin of 42%. Operating cash flows in the first half of 2019 is up 14%.","We\u2019re through much of the heavy lifting on our cost takeout initiatives and are now focused squarely on driving profitable growth through our U.S. and endless assortment businesses.","At AGI, the top line recovery has been slower than we anticipated. We made multiple changes in a short amount of time that caused disruption to our customer base and we've seen more volume lost than we expected.","Revenue dollars were stable from first quarter to the second quarter, service is now once again strong when we started to win new business for the first time in a couple of years. We expect to see better performance in the second half of 2019.","At Cromwell, we have made many changes to position the business for growth. We redesigned the distribution center and launched store at UK leveraging the Cromwell supply chain. Performance has lagged in the short-term resulting from market conditions and our actions in the region. Performances at UK has been very strong. We remain committed to this market.","Our 2019, total company outlook remains the same for gross profit margins, operating margin and EPS based on our strong operating performance so far this year. We are lowering our estimate for market growth to minus 1% to 2% and lowering our revenue guidance with 2% to 5% growth due to the weaker demand environment and performance at AGI and Cromwell.","Moving to the quarterly sales performance in the U.S., the U.S. MRO market growth is decelerated from 2% to 2.5% in Q1 to approximately 1% in Q2. We estimate U.S. market growth included about one point in price. As a reminder, these are internal estimates of market growth. The factors that determine market growth are finalized over the next 60 days.","We expect the slow market growth to continue in the second half of 2019. In the quarter, market growth slowed across all of our end markets with the exception of health care. The core Grainger business grew about 150 basis points faster than the market. U.S. large customer daily sales growth was 2% and 11% on a two-year stack. U.S. midsize customer growth was 5% and 25% on a two-year stack.","We got off to a slower start in the first half of the year for two reasons. First, as we\u2019ve noted, we have seen a meaningful decline in the U.S. market growth from 2018. Second, we've implemented new initiatives to drive growth in 2019 and beyond and these activities take time to yield results.","One example of this is our merchandising initiatives. We've completely revamped our category review process to include the voice of the customer more to ensure that we have the right assortment, and that it is presented in the right way to our customers. This will lead to strategic product ads and improve product presentation.","The date we've implemented this approach on a small portion of our assortment, and the early results are very promising. We expect to be through about $1 billion worth of this assortment in the second half of the year and to accelerate these changes in 2020.","We are confident in our ability to accelerate our share gain in the remainder of the year. Our updated sales guidance for 2019 implies U.S. share gain of about 300 basis points in the second half. And we are fully committed to 300 to 400 basis points about growth versus the market on average over the next several years.","Let me spend a few minutes discussing our U.S. growth initiatives in the context of our value proposition. While we are in the early innings of these initiatives which are first shared in May we are encouraged by the results and remain committed to their implementation to drive the business forward. We generally think about them in two buckets.","The first are improvements to our foundation that ensure that we stay competitive and the second are incremental investments that contribute to our long-term goal of 300 to 400 basis points of growth above market.","In terms of what we call advantage MRO solutions we are investing in our foundation to allow us to offer better solutions for our customers. We are improving our product and customer information and building new data platform so that we can suggest more relevant solutions online over the phone at the branch and to our sellers.","We expect to start reaping the benefit of these efforts in early 2020. We are also investing in our website to make the search process easier. Feedback from our customers is positive and improving we will continue to make enhancements to our website throughout the back half of 2019.","To accelerate our growth, we are making incremental investments in marketing and merchandising. I've already talked about our merchandising initiatives, our marketing investments are focused on both digital and media, this spend has spread evenly throughout 2019 and we're seeing strong returns from these efforts.","Moving to our second pillar differentiated sales and services, from a foundation perspective we are investing to refine our customer relationship management processes, increase in our efforts to serve specific markets more effectively and improving sales force effectiveness.","In terms of inventory management, we have done some heavy lifting to realign our offer to drive profitability. Each stock which is the core piece of this offer is now profitable and ready to drive growth.","Sales to the service represent 10% of net revenue in 2018 and total sales with these customers represent about 30% of the U.S. revenue. Over the long-term, we expect sales to keep stock to go much faster than the overall business.","From an incremental perspective, we are expanding our service offering, which includes partnering with suppliers and utilizing our safety and other technical experts to help customers manage total cost and keep their facilities up and running and their people safe.","We're also looking at targeted expansion of our sales force where it makes sense. We're planning this strategically at sellers to address changes and how customers buy and to be more relevant in select segments.","With corporate accounts, we have been very focused to last two years on communications around the price changes, we are now in a position to deepen those relationships, to drive significant growth. These relationship stress from the plant floor to the C-suite and we have a significant opportunity to gain share with these customers based on the service and the capabilities that we can provide.","Our last pillar is unparalleled customer service. Our first priority is always to deliver a seamless customer experience. We are known for this in the market and are focused on retaining this advantage throughout order of cash work. We have implemented a number of initiatives in the past year that have resulted in an improved customer experience. Our metrics have improved, and customer feedback is at an all-time best in getting better.","In terms of fulfillment, we now have 600,000 products stocked in the U.S. very likely to when a customer places an order, we will have the products available for delivery next day and all in one box. We are adding capacity and capability with the addition of our distribution center in Louisville, which we expect to go online in early 2020.","Louisville will have the most capacity in our network and we will enable us to stock up to 800,000 SKUs in the U.S. with potential for more. When we add stock items, we tend to see significant lift in revenue.","Now historically, outside of the pricing reset, we get anywhere from slightly negative share gains to up to 300 basis points. When we've had share gain in the higher end, it's been by adding customer touches or products.","The initiatives I've shared to you both, increased marketing, improve product assortment and navigation, expanded services and sales force additions and the opening of our Louisville BC is expected to allow us to grow 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market over the midterm.","I also want to spend a few minutes on the investments were making sort U.S. drive to drive long-term profitable growth. You heard us talk about expanding the product assortment. We plan to add 1 million new items to assortment this year, we've already had 400,000. Overall, we plan add 10 million items over the next three to five years, the product adds are driving revenue growth similar to what was seen historically at MonotaRO.","Our investments in systems and people to help drive this growth are also going well. We are going live with the new product information management system for Zoro this year which will allow Zoro to add products at their own pace and to become less reliant on Grainger supply chain.","We\u2019re also improving our analytics platform which will help us better market our assortment to customers online. We are investing in Zoro for success. We expect the bulk of the infrastructure investments to be complete this year. We\u2019re optimistic on the trajectory of this business going forward.","Now, I\u2019ll turn over to Tom who will discuss the quarter\u2019s results in more detail.","Thomas Okray","Thanks, DG.","Looking at our total company adjusted results for the quarter, sales were up 1% daily and up 2% on a constant currency basis. Volume was up 1.5% and price was up 0.5%. Year-to-date price was up 1%. More perspectives, our U.S. and endless assortment businesses which represents approximately 90% of total revenue were up 5% but were offset by headwinds at AGI and Cromwell.","Moving to gross profit, our GP rate declined 35 basis points. The decline in GP rate versus the prior year was primarily driven by the other businesses. We drove operating earnings growth of 5% in the quarter, our operating margin grew 30 basis points versus the prior year due to gross margin in the U.S. Our cost takeout initiative at AGI and cost discipline in the U.S. and at the corporate level. For the quarter, we generated incremental margin of 39%.","Operating cash flow was $323 million in the second quarter of 2019, up 30% driven by better operating earnings and favorable working capital versus the prior year period.","Now let\u2019s look at our performance in the U.S. As DG mentioned, the demand environment slowed sequentially from Q1 to Q2. Daily sales were up 2% composed of volume growth of 1.5% and price inflation of 0.5%. intercompany sales to Zoro contributed 0.5%, which were completely offset by the decline of specialty brand.","Our GP rate increased 10 basis points excluding the remaining contract implementations, price cost spread was neutral. Gross profit margin also included a benefit from supply chain cost primarily related to freight and inventory optimization and positive mix.","With respect to the remaining contract implementation, we\u2019re on track to complete this work in 2019 with only 5% remaining.","In the quarter, we passed through a majority of tariff and non-tariff related cost inflation while ensuring that our pricing was market based. We still expect price cost to be neutral for the year excluding the remaining contract implementations and we\u2019ve taken the following approach to mitigate any headwinds associated with price cost. With price, one of the main objectives of the reset was to ensure our pricing was market competitive.","We can move web price fluidly throughout the year to ensure that we are priced appropriately. With contract customers, we can adjust price a few times during the year and we manage these relationships in terms of total cost ownership to ensure the customers are getting the most value.","On the cost side, we\u2019ve been very happy with our ability to navigate the tariff environment.","As a reminder, we have a cross functional team that meets regularly and is worked to minimize the impact. You may recall we originally expected about 2% cogs inflation related to tariffs.","Our actual exposure through working with our supplier partners has proven to be much less. More specifically, we\u2019ve leveraged our scale and maintained strong relationships with our suppliers allowing us to better predict and manage cost headwinds.","Also, we continuously evaluate our product portfolio to ensure we have the best product at the best cost which includes optimizing sources of supply.","Moving to operating earnings. Operating margin was up 60 basis points in the U.S. SG&A was flat and sales growth of 2%. Our continued cost discipline has enabled us to maintain SG&A while growing revenue. And we remained fully committed to growing SG&A at half the rate of sales on an ongoing basis.","In Canada, daily sales were down 23% and down 20% on a constant currency basis. Price was up 3% and volume was down 23%. Volume decline nearly resulted from the customer disruptions related to the turnaround activities we took last year.","Gross profit Margin was down 150 basis points in the quarter due to negative price cost spread. While we were able to pass through price in the quarter cost was unfavorable due primarily to lower vendor rebates on softer volume and the foreign exchange impact of U.S. denominated product purchases.","SG&A was down 26% versus the prior year, driven by the cost takeout initiative. Operating margin was down 30 basis points in the quarter reflecting lower gross profit margin partially offset by favorable SG&A rate.","We expect performance in Canada to improve in the second half of the year. Late in the quarter, we saw encouraging data showing that service levels and web sales were improving.","As DG mentioned, daily sales were flat from Q1 to Q2 indicating signs of stabilization on the top line. Recall that most of the significant volume decline associated with the turnaround actions occurred in the second half of 2018, therefore, we will have easier top line comparisons in the second half of 2019.","Moving on to other businesses. As a reminder, other businesses include our endless assortment model and our international portfolio. Daily sales were up 6.5% in the second quarter, and up 9.5% on a constant currency basis due to strong revenue from our endless assortment model. MonotaRO continues to grow significantly, and we're making good progress with our growth initiatives at Zoro.","Gross profit margin for the other businesses declined 220 basis points, driven by promotional activities at Zoro, unfavorable customer mix at Cromwell and freight headwinds in Japan. Operating margin declined 290 basis points for the other businesses, primarily driven by investments in Zoro U.S. to drive long-term growth and performance at Cromwell.","Page 15 covers our guidance for 2019. The total company level, we are reiterating our gross profit margin, operating margin and EPS guidance for the year. Our U.S. segment operating performance is strong and is more than offsetting slower performance at AGI and Cromwell. We expect U.S segment operating margin to be at the high end of the guidance range. While AGI is expected to be towards the low end of the range.","For other businesses, we are updating our operating margin guidance from 6% to 8% to 4% to 6% due primarily to performance at Cromwell.","Moving to our sales expectations. Our view of the MRO market has also changed from April, instead of 1% to 4% growth, we now expect negative 1% to positive 2% market growth for 2019.","Due to the slower demand environment, uncertain economic conditions, the early stages of our US growth initiatives and performance at both AGI and Cromwell, we are lowering our top line guidance from 4% to 8.5% to 2% to 5%.","Now I'll turn it back to DG for closing remarks.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks, Tom.","I would like to close by reminding you of our long-term performance expectations. We expect our initiatives in the U.S. to allow us to grow revenue 300 to 400 basis points faster than the market, on average over the next several years.","We believe Canada is an attractive market for Grainger to be in, it can grow faster than the market and be a double-digit operating margin business over the next five years. We expect continued strong growth with our endless assortment models to the strength of MonotaRO in Japan and the investments we're making in Zoro U.S.","Overall, we expect to drive strongest SG&A leverage and continued operating margin improvement resulting from incremental margin of 20% to 25%.","Now, I will open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please state your question.","David Manthey","Hi, thank you, good morning. Initially you are targeting double-digit growth within the U.S. medium customer set and now we're down the sort of a mid-single-digit growth rate this quarter, you mentioned the fluidity of pricing.","I'm just wondering if there's anything you can talk about there as it relates to price refinements to try to re-accelerate the medium customer growth that you've made recently, or you plan to make?","Donald Macpherson","Thanks, Dave. So, we still believe that we can grow midsize customers much faster than the market. We will need to grow them faster than 300 to 400 basis points faster than the markets to be able to hit our overall targets.","We have some good signs with our midsize customers. I would say that covered customers have continued to grow very strongly which is a signal that if the customers we've acquired are actually repeating at very strong rates, which is great to see. We feel like we have some efforts initiatives going with merchandising and marketing that can help us accelerate growth.","I would point out that pretty new to us to be through the pricing changes and focusing on the midsize customers so we're learning every day what's working and what's not. And we're going to know more as we go forward, but we still feel confident and we can grow significantly though that customers, support pretty all economics of the company.","David Manthey","Okay. And then as it relates to the reduction in the revenue outlook. I would assume that has more to do with your outlook for U.S. market growth just based on percentages than international or internal disruption.","But if you run the numbers based on the full year guidance to some extent it might imply flat to lower growth in the market, in the second half of this year and I am just wondering your thoughts on how severe this slowdown might be and is there a recession in your forecasting right now?","Donald Macpherson","Great question, when we talked about a lot. I would say we are certainly not going to forecast a recession and what we see in the market in the U.S. has been slow growth, but pretty stable over the last several months. So, we don't see anything that implies that we are heading off the cliff in the U.S. obviously internationally, there is pockets that are more problematic than others, but in general, we\u2019re not forecasting negative necessarily. We think it's a possibility that probably not a probability at this point.","David Manthey","Thanks, DG.","Donald Macpherson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Buckingham Research Group. Please state your question.","Robert Barry","Hey guys, good morning.","Donald Macpherson","Good morning.","Robert Barry","So, I just wanted to circle back on the price, I mean I think the price flowed from 1.5% in the first quarter to 0.5 in 2Q tariff headwinds they are kind of moving in the other direction. So just curious how you're thinking about tariffs and other inflation and help price might track over the next couple of quarters, kind of vis-\u00e0-vis what's happening in tariffs and inflation?","Donald Macpherson","Thanks, Robert. I would say the tariff environment is still a significant uncertainty and we'll see what happens in the next couple months in terms of resolving it or not. Our philosophy is to make sure that we are priced to the market.","We will continue to make sure we are priced competitively to be able to serve our customers well and we will take actions to make sure we will get it every day basically to make sure we're priced at the appropriate range. So that's really our philosophy and that's what we're focused on, just some uncertainty as to whether or not the tariffs are going to come through in a bigger way which gives price may go up or not, but our focus is really on making sure market competitive in terms of price.","Robert Barry","Got it. I mean just to clarify a couple of things, I mean since the list three didn\u2019t move up, I mean is that going to be a bigger headwind for you in the back half and if you're pricing the market is the fact that the pricing moderated at Grainger mean that what you're seeing in the market, I guess is to like, customers are not getting as much price.","Thomas Okray","Yeah, we've been planning for the change for quite some time. The way we've got it modeled is it's relatively small, as we said in the prepared remarks, we've been able to realize substantially less than the overall exposure. So, we don't believe that the change and in [indiscernible] is going to be that material for us.","Robert Barry","Got it. Could I just clarify one more thing, when you're talking about getting the outgrowth from what I think a point in 2Q to three points in the second half? Is it all these items on slide eight that you think are driving it and are they all just adding like 20 or 30 bps or is there one or two of them that's going to like to drive the lion share of the acceleration?","Donald Macpherson","So, yeah, thanks for asking that. We will provide more detail going forward, how much we expect each to provide. I will say that this is a pretty big shift for us and mindset shift in the sense that we've tracked market share in the past, but we've never targeted market share growth. And we've never had a set of initiatives that we are expecting to align to that growth, at least not explicitly.","And we do plan to become more explicit overtime, I gave the example of merchandising in the prepared remarks, which I think is a good one where this is a little bit new to us, we are having to break down some barriers to execute faster and move faster on some things and we're seeing good results. And we do expect that that momentum to continue to build. And so, we'll provide more of the specific details. But know that page eight is pretty important for us right now, I would say.","Robert Barry","All right, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn, with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.","Christopher Glynn","Yeah, thanks. Just had a couple questions about the endless assortment strategy, there. The incremental investment you're putting in this year, is that investment in the cost base, or does it tail off next year? And what do you thinking about timeframe for that business to be standalone capable?","Donald Macpherson","Yeah. So that, -- let me get to the last one second, most of the investments that we're making, in terms of getting platform and platform independence should be -- we should be through that by the end of this year. So, we expect some of the costs we've added in terms of analytics and people to stay, but a lot of the cost will fall off next year, as well.","In terms of standalone, it'll come in pieces. So, one of the biggest things we're doing is developing the capability for that business to add their own items and they add items from third-party shippers, which will make that business less reliant on Grainger obviously, for the core Grainger items Grainger will still fulfill, but that business will become less directly reliant on the Grainger supply chain overtime.","And so that should be -- we're going to implement that system in the third quarter, by the end of the year, we should have that capability. Similarly, the data analytics platform should be complete by the end of the year. So, a lot of this should really be through this year in terms of giving that business more independence. And that's really what we're targeting.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And then just a follow-up on the medium, if you go a little deeper into what you're seeing in terms of customer retention versus the paid visions, and overall, how is the base holding on from the initial burst of growth there?","Donald Macpherson","So, the basis holding on quite well, as I mentioned, we\u2019ve taken a portion of that base, about half of the midsize customers are now in some sort of coverage model and that has continued to grow at a pretty good clip. So, the base is held on pretty well, and we are acquiring customers, as well, but certainly we're happy with what we see with the base.","Christopher Glynn","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray, with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, it was really interesting about what you did not say in your prepared remarks or in your slides, there was no comment about weather and we've seen all kinds of pressures on your peers and you had to have felt some of the same pressures because this was a -- it was an important HVAC opportunity for your filters and refreshing refrigerants and so forth, But it didn't seem to impact you and maybe can clarify what sort of pressures you did see or did not see?","Donald Macpherson","Yeah, I mean, certainly the weather was not helpful, but it is a very small impact to us. It's less than 0.5% impact, so we didn\u2019t call that out as a separate item.","Deane Dray","Good. Appreciate that. And then just to clarify and just to make sure I'm clear on this, when you cut the sales high ended guidance, you\u2019ve cut that more than what the market growth cut on the high end, so 3.5 points on your sales, high end so why are you cutting that more, is that all Canada and Cromwell and just to clarify that, please.","Donald Macpherson","Yeah, it\u2019s a lot of it is Cromwell and Canada shrinking, so that\u2019s a big part of it absolutely.","Deane Dray","Got it. And just one last quick one, it\u2019s helpful on the appendix where you give the monthly progression, and can you comment on how June ended as being the strongest month and what sort of set up have you seen in July so far?","Donald Macpherson","Yeah, I mean we don\u2019t want to over index on any monthly trends given some of the noise that can happen in the month. I would say that we do feel like we gained a little bit more share in June and we do feel like the market like I mentioned before is not falling off a cliff. We expect to be in a slow growth market moving forward and it\u2019s been pretty stable from our perspective over the last several months.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzwinksi with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.","Josh Pokrzwinksi","Hi, good morning guys. On the -- and I appreciate these color you guys gave on the tariff environment and the ability to navigate that a little bit better as we move into this 25% in less three, maybe I missed it, but how would you kind of check that against the pricing environment out there, so maybe have to ask for a little bit less price, but what\u2019s the appetite in the market some other folks in the space have mentioned that\u2019s gotten a bit more challenging, what would be your take on those?","Donald Macpherson","Yeah, we\u2019re finding that we\u2019re able to pass on most of the tariffs related price increases. The one thing that we called out in terms of price neutral is the only thing impacting that that we excluded was the price reset.","We\u2019ve had a great relationship on the tariff side working with our supplier partners. They want to sell the products with us, and it\u2019s been going extremely well as a result Jeff.","Josh Pokrzwinksi","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just coming back to analyst assortment, obviously there\u2019s some kind of strategic synergy or operation playbook synergy from MonotaRO with Zoro. Once Zoro is further down the path and maybe just kind of learned all it can, is there a place for MonotaRO in the portfolio just given that it\u2019s a little bit more distant and probably doesn\u2019t give full credit from an external perspective given the strength of the business?","Donald Macpherson","Yeah so right now we\u2019re learning a lot from MonotaRO. There\u2019s a lot to learn from their success. There is probably more leadership synergy than might be easy to recognize in a sense that the leaders of all of the businesses get together frequently and talk about what they\u2019re doing. We haven\u2019t talked much about Zoro UK, the Zoro UK is on a terrific path and will be profitable early 2020, that\u2019s probably because of the linkages they have with MonotaRO and Zoro U.S.","It\u2019s a fair question but for now we certainly feel like we\u2019re getting a lot of synergies out of the portfolio and it\u2019s an important part of our portfolio going forward.","Josh Pokrzwinksi","Got it. Thanks for the color. I'll leave it there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please state your question.","Ryan Merkel","Hi, thanks. So, first off really nice job on the U.S. margins. My question is what is depriving you positively to hit the high end of the operating margin guidance just given the slower sales trajectory?","Donald Macpherson","Well, I think it's been our ability to generate incremental margin. We know we\u2019re in a choppy slowing market and our sales growth isn\u2019t going to be as great as we had planned. We\u2019re doing a lot of good work on cogs as we described. I think managing the tariff environment very well.","We\u2019re being very fiscally responsible on SG&A, while also really continuing to invest in our priorities, advertising, digital. So, it\u2019s really comes down to our ability to generate incremental margin. I mean we had very good results as we called out.","Ryan Merkel","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then moving to Canada. I hear you're saying average daily sales are stable from the first quarter, but the recovery still seems to be tracking a little bit slower. So, what are the main issues and then any change to getting to breakeven by the fourth quarter?","Donald Macpherson","The main issues have been when we went through some of the changes was first significant and there were many changes that we made. We had some customer's instruction that we are fully expecting.","I would say the most important thing for me is that the services improved in the business, we're hearing better things from our customers, we're starting to win back some customers which is really, really important. I think the business is very well-positioned from a cost and business model perspective now. And we need to get the top-line going and that\u2019s taken a little bit longer than we thought that\u2019s really the only thing that concerns us at this point, can we get the top-line going.","Ryan Merkel","And then breakeven by the fourth quarter 2019, is there any update there that you can provide?","Thomas Okray","As we said in our guidance, which is 1 to 54 for Canada, we believe to be tracking to the low end, so the answer would be yes, breakeven -- better than breakeven for the year.","Ryan Merkel","Okay, great. Thanks.","Thomas Okray","Welcome.","Donald Macpherson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please state your question.","John Inch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Can we talk about the trajectory in the quarter? Was there a step down from the first to second quarter as we hit April and then how did sort of medium versus large play out sequentially, if there is any color you could provide there that gives us, DG you've said that that's stable, but you know, it seems - the number seem sort of low but it looks like they picked up, is there any color you can provide?","Donald Macpherson","Certainly, I would say May was lower across all segments if that\u2019s what you are referring to and June was better. I would say some of that are factors that are frankly not worth talking about from the last year or two in terms them setting the baseline that you're comparing to.","But certainly, we don't see like I said before, we don't see anything falling off a cliff and we do see midsize customers growing faster than the rest of the business and we would expect to see that going forward.","John Inch","But it sounds like you are sort of downplaying the significance of at least the monthly June take back up to 3%, is that the function of compares or is it just you don't want to get ahead of your skis by overpromising just based on one month?","Donald Macpherson","I guess I would downplay May being down as well as low.","John Inch","Right.","Donald Macpherson","So, we would say that the quarter was -- if you average out the quarter that makes sense in terms of what we see from market growth.","John Inch","And was thee a disconnect between the kind of the large versus the medium going back to my prior question, and as you exited, there wasn\u2019t really, so I mean ...","Donald Macpherson","No, not really.","John Inch","It seems like medium, there is going to be pretty challenged to get back to double digit is that fair or do you see?","Donald Macpherson","In the short-term that would be fair, like I said we're learning every day and we're doing things to continue to improve the trajectory and we like what we\u2019re seeing, but certainly in the short-term, that\u2019s true.","John Inch","And then your margin guidance for the year, right, implies a significant step down from really commendable performance from the growth in non-profit margin side especially in the U.S. to sort of the total guide, which remains unchanged for the back half, what exactly is that seasonality or are there other things going on there or you just being conservative or why didn't you, why the step down I guess, particularly the midpoint.","Thomas Okray","You are referring to the U.S., so you're referring to the U.S.?","John Inch","Well, kind of the whole thing right, just if you look at the guide. But then you look at the, with just the complexion of what's driving that right?","Thomas Okray","Right. Okay. There is some seasonality as you look at the way we performed historically. The gross margin does go down over the year, also recognizing the uncertain economic environment we're in, we just thought it would be prudent to be cautious in this and we measured in our guidance range.","John Inch","So, Tom there is no price cost dynamic, I mean I know you talked about tariffs, you feel like you're on top of it, but there is no other price cost dynamic that's kind of playing out here that would be driving some of that disruptions?","Thomas Okray","No.","John Inch","All right, then it almost implies the guy could have a little cushion in it, is that fair?","Thomas Okray","Seasonality and just the economic environment that we're in, I think it pays to be prudent.","John Inch","Agreed. All right, thank you very much.","Thomas Okray","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Bergner with G Research. Please state your question.","Justin Bergner","Good morning, DG. Good morning, Tom.","Thomas Okray","Good morning.","Justin Bergner","Just on the guide, maintained margin guide, at least at the company level on. 2% plus lower sales. Just mathematically would suggest that EPS would be 2% lower, but it seems like you're maintaining that. So, should we also read that you're expecting operating margins to be a little bit above the midpoint of the guide at the company level to offset the lower sales?","Donald Macpherson","Well, I'm really not going to get into where we think we're going to land in the range other than what we said in the prepared remarks. We've been running the play in the first half of, not getting the sales we've wanted, generating very strong incremental margins. And we're going to continue to do that in the back half. And we think it'll work out well for us. But it really doesn\u2019t want to get into going forward where we think we're going to land in the range.","Justin Bergner","Understood. And then on repurchases. I guess you did a healthy amount of purchases this quarter, you've done $400 million year to date, that would put you tracking, at or above the high end of your range. If you sort of annualize that. Are you potentially going to do more repurchases in your earlier guide, or were they just more weight into the second quarter?","Donald Macpherson","So, I would go back to our capital structure tenants, one of the tenants that we have is we don't want to hold any excess cash. And we were in a good position where we were, we had generated quite a bit of cash and we just use that to return back to the shareholders. So, really nothing to read into that. As it goes to our initial guide, we're sticking with that and if it changes, we'll talk about it, next quarter.","Justin Bergner","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Donald Macpherson","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Patrick Baughman with JPMorgan. Please state your question.","Patrick Baughman","Hi, good morning, DG. Good morning, Tom. A few follow ups here. So, really good job on SG&A control in the first half of the year. Really, it looks like it was down year-over-year.","on a material to basis.","Can you take it down again year-over-year in the second half? And I'm just trying to understand what the levers are for that if you can. I ask because you said the cost actions are now, I guess complete. So, I'm just kind of curious of the levers on SG&A.","Thomas Okray","Yeah, our philosophy is that you can always optimize SG&A. And we will continue to look at that every day. The way we're looking at those is really trying to get to our 20% to 25% incremental margin. I mean, that's the objective that the organization is focused on. But there's always, there's always ways to take out costs. I think of the prepared remarks; the cost and cost takeout\u2019s ending were primarily related to Canada.","Donald Macpherson","And I would also just add that, I think if you look at our cost structure, a big part of our cost structure is process costs of distribution centers, contact centers. We've made some pretty big changes, for example, our contact centers, they are performing quite well now. They're going to continue to get better and better.","So, maybe the restructuring is done, but we expect every single year to get continuous improvement out of our big out of our big operations and we continue to see that and would expect to see that going forward. So, it's not like we're not going to improve our cost structure. It's just that we may not have as much restructuring type things.","Thomas Okray","And I just finally I would add one important thing is even in this down market, because of what DG talked about our focus on market share and our focus on growth. We are not backing off of any of our strategic initiatives spending to hit an SG&A number. We're continuing to go forward full speed on that.","Patrick Baughman","Do you think SG&A can decline in the second half year over year? And what, what drives, and I think last year and some big profit-sharing headwinds in the second half that were an impact in the numbers there. And I'm just, so maybe that's an easy comp. I don't know. I'm just trying to kind of tie those all the stuff together here.","Thomas Okray","Yes, we do have an easier comp as far as variable compensation. What I would say for the second half is we expect the SG&A rate to be lower than the previous year for sure.","Patrick Baughman","The -- as a percent of your sales, you're just saying that the level of SG&A.","Thomas Okray","That\u2019s the percentage of sales and we also expect the second half of the year to perform better than the first half of the year as it relates to favorability to the prior year.","Patrick Baughman","From an absolute dollar perspective.","Thomas Okray","From a rate perspective.","Patrick Baughman","From a rate perspective, got it, understand. And was that profit-sharing expense line, was that a help in the second quarter year-over-year, was it a tailwind?","Thomas Okray","Sure. Yeah.","Patrick Baughman","And then just. Go ahead. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.","Donald Macpherson","That's okay. That's okay. Yes.","Patrick Baughman","And then DNA looks like it's down year-to-date. What's driving that?","Thomas Okray","That's compared to last year, we had some issues in terms of keep stock, right, awesome machines, older machines that we replace. We also had some capital expenditures at two of our bigger DCs. So, we had a favorable compare there to last quarter.","Patrick Baughman","Thank you.","Thomas Okray","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bhupinder Bora [ph] with Wolfe Research. Please state your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning, guys. This is Bhupinder here, sitting in for Nigel. So, just, Tom, I think you mentioned you gave some guidance on the other businesses margin here, can you just give some more color on those margins targets and what your confidence is actually in the back half to achieve those targets for the year?","Thomas Okray","Yeah, we took down the other business unit operating margin target, primarily due to the performance in our Cromwell business unit. Obviously with the uncertainty of Brexit also that just combined with the transformation that we've got going on in that entity, where we're really changing the business model there in terms of being decentralized with the branch network and trying to have more centralization.","Some of the things that we've noted on Canada, we're seeing there where we've disrupted the customer base, those types of things. So that's why we're taking down primarily for the other business unit.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, and is investment spending a big part of that or is it pretty small, I mean you guys have done with ...","Donald Macpherson","Certainly, the investment spending in Zoro in the U.S. is a big part that was planned at the beginning of the year. And we are we are spending that money and seeing what we want to see out of that. So, we had always planned for the Zoro margins to come down in the year. And that's what we're seeing. So that's when we talk about investment spending, that's really what we're referring to.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, got it. If I can, another one here on pricing, as we saw in the first quarter pricing was 1.5, 2.5. How should we think about the back half, because when you look at last year, second half, I think we had pretty kind of close to 100 bps, actually pricing every quarter. Are we going to see much more realization what we have seen in the quarter, or as kind of tariffs kick in, like in the second half List 3, so if you can give some color on that? Thanks,","Donald Macpherson","I think, like we said before, I think our focus really is to make sure that we are market priced in everything that we do. Depending on how the tariffs play out, that could mean more price or less price, I think and that there is some uncertainty around that. But we are tracking and watching this very, very closely and our objective always to make sure that we're priced competitively, and we will make sure we do that.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question.","Steve Barger","Hey, good morning. Just looking at heavy manufacturing down low single digit and natural resources down mid-single. In general, what are the customers or your sales force saying there, is there an expectation for improvement in the back half of those segments?","Thomas Okray","It's hard to tell. I mean, heavy manufacturing was basically flat for the second quarter, actually, in June, the overall market I'm referring to is actually negative. So, it's hard to tell where that segments going to go.","Obviously, we've got a number of initiatives in play, which DG referenced in the prepared remarks in the Q&A. We think despite that down or slowing market, we're going to be able to gain share.","Steve Barger","And just more broadly, given softer markets are customers leaning towards lowering reorder points or the amount of inventory they're willing to hold. And does that change how you think about inventory at the DCs.","Donald Macpherson","Generally, not much. I mean, the reality is that customers don't hold a whole bunch of our inventory anyway. And the way we've structured most of our large customer relationships, we're helping them manage your inventory, we set MOQs that allow them to operate at a pretty lean level.","So, we don't see a lot of channel loading or anything like that, with our customers, given that the business model, and our business model is based on this entirely on helping them manage your inventory effectively.","Steve Barger","Got it. Thanks.","Donald Macpherson","Thank you.","Thomas Okray","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please state your question.","John Inch","Yeah, just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask you about Europe. One of the things we've gleaned this quarter thus far from other companies is the European economies are actually starting to show up in a much more pronounced basis negatively. And it implied that the other business results were more UK Brexit oriented, maybe a little bit of your own affliction. What's going on, actually, with respect to Fabory and just what you're seeing in continental Europe? And does that way on the results and have any sort of bearing on the second half in terms of your own expectations?","Donald Macpherson","I think what we've seen over there, as we've seen, obviously, the UK market has been struggling a bit. And we've seen some manufacturers shift some of their production from UK to the Mainland of Europe.","The favorite businesses had sort of consistent, modest growth this year, we think the market in the Netherlands and Belgium where they are, it's been up, combined, but not thought up significantly. Certainly, there are signs of some pressures in the European market. But what we see that favorite hasn't really weighed on results, so we are feeling in the UK has.","John Inch","And the expectation that you achieve because you think it's just more of the same coming or the reasons based on just extra quarter trends or anything else. So, things get better, a little bit worse?","Donald Macpherson","Yeah, and I would just, I would just remind, they may get a little bit worse, I would just remind you that we are very small and Fabory. So, it doesn't have a meaningful impact on us right now. So, I don't -- and I also don't know that we have the best lens. I mean, we have the lenses, the Netherlands primarily and some Belgium business. So, we don't have anything really in France speaking of a very, very little in Spain. So, we don't really have much exposure to the big markets to have a position.","John Inch","Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Bergner with G Research. Please state your question.","Justin Bergner","Guys, thanks for the follow-up. With respect to neutral price cost, are you seeing any different dynamic between sort of the industrial part of your portfolio and the non-industrial part of your portfolio? Just given some of the comments from other MRO distributors earlier in the quarter.","Donald Macpherson","I have to think about that. I'm not sure I have a great answer for you to be honest. My inkling is probably not seeing much different. But I don't know that I could necessarily say that with certainty. I've looked at the total. And I'd have to go ask some questions about that. Interesting question.","Justin Bergner","Okay, great. And then lastly, with respect to the endless assortment model, you use the term continuous growth versus accelerating growth? Does that just reflect more challenging end markets? Or is there anything sorts of structural to be read into that changing language?","Donald Macpherson","The structural, I think there's a sort of law of the universe, which is always been growing over 24 the first 5 or 6 years. If we want to continue to grow in the 20s. We view something else given as it gets bigger, that becomes harder to do. So, we didn't want you to think that we're going to accelerate from the 20s to the 30s or 40s, we're going to try to continue to have a strong growth rate.","Justin Bergner","Great. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Patrick Baughman with JPMorgan. Please state your question.","Patrick Baughman","Hi. Thanks for giving me follow-up. I just wanted to follow-up; you've mentioned keep stock. And you said it's now profitable and was 10% of the business in 2018 and will grow faster, I guess then the rest of the business going forward. There hasn't been a ton of visibility here the last couple years.","So just curious, if you could give a quick update and kind of what you've been doing there? Was it losing money last year and kind of what changes have you made to improve profitability and make you feel like you can grow it better and more profitably in the future?","Thomas Okray","Yes. We have about 3 years ago, 2 to 3 years ago, we made some changes and that's improved the profitability. We're now squarely in the place where we're building new capabilities.","We've done some work on software, we've done some work on visibility and analytics and reporting to help customers understand the value that we're bringing, and we're going to continue to push on those things. The comments it's really around, we haven't for a couple of years, we hadn't been focused as much on capability building as we improve the profitability and now, we're really focused on that. And so that's going to be our focus going forward.","Donald Macpherson","I think it's important to note that in June, we had our fastest growth way that we had in two years related to keep stock.","Patrick Baughman","Got it. Okay, make sense. Thanks again. Good luck.","Thomas Okray","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks.","Operator","Thanks. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. DG Macpherson for closing remarks.","Donald Macpherson","All right, thanks for joining us. I would just reiterate a couple of points. One is, in the U.S. given the profitability, we are really focused on growth and gaining share going forward and it\u2019s a bit of a new orientation for us to say, we\u2019re going to gain share on a consistent basis. But we are wiring ourselves up to be able to do that and that\u2019s our primary focus and the other is the online model continues to be here profitable on a fast grower and so we\u2019re investing to make sure we can do that.","If those two things go well, we\u2019re pretty excited about the future and I look forward to talking to you one on one, so thanks for your time and I appreciate you on the phone.","Operator","Thank you.

(NYSE:GWW) Q1 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call April 16, 2015  7:30 AM ET","Executives","Laura Brown - Senior Vice President, Communications and IR","Bill Chapman - Senior Director, Investor Relations","Analysts","Laura Brown","Hello. This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger\u2019s First Quarter 2015 Results. Please reference our 2015 first quarter earnings release issued today, April 16th, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website, to supplement this podcast.","Today we also announced a permanent change to our capital structure and our intent to buy back $3 billion in stock by the end of 2017. In just a moment, we will provide some additional commentary regarding this important communication.","Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information.","These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations, and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.","Our capital structure announcement details our plan to repurchase $3 billion of our stock over the next three years. This represents approximately 19% of today\u2019s market capitalization.","Year to date, we have purchased $150 million in shares. The additional repurchases will be funded with a combination of $1.2 billion of internally generated cash and $1.8 billion of new, permanent debt over the next three years.","Here are some important points to keep in mind. The cost of debt is at historic lows. The issuance of permanent debt will increase the efficiency of our balance sheet and will lower our cost of capital.","We expect to issue $1 billion in long-term debt in June to help fund the program. Our new target debt ratio of 1.0 to 1.5 times EBITDA was chosen specifically to preserve our access to the Tier 1 commercial paper market.","The timing, size and structure of the share repurchase and debt issuance is flexible enough to allow for continued investment in the business, while being meaningful to the equity markets.","We fully intend to continue our 43-year track record of increasing our dividend. Finally, the repurchase will be EPS accretive. The incremental $1 billion in repurchases, beyond the $400 million previously announced, should add $0.08 to $0.12 earnings per share in 2015.","Let\u2019s move on to our quarterly results. Today we reported our 2015 first quarter. Our performance was characterized by continued share gain in our U.S. business and in our single channel online businesses.","At the same time, the strength of the U.S. dollar represented a significant headwind to our topline growth, as did our direct and indirect exposure to the oil and gas sectors in North America.","With no evidence of any change to this pattern in sight, we have adjusted our full year guidance. At the end of this recording, we\u2019ll talk in more detail about our expectations and assumptions for the full year 2015.","Let\u2019s begin with an overview of the quarter. Company sales increased 2%. We had 63 selling days in the quarter, the same as in the previous year. Operating earnings declined 1% and net earnings were down 3%.","Earnings per share of $3.07 were flat versus the previous year. Results included $0.02 per share in charges related to the previously announced shutdown of the business in Brazil and $0.01 per share in charges for restructuring Fabory in Europe. Excluding these charges, earnings per share increased 1% to $3.10.","Let\u2019s now walk down the operating section in the income statement in more detail. Reported gross profit margins decreased 0.3 percentage point versus the prior year to 44.8% driven by lower gross profit margins in the Canadian segment and the Other Businesses.","Company operating earnings declined 1% versus the 2014 quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by the performance of the business in Canada reflecting continued headwinds from the economy due to exposure to oil and gas, coupled with unfavorable foreign exchange. Operating expenses for the company increased 3% and included $33 million in incremental growth and infrastructure spending.","Let\u2019s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we\u2019ll cover the following topics. First, sales by segment in the quarter and in the month of March, second, operating performance by segment, third, cash generation and capital deployment and finally, we\u2019ll wrap up with a discussion of our 2015 guidance and other key items.","Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. Despite this, we use the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales.","Company sales for the quarter increased 2%. The 2% sales growth included 1 percentage point from acquisitions, namely WFS Enterprises Incorporated acquired in September of 2014 in Canada, and a 3 percentage points reduction from foreign exchange.","Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 4% driven exclusively by volume growth. By month, total daily sales growth was as follows, 3% in January, 2% in February and 1% in March.","Let\u2019s move on to sales by segment. We report two business segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations, located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. Our Other Businesses also include results from our single channel online businesses in Japan, MonotaRO, the United States, Zoro and Europe.","Sales in the United States, which accounted for 78% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 4%. The sales growth was driven by 2 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from sales of Ebola related safety products and 1 percentage point from higher sales to Zoro, the single channel online business in the United States. By month, daily sales increased 4% in January, 4% in February and 4% in March.","Let\u2019s review sales performance by customer end market for the quarter in the United States. Commercial was up in the high single digits driven by strong performance in the Healthcare sector, Light Manufacturing, Government and Retail were up in the mid-single digits, Heavy Manufacturing was up in the low single digits, Contractor was down in the low single digits and Natural Resources and Reseller were down in the mid-single digits.","Now let\u2019s turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 10% of total company revenues in the quarter. The business in Canada continues to face a challenging economy given the country\u2019s exposure to oil and gas. Results reported in U.S. dollars are further affected by the stronger U.S. dollar. Sales for our business in Canada declined 8% in the quarter were up 3% in local currency.","The 3% sales increase in local currency consisted of 7 percentage points from WFS and 2 percentage points from price. This growth was partially offset by a 5 percentage points decline in volume and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products.","The 5% volume decline for the quarter was primarily driven by lower sales to the Oil and Gas, Construction, Reseller, Commercial, Retail and Heavy Manufacturing customer end markets partially offset by growth to customers in the Utilities, Light Manufacturing, Transportation, Forestry, Mining and Government customer end markets.","On a geographic basis, sales in the province of Alberta, which represents more than a third of the company\u2019s business in Canada, was down in the mid-teens in local currency. Local currency sales for all provinces except Alberta and British Columbia were up versus the prior year. By month, daily sales in Canadian dollars increased 6% in January, 1% in February and 2% in March.","Let\u2019s conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. This group includes our operations in Asia, Europe and Latin America, and represents about 12% of total company sales.","Sales for this group increased 8%, 21% in local currency consisting of volume and price. The sales increase was primarily due to sales growth in our single channel online businesses in the United States and Japan, as well as our multichannel business in Mexico.","Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for January and February, and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let\u2019s now take a look at March. There were 22 selling days in March of 2015, one more than in 2014. Company daily sales increased 1% versus March of 2014.","Sales results in March included 1 percentage point from acquisitions and a 3 percentage point decline from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic daily sales increased 3% driven by 4 percentage points from volume, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price.","We also benefited from modest cost deflation, which helped mitigate the negative price realization in the United States. Price increases in Canada offset inflation from a weaker Canadian dollar on U.S. imports.","In the United States, daily sales in March increased 4%. This increase was due to a 5 percentage point increase in volume, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price.","March customer end market performance in the United States was as follows. Commercial was up in the high single digits, driven by strong sales to customers in the Healthcare sector, Light Manufacturing was up in the mid-single digits, Heavy Manufacturing, Retail and Government were up in the low single digits, Contractor was down in the low single digits, Reseller was down in the mid-single digits and Natural Resources was down in the low double digits.","Daily sales in Canada for March were down 9%, but were up 2% in local currency. The 2% daily sales increase consisted of 6 percentage points from WFS and 3 percentage points from price, partially offset by a 6 percentage point decline in volume and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products.","The volume decline was driven by lower sales to the Oil and Gas, Contractor, Commercial, Government, Heavy Manufacture and Retail customer end markets, partially offset by growth in the Utilities, Light Manufacturing, Transportation, Mining and Forestry customer end markets.","On a geographic basis, sales performance in Canada was driven by softness in the province of Alberta, which represents slightly more than a third of our sales in Canada and was down mid-teens in local currency in March.","Daily sales in March for our Other Businesses increased 3%, 18% in local currency. The 18% daily sales growth in the Other Businesses was primarily driven by Zoro U.S. along with strong growth from the businesses in Japan and Mexico.","Looking ahead to April, daily sales growth to-date is running in line with the sales growth reported for March.","Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.","Bill Chapman","Thanks Laura. Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let\u2019s move right into results by reportable segment. Operating earnings in the United States increased 4% versus the 2014 first quarter, with operating margins flat at 18.6%.","Gross profit margins for the quarter declined 40 basis points driven by higher sales to Zoro U.S., reflecting the lower transfer price used to account for these intersegment sales. Excluding Zoro U.S., gross profit margins were flat versus the prior year.","Operating expenses for the U.S. segment increased 3% and included $22 million in incremental growth and infrastructure-related spending.","Let\u2019s move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings decreased 56% versus the prior year. The decrease was driven by the 8% sales decline, unfavorable foreign exchange, lower gross profit margins and negative expense leverage.","Gross profit margins in Canada declined 70 basis points versus the prior year, due to lower gross profit margins at WFS. Excluding WFS, gross profit margins were flat versus the prior year as price increases and higher freight revenue were offset by unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States. The Canadian business increased prices in the first quarter to offset unfavorable foreign exchange rates on product sourced from the United States.","Despite the headwinds in Canada, we continue to invest in the business through this difficult macroeconomic environment to strengthen our operations and better position the business for the long-term.","The Other Businesses generated $10 million in operating earnings in the 2015 quarter versus $8 million in 2014. This performance was primarily driven by strong results from Zoro in United States and MonotaRO in Japan, along with reduced losses in China.","In addition, costs associated with the previously announced shutdown of the business in Brazil and planned restructuring expenses for Fabory in Europe partially offset earnings for the Other Businesses in the quarter and are expected continue into the second half of 2015.","The charges related to Brazil and Fabory resulted in a reduction in earnings per share of approximately $0.02 and $0.01 per share in the quarter, respectively, and are excluded from company guidance.","For the full year, planned shutdown costs for Brazil and restructuring costs for Fabory are estimated to be $0.09 and $0.04 per share, respectively.","Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net expense of $4 million in the 2015 first quarter versus $3 million in the 2014 first quarter. This $1 million increase was primarily the result of higher foreign currency transaction losses and lower interest income from lower average cash balances.","For the quarter, the effective tax rate in 2015 was 38.4% versus 37.7% in 2014. The increase was primarily due to more earnings in the United States relative to other jurisdictions with lower tax rates. We are still projecting an effective tax rate of 37.7% to 38.8% for the full year 2015.","Lastly, let\u2019s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $156 million in the 2015 first quarter versus $168 million in the 2014 first quarter. The company used the cash generated, along with cash on hand, to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends.","Capital expenditures were $99 million in the 2015 first quarter versus $66 million in the first quarter of 2014. The increase in capital expenditures versus prior year was attributable to investments in our distribution network, primarily the distribution center in the Northeast United States and IT-related spending. We returned $223 million to shareholders through $73 million in dividends and $150 million to buyback 634,000 shares of stock.","Now let\u2019s take a look at guidance. As reported in our first quarter earnings release, we lowered our 2015 sales and earnings per share guidance. There are three primary factors contributing to this change.","First, the weakness in oil and gas prices will dampen the industrial economy in North America, reducing our expectations for macroeconomic growth.","Second, despite softness in the U.S. economy, we see share gain opportunities with large customers and instead of hiring 200 new sales representatives in 2015, we now plan to add 400.","Admittedly, this will create expense headwinds in the near-term in addition to lower expense leverage on lower sales volume, but it will ultimately help Grainger extend its advantaged position in the MRO marketplace. In addition, many of our cost productivity projects are delivering at or above plan, mitigating some of the lost expense leverage.","Accordingly, we now expect approximately $150 million in incremental growth and infrastructure spending for the full year of 2015 versus the $130 million midpoint originally forecasted. The $150 million estimate represents the high end of the growth and infrastructure spending range.","Lastly, we updated EPS guidance for the accretion from $1 billion of additional share repurchases now planned in 2015. We now expect 1% to 4% sales growth and earnings per share of $12.25 to $12.95.","Let\u2019s look more closely at the underlying elements of our expectations versus normalized results in 2014. We\u2019ll begin with sales. We now expect sales growth of 1% to 4%, down from 3% to 7%, reflecting reduction of 100 basis points from a weaker economy and 100 basis points from lower than expected sales from the multichannel model, primarily in Canada. We have also revised our full year price realization estimate to zero percent given the current environment.","Moving on to gross profit margins, for the full year, we now expect gross profit margins to be flat to down as much as 20 basis points. For the 2015 second quarter, we are expecting gross profit margins to expand or contract as much as 10 basis points versus 2014.","Please keep in mind as you model margins for the second quarter and the remainder of the year, our first quarter included supplier support for our annual customer trade shows and as a result, both gross profit margins and operating expenses as a percent of sales are inflated by about 100 basis points.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at operating margin expectations. In 2015, we anticipate operating margin to be flat to down as much as 40 basis points versus 2014. As our guidance implies, given our commitment to growth and infrastructure investments, we lose operating leverage below about 4% sales growth.","For the 2015 second quarter, margins are forecasted to decline 25 to 45 basis points versus the 2014 second quarter due to the anticipated incremental growth and infrastructure spending in the second quarter. Please see Exhibit 3 for more information.","Finally, earnings per share, as noted in our revised guidance, we now expect EPS of $12.25 to $12.95, reflecting the headwinds from the economy and the incremental sales force hires, partially offset by the success of our productivity programs and expected accretion from the $1 billion in incremental share repurchases in 2015.","So to conclude please mark your calendar for the following upcoming events. On April 29th we will host our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The script from that meeting will be available on our website following the event. On May 6th, Court Carruthers, Senior Vice President and Group President, Americas, will present at the Robert W. Baird Growth Stock Conference in Chicago. The event will be webcast. We plan to report April sales information on May 13th. And finally, on May 20th, Jim Ryan and Ron Jadin will present at the Electrical Products Group Meeting in Longboat Key, Florida.

Grainger fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Laura Brown, Senior Vice President, Communications and Investor Relations. Thank you Ms. Brown, you may now begin.","Laura Brown","Good morning, everyone. This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. Thank you for joining us this morning. With me is DG Macpherson, Grainger's CEO and Ron Jadin, Grainger's CFO.","Earlier this morning, we reported our results for the 2016 fourth quarter and full-year. Included in today's press release were several large adjustments. We would like to take this opportunity to discuss these adjustments in further detail and that's the reason we decided to host a live call this quarter.","As a reminder, some of our comments today maybe forward-looking, based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties including those detailed in our SEC filings. These documents are available on our Investor Relations website together with reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with the corresponding GAAP measures.","DG will begin by making some opening comments regarding the performance of the business as well as provide additional cover on a couple of the adjustments. He will then turn the call over to Ron to discuss the remaining adjustments. After closing remarks, we'll open the call for question. DG, to you.","DG Macpherson","Thank you, Laura. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Even though our underlying operations performed is expected, given the number and the size of several fourth quarter adjustments, I thought the need to discuss them more in open detail. As Laura mentioned, Ron will cover several of the accounting adjustments as well but before we do that, I would like to share my thoughts on the performance of the business for the quarter.","The fourth quarter was operationally in line with the expectations we shared in November at our Analyst Day, both from a sales and an earnings perspective. Our US business performed slightly better than expected given stronger sales performance in December in solid expense management. Our business in Canada was still underperforming is making progress and also met our expectations for the quarter with better than expected sales performance in the month of December.","Both the US and Canada exceeded our sales expectation in the month of December, which we partially attribute to the favorable timing of the year and holidays and some customer year-end spending. Our single channel online business is primarily Zoro in the US and MonotaRO in Japan, continued to perform quite well, growing revenue and earning strongly in the quarter.","So far, in January we're seeing some softness which we believe is related to extend the vacations that occurred in early January due to the timing of the New Year's holiday. In addition, January has a touch count both in the US and Canada. And in Canada, especially why that's some prebind that occurred prior to the new system implementation of February 1st last year.","Now, this past year, we made strong progress towards positioning the business for better growth and performance in the future. Several examples include further realignment of the large customer Salesforce to focus on specific end markets. The launch of our inside sales team focused on medium-sized customers, the opening of our 1.4 million square foot new DC in the North East. We made significant progress on e-commerce both with our www.grainger.com and online model with the customer experience.","We continued previously announced restructuring in the US and Canada including the closure of 69 branches, and we also initiated new pricing in the US which provide a more relevant price for new and noncontract customers across all channels including the web. Now, with that overview of the quarters of backdrop, I would like to now cover two of the adjustments that we reported today. First, our decision to write down a portion roughly half of the goodwill associated with the Fabory business; which was acquired in August of 2011.","The impact EPS was $0.79. For those of you not familiar with Fabory, it is a fastener specials primarily focused in the Netherlands and Belgium. We have restructured this business on several occasions and we are seeing improved revenue and stable margins resulting from the current initiatives. And while we believe that business has potential for growth in the future. Our historical weak growth in margin performance caused us to revalue the long-term goodwill.","Secondly, we took at $0.08 EPS impairment charge for some intangible assets related to our business in Columbia. Both Fabory and Columbia are fastener specials and outside of our broad line MRO portfolio. We have been taking action in the last couple of years to make sure that we focus on our core broad line MRO markets in developed economies. So, with that I would like to turn it over to Ron to discuss the remaining adjustments.","Ronald Jadin","Thank, DG. As we shared in this morning's release, we recognize the $36 million or $0.38 per share charge related to an accounting adjustment for unclaimed property. For Grainger, unclaimed property is debt is defined primarily as aged customer debits and credits. Prior to 2013, the unclaimed property was recognized as income and no liability was established. The adjustment made in the fourth quarter reflects our best estimate of any unclaimed property prior to 2013. This issue was identified internally and the estimate has been validated by external third parties.","In 2013, we implemented a new process and began establishing liability for unclaimed property. In addition, we recorded $9 million or a $0.10 per share charge to increase the reserve for contract dispute. We've been working with the General Services Administration or GSA, auditors to resolve these issues from an ongoing audit. These issues related to tax rate and miscellaneous billing errors, this dispute relates to sales under a multi-award contract beginning in 1999.","The GSA continues to be a great customer. We have done more than $2 billion in business with them since the beginning of the contract in 1999. In addition, there were several small discrete tax items recorded in the quarter, the true up estimated tax is versus taxes paid, primarily for US federal and state tax provisions. Combined these at a negative $0.06 EPS impact, partially offsetting $0.21 in EPS favorability recorded in earlier quarters from the settlement of tax returns for the years 2009 to 2012.","Now, I'll turn it back to DG for closing comments.","DG Macpherson","Thanks, Ron. Well, I'm certainly not pleased with the need to make these adjustments in 2016. The underlying business generally met our expectations. As a result, we reiterated our sales in EPS guidance for 2017. As I mentioned earlier, we made significant changes to the business over the last year and I am excited about the future prospects for growth and profitability for the business. We are focused on our core businesses in North America, the online model in the UK.","We generated $1 billion in cash flow at 2017. We expect to see free cash flow continue to grow as we will not need to spend as much in the coming years on capital expenditures as we have in the recent past. So, with that, I'd like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ryan Merkel","Hey, good morning guys, and congrats on being the quarter.","DG Macpherson","Thank you.","Ryan Merkel","So, first question from me is why are you reducing gross margins for the year and then secondly related, you also mentioned that Apex is tracking a little bit lower and you're changing that. So, what's underlying those two things?","DG Macpherson","Yeah, go ahead, Ron.","Ronald Jadin","Sure. Ryan, it's really early to make a call on guidance for the year based on where we ended the fourth quarter really being right on our guidance. As we thought about it, our favorability in expenses we thought we should reflect slightly but we didn\u2019t want to change the overall, so it's just kind of at really at the front, just a minor tweak for recognize a little bit of favorability and a little bit of risk on either expense or GP.","But I wouldn\u2019t read really probably we shouldn\u2019t have changed anything in line side, it was such a small change and we really don\u2019t know any more about the year, now then when we set it November.","Ryan Merkel","Okay, so nothing really that dramatic change with the gross margin?","Ronald Jadin","No. We don\u2019t intend any real signaling there.","Ryan Merkel","Okay, got it, okay.","Ronald Jadin","I mean, 10 basis points is pretty small.","Ryan Merkel","Got it, okay. And then secondly, on pricing. Our suppliers starting to talk about price increases and then you delay the price increase in Canada but remind us when you plan to push that through.","DG Macpherson","Sure, Ryan. So, we are constantly in communication with our suppliers on price increases from our supplier community. We had some pressure in some categories but overall the pressure's been relatively modest and we don\u2019t expect to have significant price increases throughout this year. So, we're expecting it to be relatively stable on that front.","In terms of Canada, as we went through the transition with the system last year, given some of the service challenges we did not pass through a price increase that otherwise we would have been passing through last year. We have started that process now and through the first half of the year, we will be increasing prices in Canada to reflect the market.","Ryan Merkel","Perfect. And just one last follow-up. I'm a little surprised to hear you say you're not expecting suppliers to raise prices. Just given what we've seen with the commodities, so is there something else that is that demand's not strong enough or you're just not having the negotiations right now that tell you or give you enough confidence that you would see suppliers rating price.","DG Macpherson","Right. So, given what we see and there is always a lag for us. So, in terms of the commodities increasing, it takes a while for that to flow through the supplier base. At some point of commodity stay at elevator levels for a longer period of time, we typically will see some supplier cost increases and we will then pass those through. But it hasn\u2019t been long enough yet to really force that to happen.","Ryan Merkel","Got it. Okay, thank you so much.","DG Macpherson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from David Manthey of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","David Manthey","Thanks. Hi guys, good morning. First off, could you talk a little bit more about the unclaimed property continue to, not sure I fully understand that. Could you give us more details on what the impact was historically because of how it was being handled and what it means going forward as well?","DG Macpherson","I'll turn that over to Ron.","Ronald Jadin","Sure. So, the $36 million reserve covers, I think we highlighted in there but $2 million or $3 million for potential interest cost, that sort of things, but roughly the $33 million or so related to that is over a five year period. So, it's about $6 million or so a year. And these are amounts owed to probably nearly 170,000 to 200,000 customers in amounts that are typically less than $200 a piece, somewhere adjustments on freight and tax.","There is a variety of different debits and credits that can be issued by Grainger to a customer. And in those years, prior to 2013, after they aged significantly and were not applied, were taken to income by the company. And we should have put a liability on the books for that prior to 2013, actually in 2013 and we didn\u2019t do till now.","David Manthey","Okay. So, it's not that it increased anything, it just didn\u2019t decrease whether its sales or cost as it should, is that what you're saying?","Ronald Jadin","I'm not sure I understand our question there.","David Manthey","Well, if it were something that you had owed to a customer but you didn\u2019t take through the P&L, the sales or your profitability was inflated historically now you're just recognizing that, so bringing that down, is that how I should think about it?","Ronald Jadin","Yeah. We recognize it to the P&L up through 2012. So, we took those --","David Manthey","And not?","Ronald Jadin","And not since then, no.","David Manthey","Not since then, right.","Ronald Jadin","So, everything's, we are really just reflecting now the same process we've been going through since 2013, we're reflecting that back into prior years.","David Manthey","Okay. And then second on pricing, if you can talk a little about the Red Pass Plus sort of the uptake there? How are you driving awareness and then as it relates to the pricing dynamic here, whether or not you are getting price increases or the cost side of your equation is changing. Are you still targeting a minus 1% price in 2017?","Ronald Jadin","Yes. We have no change to our expectation at this point for pricing for the year. Red Pass Plus for those unfamiliar, it's a program for typically for mid-sized customers. Most of that activation has happened historically the last nine months through inside sales and it's been a program we've used to get reasonable prices for those customers. That had continued to accelerate that program. We're also offering it now online for the first time. And we're also seeing some sign ups online.","So, we would expect that to continue to be a key part of getting reasonable prices for all of our mid-sized customers both online and through our inside sales organization and we're seeing really good results when we get customers to sign under that program thus far.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning, everyone. I guess the first question is, is this going to be a conference call that you're going to have every quarter, is this just because of the nature of the charges and what's going on. Is this a one off?","Ronald Jadin","So, we will continue to evaluate our investor outreach and we will continue to talk about it. At this point this is a one off because if that changes we will certainly let you know.","Robert McCarthy","Alright, not to be cynical but obviously CEO's in the past when they get into the seat, obviously if taken rather large sizable charges going forward, now obviously this is a long standing issue, so I understand that. But do you think that you could have done more in terms of perhaps calling out some more restructuring on your branch base footprint or do you think it that just do more of that consistent with your kind of message that you are sort of viewing that organically as you go forward?","DG Macpherson","Let me try to understand the question. So, on the branch organization, is that what you are asking?","Robert McCarthy","The branch history, perhaps this could have been an opportunity while you had all these items to perhaps do some more maybe one time issues in association with branch consolidation or restructuring.","DG Macpherson","Yeah, sure. So, we now have a little 252 branches in the US. I'll focus in the US for this discussion. We've gone from 420 to 250. We've actually seen stability and even some growth in branches with those existing buildings and the volume that goes through them is quite profitable. So, we will always evaluate the branch and the branch footprint but right now we like what we are seeing out of the branches that remain open. And so, we right now wouldn't make sense for us to take any additional restructuring given what we're seeing in terms of volume into those branches.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. And then this question is a bit of a stretch but I guess that\u2019s what I'm known for. In terms of the oil and gas and energy exposure in Canada, I think that broadly could be anywhere from 15% to 20% of the overall company. Could you talk about kind of what you are seeing both explicit energy exposure, the knock-on impact the Canadian effect and what you -- could we see the prospect for a recovery kind of going into '18 or '19 or what are you looking for to get a better sense of maybe we could start to see a return to positive growth across the sizable kind of end market perspective of your company.","Ronald Jadin","Yes. So, oil and gas for Canada I think as you are familiar with, the direct exposure is high, the indirect is probably 30% plus I would say in terms of resources and just Alberta and what you see, what we have seen is the knock-on effects for oil and gas on construction companies in Alberta. So, it's the big portion of the revenue in Canada. It's much less in the US, in US it's less than 5%. So, that said, we are watching very closely.","You can look at oil recounts, obviously they've gone up recently, we're also talking with lot of our large customers about project business. Certainly things are stabilized with that customer base. They are not taking capacity out, this time last year they were taking 10s of 1000s of people out of the operation. Right now that's not happened. We don't see great activity yet but certainly I would expect it could to your time line '18, '19, we certainly could see a turnaround there. That's very possible if oil stays between 50 and 100.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. Could you touch briefly on your US exposure excluding Canada with respect to oil and gas direct and indirect and what you are seeing there?","Ronald Jadin","US, for oil and gas.","DG Macpherson","Oh, for oil and gas. Question into direct is, US of oil and gas direct is 2 arguably oil and gas has a fairly significant impact on heavy manufacturing so I don't know that we fully know but I would say organizations that produce large machinery, given oil and gas have been very affected by that and so we have seen that heavy manufacturing getting hit in the US as a result probably less than 10% of our total US business and that probably is stabilizing now as well.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ryan Cieslak of Keybanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Ryan Cieslak","Hi, good morning guys.","DG Macpherson","Good morning.","Ronald Jadin","Good morning.","Ryan Cieslak","The first question is on just the gross margin guidance for the first quarter. It downed 80 to 130 basis points or so. That implies sequentially maybe the trends from the fourth to the first blow in you but normal trend we've seen on a sequential basis. Is there anything going into the first quarter that might be impacting the gross margin or something that maybe was unusual in the fourth quarter that's rolling off.","DG Macpherson","Probably just Canada, the timing of the recovery and margins in Canada like DG said it's going to the pricing actions are going to be over the first six months and so that's going to ramp up over a longer period of time than you'd expect to see in the US from a pricing perspective.","Ryan Cieslak","Okay and then the pricing then on in Canada, you mentioned that the price increase coming through, is that something that just gradually rolls through in the first half of the year or is there a specific date you guys would be implementing that, that price increase?","Ronald Jadin","We've already started the process. It hits a relatively small portion of the volume initially because you have to go through customer level negotiations to get a broader increase and so that's the process we have to follow through the first six months.","Ryan Cieslak","Okay. And then my follow-up question and I will jump back in the queue when you look at the end market breakout in the month of December, real nice take up in commercial and government and then you also highlighted heavy manufacturing as positive. Was there anything in particular within those end markets that you really saw in the month that gives you greater confidence? Is that sustainable or is that just a combination of maybe some easier comps and some other things? Thanks.","Ronald Jadin","Yeah, I'm going to take. So, in December everything was up and part of that's a holiday timing, part of that was some year-end buying. From an end market perspective we are seeing certainly manufacturing stabilize even through the entire fourth quarter and then government has been strong and consistent strong performer and we feel like we're well-positioned to continue to grow the government business.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","DG Macpherson","Good morning.","Ronald Jadin","Good morning.","Deane Dray","Hi. I was hoping to follow-up on that last point on the strengthening the government business in the fourth quarter and it's the term that you say was project business and I was associate Grainger with more MRO type business stuff that wears out or has to be replaced and less about project. So, maybe if you just clarify when you talk about the government projects what type of business is that?","DG Macpherson","Yeah. So, that it would be more small projects rather than large projects, Deane. It would still be MRO but if people are doing maintenance cleanup projects in a bigger way, sometimes will have somewhat larger orders. The order pattern had some of that but it wasn't tremendously high volume. Generally the volume was good across the broad in December and so I wouldn't read too much into the project business. I think the government flow has been very, very consistent, we continue to do very well, the military with federal government and we saw some state government strength as well.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then, for pricing in Canada down 4% points, was that across the board or was it mostly energy and natural resource focused?","DG Macpherson","It is across the board, although the bigger head is in the energy and resource business given where volume is and that's been more challenged throughout the entire year last year. I would say that's true.","Deane Dray","And then just last question from me if I could, maybe for Ron, really strong free cash flow conversion this quarter anything unusual in terms of timing of payments or anything like that?","Ronald Jadin","Yeah. There was actually with regard to timing of payables, just there was a lot of inventory purchase near the end of the year, so our in transit inventory balance increased quite a bit and as a result our payable did as well. So, really just the timing thing there. Most of our favorability was driven by working capital. AR came down quite a bit in the fourth quarter versus the third which it always does but even more so this year and I think the timing, this time the time when holiday helped us in terms of when the holidays on a weekend we have more days to collect where our customers are open and we are in the office. So AR benefited as well.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then, just lastly a comment that the extent to which voice of the customer matters and like Robert McCarthy's question, it'd be great if you guys would get consideration to do any of these calls. I think it's gone very well and we appreciate the insight. Thank you.","DG Macpherson","Thank you, Deane.","Ronald Jadin","Thanks, Deane.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Andrew Buscaglia of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Buscaglia","Hey guys. Can you just talk a little bit about your Canada segment? I would have thoughts thing could will get a little better in Q4 but you got something going on there. How much, what's the trajectory of that business on the operating line through the year like, will we see a break even number by the end of '17?","Ronald Jadin","Yeah. We are -- our plan calls for fourth quarter to break even with the business in Canada. Just to give you a little bit history there, given the reliance on oil and gas, obviously the down turn has a big impact and the added challenge has been, we put the new system in and we had some service disruptions as well. We focused very hard last half of the year on stabilizing the service and we are hearing very good things from customers right now in terms of providing service to them and so we feel like we are in a better position now to be able to do things like take price increases and drive volume but we would expect to be break even in the fourth quarter of next year of this year.","Andrew Buscaglia","Okay, got it. Then just one other sort of a question on the EBIT line in your unallocated expenses. Looks like you're helped by some restructuring there. How come some, what was that restructuring specifically help that line item or like why would that go into that specific?","Ronald Jadin","Yeah. There was some cost, we have easier comps in the fourth quarter of this year than last year because in the fourth quarter of '15 we had quite a few expenditures relative to the SAP project which went live in the first quarter of '16. So, from an expense perspective if that's what you are referring to we had easier comps but we also were taking cost out of the business as well as we've been doing everywhere, given the soft revenue.","Andrew Buscaglia","Okay. So, that's the expense that helps you, looks like it helps you about $0.09 or so for --.","Ronald Jadin","Are you looking at the adjustments page?","Andrew Buscaglia","Yeah.","Ronald Jadin","Oh, the adjustment. That had to do earlier this year. That wasn\u2019t a fourth quarter item.","Andrew Buscaglia","Okay.","Ronald Jadin","Yeah. Earlier in the year just to be clear, I was answering fourth quarter.","Andrew Buscaglia","Well, I was just looking at your unallocated expenses usually is a little bit higher in Q4 but for some reason this quarter it seemed like it helped your EBIT line.","Ronald Jadin","Yeah. And I think I answered it, yeah. Easier comps.","DG Macpherson","This is an implication at the moment.","Ronald Jadin","It's really easier comps.","Andrew Buscaglia","Okay, got it. Alright, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Graham","Hi, good morning and thanks for having this call. I just wanted to really understand a little bit a more about the price decreases that you are putting through for the mid-size customers and also the spot buys latter being discussed a lot at the Investor Meeting back in November.","And the simple question is this since you indicated that at that time that you had begun that price reduction program or whatever you like to call it initiative it was about 18 months ago. So, just kind of hoping you can tell us how is that going for both, I mean how are the mid-size customer reacting, how are the sort of across the board if selective stock price reductions to various customers going on spot buys? Could you give us an idea of how that is going, are you starting to see those sales respond?","Ronald Jadin","So, I would make a few points. Thanks for the question. So, with our large customers they have had competitive prices for a long time. We had changed to some degree our price structure to try to give them more price incentives to buy slower moving items. And that has gone reasonably well when we give category discounts or other discounts we do see volume increases. So, that has gone well.","On the mid-size customer piece, we went through a fairly significant coverage change last year where we eliminated outside sales covering mid-size customers and started inside sales and that team has been working to get the pricing programs in place for those customers and again when we get to customers and we get them to sign up with the pricing program which we talked about Red Pass Plus a minute ago, that has gone well. The broad changes on the web have just started. So when we talked in November we talked about the beginning of the year starting those changes. It's too early to say how they are going and really what we've done so far is changed some prices to understand how the back-end systems would work and support those changes and so far that looks good.","You'll see a lot more that happening over the next couple of months and we are getting a much better read on how on the impact of those changes and just to remind everybody the goal here is to provide a reasonable price for small mid-size customers and spot buys. And that price will be higher GP than the average GP. So it's still going to be not cheap but it's a reasonable price for those customers and those changes broadly are just starting now.","Scott Graham","Excellent. Just one other question if I could you know. Your sales guidance for the year was +2 to +6 was given at time when let's just say optimism was not where it is today I think there is clearly a lot more optimism in the business community particularly in industrial land. I was just sort of wondering if you would be able to give us a opinion, I know it's only the first quarter but I suspect the +2 would be a little bit disappointing in that, somewhere within that range we are kind of thinking more at least the mid-point. Is there anything you could offer DG on kind of what you are thinking now on that sales guidance range versus two months ago given the changes that has taken place?","Ronald Jadin","Yeah. I mean, I don't know that we've got a different perspective. I would say to your point around optimism, I have been with a number of customers this year and there is some optimism but that optimism hasn't yet translated into to activity. And in fact, some of the manufacturers had some concerns as well as optimism about the rush in things to do. So, I would say there is some optimism and if that were to bear fruit, certainly that would help us. So far we haven't seen it. So, I don't think our position has changed at all.","Scott Graham","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Adam Uhlman","Hi, good morning. Thanks again for hosting the call.","DG Macpherson","Good morning.","Adam Uhlman","Just a follow-up on that last question. And then, I guess as this optimism has been building. At what point would the company think about adding additional growth spending to the forecast for the year. Will we have to be above the high end of the sales guidance or do you think you are pretty well set in terms of the additions that you planned for sales people, regardless of the demand environment?","Ronald Jadin","Yeah. I think we are mostly set, I think with the large customer organization we are mostly set in terms of the coverage we have. We like the coverage we have and that group is going to get more productive given some of the tools we've given to them. I would say for mid-size customers what would get us to increase spending is if the results were positive in a way that was better than we expected, then we would spend the money. And so, I don't think it's necessarily external. It's more what happens to our own initiatives and if the initiatives bear fruit we will spend more. We are not really locked into to what happens in the economy for those actions.","Adam Uhlman","All right, that's helpful, thanks. And then, Ron, have you made any changes to the cash flow assumptions for this year?","Ronald Jadin","No. No changes.","Adam Uhlman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks, good morning.","DG Macpherson","Good morning.","Christopher Glynn","Question on the OpEx line. OpEx to sales prove little more than a 70 basis points in 2016 and I know 2017 have incentive comp restoration and the DC ramp cuts, but not withstanding that is there kind of a ongoing opportunity to manage OpEx there within the context of nearly $3 billion spend line?","Ronald Jadin","Yeah. I would say we are very focused on making sure that we get productivity out of our large pools of cost. We continue to get nice productivity out of our distribution centers which is a big cost. We are making changes in our context centers in 2017 to consolidate and take out some cost. We are working hard on the sales force and the tools we provided them so that we can grow without having to add headcount in equal parts to our growth. Really at every point in the organization we are focused on expense, spend money where customers care about it and then get productivity in every part of the organization.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And within the key line items of your guidance, gross margin revenue and SG&A would seem that that one is the most in your control to be able to guide conservatively. It has in fact on the again the ramp cost not withstanding?","Ronald Jadin","So, our guidance is our expectation at this point. So, we are I am not sure that you stand but you may. Our guidance is our expectation.","Christopher Glynn","Fair enough. And then, just finally you may alluded to but just wondering if any 4Q budget flush was also kind of seen in the manufacturing sector, January softer, it seems even January got softer even adjusting for the holiday timing.","Ronald Jadin","Yeah, we are watching that closely. It's a little bit too early to tell and I think once we get through, just as a reminder, January last year was our second highest growth month of the year after December. So, there is some holiday timing, I think there is some weather we did sell more cold weather product in December than we are selling in January for sure given what we have seen in the weather. So, there is a number of factors there. I wouldn't read too much into the first three weeks necessarily.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Justin Bergner of Gabelli and Company. Please go ahead.","Justin Bergner","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. So, the first question relates to I guess your comment that the US did a little bit better than you expected in the fourth quarter from the sales point of view. So, could you just maybe clarify if the overall company was sort of in line with your expectations and what part of the business came a little bit short of your expectations?","Ronald Jadin","Well. So, keep in mind we were comparing that to our Analyst Day. What we talked about in Analyst Day December was a little stronger really across the board. All Canada, the US, both were stronger, the rest of the business was basically on what we would have expected. So, that's why we are a little bit better. Yeah. Just slightly better than expectations. I wouldn't read too much into that and we've been talking about what happened in December and November and January and how much of that was holiday timing and other stuff. So, I wouldn't necessarily read too much into that and really nothing was significantly below expectations for December.","Justin Bergner","Okay. And restructuring seemed to end the year around $45 million, which is a little bit light of $50 million or $65 million guide. So, should I make anything of that in terms of how that will affect 2017 restructuring spend or did you find reasons to cut back on restructuring spend a bit?","Ronald Jadin","No. And some of that was estimates of what do we cost the restructure, sometimes were higher than we landed and so that won't have any impact. It should not have any impact on 2017.","Justin Bergner","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matt Duncan of Stephens. Please go ahead.","Matt Duncan","Hey, good morning everybody.","Ronald Jadin","Good morning.","DG Macpherson","Good morning.","Matt Duncan","So, first thing just want to try dig a little bit more on the sales trend and maybe kind of look at some of the algebra here. My recollection is that January's comparison is 4.8 points harder than December and you had two points of holiday benefit in December and I guess there is based on your comments some chance there has been a negative hit in January. So, is the change from December to January simply the comparison and the difference in holiday timing and maybe the underlying demand is still kind of where it was if not improving just some thoughts that will be great.","DG Macpherson","I think it's a little early to tell. I think some of the points you make are certainly on point, I think on US a lot this may in fact be timing and seasonal. I think in Canada there is a specific issue for us which is last January there was a lot of customer pre-buy before we went live with the system and so Canada will let goofy in both January and February. February will be a very easy compare and January is a very hard compared given the flow of what happened around that. Other than that I think we don't see any reason to think the underlying demand has changed dramatically.","Matt Duncan","Okay, that helps. And then Ron, on gross margin the year-over-year decline there in the fourth quarter specifically was a lot less than what you guys had been experiencing. Can you walk us through what caused that?","Ronald Jadin","Yes. With some easier comps essentially, or there was some unfavorable GP rate items in the fourth quarter of '15 that just gave us a bit of easier comp. And then some of the mix issues that we have with faster growth with some of our low margin businesses while they continue to grow. As they get bigger they have a lower mix impact, negative mix impact on GP, so as they mature and as their margins expand actually, the native impact of those businesses diminishes overtime.","Matt Duncan","Is there anything going on there with rebate levels given how strong December close down I mean you were flat at December 13 and came in up 6.5. You mentioned that you had a lot inventory kind of in trends in at the end of the year. So, just curious if maybe that you had a little bit better rebate accrual then you were then counting on previously?","DG Macpherson","Not materially. A little bit better but not material.","Matt Duncan","Okay. And then, last thing on Fabory.","DG Macpherson","Just because the thing is when you pre-buy, right, those rebates gets capitalized, you don't take those to the P&L.","Matt Duncan","Right, okay. Last thing from me on Fabory and I know it's a little bit of difficult discussion but it's been a while you guys have had trouble. You made good progress in trying to get it improved and making money for you. But it continues to be a little bit of a problem child. Is there a point in time in which you start thinking about divesting that business or is it a business that you feel like Grainger needs to be involved in going forward?","DG Macpherson","So, just to give you a little bit of history that the thesis when we got that, that those are really two pieces of the thesis. One was we could expand in Central Europe through a branch expansion strategy, the other was that we could diversify its product portfolio and make it a broad liner. We really struggled with those two, the first couple of years we had the business. We ended up having to reverse course, refocus it on fasteners, it is a fastener specialist.","I think there is benefits to having specials in the portfolio. I think we understand how specialist compete. Having Fabory in the portfolio and we certainly get benefits from faster buy, from the company. But that said, it's not core to what we do. Right now we need to get it performing. We need to be performing better, we need to increase profitability, get it growing but we will always consider both term but what to do with the business but we are optimistic about the path it's on and we need to continue that path first before we consider alternatives.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Hamzah Mazari","Good morning, thank you. Just the first question maybe for DG. DG, could you maybe talk about your supply chain and any issues you may be looking at given potential for tear it's and credit agreement changes as you look at your global supply chain?","Ronald Jadin","Yes. So, thanks Hamzah. So, we do a lot of analysis on our supply changes as a regular course of business to understand where we purchased whether we have unique exposure relative to competitors through our purchasing activities, we don't have much. So, trade agreements would certainly have an impact. We have alternative suppliers for many of those sources and we have those in place in plans if we need to go to those alternative sources. We don't feel like we will be unduly impacted by trade agreements.","We don't buy more than our competitors do overseas as an example and we have alternatives for many of those suppliers. I think the broader issue, so for the sourcing that we own for our private brands that we globally source, I think we have a good set. For the branded product, there are some categories that really are not made much in the US anymore if at all and so trade agreements on those I don't know what would happen there and we'd have to figure that out and we haven't historically focused too much of our energy there because that hasn't been under our control but I think it's an interesting thing for us. We probably need to spend little more time thinking about that.","Hamzah Mazari","Great. And just last question, is it -- do you have a time line around when the Zoro business margins can get closer to your Japanese business? Is that realistic, it seems like there may be a lot of investments spend rolling through the P&L on Zoro. Just trying to get a sense of whether that business can mirror the Japanese business so is there anything structural there? Thank you.","DG Macpherson","Now, thanks. I think that Zoro's business will be very close to MonotaRO's overtime. And we continue to see expansion, we think it's going to be in the 8th this year in terms of operating margin and it will continue to get do that double digit number. Really the difference is advertising spend as we grow, so we invest a bunch to grow the business in Zoro. We are still acquiring customers that are really high rate. And as that business becomes more modest in its growth, more like MonotaRO, we would expect them the margins to be pretty much the same overtime.","Hamzah Mazari","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Please go ahead.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Good morning, guys.","DG Macpherson","Good morning.","Ronald Jadin","Good morning.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Hey, just one question on some of the improvement trends in December versus what they were in November. I mean, all the areas got better but the US was a little less improvement, so you had Canada went from down 13 to up two, that's a big move. Other went from up seven up 19, both of those have these kind of double-digit moves. The US went from -2 to +1. In that reason what that would be more modest than the moves in the other areas?","Ronald Jadin","Well, I mean, I think in general our US business is less variable. So in down time it's down less and in up times it's up a little bit less and that's just the way the US business works. We serve the entire economy in the US, so we are very diversified. We are not as diversified in Canada, so if you have big projects, it can have a bigger impact. I think that's probably the basic dynamic there.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. And then just a follow-up on kind of this first quarter gross margin. You are down 30 in the fourth quarter and that we are going to be down 80 to 130 in the first quarter. You mentioned that how comp but I mean I think you already changed the counting for the trade show stuff last year. So, and maybe why the first quarter is tough gross margin comp for this year?","DG Macpherson","Well it's really a combination of both. The fourth quarter was a easier comp and the first quarter is a tougher comp. So, there is a couple of swings to account for but I would just reiterate that especially in Canada where we saw a real pressure on margins in this last year. The challenge will be recovering that through pricing actions in the first half of the year. Those won\u2019t happen just in the first quarter.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. You mentioned that of course, that's really about Canada?","DG Macpherson","Yeah, that's a big part of it.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay.","DG Macpherson","And then the comps.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay, yeah.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Robert Barry","Hey guys, good morning.","DG Macpherson","Good morning.","Ronald Jadin","Good morning.","Robert Barry","Lot of ground covered here. Maybe just a few follow-ups. First, on the much earlier commodity pricing question kind of when the commodities start to impact the pricing and I know it's not a precise dynamic but just as a benchmark like ISM prices component, right, which shows what OEMs are paying for inputs, it's been rising now for about 10 months. We've seen kind of what's been happening with the spot prices. I mean does it typically take that long to kind of trickle through and impact you or might be taking longer kind of through this cycle for some reason?","Ronald Jadin","Well, I think so it depends I would say where your starting position is. Given that went down so far and now they have been upper 10 months, I think it's probably taking a little bit longer but if they continue to stabilize at higher levels I think you will see it flow through. So, I think it's just what you are seeing now is just a function of how far they went. They dropped before coming up and in many cases they dropped a lot.","Robert Barry","Yeah. And remind us what's in the gross margin outlook, is there an assumption that you will start to get some benefit from pricing this year?","DG Macpherson","It's -1.","Ronald Jadin","It's -1, is the expectation. Now we also have expectation we will negative cost inflation this year as well.","DG Macpherson","50.","Robert Barry","Right.","Ronald Jadin","About 50 basis points. So, if there was significant commodity increases that would, that would help us if that happens.","Robert Barry","Got you.","Ronald Jadin","But we don't have anything baked in there.","Robert Barry","I mean, what is your thought on being able to put through pricing if it starts to come from your vendors, just given a lot of the end markets are still pretty sluggish and there is a lot of small mum and pops and pops kind of cutting price to stay alive. I mean, do you think you could kind of get material pricing in this environment?","Ronald Jadin","Yeah. If it's well known that the commodity prices are up, we generally do pretty well and we're able to pass that through and I think that would still be the case here.","Robert Barry","Got you. And then maybe just the last one on this clean energy. I think in November you expected that would be $0.10 benefit in '16, I think ended up being $0.15. So, is it all that $0.05 helping in the fourth quarter and was that just related to the weather?","Ronald Jadin","Great. A lot of its weather, a lot of it is just whether the facilities are running at full capacity or not. It's the dynamic of both of those two. So, we ended the year at about $0.15 and we think next year '17 will in the $0.10 to $0.15 range, so very similar.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Joseph Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joseph Ritchie","Thanks, good morning guys.","DG Macpherson","Good morning.","Joseph Ritchie","So, just a couple of real quick ones. On the unclaimed property contingency just to be clear, there's no cash impact or is there a potential cash impact from that charge?","Ronald Jadin","There is none today but over the next few years we'll make attempt to either return cash or issue credits to customers, so eventually overtime there will be.","Joseph Ritchie","Got it. And what would potentially trigger that, I am just trying to understand it a little bit better.","DG Macpherson","We will trigger it by actively pursuing many customers and then states as well.","Joseph Ritchie","Got it, okay. And then as it relates to I know typically we've talked about pricing a lot. I guess just asking it very specifically typically January, February, timeframe. Do you put through some type of pricing increase and see. If I miss the answer earlier is there an expectation that you are going to try to pass price through in January or February or is it just a too difficult for the period of time to be able to do that today?","Ronald Jadin","Well, we are \u2013- we have gone through a process and I'll focus on the US first. We are certainly going to have a price increase in Canada as we have talked about through the first half of the year. In the US, we are restructuring our price, we certainly have raised some prices and lowered others. We look at the market pricing and we've adjusted to that. So, there are some price increases in there and we would expect this to hold.","Joseph Ritchie","Okay. And then lastly one quick one on your just your import position. What percentage of your COGS do you import and we have it roughly 20% to 25%, I just want to make sure that we're ballpark correct.","Ronald Jadin","Well, I take that to our earlier discussion. If you said what is the percentage that we import that is part of our private brand which is what we have talked about historically. Our private brand is 20% to 25%, most of that is imported now, so probably 15% to 20% would be imported. And then if you included the brands that goes way up, so the branded products in our estimate would be 40% roughly but we have some work to do to really understand that.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe","Thanks, good morning. And this call has really helpful, thanks a lot for doing it. Just, so just -- Ron, I just wanted to double check that all of the one timers came through SG&A, correct?","Ronald Jadin","Yes, that's correct.","Nigel Coe","Okay, great. And then the uptick in December --.","Ronald Jadin","I'm sorry, in the fourth quarter they did. There were few early in the year that were excess and obsolescence for inventory, those would have been up in that GP. So, just to be clear, the fourth quarter that's true but earlier or in there is at least one or two.","Nigel Coe","Okay, great. -- My question.","Ronald Jadin","I am sorry. One more thing, just also the discreet tax items, maybe it's obvious but those are below the lines, those are in tax.","Nigel Coe","Right, okay, good, thanks. Thanks, Ron. Then the uptick in December, I mean maybe this is getting a bit too down on the ways, but did you see any differential between store versus direct. I mean, I'm just thinking about the margin differential between store and online. Was there any noticeable impact on either channel or nothing to call up that?","Ronald Jadin","It was, yeah, it was fairly even across both I would say. So, we saw upticks in all the channels.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And then going into January, the comment that slow down join to date, obvious Canada is the big part of that but is the same REIT for the US just given the time of the holidays and the comp?","Ronald Jadin","Yeah. I would say January started out sluggish based on some of the comps in the holiday discussion we had before, yes.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And then just finally, obviously big changes on some of the sales force during 2015. How do we think about the productivity where we are on the productivity curve for your just picking on the inside sales channel?","DG Macpherson","So, we have installed completely new processes over the last year at a new system support for sellers to help make them more productive. On the inside sales team, we're giving them much more clarity on who to call on, how frequently to call, what the returns are on those calls, I think we have got a long path for improvement here since we are very early in that process and figuring it out but it's pretty exciting in terms of the data we have now and the ability to drive improvement going forward.","Nigel Coe","So, in terms of getting up to full productivity, is that a year, is it two years, I mean how long is the time line?","DG Macpherson","On the inside sales team in particular?","Nigel Coe","Yeah.","DG Macpherson","Yeah, it's going to take probably 15 months to two years for any individual seller to get to full productivity typically.","Nigel Coe","Great. Thanks a lot.","DG Macpherson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.","DG Macpherson","So, great I think we -- okay. So, thanks for the time, I really appreciate everybody being on the call. I would just summarize it the quarter basically from an operating perspective was at or maybe slightly above expectations. Hopefully, we helped to explain some of the unusual items that we had in the quarter and we are holding on guidance for 2017 and we are certainly excited about what we have done in 2016 to prepare ourselves to grow and gain profit going forward.","So, thanks for your time. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Macpherson, Chairman and CEO and Ron Jadin, Senior VP and CFO.","As a reminder, some of our comments today maybe forward-looking based on our current view of future events, and actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with the corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q3 press release, which is available on our Investor Relations Web site.","D. G. will be making some opening comments regarding performance of the Company with an update on our pricing actions in the U.S. After that, we will open the call for questions. D. G. to you.","D. G. Macpherson","Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thanks for joining everybody. Before I begin, I wanted to acknowledge the many natural disasters that we have collectively faced in the third quarter to say that it has been an unusual period, would be a great understatement. Multiple hurricanes across Texas, the Southeast Florida, Puerto Rico and the Islands, the earthquakes in Mexico and the wildfires out west have all challenged our team members and our customers.","We're relieved that all of our team members have stayed safe and we are really heartened by the support that we provided to these communities during this unusual period. Our team members have worked selflessly and diligently to help these communities. I've received countless personal notes of how our team members supported individuals and companies, and it makes me very proud to be a part of this organization with 23,000 team members. These natural disasters didn't have a material impact on our financial results this quarter, but the value that we bring to communities and customers during these times is really impressive.","So let me move onto the quarter, and the quarter the message is pretty simply. Overall, it was a solid quarter and there were some positive signs. We continue to implement our pricing initiatives, which are driving solid growth as we expected. Removing pricing is a barrier in the U.S. allows us to do what we do best, which is to create value for our customers. We do that through our seller and onsite relationships, our fulfillment capabilities, our technical support and by helping customers take out cost.","We continue to manage our expenses tightly and to make progress on improving our cost structure. We continue to make progress on resetting our Canadian business for profitability. Our single channel online model continues to drive solid growth and margin expansion. And we continue to invest for the future in critical areas. Most notably, with digital investments to measure that our digital capabilities are advantaged; in our supply chain, to make sure that we can handle the volume with great service; and by providing tools to help our front line team members to be more effective. And we are acting with urgency across the entire business to make sure that our business is set for profitable growth going forward.","Now, before I go into details in some of these areas, I will discuss the overall Company results. We will start with our reported results on slide four, which include the impact of restructuring in the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. adjustments include restructuring primarily related to the consolidation of contact centers, partially offset by gains on sales of assets, branches and other items. Canada restructuring include the branch and headcount reductions. So this morning's call we will focus on adjusted results, which excludes the items outlined in our press release.","So our adjusted results, which are on page five are in line with our expectations. Total Company sales were up 2% or 3% on a daily basis. Volume was up a strong 8%. Price was down 4% as the entire assortment went on web pricing August 1st in the U.S. Hurricane related sales growth was offset by lower seasonal sales in the quarter. Our gross profit declined 150 basis points, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to get strong operating expense leverage on higher volumes. Operating expenses increased 3%, volume up 8% in the quarter. And operating cash flow was up slightly despite the price write down as we focus our investments on the highest return areas.","I\u2019ll cover other businesses first. As a reminder, other business includes our online model and our international businesses. Sales in our other businesses were up 13%. That\u2019s 15% excluding foreign exchange headwinds on a daily basis. The online businesses, which includes Zoro in the U.S. and the MonotaRO in Japan, continue to expand operating margins. Our international businesses performed in line with our expectations as a group. And operating margin, as of note, operating margin expanded versus the prior year excluding our investment in the digital platform. So we put our digital investments in the other business category. And if you excluded those, operating margins would have been 6.1% in the quarter.","Let's move to Canada, and Canada sales were up 7%, which is 2% in local currency on a daily basis. Expenses in Canada were flat in local currency. And as you know, we're in the midst of a substantial transformation of the business in Canada. And we\u2019ll discuss our plans in Canada and detail in a few weeks at our November Analyst Meeting.","Turning to the U.S. We had encouraging results and trends from the volume response to pricing actions, and an improved demand environment. Sales for the quarter were up 1% on a daily basis. That included volume of 7% and price deflation of 5%. As a side note, this volume growth puts us in the 6% to 8% range that we\u2019ve talked about for annual growth, volume growth in 2018 and 2019.","We had a strong fiscal year end from the Federal government after several months of delayed spending. Hurricane related sales added 1% to sales as in inter-company in the U.S. They were completely offset by holiday timing and seasonal sales, so the 7% is really true volume in the quarter.","Now, the growth was somewhat aided by demand tailwinds. Our current analysis suggests U.S. market will grow 2% to 3% for the year. Operating expenses in the U.S. were flat, demonstrating leverage on volume growth. We continue to be diligent in managing expenses, and are confident that we\u2019re going to achieve the cost targets that we\u2019ve outlined previously. Operating margin declined 220 basis points, driven by the GP impact of our pricing actions.","So, taking a little closer look at large customers in the U. S. We continue to see sequential volume improvement with large customers. A note here of hurricanes effect large and mid size customers differently; hurricane related sales growth was more than offset by lower seasonal sales and holiday timing with our large customer, so this is really a pure volume. The benefit from the August 1 pricing rollout started in August, but really accelerated in September. Technically, what happened was we turned on the web prices on August 1st. We basically make sure that everything is working correctly and then we started investing in digital investments after that point about a week later.","We talked last quarter about government slowing down in the second quarter. That continued into the quarter but then we saw a pick-up in activity at the end of the quarter. U. S. had two notable growth areas large spot by volume, which have been declining for years, grew in the quarter and large non-contract volume which have been declining for years also grew in the quarter. So, those are very positive signs looking forward.","Turning to mid size customers. We had significant improvement year-over-year and versus the second quarter of 2017. All of this business is now competitively priced. We are acquiring customers digitally and we\u2019re seeing strong drop due margins to the bottom line. For the first time in the long time, we have significant growth with midsize customers at attractive margins. Now, as a reminder, the actions of August 1st resulted in all prices for all customers being more competitive. This helps us speed up customer retention efforts, accelerates the acquisition of new customers. And it simplifies our pricing to make it much easier for customers to understand. And these actions are critical to achieving our 2019 operating margin objectives.","Turning to guidance. In terms of 2017 guidance, we narrowed the range. We kept the mid-point the same. Our performance was in line with our expectations for the quarter. We would expect that given changes we\u2019re making in Canada, which are significant, we would expect performance for that business to be challenged versus our expectations for the remainder of the year. And we would not be surprised if the U. S. was a bit stronger than expectations, given what we\u2019ve seen.","Sales midpoint is slightly lower because we divested a specialty business in the quarter. We\u2019ve maintained our operating margin rate and our EPS midpoint. And of note, Q4 expenses are higher sequentially due to normal timing of expenses and investments we\u2019re making in the single channel online business and digital marketing.","So in close, we had a solid quarter. The U. S. volume growth was very encouraging. Digital marketing enables us now to acquire customers. The online model grew nicely and profitability expanded. We had solid expense management throughout the company. And we continue to work to turnaround Canada. The U. S. pricing actions remove a barrier. They allow us to focus on creating value for our customers. We do that by helping take cost out of the customers\u2019 business. We help them manage our inventory and what is a very messy category. We provide exceptional fulfillments, and our sales and service teams help businesses succeed.","So this is our first and third quarter call, which comes at an interesting time, given our Analyst Day is only a few weeks away. At our Analyst Meeting, we\u2019ll cover a number of topics in more depth, including price and volume response in the U. S., the Canada turnaround, our digital strategy and our cost actions.","So with that, I\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Ryan Merkel","The first question I have is on U.S. sales in September, up 5%. What was the U.S. volume growth, ex-hurricanes and ex-divesting the specialty business?","D. G. Macpherson","For the large customers?","Ryan Merkel","For the U.S.? I was thinking\u2026","D. G. Macpherson","For volume, yes\u2026","Ryan Merkel","And that's relative to 7% for the quarter\u2026","D. G. Macpherson","It was nine.","Ryan Merkel","So that\u2019s encouraging. And then my second question, in the fourth quarter do you expect U.S. volume growth to improve from the 7% that you did in the third quarter? Now you just did 9% in September. So I'm assuming the answer is, yes. And then also tell us what you think U.S. price will be down in the fourth quarter just to calibrate our model?","D. G. Macpherson","So I would say, Ryan that our volume expectations haven't changed. We would expect to see continued improvement, slight improvement in volume, and our GP expectations are what they were before. Sequentially, we expect our gross profits to be down 20 to 40, to 50 basis points, and that's just because we have the full effect of the pricing actions in the quarter. So that's our expectation.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Duncan from Stephens. Please go ahead.","Matt Duncan","So, on the U.S. large customer business, you went from four in the 2Q to a five in the 3Q. I'm curious is there any way to sort through how much you think you were able to get from -- it sounds like the spot by volume did start to pick back up again, and how much of the benefit did that add? And then economically, were the tailwinds a little better in 3Q versus 2Q, or was it the same environment?","D. G. Macpherson","So, we've experienced modest tailwinds that continued to increase throughout the year, I'd say. So it's little better it seems at the quarter. In terms of the large customers, both the spot buy and large non-contract customers, which effectively are all spot buy, showed some growth for the first time in a long time, and that helps. And our contract customers continue to grow similarly to what we've seen, continue to improve slightly. So that's no real change there in terms of the path that we've been on.","Matt Duncan","And then shifting over to the medium sized customer base then, a three to a 15 is obviously a very big change. It sounds like maybe five points give or take of that was hurricane related, but still three to 10 is quite nice. Did you, did you kick in the digital marketing? How much volume would you attribute to that? And are there any correlations we can draw here in terms of timeline that when we started to see this volume really pick up as we look over to the U.S. large customer business and think about the timeline of how long it takes for the price actions to help with growth there?","D. G. Macpherson","So just to be clear, so the 15% is net of the hurricane impact. So the actual growth for mid size customers is higher when you include the hurricane impact. And I would say it\u2019s a fairly clear path in terms of continued growth post the price changes. And mid-August, we really started digital marketing in earnest and so that certainly help the growth post that period.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning, and congratulations on a better than expected quarter. I guess the first question I have is in terms of the gross margin, could you just talk about the walk in the U.S., because I think the total company was benefited by gross margin benefit in Canada in the quarter, lower inventory adjustment, something along those lines. Could you just talk about what was the pure compression in GP in the U.S.?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, in the U.S. the year-over-year compression was we're looking at 150 basis points in the U.S. and so that -- which is exactly what we expected. And sequentially, it was 180 basis points.","Robert McCarthy","180 basis points from Q2, which was in line with your expectations, it sounds like\u2026","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, it\u2019s almost exact with our expectations.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. And then just a follow up on Canada. Obviously, fairly dynamic there and obviously some updates for '17. But how do we think about, and you gave us some updates around '17 in terms of Canada being worse and U.S. being a little better versus your expectations. But how do we think about going into the targets for '19 in terms of where is the incremental pressure on '19 targets now, given the run rate of what you're seeing in your businesses?","D. G. Macpherson","So we\u2019ll talk a lot about that in the few weeks, Rob. I would say that our expectation and in terms of the actions we're taking in Canada, we expect our profitability will be better. And we\u2019ve talked about Canada being in 2019 and so we\u2019re taking actions now to make that happen. It\u2019s a messy process. There is a significant change that we're making to the business. But we\u2019ll give more clarity on that in a few weeks.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Scott Graham","I have two questions for you, the first is hopefully easy. You note on page nine that the spot buy and large non-contract business volume was positive in the third quarter. And I'm just wondering, are we to read that your price actions went beyond spot buy and into large non-contract?","D. G. Macpherson","So keep in mind that a large non-contract customer would almost have the same price change or similar to mid size customers that they didn\u2019t have pricing that they\u2019ve gotten historically. And so non-contract large customers will have more of a price write down and better volume response similar to mid size customers not quite as severe because there are some large non contract customers that have price deals historically. So you should read that that -- the price change to have a very big impact on that group we would expect.","Scott Graham","Okay, because that's a little different than your message previously, right? Or am I not understanding it?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, we lumped historically spot buying with large non-contract in some of what we shown. But there is a significant portion of the volume that\u2019s non-contracted.","Scott Graham","I understand that now. The other question that I have for you very simply is with spot buy better and midsize customers better, did we have a positive mix in the U.S.?","D. G. Macpherson","So not quite. Although, the trends would suggest that could happen is what I would say.","Scott Graham","That should happen. Would you agree?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, it should. Once we lap the price changes it should happen for sure.","Scott Graham","I understand. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Robert Barry","Could I just clarify a couple of things you said earlier, the 15% growth in medium you said, is -- would have been higher?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes.","Robert Barry","So, the hurricane\u2026","D. G. Macpherson","So the way that works is we have a hurricane. Our branches we typically load the branches with hurricane type products and they skew more to midsize customers. So we see more midsize customer hurricane volume than we would see with large customers. We see a lot of it everywhere of course. But so it had a bigger impact but we\u2019ve taken that out with the 15%.","Robert Barry","So where is in the large, the hurricane was offset by the holiday timing and seasonal, it was a net benefit in the medium?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, exactly.","Robert Barry","And also to clarify, you said September in the U. S. was up nine on volume. Is that also a clean number, I would have thought the hurricane would have been mostly September or weather or maybe mostly August, that volume number\u2026","D. G. Macpherson","It excludes it basically, yes.","Robert Barry","And then if I could just ask quick question about what\u2019s going on with inflation. I know there are lot of puts and takes impacting the gross margin this year. But if you just look at product cost inflation, how much of a headwind is that you\u2019re observing this year. And are you getting any price to offset it, say in the large customer contract business?","D. G. Macpherson","So, our COGS inflation this year is going to be very slightly negative. And so we are seeing inflation. Now, we are starting to see inflationary pressures a little bit more than we\u2019ve seen in the last few years of course. But so far, we have that is not shown up in our COGS line.","Robert Barry","Why is that so minimal given what we\u2019ve seen with commodity inflation headwinds?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, we\u2019ve done a whole bunch of work at looking at product categories and optimizing our product categories and cost. So, we have a rigorous process where we\u2019re following, we call it PPO, which basically helps us get the right assortment at the right cost.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Buscaglia from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Buscaglia","Can you just comment on that spot buy? You guys didn\u2019t provide more data in the slide this time around. But can you provide us with a number relative to that negative 3% you saw in Q2?","D. G. Macpherson","It\u2019s gone from -- it was negative three, and it\u2019s low single-digit positive for the quarter.","Andrew Buscaglia","And would you attribute that to some of the new -- I mean, first of all, how did that do relative to your expectations? And then do you attribute some of that to new things like Gamut, I mean we had Zoro been strong or continue to be strong. But what would you say [indiscernible]?","D. G. Macpherson","The spot buy is with large contract customers and that would not have anything to do with Gamut at this point. It would be just the pricing just that we make. And making sure that we\u2019re actually selling the value and getting more of the customers\u2019 pie.","Andrew Buscaglia","And then if I could just squeeze one more in it, your OpEx was flat on that 7% volume number. But what can we expect in terms of -- I mean, I know that you probably talked more about this at the Analyst Day. But looking into \u201818, what that OpEx increase would be -- like what\u2019s the framework to think about that for the long-term?","D. G. Macpherson","So we\u2019ll talk about that at the Analyst Day. Obviously, we expect to get continued leverage and we expect expenses to grow slower than volume. But we'll talk more specifically in a few weeks.","Operator","Our next question is from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Christopher Glynn","Just had a question about the price trend in the negotiated large customer contracts that you said are about done. I think long term that's still a percentage roll every year to a degree. So wondering your visibility conviction at price concession remains an incremental piece long term of those negotiations, or is that similarly off the table and stabilized?","Ron Jadin","We're expecting carryover impact next year on pricing probably minus 2% range, and we'd expect that to then flatten out in the following year and turn positive with inflation.","Christopher Glynn","And then just curious fourth quarter tax rate and place holder for ongoing tax rate?","Ron Jadin","So we've guided for the balance of the year for tax rate already and we'll give a guide in our November Investor Day for next year. And I know there's been a number of ranges published already this morning from some of the sell side on taxes. And it's difficult for us to comment on third quarter taxes versus consensus. But I think it's a little bit more straight forward for us to talk about it year-over-year. And when we look at our reported tax rate in the third quarter of last year, it was about 34% and this year it's 31.7%, and that's in our press release.","If you look at that and how we\u2019re weighted to last year's earnings before taxes, it's an improvement of about $6 million in lower taxes or about $0.10 EPS. And about two thirds of that is driven by our clean energy investments and the other third is driven by some solar credits and foreign tax credits. So for us year-over-year normalized it's about $0.10 pickup. And about two thirds of that also would have been -- because this is done on a year-to-date trough, two thirds of that $0.10 is probably from the first half of the year. So a lot there to consume, but that's our perspective on a year-over-year basis.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Belfiore from UBS. Please go ahead.","Chris Belfiore","So, I just trying -- kind of go back to the mix a little bit. So if possible, trying to understand the benefit that you guys might have seen from any cost actions on the market improvement in the United States versus the mix? Given some of the numbers you kind of gave with the one you just gave of low single digit improvement on spot, it kind of implies that the recurring side kind of actually decelerated from 1Q to 2Q to 3Q. So the mix does seem better. So just trying to understand that a little bit kind of understand that how you have -- you still in negotiations with the recurring sites for the large contracts. So how that might change going forward a little bit?","D. G. Macpherson","So, I think maybe I can help, just talk about. So we renegotiated most of the contracts that we would want to at this point. There\u2019s some that we can't because of contractual reasons, and we'll get to those over the next year. The way this works, it's a little bit odd to look at spot buy independent from the total volume or non-spot buy with large customer, because the goal here is to grow the entire customer and to have more of the share beyond spot buy. So the non spot buy basically has been fairly consistent in terms of the growth in the business, but we start to see that spot buy, that means more of the mix is non-negotiated, which just makes it easier for the customer and makes it easier for us and actually is helpful for everybody. So that\u2019s the goal and changing this at this point.","Chris Belfiore","And then I know you said that kind of give a lot of details in November. But in terms of Canada, I mean, you guys have been targeting breakeven operating margins by year end, and it seems likes that\u2019s probably not the case. Just kind of any commentary around that or is there trends that you're seeing in the region from that from that stand point?","D. G. Macpherson","So we're seeing decent volume growth. We will come back, as I mentioned before, in about three weeks and talk through the plan for Canada. And the plan for Canada as we said it before is substantial, and I think get's us to a place that is much more profitable in 2019, which is what we\u2019re looking for. So we will talk about that very shortly.","Operator","Next question is from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray","Like to get some color, further color on the hurricane impact. Specifically, what your sense of the mix for those medium customers relative to the segment average? And then what is expectation for fourth quarter impact from hurricane?","D. G. Macpherson","Fourth quarter impact, Deane, will probably be very small, if it is noticeable. In terms of mix, most of the time we have hurricanes I think this was no different. Product mix is similar in many ways to the rest of the mix. We end up spending a little bit more money frankly to deliver the product. So we do a lot of things that you wouldn\u2019t naturally do. And so things like freight cost go up in the short-term to serve the customer. It's not really a big net benefit or decrement to the GP rate.","Deane Dray","And just as a follow up, have you quantified what the digital investment in the quarter was? From a dollar amount, but also what is exactly we\u2019re spending it on?","D. G. Macpherson","We have not quantified that. We\u2019ll talk about that in a couple -- in a few weeks, that\u2019s going to be a part of the discussion we have in the Analyst Day.","Operator","Our next is from Luke Junk from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Luke Junk","First, D. G. just wondering if you could help size the benefit from higher government spending in September, is it in the same areas, the drag that you saw in June?","D. G. Macpherson","So, I would say fiscal year end, in general, was similar to past year it wasn\u2019t either really strong or really weak. So it was similar fiscal year end to what we've seen before. Net-net there have been some bumps in terms of government procurement that happened from mid May through mid August, probably in the negative for the year so far. But year-end it was pretty good but not unusual.","Luke Junk","And then second little bigger picture question. Just wondering as you're ramping up your efforts to acquire customers in the mid size area. I'm wondering is where and how your digital marketing activities that picked up in mid August here and inside sales efforts in your sack. So differently from a perspective range of your customer, how is that marketing effort can appear to me, and say if I do place an order, what kind of follow up or sale cycle expect to see?","D. G. Macpherson","So the basic funnel, and again we\u2019ll talk about this in a few weeks. But we will use digital marketing in many cases to acquire customer, we learned who that customer is. We\u2019ll figure out what the right price and service offering for that customer is. And then if they get big enough and attractive enough inside sales will cover them. And once an inside sales person is covering them most of the digital investments will be email digital as opposed to discounting digital. So there\u2019s a funnel and a process for customers as they get more mature. That leaves them to inside sales if the characters fix with that customer make sense.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Evelyn Chow","This is Evelyn Chow on for Joe. I would like to dig into the light spot buy acceleration, great to see very encouraging sign. Just wondering if there is any tilt this quarter towards certain customer or product categories that you\u2019ve seen?","D. G. Macpherson","No, the growth has been pretty consistent across the board. So if you look at the overall customer growth, it\u2019s been similar in the spot buy.","Evelyn Chow","And then maybe turning to the divestiture of the U. S. specialty business, just wanted a little bit more clarification on the rationale and any potential impact to margins this year?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, it was a relatively small business that made a little bit of money. It was not core to what we do. And so some of our acquisitions we\u2019ve integrated into the core, and this one never really made sense to integrate into the core. We brought some of the products into the business. But frankly this business ends up joining another business that\u2019s similar and has a much better chance of success in that portfolio than it does with us.","Operator","Our next question is from Justin Bergner from Gabelli and Company. Please go ahead.","Justin Bergner","My first question is just similar to some other questions that have been asked, which is if the spot buy and non contract buy for the large customers drove the acceleration and the actual contractual buy was at a similar growth rate as last quarter. I mean, it would seem that with the market accelerating a bit holding the contract purchases similar growth rate might be under performing the improvement in the market. Is that true and if so why?","D. G. Macpherson","No, we actually don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. And if you look at the large customer results, what you\u2019ll see is the spot buy and the non-contract customers went from negative to growing low single-digits which means the rest of it had to grow faster than the average. And so that is -- and we think that\u2019s gaining share at a similar pace to what gain share before.","Justin Bergner","Okay, that\u2019s great to know. And then on the acceleration in the other businesses, I guess the volume accelerated from second quarter a touch, but the single channel number decelerated fairly materially. So what\u2019s offsetting the deceleration in the single channel business to hold the other business volume consistent with prior quarter growth?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, we\u2019ve seen nice growth with the single channel online model even through this quarter the Japanese business grew in the 20s. But there are other businesses, Mexico grew strongly favorably strongly. So, we\u2019re seeing growth in some of the other international but the UK grew a little bit. So we\u2019re seeing nice growth in that portfolio as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Securities. Please go ahead.","Hamzah Mazari","The first question is just on market share. D. G. large customer market share for you guys, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, is maybe 14%. Can you get to double-digit market share on the medium customer side? Or is there anything structural that prevents that? And then secondly, are you maxed out on large customer market share but that\u2019s a pretty big number when you look at the overall industry?","D. G. Macpherson","I think we\u2019re not maxed out on large customer market share. I think we have share opportunities to grow. When I do customer visits there, frequent discussions about how to expand the relationship find more context sell our value in the places where we don't have value -- add value today. So I'm not concerned that we've tapped out. Midsize customers, I guess, when you're as low shares where we'll see. When you talk to the midsize customers, they really love Grainger and the value that Grainger provides and they just haven't been buying from us largely because of price and we haven't actually been reaching out to them. So we'll see. I'm going to reserve that answer for time back. I think there's a long playfield for us to grow midsize customers.","Hamzah Mazari","And then just a follow-up. Any comments around the CFO search and what you're looking at there, I appreciate it?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, so we have a search firm and a number of candidates that are -- that we are working through and we will get you an update when we have the CFO. We have very good pipeline.","Operator","Our next question is from Patrick Baumann from J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Patrick Baumann","I had a quick question on the pricing. You had a couple of months now under your belt with the new cuts, or price reductions. Are you seeing any noticeable competitive response on pricing and if so from where?","D. G. Macpherson","So, maybe I should start by what we've done with pricing, I think it was probably more unique to us than to the market where our prices were out of market the way we go to market. And so we expected modest reaction and that's pretty much what we've seen. There hasn't been much reaction. The reality in our space is that everybody goes to market differently, has their own strategy. And so we haven\u2019t seen a lot of direct response to our actions, and our prices aren't lowest now and won't be.","Patrick Baumann","And then just a clean-up question on tax rate, and I know you talked about the year-over-year change. But how much or did tax rate at all add to the midpoint of your EPS guidance relative to your prior guidance, and if so how much?","Ron Jadin","No. This is Ron. We stayed with the midpoint. We think the benefit overall on taxes is in the $0.05 to $0.10 range, and it\u2019s really offsetting some little bit of loss earnings from the specialty business we sold very small and then just a cautious look at Canada for the year.","Patrick Baumann","And then last one from me, just one more clean-up. The revenue guidance, the tightening around the low end and it seem like. Is that all because of...","Ron Jadin","That's because of the specialty business sale. I think that was your question so yes, specialty business sales.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Barger from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Steve Barger","Just back to the comment on working to get the right assortment at the right cost to offset inflation. Does that mean you're de-sourcing or resourcing some product to different vendors or how does that work?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, it typically is at a category level. And by category level, I would mean 500 SKUs, 200 SKUs. And effectively, we look at all the customer feedback and what customers care back. We look at the assortment we have and in some cases we're adding vendors, in some cases we consolidated vendors. It just depends on what the customers care about and then we try to get the lowest cost we can. And so there's not a single formula. You have to do it category-by-category.","Steve Barger","And do you expect you can keep the lid on that inflation as you go through the end of this year into the first part of '18 based on your efforts?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, we do. We think we'll keep a lid on inflation. I think if we didn't have that program, we would be seeing some inflation for sure. But that program helps us to offset that inflation.","Steve Barger","And one more quick one sorry if I missed this. Are there any of those non-core business divestitures we should be looking for or is that portfolio where you want it now?","D. G. Macpherson","Portfolio is pretty much where we wanted now.","Operator","Our next question is from Jane Zhao from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Jane Zhao","So first one, I just want to understand little bit better the revenue and income for the specialty business, you guys divested. It was a one point headwind this quarter. But I think you guys sold the business in late July. So can you just give us some color, may be the potential impacting to 4Q?","Ron Jadin","We sold it in mid July and it was\u2026","D. G. Macpherson","Revenue was in the $6 million to $7 million a month range, maybe\u2026","Ron Jadin","So $70 million to $80 million businesses.","Jane Zhao","And is it slightly lower margin business compared to the rest of U.S.?","Ron Jadin","Yes.","Jane Zhao","And then on the pricing outlook. So pricing was down 5 points and it was I guess a full quarter of pricing impact. Are you guys still looking for like about 6 point of run rate in terms of price decline?","D. G. Macpherson","So keep in mind that the price changes happened mid quarter. For the last two months, the price changes were in effect. And so it's not a full, five is not a full quarter ex-U.S.","Jane Zhao","So six is still the number you guys are looking for on a run rate basis?","D. G. Macpherson","Five to six in the first quarter, five to six\u2026","Operator","Our next question is from John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","John Inch","Just to circle back the tax issue, I don\u2019t think we got the answer. What -- Ron or D. G., what is the effective tax rate you're guiding to in the fourth quarter to get to your implied 2013 midpoint EPS?","D. G. Macpherson","For the full year, it's 34.5 to 35.5 and for the quarter, it\u2019s about 35 for the fourth quarter.","John Inch","35 for the fourth quarter, okay\u2026","D. G. Macpherson","Sorry, if I wasn\u2019t clear enough on the other comment.","John Inch","That\u2019s okay, now I got the year. I just -- it's hard to triangulate because you\u2019re excluding the 11 million, it\u2019s just hard to triangulate. I was going to ask you, hurricanes were a percent of contribution in the quarter. What does that imply? Doesn\u2019t that imply there were 3 points of contribution benefit in September? You're giving your numbers ex-hurricane. So I'm just trying to understand that.","D. G. Macpherson","John, I don\u2019t understand the question. I didn\u2019t track that.","John Inch","So if hurricanes were a percent of benefit for the quarter, the impact of hurricane for your commentary happened in September. Does that imply the actual September results were boosted by about 3 points, just literally taking the one versus one month?","D. G. Macpherson","So it\u2019s two in September.","John Inch","And you said margins are slightly worse for these tails, is that correct?","D. G. Macpherson","Generally, it's not a major impact on the next I would say.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Robert McCarthy","Just a quick follow up. As you think about the medium size business, going forward, how do we think about the pricing actions you\u2019ve taken or contemplating? And the gross margin mix as we go into '18, what\u2019s the embedded assumption there, given what we have new information now?","D. G. Macpherson","So we're going to have to wait three weeks for that one, Rob. We\u2019ll talk at the Analyst Day about that.","Robert McCarthy","And then just finally on Canada. Is there anything you can say about breakeven or not, or we would expect a small loss in the fourth quarter, seems these guys would imply loss given your comments around the narrowing in the range?","D. G. Macpherson","That would be our expectation and we\u2019ll get a lot more detail in Analyst Day.","Operator","Our next question is from Justin Bergner from Gabelli and Company. Please go ahead.","Justin Bergner","Thanks for the quick follow up. On the corporate expenses, I guess, say we\u2019re meaningfully down year-on-year and modestly down quarter-on-quarter. What\u2019s -- is there any change to the view for the annual corporate expenses embedded in your narrowed guidance range?","Ron Jadin","And this is Ron. Not really we\u2019ve some favorability in the third quarter driven by the low share price and stock compensation. The expensing of that and that will pride bounce back with a bit higher stock price in the fourth quarter. So there is some timing there. But that drive sequential variation. But for the year, we don\u2019t expect anything unusual.","D. G. Macpherson","And we continue to work very hard to make sure that our costs are necessary. And so we\u2019re really focused on making sure that our expenses are all well managed. And I think that this reflects that part.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Cieslak from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Ryan Cieslak","Really quick just on the volume guidance in the back half of the year in the U. S., originally 6 to 8. Have you changed that guidance at this point based on what you saw here in the third quarter or your expectations, sorry if I miss that. I just wanted to make sure that was clear.","D. G. Macpherson","So, I would say in the U. S. we\u2019re optimistic about what we\u2019re seeing, but we\u2019re not fairly short timeframe. So we\u2019re not going to change our guidance per se that we are happy with what we\u2019ve seen.","Ryan Cieslak","And then thinking about the longer-term operating margin targets you guys have out there for 12% to 13% by 2019. Can you just refresh us on what you guys are assuming for annual COGS inflation to get to that \u201919 framework? Thanks.","D. G. Macpherson","So, we don\u2019t typically view that. I would say, we don\u2019t actually plan annual COGS inflation necessarily in that math. We look at price cost spread. So from our question is, when we manage COGS as well or better than our competitors and we will be able to perhaps pass through whatever the market COGS is overtime. So, we typically find our financials that way as opposed to sticking with the specific number, because that number can fluctuate pretty quickly. But we\u2019ll talk about our expectations again in few weeks.","Ryan Cieslak","Okay, thanks.","D. G. Macpherson","All right. Well, thanks everybody. I think that\u2019s our last caller. Just to summarize, we made a solid quarter, U. S. volume growth was encouraging, continued strong growth and profitability expansion in the online model, continue to really focus on cost management and we\u2019re in the midst of a significant turnaround in Canada. Look forward to seeing most of you in a few weeks. And thanks for your time.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

(NYSE:GWW) Q1 2016 Earnings Conference Call April 18, 2016  7:30 AM ET","Executives","Laura Brown - Senior Vice President Communications and Investor Relations","William Chapman - Senior Director of Investor Relations","Analysts","Laura Brown","Hello, this is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger\u2019s first quarter 2016 results.","This podcast is supplemented by our 2016 first quarter earnings release issued today, April 18, and other information available on our Investor Relations website. This material contains forward looking statements that are based on our current view of the competitive market and the overall environment. Future risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially.","Please see our SEC filings, including our most recent periodic reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which are available on the Investor Relations website, for a discussion of factors that may affect our forward-looking statements. Tables reconciling non-GAAP measures accompany the script to this podcast and today\u2019s earnings release, which are both available on our Investor Relations website.","Today we reported our 2016 first quarter results. While we are currently experiencing economic headwinds and our short term results are affected, we continue to manage the business for the long term. Our investments in eCommerce, KeepStock and supply chain, including the New Jersey and Toronto distribution centers, will provide and support growth for years to come.","We have also invested in tools and processes that will make us more productive including a new CRM system and SAP in Canada and Mexico. Now, let\u2019s cover the specifics for the quarter.","A stronger-than-expected January, due to carryover spending from fourth quarter customer shutdowns and favorable holiday timing, contributed to our sales performance. The difficult economic environment and headwind from last year\u2019s strong sales of seasonal products and Ebola-related products were also considerations.","Solid expense management and the timing of planned spending offset some of the gross margin pressure. In Canada, we completed the installation of SAP, which will drive better service and increased productivity over time. However, we saw a further slowdown in February and March due to the implementation, which also had an unfavorable impact on expenses.","And our single channel online businesses of Zoro in the United States and MonotaRO in Japan posted continued strong performance.","Let\u2019s now look at the quarter in detail. Company sales increased 3%. We had 64 selling days in the quarter, one more than the previous year. On a daily basis, sales increased 1%. Reported operating earnings declined 10% and net earnings were down 12%. Reported earnings per share of $2.98 were down 3% versus $3.07 in the previous year.","The first quarter in both years contained restructuring items as noted in the press release issued today, April 18. Please refer to the adjusted results found in the press release. All results referenced in the remainder of this podcast are adjusted unless specifically noted.","Now, let\u2019s now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail.","Gross profit margins decreased 300 basis points versus the prior year to 41.8% driven by lower performance in the U.S. and Canada segments. Operating expenses for the company declined 4%, driven by restructuring benefits and the timing of planned spending. Company operating earnings declined 5% versus the 2015 quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by lower gross profit margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses.","Company operating margins were down 110 basis points versus the prior year to 13.4%. Net income was $199 million, down 6%. Earnings per share of $3.18 were up 3% from the 2015 first quarter.","Let\u2019s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we\u2019ll cover the following topics. First, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of March; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we\u2019ll wrap up with the discussion of our 2016 guidance and other key items.","Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. For consistency, we use the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales.","Company sales for the quarter increased 1% on a daily basis. The 1% sales growth included 4 percentage point from Cromwell acquired on September 1, 2015, and a 1 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales declined 2% driven by a 3 percentage point reduction in price and a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point increase from higher volume.","By month, daily sales were as follows; up 4% in January, up 1% in February, and down 1% in March.","Let\u2019s move on to sales by segment. We report two business segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations, located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. Our Other Businesses also include results from our single channel online businesses in Japan, MonotaRO; the United States, Zoro; and Europe.","Sales in the United States, which accounted for 75% of total company revenue in the quarter, were down 2% on a daily basis. The 2% decrease was driven by a 3 percentage point decline in price and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by 1% from volume growth and a 1 percentage point contribution from increased sales to Zoro, the single channel online business in the United States.","Let\u2019s review sales performance by customer end-market for the quarter in the United States.","Government was up in the mid-single-digits. Light Manufacturing and Retail were up in the low-single-digits. Commercial was down in the low-single-digits. Contractor and Heavy Manufacturing were down in the mid-single-digits. Reseller was down in the low-double-digits. And Natural Resources was down in the mid-teens.","Now, let\u2019s turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 7% of total company revenues in the quarter. The business in Canada continues to face a challenging economy given the country\u2019s exposure to oil and gas. Results reported in U.S. dollars were further affected by the strong U.S. dollar.","Sales for our business in Canada declined 25% on a daily basis and 17% on a daily basis in local currency. The 17% decline consisted of 14 percentage points from lower volume and 6 percentage points from the SAP implementation, partially offset by 3 percentage points from price. The Canadian business installed SAP on February 1, 2016. As expected, the business experienced lower sales following implementation, as team members became acclimated to the new system.","All customer end-markets were lower in the quarter. On a geographic basis, daily sales in the province of Alberta, which represents about a third of the company\u2019s business in Canada, was down 26% in local currency. Local currency sales for all other provinces were down 10%.","Let\u2019s conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. This group includes our operations in Europe, Asia and Latin America, and represents about 18% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 47% on a daily basis, consisting of 33 percentage points from Cromwell, acquired on September 1, 2015, and 17 percentage points of growth from volume and price, partially offset by a 3 percentage point decline from foreign exchange.","Sales growth in the Other Businesses was driven by the strong performance from the single channel online businesses in the United States and Japan, which grew 34% on a daily basis.","Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for January and February, and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let\u2019s now take a look at March. There were 23 selling days in March of 2016, one more than in 2015.","Company daily sales declined 1% versus March of 2015. Sales results in March included 4 percentage points from acquisitions, and foreign exchange was essentially flat for the month. Excluding acquisitions, organic daily sales declined 5% driven by a 3 percentage point decline in price, a 1 percentage point reduction from the timing of the Easter holiday, a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of Ebola-related products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point contribution from volume.","In the United States, daily sales in March declined 5%. This decline was due to a 3 percentage point decline in price, a 1 percentage point reduction from the timing of the Easter holiday, a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of Ebola-related products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point contribution from increased sales to Zoro.","March customer end-market performance in the United States was as follows. Government was up in the mid-single-digits. Light Manufacturing was flat. Retail was down in the low-single-digits. Commercial was down in the mid-single-digits. Heavy Manufacturing and Contractor were down in the high-single-digits. And Natural Resources and Reseller were down in the mid-teens.","Daily sales in Canada for March were down 20% and down 18% in local currency. The 18% daily sales decline consisted of a 16 percentage point decline in volume, a 3 percentage point decline from the SAP implementation and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point benefit from price. The volume decline was seen in all customer end markets.","On a geographic basis, sales performance in Canada was driven by softness in the province of Alberta, which was down 24% in local currency in March. All other provinces were down about 18%.","Daily sales in March for our Other Businesses increased 41%. The daily sales growth consisted of 31 percentage points from Cromwell and 10 percentage points from volume and was primarily driven by Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO. Performance for the Other Businesses was driven by 28% daily sales growth for the single channel online businesses.","Our businesses in Latin America and Fabory in Europe were affected by the timing of Easter, where extended holidays are more common.","Turning to April, daily sales growth to date has benefited from the timing of the Easter holiday. We are expecting low-single-digit sales growth for the full month.","Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.","William Chapman","Thanks, Laura. Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let\u2019s move right into results by reportable segment. As a reminder, all results in the podcast are adjusted to exclude restructuring unless specifically noted.","Operating earnings in the United States declined 5% versus the 2015 first quarter, with operating margins down 90 basis points to 17.7% versus 18.6% in the prior year. Gross profit margins for the quarter declined 260 basis points, driven by greater sales to lower margin customers and price deflation greater than COGS deflation. Approximately 80 basis points of the reduction, was due to changes in the classification of certain funding received from vendors related to the annual trade show.","Operating expenses in the U.S. segment decreased 7% driven by lower payroll and benefit costs and timing of planned spending and $10 million of supplier funding for the trade show.","Let\u2019s move on to our business in Canada, which had a loss of $9 million in the quarter versus a $9 million in profit in the prior year. The decrease was driven by the sales decline, lower gross profit margins and unfavorable operating expense leverage. The gross profit margin in Canada was down 660 basis points, with about one-third of the decline due to not having a trade show this year in Canada and about two-thirds from product mix driven by unfavorable foreign exchange.","Expenses were down 18% versus the prior year, but the business experienced negative expense leverage given the 24% decline in reported revenue. We believe our investments in supply chain and IT in Canada set the stage for improved performance for this business.","Our Other Businesses generated $22 million in operating earnings for the 2016 quarter versus $12 million in 2015. This performance was primarily driven by strong results from Zoro in the United States and MonotaRO, along with the incremental earnings from Cromwell, acquired on September 1, 2015. Operating margin for the Other Businesses in the quarter increased 100 basis points, from 3.9% to 4.9% year-over-year.","Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net expense of $20 million in the 2016 first quarter versus $4 million in the 2015 first quarter. The increase is due to interest expense from the $1 billion of debt the company issued in 2015, as well as expected losses from the company\u2019s investment in clean energy.","For the quarter, the effective tax rate in 2016 was 35.6% versus 38.4% in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the company\u2019s investments in clean energy. We are still projecting an effective tax rate of 35.2% to 36.2% in the full year 2016.","Lastly, let\u2019s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $154 million in the 2016 first quarter versus $156 million in the 2015 first quarter. The company used the cash generated, along with short-term borrowings, to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends.","Capital expenditures were $52 million in the 2016 first quarter versus $99 million in the first quarter of 2015, reflecting a lower planned spend for 2016 and the timing of ongoing projects. We returned $245 million to shareholders through $73 million in dividends and $172 million to buy back 893,000 shares of stock.","Now let\u2019s take a look at guidance. As mentioned in the press release, we have narrowed our 2016 guidance range for sales and earnings per share. Our new guidance reflects increased gross profit pressure for the year and increased operating expense favorability, although not to the same extent as the first quarter.","Let\u2019s look more closely at the underlying elements of our expectations versus adjusted results in 2015. We\u2019ll begin with sales. We narrowed our sales guidance range and maintained a midpoint of 3% reported growth. We now expect price to be a little worse, down 2%, and foreign exchange to be a little better, down 1%, both for the full year. Although price was down 3% in the first quarter, we expect price to improve slightly in the final three quarters. We normally issue a price increase in January, but we intend to increase prices on a selective group of items as the year progresses.","Moving on to gross profit margins. Given the deflationary environment, we are taking a cautious view on gross margins and are lowering our gross margin expectations by 80 basis points. So for the full year, we now expect gross profit margins to be down 130 to 150 basis points versus 2015. For the 2016 second quarter, we are expecting gross profit margins to be down 130 to 150 basis points versus the 2015 second quarter.","On operating expense for the year, we expect operating expense to sales to be flat to down 90 basis points. For the second quarter, we expect operating expense to sales to be down 40 to 60 basis points.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at operating margin expectations. The gross profit and operating expense adjustments offset, resulting in unchanged operating margin guidance from January. So for the full year, we expect 40 to 150 basis points of operating margin compression versus the prior year. For the 2016 second quarter, operating margins are forecasted to be down 70 to 110 basis points.","On restructuring in the first quarter, we closed five branches in the United States, and we expect to close 50 more in the remainder of the year. While negligible in the first quarter, we now anticipate gains on sales of restructuring related assets to be $5 million to $10 million pretax over the rest of the year. Unlike the $7 million gain on sale of the former Toronto distribution center due to relocation, the branch gains are an offset to restructuring costs and are not in our guidance. We wanted to share this detail as it drives reported results, from expenses to earnings per share and net working assets to cash flow.","Now on our non-operating initiatives, we anticipate our next issuance of $400 million in long-term debt in the second quarter as part of our planned $800 million in share repurchases for 2016. As communicated early this year, we entered into a second clean energy investment, which generates operating losses but is also eligible for tax credits. We expect about $0.15 per share benefit to earnings per share in 2016 from the two clean energy investments. Please see Exhibit 4 for more information.","Finally, earnings per share, we narrowed our range for earnings per share. Similar to sales, we did not adjust the midpoint due to uncertainty about the economy and the first quarter expense favorability that will not repeat to the same extent.","Please mark your calendar for the following upcoming events on April 27, we will host our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The script from that meeting will be available on our website following the event. We plan to report April sales information on May 13. And on May 18, Jim Ryan, Ron Jadin and D.G. Macpherson will present at the Electrical Products Group meeting in Longboat Key, Florida. This event will also be webcast.","We appreciate your support and thank you for your interest in Grainger.

Grainger Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to your host, Irene Holman, VP, Investor Relations.","Irene Holman","Good morning. Welcome to Grainger\u2019s Q3 earnings call. With me are D. G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Senior Vice President and CFO. As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking statements based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of the slide presentation and in our Q3 press release. Both are available on our IR website. D.G. will cover performance for the quarter, and Tom will go deeper into our financials including segment results. After that, we will open the call for questions. D. G., to you.","D. G. Macpherson","Thank you, Irene. Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. So we had another solid quarter. Demand remained very strong in the third quarter and we are continuing to gain share. In the US, as we lapped our August 2017 pricing changes, we are encouraged with our volume growth of 8%, which significantly outpaced the market. We are continuing to see that our value proposition resonates with both large and midsize customers now that we have removed pricing as a barrier. We continue to grow faster in more profitable parts of the business, notably with our midsize customers. In addition, gross margin when normalized for the revenue recognition accounting change, and operating margin, were both favorable to prior year.","In Canada, the execution of our turnaround continues to make progress and is on schedule. We still expect to exit the year at a profitable run rate. Our single channel online businesses, namely, MonotaRO and Zoro, had strong growth and profitability. We recorded a non-cash impairment for Cromwell in the UK, reflecting slower growth than planned at acquisition. The overall international businesses are profitable with the exception of the impairment. ","We believe that our current exposure to tariffs is well understood and effectively managed. Tom will address tariffs later in the presentation.","I would also mention two other things. One, we had a very strong customer satisfaction rating in the US this quarter, actually the strongest we\u2019ve seen under the current methodology. And also with Hurricane Michael making landfall last week, I want to note that all of our people are safe and our team members are doing a great job responding to the event as they always do.","With that, let\u2019s take a look at our results. Third quarter 2018 reported results contained restructuring charges of $142 million and a $2.37 impact to EPS. In the quarter, we took a non-cash impairment of $139 million related to our Cromwell business. In 2015, we described to you the expected benefits of the acquisition, based on the strength of the core Cromwell business, the ability to build the online model off of that core and the potential in the UK market. Many of these benefits still exist. However, a few things have changed since the decision. First, Brexit occurred within a year of acquisition and the market slumped. And the uncertainty surrounding Brexit as it gets closer to being executed forces us to take our growth projections lower. Second, the cost of capital is higher now. These two structural issues explain the majority of reduction in valuation.","In addition, our strategy included building an online model with the Cromwell name. In reality, this approach created customer conflict with the core business. We adjusted our approach and re-launched the online model under the Zoro name about a year ago. The opportunity with Zoro is large and compelling with very strong early signals in the market. But the late start of Zoro and the lower growth rate given market conditions impacted current valuation. While it\u2019s still early days, we do believe the UK is an attractive place for Grainger to play.","This morning's call will focus on adjusted results which exclude the items outlined in our press release. Total company sales in the quarter were up 7%, that included 7% in volume, 1% in price and a headwind due to foreign exchange and hurricane comparisons of 1%. This is the first quarter in 2018 with a foreign exchange headwind. Normalizing for foreign exchange and hurricanes, our sales increased over 8%. Our normalized GP rate was flat to the prior year after adjusting for the revenue recognition accounting change which we discussed earlier. We continue to realize operating expense leverage on higher volume. This all lead to operating earnings growth of 15% in the quarter and an operating margin that was 80 basis points higher than the prior year.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom for additional detail, including our segment results.","Tom Okray","Thanks, D. G. I\u2019ll cover our other business results first. As a reminder, other businesses include our single channel online model and our international businesses. Sales for these businesses were strong, up 13% in the quarter; 14% driven by price and volume, partially offset by a 1% reduction related to foreign exchange. Our online businesses grew 23%, continuing to be a profitable growth driver. The international businesses were profitable led by our Mexican operations. In Canada, the AGI turnaround is making progress. ","With many of our cost reduction initiatives behind us, we will now focus on growing profitably. Sales were down 20% or 17% in local currency. Price increases, branch closures and sales coverage optimization activities contributed to volume being down 27%. This was partially offset by a 10% increase in price as we continue to renegotiate pricing on our large customer contracts.","Moving to profit. In our comparison to the prior year, there were non-recurring adjustments related to excessive and obsolete inventory and vendor rebates that impacted gross margin. After adjusting for these items and normalizing for revenue recognition, our gross margin was 430 basis points favorable to the prior year. Operating margin improved 200 basis points, driven by favorable pricing and cost reduction. Adjusting for the non-recurring items, operating margin improved 570 basis points. Looking forward, we expect to exit the year with a positive operating margin run rate.","In the United States, the demand environment was strong and we were able to grow profitably. Our value proposition combined with a continued favorable response to our pricing actions resulted in increased share. Sales were up 9% in the quarter. Volume was up 8% and price was up 1% due to general inflation as well as lapping the price reset. ","In the month of September, hurricanes negatively impacted sales growth by a 160 basis point. In 2017, Harvey and Irma had a larger benefit than Florence contributed in 2018. Normalizing for this impact, sales in September grew at 8%, consistent with August growth for large and medium customers. After adjusting for the revenue recognition accounting change, our normalized gross profit rate increased 20 basis points. The increase was driven by customer mix and favorable price cost spread. ","Operating leverage continued to be strong in the US. Having said that, you will notice some lumpiness in the quarter related to two factors; increased variable compensation versus the prior year; and the quarterly variable compensation true-up methodology. On a calendar year basis, these factors will wash out with sales growing significantly faster than operating expense. All-in, operating margin at 15.1% improved 20 basis points versus prior year.","Let's take a look at our large and medium customers. Despite lapping our pricing actions in mid-August, we continued to see strong volume growth from both large and midsize customers. Our value proposition continues to resonate and we are seeing the results. Our US large customer business is performing consistently. We're seeing strong performance with our non-contract customer and spot buy purchases are increasing with contract customers. US medium volume growth of 22% is strong, especially considering a tough comp. New customers continue to be a meaningful contributor to volume growth. We are excited by what we are seeing. While we expect continued double-digit growth with medium customers, the rate of growth in Q4 will moderate.","I want to take a few minutes to go in some more detail on tariffs and other issues. With respect to tariffs, we have deployed a cross-functional taskforce to gain a clearer understanding of the tariff impact as well as to execute mitigating actions. The team meets daily, reporting to senior leadership at least weekly. Some other actions include validating tariff increases, working with suppliers to minimize the cost impact, including identifying alternative supply and evaluating pricing actions while ensuring that our pricing stays market-based. ","With respect to quantifying the impact, product directly sourced from China represents about 20% of the US segment\u2019s cost of goods sold. This product is split between our national brands and our private label. National brands, which comprise the majority, are sourced from suppliers with manufacturing in multiple locations, providing flexibility in addressing the tariffs. Approximately half of this product sourced from China is impacted by 301 tariffs. Applying tariff rates of 25%, we estimate our costs would increase by about 2% for the US segment. Based on the taskforce work combined with our experience to-date, we are confident that we can find alternative supply and\/or price to cover the expected tariff cost increases.","Moving to taxes, we want to ensure that the main drivers between reported and adjusted tax rate versus the prior year is understood. The Q3 reported rate of 32.7% is up 1 percentage point versus prior year. We had tax benefits from US tax reform and stock-based compensation. This was more than offset by the impact of the Cromwell impairment, which is non-deductible and increased the rate by 16.3 percentage points. ","With respect to the adjusted rates, the Q3 rate of 20.0% is down 11.7 percentage points versus prior year. As with the reported rate, the adjusted rate reflects benefits from US tax reform and stock-based compensation. However, the Cromwell impairment is removed from our adjusted results and does not impact the adjusted tax rate. ","Finally, in July, we gave EPS guidance of $15.05 to $16.05. Further, we mentioned that it did not include the tax benefit from stock-based compensation for the second half. We\u2019ve stayed away from predicting the exercise of stock-based awards, which is inherently difficult. Excluding that benefit, which was $0.14 in Q3, we are trending to the high-end of our guidance. As a reminder, we will provide 2019 guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January.","I'll now turn it back to D. G. for closing remarks.","D. G. Macpherson","Thanks, Tom. So, overall, we\u2019re very pleased with our continued strong momentum. We know that we\u2019ve a compelling value proposition, and the team members are energized and focused on creating value for our customers. ","After lapping the price increases, the US continued to gain share at attractive margins. The turnaround in Canada is on track. We\u2019re now focused on profitable growth off of the business model reset. Our online model continues to show very strong profitable growth and our narrowed international portfolio continues to improve profitability. ","With that, I will open it up for any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Merkel","A couple of questions from me. So first, based on some of my inbound emails, people are picking on the lack of operating leverage in the US for this quarter. Can you just discuss what exactly drove the variable comp throughout this quarter? And then can you confirm that this is a one-time event and that the US operating leverage will be strong in 2019?","Tom Okray","Yes, I mean as we said in our prepared remarks, the big impact that we had in terms of operating leverage was the true-up. We do this on a quarterly basis. And as our results for the year are very strong, we had to put a disproportionate amount in Q3 and Q4. Obviously throughout the year, point to wash out, if you normalized for that, we're going to see tremendous operating leverage with sales growing approximately twice the rate of operating expenses.","Ryan Merkel","And then secondly, I know you are not talking about 2019 but on the last call you stated you thought gross margin in 2019 could be stable with 2018. And I guess now that we have more information on the contract price reset and I guess an educated guess on tariffs, do you still think that you could have stable gross margins in the next year?","D. G. Macpherson","So, Ryan, we are working through all that. We will provide details in January as we announce earnings. Obviously there\u2019s a couple of things that are pretty exciting. One is customer mix is a positive right now, so midsize customer -- non-contract customer is growing faster than large contract that will be a benefit. We have to work through the specifics of the tariffs, but we feel like we're on top of that. Our goal is to be as close to flat as we can be and we think we have got the right process in place to get the best outcome.","Ryan Merkel","And then maybe just lastly on tariffs before I turn it over. I know this is a tricky question as you are starting to have conversations with customers about pricing. But is your goal to protect gross profit dollars and maybe protect gross margin rate, is that something you can comment on today?","D. G. Macpherson","Our goal is always the same. We want to be competitively priced and we want to get the best cost we can. Our expectation is that we will be able to pass through the price or find alternative sources to mitigate the impact of the tariff. And again in January we will talk about where we think we land on that, we\u2019ll look then.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Glynn","So SG&A -- SG&A at the company level -- I guess SG&A was down a little sequentially despite the spike in the US comp catch up. I\u2019m just wondering what was kind of the offset there?","Tom Okray","Well, so the offset is, just we continued cost out productivity that we've been doing for the past several quarters.","D. G. Macpherson","Yes, I would also point to Canada, as a big offset to that we've taken about $85 million out of the cost structure in Canada. And those two those actions are behind us as we had another benefit in the quarter there.","Christopher Glynn","And then passing the GM, so excluding the revenue wreck, company level gross margin was flat with the US up 20, and Canada up more than that, so it\u2019s -- wondering whether it\u2019s some pressures in the other businesses\u2019 gross margin?","Tom Okray","The other businesses\u2019 gross margin is down slightly. You also have just the algebraic dynamic of their lower margin -- gross margin overall, and they\u2019re growing at a faster rate.","D. G. Macpherson","I mean that -- the online model continues to grow very quickly and it starts with a lower GP, and that has a big impact.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.","Adam Uhlman ","I was wondering if we can start with the US segment gross margin this quarter. Congrats on expanding it, positive price costs and mix. I guess I am wondering why the gross margin -- would it have been a little bit better with that mix impact in the point of price, were there any other items within that? And then I\u2019ll just loop my second question on and that's related to the tariffs. Is there any potential for inventory reevaluation associated with that, because that\u2019s something we have to think about for fourth quarter gross margin?","Tom Okray","Let me take the first part of the question first. What I pointed to is taking a look at the sequential. Throughout the year, our gross margin typically declined. And if you look at how we\u2019re performing this year, it\u2019s a much less of a decline than we have had in previous years. So we\u2019re very happy with what\u2019s happening with gross margin. One other thing that I would point out is FX was a headwind this quarter. It\u2019s been a tailwind the previous two quarters. The dollar is getting stronger versus the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso.","D. G. Macpherson","And then the second part of your question was around inventory revaluation, we do not believe we\u2019ll have any concerns there. And as a reminder we\u2019re on LIFO, I think we shouldn\u2019t really -- we shouldn\u2019t have a problem in any case.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Winoker","Just to drill down maybe a little bit on the tariff points that you\u2019ve raised on Page 11. The first question is, just the simple math on that 25, on 50, on 20 I think is maybe closer to 2% and 2.5%. I do know there\u2019s just rounding point, then all of it. Have you gone line-by-line there, math there on 2% it looks like it\u2019s under a $1 impact if you didn\u2019t have alternate sourcing or pricing action. Am I thinking about that the right way?","Tom Okray","Yes, I mean we\u2019re -- well first of all we\u2019re certainly going line-by-line. We just simplified it for presentation sake. And as we noted in our prepared remarks, we think it\u2019s well understood and very manageable.","Steven Winoker","And that math though makes sense as well?","Tom Okray","Correct.","Steven Winoker","And then just on the alternate sourcing point just where you may have challenges on pricing or taking actions or concerned about volume impact of those pricing actions. How are you thinking about your options there in terms of substituting supply?","D. G. Macpherson","So we -- our team is looking very closely at pretty much SKU-by-SKU level and like all sourcing decisions we look at the quality of the product, we look at the cost of the product depending on how the tariff plays out. We have alternative sources already in many places, and we may have to find some additional ones. But we just look at the total economics, total landing cost and pick the one that\u2019s got the best cost for the business. Much of our ships could -- if it\u2019s China, if it\u2019s shifted it could go either to India, to Mexico or the US depending on the nature of the product. The other thing I would say is, as we're going through this, we have a fairly refined should cost approach looking at what the product cost should be. We understand what portion of the cost should be related to tariff and so we are able to work with suppliers to make sure that we are actually taking the right cost increase and that\u2019s a big focus for us.","Steven Winoker","And how long you think it will take you to migrate once you make those decisions?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, it depends. If we have an alternative source, it\u2019s actually pretty quickly. We don\u2019t -- at this point we don't feel like we're in a position where we are going to have any disruption and we feel like we are on top of this. So, we don\u2019t -- are not concerned about being able to make any changes we need to make.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Luke Junk from Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Luke Junk ","First question, D. G., Canada revenues slipped down again this quarter, by design, of course. Can you help us understand when run rate revenues should start to normalize? I think Tom mentioned in the prepared remarks that many of the cost reduction initiatives are now behind you. Basically, what kind of volume assumption is built into your operating margin guidance including this year heading into '19, broadly?","D. G. Macpherson","And we'll talk in January about the specifics for what our volume expectations are for next year. We do expect volume to stabilize over the next several quarters into next year. And we expect next year to be more of a stabilization period. I would note a couple of things. One is that the branch closures, which are mostly behind us, there's still some to come, have an impact on revenue. It also has a positive impact on profitability. We have reorganized our sales team and coverage is now stable. And we're now talking to customers and trying to drive growth. And I think that will help us stabilize over the next year. So we feel -- I would say in general, it's hard to look at numbers that are down that much. And it's hard for the team. But this is what we expected. And I think the team has doing a great job of managing through that. And we're in a good position now to really create value for customers, improve service, and improve the conversations we're having. So, we're optimistic about stabilizing and being able to grow.","Luke Junk ","And then second question on tariffs. What I'm wondering is do you approach recovering the tariffs differently by line of business, whether it's a different customer value proposition. Obviously, either they\u2019re impacted by your recent price actions or something like in Canada where some of the product is being imported from the US? Any thoughts you can share in respect to that?","D. G. Macpherson","So, what I would say is that the cross-functional team we have has people from our sourcing, from our product management teams, people from our pricing teams and including our commercial teams, all working together to make sure that we make the right decisions. I won't go into specifics about that. But in general, like I said before, we're really focused on making sure we get the right cost from our suppliers and have a competitive price. And so, that's really our fundamental principle in driving the results here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe ","Going back to the tariffs, best price, half of the -- you mentioned half -- included half activity. Can you give any color in terms of what's currently not covered in terms of product categories? Any color there would be helpful.","D. G. Macpherson","I don't know that we want to go through the details of which ones aren't covered and are covered. But what we've seen is that the way 301 is written, there are a number of product categories that aren\u2019t exactly -- that aren't included in this. And so, roughly half of what we have coming from China is really in that bucket today.","Nigel Coe ","Okay. And then on the impact you\u2019ve laid out, the 2% or whatever it is on the US cost, does that include any benefit from the weaker RMB or was that on an episodic basis? So, are you including the depreciation of the Chinese currency in those calculations?","Tom Okray","No. The calculation was done on a constant currency basis.","Nigel Coe ","Okay. And then just quickly on the hurricanes, the 160 basis points impact and you mentioned that there was some offset last year with the two hurricanes that weren't there this year. I just want to understand how that\u2019s -- what the difference is between last year and this year in terms of the benefits versus the impact?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes. So, what we do when we look at hurricane impact is we look at two things. We look at run rate business in the market that the hurricane hits and we look at hurricane product sales in the markets that it hits. Last year, Harvey obviously had a huge impact on the Houston market which lasted for a long time. And then Irma hit Florida. Those two combined had a lot more hurricane sales offsetting the business slowdown. In fact, the Florida business slowdown was very fast. There wasn't' much of it. And this year, Florence did not have as much impact. It still had a significant impact on that market. But given it didn't hit in as highly populated area as Houston, the impact was a little bit less this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray ","Could we talk through the restructuring actions in the quarter, so that was $142 million? Where do you stand in terms of the actions, how much are headcount, how much is footprint, anything structural? And then expectations for the balance of the year.","D. G. Macpherson","I'll turn it over to Tom in a minute. Most of that $142 million was the Cromwell impairment. And that was $139 million of it. The rest were small in general. And most of the big changes in both Canada and the US are mostly behind us. So, maybe Tom can talk about.","Tom Okray","Yes, exactly. Taking out the Cromwell, there's some small severance items in our integration favoring North America wind down in the US. And then there's some residual branch closure costs and severance costs in Canada which is quite small and coming to an end.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then just want to get -- I might have missed this I apologize. But last quarter, you talked about some pricing delays in large US customers because of contract negotiations. But where did that stand and how much of that has been run through the P&L?","D. G. Macpherson","So, the vast majority of what we've done by the end of the year, we'll get 95% done by the end of the year. The contracts that aren't done are customer choices and\/or implementation slowdowns depending on what we're talking about, and particularly, some government customers. But in general, we'll be mostly done. And we'll be talking about very small impacts going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Evelyn Chow from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Evelyn Chow ","Maybe just starting on a comment you made on the medium customer, I think you noted that you expect 4Q to grow double-digits but for the rate to moderate. Just curious if that's just a function of harder comps, especially noting that I guess your 3Q comps are probably even harder than your 4Q ones?","D. G. Macpherson","Well, so I would talk about a couple things, Evelyn. Thanks for the question. So, one is remember, the third quarter, we made the change last year, August 1st. So, part of the quarter was actually not under the new pricing. I would say we continue to be very encouraged and surprised by what we're seeing post-lapping the price changes in terms of midsize customer growth. Our models do not have us growing 30% forever, as you might guess. So we\u2019ve talked about moderating, we think it's going to be moderating to a very strong growth rate. And we only had 10 weeks after lapping the prices to really understand it. But I would say we are encouraged by what we're seeing. And we'll be more definitive at the end of the year, as we talk through it. But I'd say all signs are very, very positive on midsize customers right now.","Evelyn Chow ","That's helpful, D. G. And then apologies for an unoriginal question on tariffs but just curious, I mean I think what you laid out in Slide 11 is very helpful. I know the President has intimated that he is contemplating additional tariffs. In that event, have you thought about how to re-sense the math you laid out already? I mean is that going to be something closer to hitting the 30% of total company COGS that you've discussed in other forums?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes. So, first of all, we don't know how that will be implemented or if it will be implemented. So, like all these things, we are watching it very closely. But we don't have an opinion yet as to how that will play through. I would say, in general, obviously the tariffs are simply inflationary. And I think you see what the inflation is roughly based on the math we've seen so far. We think in the short-term, we would be able to navigate this no matter what happens. We think relative to competitors, we might be in a better position. The long-term impacts, we could all sort of argue about over time. But certainly, in the short-term, we feel like we're on it and we know what we need to do depending on what happens.","Evelyn Chow ","Understood. And then I guess last question from me. I think you noted that your spot buy has been increasing with some of your contract customers. So, just curious to know what is the mix of your planned versus unplanned purchase now versus normal or maybe versus target?","D. G. Macpherson","We don't typically talk about that specifically. And we'll take the question and think about whether at the end of the year we talk about it or not. But thanks. It's a great question, but we haven't typically laid that out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Cieslak from Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Cieslak ","Just first, I wanted to go back to the guidance and just make sure we're clear on what you guys are saying. So, if I heard you right, you said that when excluding the $0.14 benefit from stock comp and the tax rate, you're running at the high end of your EPS guidance range. One, is that correct? And then two, does that assume then the other inputs to your guidance as it relates to both sales growth and gross margins are also running at the high end of your prior guidance?","Tom Okray","Yes. It's a good question. I just want to make it clear that we've raised guidance twice this year. And we're tracking toward the high end of that range. We're very encouraged by our performance. And I'd be disappointed if we don't beat guidance this year. With respect to your question on the other elements other than EPS, the same holds true. We're tracking toward the high end of the range.","Ryan Cieslak ","And Tom, would you say you also would be surprised if you didn't beat the high end of both sales and gross margin guidance or is that more of an EPS comment you made there?","Tom Okray","I would say it's more EPS, but we're always slugging it out with the other parameters as well.","D. G. Macpherson","And I would say we're tracking toward the high end of all the dimensions that we laid out. So, obviously, we hope to beat them. But we're really tracking to the high end.","Ryan Cieslak ","Okay. Just quickly to close that question, I'd just be curious. Is there any reason why you're not giving more specific formal guidance on the full year? Is this a change in practice or just based on where we are in the year and some variability in the fourth quarter?","Tom Okray","It's really a transition in practice. We want to get out of the business of giving quarterly guidance and giving a range and working toward a midpoint. Going forward, for next year, we'd like to give guidance once a year and then quite frankly not talk about it the rest of the year, talk more about the results we're putting on the board.","Ryan Cieslak ","Okay. And then for my other question, looking at the US volume growth, it continues to be strong. But when you look at it on a two-year stack trend which we all do to try to get a sense of adjusting for prior year comps, it looks like it flatlined a little bit and implies maybe into the fourth quarter, you're starting to run more in the mid single-digits versus the high single-digits for US volume all-in. Is there something going into the fourth quarter as it relates to some of the marketing initiatives that maybe would re-inflect that higher where you can maybe achieve something in the high single-digits or is mid single-digit volume growth sort of the right way to think about at least near-term where the volumes might be growing?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes. So, we haven't really seen anything that suggests that we cannot continue to gain share and continue to grow. And like I said before, we're really encouraged by post-pricing changes, what we see in our large customer volume grew consistent with what had been growing before post-price change, and our midsize customer continues to grow. So, we would expect to be north of -- certainly north of 5, if that's your question. And we expect to have strong revenue results going forward in the US.","Ryan Cieslak ","Okay. And then my last question, and I'll hop back into queue. When you look at the tariff related commentary that you guys gave in your exposure there, 20% of your COGS, I think the prior guidance or color that you gave was specific to private label. And I think what it was, was something in that two-thirds of your private label, it was directly sourced from China. Is that still the case or is that now maybe a little bit lower? Just when you do the math, it suggests maybe that's a little bit lower than what you guys were previously talking about. Thanks.","D. G. Macpherson","Yes. I think the confusion there would be two-thirds would be on a revenue basis. And given the GP on a COGS basis, it's roughly the math as you see it. So, that's the difference there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner from Gabelli and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Bergner ","First question just on the incentive comp and how it affected the OpEx growth. If I take that 400 basis point differential on 5% growth versus 9%, I'm in the $20 million range. Should I think of then effect on the third quarter -- the usual effect on the third quarter being sort of three quarters of that $20 million being compressed in one quarter versus four quarters?","Tom Okray","Yes. We're not going to get into the specific math, but you're thinking about it the right way.","Justin Bergner ","Secondly, on the tariffs, I'm not sure I understood correctly on the private label, the merchandise. Is that private label merchandise stuff that you can redirect to other countries as it relates to where you supply from? And how much of that 20% is related to private label versus branded?","D. G. Macpherson","So, private brands, we have a whole bunch of products that we buy in China that are private branded. In many cases, we already have alternative sources that are identified. And so, what we're referring to is if we have an alternative source, depending on how the math works with the tariffs, we may be looking to switch that. We may not be if the cost is still better in China post the increase. And so, the way we think about this -- some of it's risk mitigation. If we are buying something uniquely in China, we have to have an alternative source and we will have it. If we're buying something that's only produced in China, and there are some products like that, then obviously we don't have alternative source. We can go find them and that's going to be more work.","Justin Bergner ","And then the 25% tariff assumption, I assume that a good chunk of the imports from China are being tariffed at 10% today. So, how much of that impact today is at the 10% versus at the 25% rate? I guess, I'm assuming that you expect it to step up to 25% at year-end.","Tom Okray","Yes. We assumed worst case for the calculation. So, we didn't take any credit for staying at 10%.","D. G. Macpherson","And some of the 10%, it actually already started to flow as you correctly state.","Justin Bergner ","Okay. Do you want to break out how much of the 10% versus the 25% or would you rather not?","D. G. Macpherson","We'd rather not right now.","Justin Bergner ","And then lastly, on the sales side, was there anything that was disappointing in terms of US sales, whether it be deceleration in natural resources or government customers, things that you would point to as falling short of your expectations in the quarter?","D. G. Macpherson","I would say that pretty much all things US, revenue margin, all of it was positive in the quarter relative to our expectations. And of course, there was more uncertainty going in because of the price lap. And pretty much at every turn, it would actually be what we expected to happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Graham ","I just have a question about US price which was a positive to 1 in the quarter. I was just hoping you could give us just a little bit of color on sort of the disaggregation of that because the price actions were still lapping. So, I'm assuming, of course, that the price actions were negative but that you had price increases and mixes in there as well. Could you give us any color on the buckets?","Tom Okray","Yes. Sure. I mean the way we look at the pricing is how much is commodity, vendor-related, end market levers, and then how much is related to the price reset. I mean what we've seen is the decreases associated with the price reset has slowed considerably, as you would expect, as we work through the contracts. And we've been very consistent and actually improving in terms of the price we've been able to pass on related to tariffs and other market base.","D. G. Macpherson","I would also say that the other element is customer mix was positive in the quarter which helps price. And we talked about spot buys; spot buys increasing helps as well with large contract customers as we're not selling as much deeply discounted items. So, yes.","Scott Graham ","D. G., would you say that's the first or the second quarter that spot buy and medium size customer mix has actually begun to read through?","D. G. Macpherson","Boy, I think it's the second quarter that that's started to read through. But I don't -- don\u2019t hold me to that, but I believe that's true.","Scott Graham ","Okay. And lastly, again on the pricing. So, you have the price actions with the large customers. When you go back to those customers for price increases, could you kind of walk us through were there sort of upper bands and this kind of thing that slows things down or how do you work through that with those customers?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes. We won't talk about specifics. I would say we have a very tried and true process that we use to work through any changes with customers. And our commercial team does a great job of navigating with our customers to get the best outcome for both of us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Baumann from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Baumann ","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Just had a couple clean-ups here, a lot has been covered already. Just on the tariffs, it sounds like you still expect to mitigate through alternate sourcing or pricing. Do you think you can offset the tariff cost right away or you think there might be some lag?","D. G. Macpherson","So, given what we know now, there would not be a big lag. We think it would be -- given what we expect in terms of the 10 going to 25, we think we'll be roughly coincident, close enough.","Patrick Baumann ","Okay. And then just a couple little clean-ups here. Can you tell me anything on branch count? I'm not sure if it was in the release or if it was I missed it. Just wondering what that looks like today versus the second quarter end. I know you guys are still closing branches in Canada or I think you are?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes. We are. So, we will, by the end of this year, have 30 -- 31 branches -- 35 branches opened in Canada. Most of them have already been closed. We closed seven in the quarter in Canada. And really, the rest is virtually nothing. The branch count is stable pretty much everywhere else.","Patrick Baumann ","And as you've been closing these branches in Canada, have there been any gains from them because I haven't seen any of those kind of running -- or I don't think you've called any of those out?","D. G. Macpherson","Could you repeat the question?","Patrick Baumann ","Have there been gains on those branches? I haven't seen them called out.","D. G. Macpherson","Yes. Keep in mind, yes, so, typically, they're smaller branches and not necessarily as valuable as the US branches in terms of sales.","Tom Okray","Yes. The gains would obviously show up in our restructuring charges. And they're relatively small.","Patrick Baumann ","Got it. So, those restructurings are net of gains?","Tom Okray","Yes. Correct.","D. G. Macpherson","Yes.","Patrick Baumann ","Got it. I understand. And then last a couple of, just in terms of the price write down, I'm not sure if you mentioned that, but are you done now with US large customer contracts?","D. G. Macpherson","We talked about that before. By the end of the year, we'll be 95% done, so mostly. The rest will be small. And that's almost all customer choice.","Patrick Baumann ","Sorry. Yes, I missed that. And then last one from me. Just Zoro US, how did that grow in the quarter?","D. G. Macpherson","It continued to grow strong -- strong growth in Zoro US.","Patrick Baumann ","Is it up like -- I think you said 23% for total single-channel. Is it up at that kind of range or is it going \u2026?","D. G. Macpherson","It's not quite that. But it was up \u2026","Tom Okray","It was up 18%.","D. G. Macpherson","\u202618% in the quarter. We're just looking at the number 18.","Patrick Baumann ","Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Macquarie Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Hamzah Mazari ","My first question is just around price\/cost. We talked a lot about pricing. But I think a few quarters ago, D. G., you had talked about COGS deflation. And as you know, there's a lot more inflation in the system now, whether you look at labor, freight, other items. Do you still expect COGS deflation going forward?","D. G. Macpherson","So, no. What we talked about is price cost spread and are we able to get -- are we able to mitigate COGS increases and get the right price for our customers. This year, we had talked about being down half a percent. We still expect to be roughly there. That's mostly because of the initiatives we've done to manage our costs, to understand supplier cost and improve our cost structure. But otherwise, we would actually be in an inflation mode this year of 1% to 2%, probably.","Tom Okray","To be clear though, for the quarter, we did have product cost deflation.","D. G. Macpherson","Yes. We did.","Hamzah Mazari ","Good. Got it. Very helpful. And then last question. I'll turn it over. Just on the Canadian turnaround, D. G., Grainger has tried that for several years, as you know. This time, maybe just frame for us what's different this time in terms of strategy. I know you highlighted operating margin run rate positive Q4. But just high level, what's different in this turnaround versus past several years?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes. Well, this one is a lot more, I would say, intense in the sense that we've completely reset the business. We've combined the back office with the US and created North American centers of excellence. We've gone from 170 to 35 branches. We've completely restructured the sales organization. And all of that basically means we've taken about $85 million in cost out of the business. And we're now going to start growing that business. We're adding some of the US assortment to that business, the ability to buy out of the US. We're really focused on expanding -- diversifying the customer base throughout the business. And all those things I think will mean it feels very, very different and allows us to be much more consistent in the growth we see and the performance we see out of that business going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Barger from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Barger ","Yes. Thank you. So, going back to what you just said about Canada, the 4Q positive operating margin exit is more on price and volume stabilization at this point, less on cost control like the branch closures that you just executed. And should we expect that you remain positive on a quarterly basis going forward?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes. You should expect that we remain positive going forward. A lot of what you're going to see in the fourth quarter, it will be the first time that you see really clean look at the cost structure as well. So, it's not just price and volume stabilization. It's also the cost structure getting to the new level.","Steve Barger ","Understood. And incrementals have been solid year-to-date, averaging about 24%. As you think about tougher comps, you think about mix, volume, tariffs. If we see a mid single-digit growth environment going into '19, do you think you could maintain a 20% incremental or better? Or should we be thinking high-teens given the puts and takes?","D. G. Macpherson","Oh! I think we should be able to maintain a 20% or higher.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.","John Inch ","So, if we're going to aspire to a framework of gross margins stable, does that imply a similar boost to mix from growth rates at the medium versus large today, I mean presumably those are going to slow, but do you still expect that ratio to kind of hold at 2 for 1 or whatever?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes. We'll come back and talk to you about that in January, specifically. But our expectation is that midsize customers will be growing faster than the rest of the business. And that will help us. That'll be a positive.","John Inch ","Okay. So, that makes sense. If we back into -- it's a little bit of a follow-up on that variable contribution question. But if we back into kind of the OpEx leverage, if you ex-out restructuring, we're coming up with about 20%. And the genesis of my question is I think, D. G., earlier in the discussion, you alluded to the fact that -- you or Tom alluded to the fact that perhaps restructuring was maybe sort of tapering off. I'm curious because it seems like a lot of the OpEx benefit has come from restructure in Canada and so forth. What's your trajectory for restructuring? I mean do you see as much opportunity to go after various projects in Canada or the United States or how should we think about that?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes. So, we've been running to a cost program that we talked about last year. We had been meeting or exceeding those expectations. We are in a good position now to make sure we improve our cost structure in 2019. And it comes across the entirety of the business. A lot of it actually comes from changes we have made recently, whether it's centralizing contact centers or going to the centers of excellence at AGI. All that flows through the P&L next year. I would also say that there's still great opportunity to improve the core big cost buckets in the US, whether that's getting more revenue per seller in the US, whether that's getting more lines per hour in the distribution centers.","We're going to have the Louisville distribution center up and running next year. More of our volume will then be going through automation which will help the cost structure. And we continue to get comfortable with the contact center footprint we have and getting more effective, more efficient there. So, the big cost buckets, we see a path to continue to improve the cost structure. We think that's going to continue in the future.","John Inch ","Makes sense. Just last one from me. Canada, I guess we had talked about a 4% to 8% margin rate in '19. What's changed in 2018 that prospectively makes that not a viable target or the low end or something like that? What ultimately changed in Canada this year? And maybe the 4% to 8% is still an aspirational target if we're going positive at the end of the quarter. I mean how do you sort of translate?","D. G. Macpherson","We actually don't think anything has changed. So that's still the range we're talking about so.","John Inch ","Okay. So, 4% to 8% is still on the table then?","D. G. Macpherson","Yes. And we'll talk specifics -- on about what we think specifically in January.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to D. G. Macpherson for closing remarks.","D. G. Macpherson","So, thanks for joining us today. I would just make a few points coming out of the call. Thanks for your questions. The first one is in the US, there was a lot of uncertainty going into the quarter about what happened when we lapped the prices. That actually has been very positive. Almost every metric we have in the US is looking positive in terms of our growth, our GP, our expenses, our customer acquisition. So, we're really excited about what we saw in the quarter from the United States.","Canada turnaround continues to go well. It's very challenging, but we are in a good position now based on the new cost structure to drive growth and to be profitable going forward in Canada. The online model continues to grow and to grow at attractive rates. So, we're very positive there. And then the international business which is much narrowed is in a good position to continue to drive margins. So, we feel really good about where we're at as a company and where we're heading. And I really appreciate the time. So, thanks for being on the call.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"9904":["W.W. Grainger (NYSE:GWW) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 16, 2012  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Laura D. Brown - Senior Vice President of Communications & Investor Relations","William D. Chapman - Director of Investor Relations","Laura D. Brown","Hello. This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. We will share with you some information regarding Grainger's Third Quarter 2012 Results via this audio webcast. Please also reference our 2012 third quarter earnings release issued today, October 16, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this webcast.","Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.","Before I discuss the quarter, I'd like to first highlight the $0.66 per share reserve for the expected settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, which includes the following 2 parts: number one, a $70 million pretax charge for the proposed settlement in principle with the DOJ over the interpretation of contract language signed more than 10 years ago with the General Services Administration and the U.S. Postal Service; and second, a $6 million pretax reserve related to tax, freight and miscellaneous billings for these customers.","We are close to having this longstanding dispute behind us. It is important to note that the proposed settlement does not any admission of wrongdoing by the company and avoids costly and lengthy litigation. The GSA contract dates back to 1999 and the government remains one of our larger customer end markets. As a case in point, throughout the multi-year audit, the government continued to buy from Grainger and in fact, increased its purchasing during that time. In 2011 alone, our sales to the GSA and the U.S. Postal Service totaled approximately $200 million. Additional information regarding this case can be found in the earnings release issued on October 16, along with previously filed 10-Qs and 10-Ks.","Please note that the following analysis and commentary for the remainder of this podcast excludes the effect of the $0.66 charge. From a segment presentation standpoint, the entire charge is recorded in the United States segment.","We'll start with total company results and then take a closer look at our segments. Performance for the quarter was driven by sales growth and market share gains, coupled with strong gross margin expansion. Company sales increased 8% versus the 2011 third quarter. We had 63 selling days in the quarter, 1 less than the previous year, which cost us approximately $33 million to $38 million of revenue growth. Sales growth on a daily basis increased 10%. Operating earnings increased 9%, while net earnings increased 11%. Earnings per share, excluding the $0.66 charge, were $2.81 for the quarter, representing an increase of 12% versus the 2011 third quarter. It is important to note that one less selling day represented approximately $0.05 to $0.10 per share in lower earnings on an incremental basis. With fewer selling days, only expenses that are truly variable are avoided, while fixed and semi-variable costs must be absorbed by a lower sales base.","In a few moments, we'll analyze our sales results for the quarter. Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Gross profit margins increased 40 basis points to 43.6% versus 43.2% in 2011. Our purchasing scale enables us to manage price changes in line with the market and ahead of product cost inflation. We'll provide more detail when we review the business by segment.","Company operating margin increased 20 basis points to 14.5% versus 14.3% a year ago. This improvement was driven by solid sales growth and gross margin expansion. Operating expenses grew 9%, including $19 million in incremental growth-related spending in the quarter and inclusion of operating expenses in Europe and Brazil, which we acquired since the start of the 2011 third quarter.","Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter in the month of September; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with the discussion of our revised 2012 guidance.","As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 8% on a reported basis and 10% on a daily basis. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 11% in July, 10% in August and 9% in September. The 10% daily sales growth for the quarter included 3 percentage points from acquisitions and a 1 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. We reached the anniversary of the acquisition of the business in Europe on August 31. Accordingly, the quarter includes 2 months of incremental sales and operating results. On an organic basis, which excludes acquisitions and foreign exchange, daily sales for the quarter increased 8%, with 4 percentage points from volume and 4 percentage points from price. Daily organic sales growth by month was as follows: 8% in July, 7% in August and 8% in September.","Let's move onto sales by segment. We report 2 segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Asia, Europe and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses.","Sales in the United States, which account for 77% of total company revenue, increased 4% in the quarter, 5% on a daily basis. The 5% sales growth consisted of 4% from price and 1% from volume. Daily sales in the United States increased 6% in July, 4% in August and 6% in September.","Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Our growth drivers, which include increasing our product line, expanding customer sales coverage, enhancing our e-commerce capabilities and increasing our inventory management solutions are enabling Grainger to serve customers more effectively in the following end markets in the United States. Here is the sales performance for each respective customer end market in the quarter: Light and heavy manufacturing were up in the high single digits. Commercial and government were up in the mid-single digits. Retail was up in the low single digits. And Naturals Resources, reseller and contractors were down in the low single digits.","Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent 12% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 10% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency. On a daily basis, sales in local currency increased 13%, consisting of 11% volume growth and 2 percentage points from price. By month, daily sales in Canadian dollars increased 16% in July, 13% in August and 11% in September. From a customer standpoint, sales performance in Canada was driven by strong growth in the Western provinces led by the commercial, oil and gas, forestry, contractor and utilities end markets.","Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations in Asia, Europe and Latin America and currently represents about 11% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 54%, which consisted of a 39-percentage-point contribution from the acquired businesses in Europe and Brazil, 24 percentage points from volume led by strong growth in Japan and Mexico, partially offset by a 9-percentage-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange.","Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for July and August and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at September. There were 19 selling days in September of 2012 versus 21 days in the same month of 2011. Total company sales increased 9% on a daily basis in September of 2012 versus September of 2011. The daily sales growth in September included 1 percentage point from the business acquired in Brazil. Organic sales increased 8% on a daily basis, consisting of 4% volume growth and 4 percentage points from price inflation.","In the United States, September daily sales increased 6%. This growth consisted of 4 percentage points from price and 2 percentage points from volume. September customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Government, heavy and light manufacturing were up in the high single digits. Commercial was up in the mid-single digits. Retail was up in the low single digits. And natural resources, reseller and contractor where down in the low single digits.","As we shared with our August sales release, the fiscal year end for the federal government ended in September. Thanks to our strong relationships with many of these government agencies, coupled with the value of the service we provide, we enjoyed a strong finish to the month of September. This level of growth to the government was achieved despite a decline in sales to the U.S. Postal Service related to its aggressive restructuring program. And as noted above, despite the lengthy government audit, we have continued to grow our business relationship with the government.","Daily sales in Canada for September increased 14% in U.S. dollars, up 11% in local currency. The 11% local currency daily sales growth consisted of 10 percentage points for volume and 1 percentage point for price. Similar to the quarter, sales growth in Canada was driven by strong performance in the commercial, oil and gas, contractor and utilities end markets.","Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 25% in September, consisting of 6 percentage points from acquisitions, 24 percentage points from volume, partially offset by a negative 5 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange.","Daily sales growth to date in October is currently trending slightly below the 8% organic daily growth posted in the third quarter.","Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.","William D. Chapman","Thanks, Laura. Since we've already analyzed company operating performance, let's jump right into performance by reporting segment. Again, we have excluded the $0.66 per share charge described at the beginning of this podcast. Operating earnings in the United States increased 7% versus the 2011 third quarter, and the U.S. operating increased 50 basis points to 18.2%. This performance was driven by 4% sales growth and higher gross margins. Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 50 basis points, driven by price increases exceeding cost inflation, partially offset by unfavorable customer mix. Operating expenses increased in line with the sales increase and were primarily driven by $19 million in incremental growth-related spending on areas such as new sales representatives, e-commerce and advertising.","Let's move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings increased 37% versus the prior year, up 38% in local currency. Strong sales growth, coupled with higher gross profit margins, and positive expense leverage, contributed to operating margins increasing 240 basis points to 12.5%. Gross margins increased 140 basis points, with roughly 2\/3 of the expansion coming from the timing of supplier rebates and advertising credits.","Operating performance for our Other Businesses declined versus a year ago, posting operating earnings of $9 million for the quarter versus $11 million in 2011. Strong performance improvement in Japan and Mexico was partially offset by losses from the acquired businesses in Europe and Brazil, along with losses at some of our startup businesses in developing markets. The operating loss in Europe was primarily driven by lower sales tied to the economy and lower gross margins related to unfavorable customer mix. Contributing to the loss in Europe were adjustments tied to the completion of the purchase price allocation. In Brazil, continued investments in expanding the sales force and product offering contributed to a small operating loss from this newly acquired business.","Below the operating line, interest expense, net of interest income, was $4 million in the 2012 third quarter versus $2 million in the 2011 third quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher average debt outstanding and higher average interest rates in 2012 versus 2011. In addition, interest expense adjustments related to capital leases for the acquired business in Europe also contributed to the increase in 2012.","The effective tax rate for the 2012 third quarter was 37.1% versus 38.7% in 2011. The lower rate was primarily due to higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a lower blended state tax rate. As a reminder, we continue to expect the effective tax rate for the full year 2012 to be in the range of 37.4% to 37.7%.","Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $338 million versus $251 million in 2011. We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $59 million versus $47 million in 2011. We paid dividends of $57 million in the quarter, reflecting the 21% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of this year. In addition, we bought back 421,000 shares of stock for $85 million and ended the quarter with 5.6 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $142 million to shareholders in the quarter.","On July 18, 2012, in our second quarter earnings podcast, we indicated that if economic growth slows and\/or the dollar continues to strengthen, the lower end of our sales range is more probable than the higher end. As reported in our 2012 third quarter earnings release, we slightly lowered and narrowed our 2012 sales guidance to a new range of 11% to 12% growth. At the same time, we reiterated our 2012 earnings per share guidance of $10.50 to $10.80. Let's look more closely at the underlying elements of our current expectations.","First, we are forecasting daily sales growth of 6% to 9% in the fourth quarter. While we gain an extra selling day in the 2012 fourth quarter versus the 2011 quarter, the holiday calendar will be working against us in December. Both Christmas and New Year's Day fall on Tuesdays. So we will be open for business on Monday, December 24, and Monday, December 31, but are forecasting a minimal sales contribution on either day.","Second, our gross profit margin for the fourth quarter should approximate the 43.6% reported for the 2012 third quarter.","Third, we are forecasting strong operating margin expansion in the 2012 fourth quarter as we lap heavy investment spending in the prior year quarter. The absolute level of spending should be on par with growth spending in the 2012 third quarter and relatively small on an incremental basis versus the fourth quarter of 2011.","Fourth, while our business in Canada posted strong performance in the 2012 third quarter, we are forecasting more moderate sales growth and margin expansion in the 2012 fourth quarter. Going forward, we will be investing in the foundational elements of the business, namely supply chain and information technology to support the impressive growth of this $1 billion business. In addition, we'll also begin to invest in growth drivers to accelerate market share gains primarily in Eastern Canada, which represents nearly 70% of the country's market opportunity.","Fifth, the performance of our Other Businesses should continue to be driven primarily by Japan and Mexico. Conversely, we expect both Europe and Brazil to be slightly dilutive in the 2012 fourth quarter.","Sixth, we expect foreign exchange to be a slight headwind on both the top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter.","Finally, our 2012 guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 37.4% to 37.7% for the full year.","In conclusion, we remain confident in our strategy to gain share and extend our leadership position in the large and fragmented MRO market. We will continue to invest in what matters to our customers, more products and services, more sales coverage and enhanced e-commerce capabilities, to provide outstanding customer service. At the same time, we will continue to drive margin expansion by growing our private label program and harvesting productivity through our continuous improvement programs, all with the objective of delivering solid returns to shareholders.","Thank you for your interest in Grainger.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Irene Holman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Irene Holman","Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Q4 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, Senior Vice President and CFO.","As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of the slide presentation and in our Q4 press release which is available on our IR website.","Looking at reported results for the year, we had adjustments resulting in $186 million impact to operating earnings and a $2.97 impact to EPS, adjustments included $139 million of non-cash impairment charges related to the Cromwell business and restructuring primarily related to Canada. This morning's call, we'll focus on adjusted results which exclude the items outlined in our press release.","Now I'll turn it over to D.G. to discuss our 2018 performance. D.G., to you.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks, Irene. Good morning. Thanks all of you for joining us this morning. 2018 was a strong year for Grainger, both in terms of our performance and in building the path for our long-term success. I am extremely proud of our team members and what they accomplished. Across the business, we remained laser-focused on enhancing our relationships with customers, which has put us in a better position to consistently gain share moving forward.","Let's take a look at what we accomplished in 2018. We drove significant share gains across large and midsize customers in the U.S., as our value proposition continue to resonate on more relevant pricing. Our strong sales performance and favorable customer mix help drive gross margin performance that was better than expected for the year, and our diligence in managing costs resulted in significant operating expense leverage.","We continue to enhance the customer experience with the Grainger brand in the U.S. to better search capabilities, best-in-class fulfillment, and by improving the end-to-end customer experience from order to delivery. Feedback from customers has been very strong and improving over the last two years.","In Canada, the structural reset of the business is complete and we exited the year with a profitable fourth quarter. This has been a tough road for our team members in Canada. I want to acknowledge all the work that they and our team members in the U.S. put in to get Canada to profitability. We still have work ahead of us to stabilize volume performance, which I will talk about in a minute.","Our single-channel businesses, mainly MonotaRO and Zoro, continued to drive profitable growth. Daily sales grew 23% for our single-channel model in 2018. For our international businesses, the portfolio performed well and contributed to operating margin expansion in the year. Across the business, we drove strong operating expense leverage. We achieved $130 million in cost savings and productivity, net of digital investments, which was above our target of $80 million to $120 million. For the year, operating expenses grew at half the rate of sales.","Last January, we mentioned our plan to make incremental digital investments to accelerate progress with our offering in the U.S. Since then, we've combined our Gamut and grainger.com capabilities and made incremental investments in digital marketing. We also invested in our Zoro business to build out our endless assortment model.","At our 2016 analysts meeting, we shared 2019 operating margin guidance of 12% to 13%, and we reiterated that target at early 2017 when we announced the acceleration of our pricing actions. We hit that target a year early with operating margin of 12% for the year, and we will build off this momentum moving forward.","Now I want to remind everyone of the 2018 expectations we set for the U.S. business when we announced the acceleration of our move to market-based pricing. We said that we expected to achieve 6% to 8% annual volume growth in both 2018 and 2019 with expected market volume growth of 2% to 3% in each year. We expected price deflation of 2% and gross profit margin to decline approximately 120 basis points in 2018. Our results were better than that.","U.S. volume grew 8% at the high-end of our guide versus U.S. market volume growth of about 3.5%. Price was flat and contributed to GP margin being down only 20 basis points after normalizing for the revenue recognition change.","Price deflation related to the reset was offset by positive customer mix and market-based price increases. More importantly, we are having \u2013 not having to deeply discount infrequently purchased items as customers are more comfortable with our pricing. When I speak with customers and team members, I am hearing that price is no longer the primary part of the conversation, and the focus is squarely on how we can add value and help our customers solve problems.","Our volume performance with both large and midsize customers remained strong throughout 2018. The fourth quarter was our first quarter having fully lapped the pricing changes, and this was our strongest quarter of results to-date on a two-year stack after adjusting for the holiday timing in December, which Tom will address later in this call.","U.S. large customer volume grew 6% in the fourth quarter and 14% on a two-year stack. For the year, our U.S. large volume grew 12% on a two-year stack. U.S. midsize customer volume grew 16% in the fourth quarter and 42% on a two-year stack. For the year, our midsize customers grew 31% on a two-year stack. We are very happy with our performance in the U.S. in 2018.","I want to spend a few minutes reminding everyone of our strategy and performance expectations going forward. Our strategy is to create value for customers through two business models. The first model is the high-touch, high-service model that serves customers with complex needs. Our Grainger U.S., Canada and Mexico businesses plus Cromwell and Fabory all fit within this model.","The second model is the endless assortment model focused on customers with less complex needs, which we sometimes call the single-channel online model. In our high-touch, high-service model, we have three priorities for every business to create more value for our customers.","Our first is to make sure that we have advantaged MRO solutions. That means understanding more about our products and our customers than anyone in building solutions that create value for our customers.","Our second is differentiated sales and services. The battle in our space with complex customers largely occurs at their place of business. Our sellers and our service teams build relationships and provide services that customers value.","And the third is our flawless order-to-cash process. Creating value for our customers means our order-to-cash process has to be the absolute best in our space. We are very strong here, and we have continued to make good progress.","Our fourth priority with our high-touch, high-service model is to continue the turnaround in Canada. While we have made great progress, we have not yet met our expectations. With the cost structure changes behind us, we are now focused on stabilizing volume and driving profitable growth.","Our team is working on expanding our product assortment and building a demand generation engine through improved website functionality, effective digital marketing and a high performing sales and services team. This is an attractive market where we are one of the largest players. Our long-term goal remains to achieve double-digit operating margin and consistent share gain for this business.","In terms of the endless assortment model, we have several priorities. Given the success of our Zoro business coupled with our learnings from MonotaRO, we have made the decision to invest in Zoro to accelerate their product expansion efforts. This means investments in systems and people.","In addition, we are leveraging our knowledge of MonotaRO to improve our marketing and analytics capability in our Zoro U.S. operation. These two changes will require some incremental investment in 2019 that will lower margins in the Zoro business. We are confident that these investments will improve both our growth rate and margins for Zoro in the next several years.","Now executing against these priorities will put us in a position to accomplish the following in 2019 and beyond. We expect U.S. revenue to grow 300 basis points to 400 basis points faster than the market. We expect Canada volume to stabilize in 2019 and for profitable growth to follow up. We expect accelerated growth of the endless assortment model. We expect continued strong operating expense leverage, and the company expects to have operating margin expansion in 2019.","Now I'll turn it over to Tom for detail on our 2018 performance and our 2019 guidance.","Thomas Okray","Thanks, D.G. I'll start with a recap of our 2018 total company-adjusted results then move to the fourth quarter results by segment. For the full-year, revenue was up 8%, 7% on a daily basis driven entirely by volume.","Our normalized gross profit rate was down 20 basis points versus the prior year after adjusting for revenue recognition consistent with the U.S. businesses. We continue to realize operating expense leverage on higher volume. For the full-year, operating expenses normalized for revenue recognition grew 3% on 8% revenue growth.","Our strong sales growth, gross margin performance, and diligence in driving operating expense leverage resulted in incremental margin of 25%, operating earnings growth of 17%, and then operating margin of 12%, which is 100 basis points higher than the prior year. EPS grew 46% for the year. We generated operating cash flow of $1.1 billion, representing a 110% of net earnings after adjusting for the non-cash impairments for the Cromwell business.","This result was flat to the prior year as positive earnings were offset by higher working capital, primarily driven by the timing of trade and other payables which we do not expect to repeat and the investment in inventory, including some opportunistic pre-buys. In addition, we returned $741 million in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Looking at the quarter, sales increased 5% including a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 6%, 4% on a daily basis. Sales were comprised of volume growth of 4% and price inflation of 1%, partially offset by a 1% impact for holiday timing.","Our normalized gross profit margin was down 20 basis points as margin growth in the U.S. and Canada was more than offset by gross profit declines in our other businesses, driven primarily by Cromwell and freight increases in Japan.","Operating expenses normalized for revenue recognition increased 3%. The increase was driven by three factors. First, incremental digital investments including website enhancements and marketing spend for our U.S. business as well as investments in the growth of our Zoro business; second, incentive compensation versus the prior year reflecting our strong performance in 2018; and third, expenses which were one-time in nature and are not expected to repeat.","Overall, operating earnings were up 10% resulting in operating margin of 11.2%, which is up 50 basis points from the prior year. Earnings per share increased 35% in the quarter versus the prior year due to strong operating performance in a lower tax rate.","Looking at our other segment results. I'll start with our other businesses, which include our single-channel online model and our international businesses. Sales were up 11% on a constant currency basis due primarily to volume. Operating earnings increased 28% for the quarter with a 70 basis point improvement in operating margin.","In Canada, we finished the quarter profitably. Something we haven't been able to say for the past 11 quarters, sales were down 25% on a daily basis and down 22% daily in constant currency. We've made a lot of changes in a short period of time to improve the business and that has impacted volume more than we expected. The volume decline was offset by 8% price inflation.","Moving to profit, our gross margin was up 160 basis points versus the prior year after normalizing for revenue recognition. Price inflation and lower freight were partially offset by product cost inflation and lapping favorable inventory adjustments in 2017 fourth quarter. Operating earnings increased 134% versus prior year. Operating margin improved 330 basis points driven by the initiatives from our turnaround plan.","In the U.S., sales grew 6%, 5% on a daily basis and 6% after normalizing for holiday timing. In 2018, Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve fell on a Monday versus on a Sunday in 2017. We were open for business both days to serve our customers. However, revenue on those days was significantly lower than normal. That lower revenue effectively offset the benefit of the additional sales day.","Excluding holiday timing, it was our strongest quarter on a two-year stack since announcing the pricing reset. We feel good about our sales momentum heading into 2019. Gross profit margin was up 20 basis points after normalizing for revenue recognition. As price inflation outpaced cost inflation in the quarter, higher supplier rebates on strong volume performance also contributed to favorable GP rate in the quarter.","Operating expenses in the U.S. were up 8% after normalizing for revenue recognition in one additional payroll day. For the year, after normalizing for revenue recognition, operating expenses grew 5% and 8% revenue growth, providing significant operating leverage. However, there was some lumpiness throughout the year.","In the quarter the lumpiness related to three main factors. First, we made planned incremental digital investments in the U.S. Second, we had higher incentive compensation versus the prior year reflecting strong performance in 2018. And the third piece was related to items that we do not expect to recur. Overall, operating earnings grew 5%, resulting in a 14.6% operating margin for the U.S., which was down 20 basis points in the quarter.","Moving to our cost takeout and productivity targets, everything we do is focused on delivering value to our customers in the most efficient and effective way possible. Our goal was to drive $150 million to $210 million of cost savings and productivity, net of digital investments over a two-year period. In 2018, we achieved cost savings of $130 million and are now more than halfway to our two-year target.","In the U.S. we realized $70 million in savings driven by a handful of items, including sales productivity from increased revenue per seller and onsite service efficiencies. Supply chain productivity as we practice continuous improvement in our DCs and completing the context center consolidation.","For Canada, we realized $45 million in savings related to our turnaround efforts. And for our other businesses, we realized $15 million in savings, primarily related to closure of unprofitable businesses.","Our 2019 cost takeout target is to achieve $65 million to $85 million in savings. Improving our cost structure has been and continues to be an important part of driving profitable growth in the future. We're confident in our ability to achieve our 2019 target.","To recap 2018, our performance was strong throughout the year. We gained share, profitably, beat our expectations on operating margin and earnings per share, and achieved our 2019 operating margin target a year early.","Now let's take a look at 2019 guidance. As a reminder, we changed our guidance philosophy in 2018. We now set guidance in January and plan to update it, if we expect to be materially outside the range. In 2019, we expect to deliver the following for the total company, 4% to 8.5% sales growth driven by continued share gains for the U.S. segment and the single channel businesses.","Total company gross margin is expected to be down 60 basis points to flat versus the prior year. This is due to the timing of our contract pricing, negotiations and freight headwinds partially offset by price increases and customer mix.","Operating margin is expected to improve 20 basis points to 100 basis points driven by strong sales growth and continued expense leverage. We\u2019re investing in the areas that matter most to our customers. This includes incremental digital investments in the U.S. segment and investments to accelerate growth with Zoro. Our goal is to drive 2019 incremental margin of 20% to 25%.","Finally, we expect earnings per share growth of 2% to 12%. We expect to have a higher tax rate in 2019 versus the prior year due to the wind down of our clean energy investment at the end of 2018.","As a result, there will be no EPS benefit due to clean energy in 2019. We have also not assumed any stock-based compensation impact to the tax rate in 2019, which helps the tax rate in 2018.","Moving to our segment level projections for 2019, in the U.S. segment, we expect operating margin of 15.5% to 16.1% driven by expense leverage on strong sales growth, partially offset by gross profit margin headwinds.","U.S. revenue growth is expected to be driven by customer acquisition and increasing share of wallet. We continue to expect this business to grow 300 basis points to 400 basis points faster than the market with expected market growth of approximately 1% to 4%, which includes 1% of price.","Moving to gross profit margin, U.S. GP rate is expected to be down slightly to flat, due to a few factors. First, we expect to pass through both general and tariff for related cost inflation. In an inflationary environment, we feel confident in our ability to pass-through price.","Second, increased freight costs. We have strategic partnerships with freight carriers that significantly mitigated our exposure to increases in 2018. We continue to effectively manage freight costs and expect 2019 freight increases to be materially less than the market.","Finally, we will complete the contract negotiations related to the pricing reset in 2019. We have approximately 10% of large contract revenue to go. In Canada, we expect operating margin of 1% to 5%. Our 2018 volume performance was below expectations. And as a result, our operating margin guide for 2019 is slightly lower than our original target.","As D.G. mentioned, most of the cost structure initiatives are behind us and we are now focused on stabilizing volume and driving profitable growth. Our 2019 actions will include expanding our product assortment, including leveraging the U.S. assortment where it makes sense.","Improving our digital capabilities, including website functionality and online marketing, and building a high performing sales and service team, Canada is an attractive market for Grainger and we're committed to getting this business to long-term profitable growth.","For other businesses, we expect 6% to 8% operating margin, single channel businesses operating margin growth is expected to slow due to investments in product expansion and technology to support the growth of our endless and assortment model. As we commented earlier, we're confident these investments will improve both our growth rate and margins for Zoro over the next several years.","On Slide 20, we outlined our cash flow projection. In 2018 we generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow. In 2019, we expect operating cash flow to be between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion driven by strong earnings growth and working capital improvements.","We plan to use $300 million to $350 million of our cash to reinvest in the business. This includes investment in a DC to support the growth of MonotaRO. We will also make investments to support the growth of our Zoro business, improve our IT infrastructure, and enhance our U.S. distribution center network.","Development of our Louisville, DC is progressing as planned and we are on track to start outbound shipping in early 2020. We expect to use $450 million to $600 million for share repurchases, which reflects confidence in our strategy going forward. The remainder will be used for dividends.","Now I'll turn it back to D.G. for closing remarks.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks, Tom. We are very pleased with our performance in 2018. More importantly, we are excited about the actions we've taken to position us for success moving forward. We look forward to maintaining this momentum in 2019 and beyond.","Now we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Merkel","Great. Thanks. So first of all, U.S. EBIT margin guidance for 2019, up 10 basis points at the midpoint. I guess two-part question. First, just to clarify your thinking about flat gross margins, and then, it is offset by investment. Is that why there's not more margin expansion? And then, well, I'll let you answer that then I\u2019ll ask the second part.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks, Ryan. This is D.G. So a couple things. One is on the gross profit line. Our expectation is that we will be down 60 basis points to flat for the year. There's a couple things going on there. One is, we talked about being roughly flat in 2019 before. What has happened is some of our contracts have not actually been implemented yet, so we got some benefit in 2018 and that benefit will turn into a slight negative in 2019.","So at the midpoint, we're slightly down. We still expect to get strong operating leverage in the year. We are making some additional investments in digital capability certainly, but we still expect to get strong operating leverage and slightly down GP at the midpoint and that's because of that contract timing.","Ryan Merkel","Okay, got it. All right. And then are we through some of these one-off items, sticking with U.S. EBIT margin in the fourth quarter? I guess what I'm asking is once we get into first quarter 2019, does year-over-year operating margins in the U.S. start to expand again? Or is this something that might be more of a second half progression?","Thomas Okray","Yes. Let me take this. This is Tom. As we alluded to in our prepared remarks, there's three main items there. Let me give you a little bit more granularity to help you size that. For the U.S. segment in Q4, SG&A expenses grew 6%. We said 5%. That's related to the additional payday.","If you normalize for three buckets, which is variable compensation, the additional payroll day and items that aren't expected to recur, the 6% increase actually goes to flat or 9% associated with revenue recognition, goes to a 3% increase. This clearly had a material impact on our Q4 U.S. segment on the operating margin, and we don't expect this profile to be representative going forward.","Ryan Merkel","Got it. Okay. That's helpful.","Donald Macpherson","Who's next?","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","David Manthey","Thank you. Dramatic pause there. Hi, guys, good morning. First off, as it relates to your outlook, it appears to contemplate something of a soft landing. Could you just talk about the 1% to 4% market growth? What of that do you assume is price versus volume for the market? And then are you assuming that Grainger is going to be in the same ballpark of maybe a low single-digit growth rate of price?","Donald Macpherson","Yes. So we have 1% price in there. We have volume of 0% to 3%. We would expect to be somewhere in that ballpark generally. So yes, that's what we've embedded in there. And it is a bit of a soft landing. We don't have any. We've got the same economic advisors that everybody else does and so we're hearing the same things you are. So that's where we're at right now.","David Manthey","Okay. Sounds good, D.G. And then on these investments in the digital in the Other Businesses, including Zoro, could you talk about the nature of those investments? What broadly, what type of investments those are? And then if you could talk about maybe by how much those investments depressed the EBIT margin forecast that you've given us?","Donald Macpherson","Sure. So the investments are largely \u2013 if you think about our business in MonotaRO which has been so successful. They now have 20 million items on their website and we are making investments in Zoro to be able to expand our offering dramatically over the next several years. Those investments are in systems and people to make sure that we can be successful in doing that.","We're also investing in analytics capabilities and marketing capabilities and really taking the lessons we've learned from MonotaRO to go ahead and push that. Those investments are significant for Zoro. The business will remain profitable through the transition and most of those investments will be done by the end of the year. So we should be in better shape going into 2020 from a margin perspective, but we expect several hundred basis points or more to be down relative to where we were this year.","David Manthey","Sounds good. Thank you.","Donald Macpherson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Glynn","Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to ask a little bit about the sequential momentum and the medium strategy. In terms of your path to get back above 5% share long-term, obviously good momentum right now. Wondering if there are any market penetration levers that are just getting started there and how that compounding sensitivity is shaping up? You're introducing new levers at Zoro, sounds interesting. How would you describe how you sustain the compounding at the medium?","Donald Macpherson","Sure. So with midsize customers, and we've talked about some of this before. We've seen growth both with existing customers. We've reengaged some last customers and we've acquired new customers. I would say the new customer acquisition has been very solid over the last quarter, and we expect that to continue. So most of that is acquiring new customers digitally and then getting \u2013 building a relationship with those customers.","We still have a fairly small customer file with midsize customers relative to the entire universe. So with the Grainger brand, midsize customers, we expect consistent strong growth over the next couple of years at a minimum. And a lot of that's going to be new customer acquisition in addition to some of the existing customer growth.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. Great. And I just want to get a better understanding of the impact of the contract negotiations on U.S. gross margin outlook because the U.S. large revenue base about 80% of the segment and you're talking about 10% of those, so maybe 8% of the U.S. segment. It doesn't seem like that approach is the magnitude of mix that would have such a pronounced impact on your gross margin outlook given volume and mix should be good guys?","Donald Macpherson","Yes. So it actually does approach the number that we're talking about, if \u2013 that's going to be in the 10s of basis points of impact for next year. So if we're down 60 to flat if that were not the case, we\u2019d be sort of centered \u2013 much closer to zero for next year. So that's the impact and a lot of this is just implementation of contracts that are already signed. And in particular, one very, very large contract that that still needs to be implemented fully.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. Thank you.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Volkmann","Hi, good morning. I wonder if we could go back to the midsize sort of large customer breakdown and obviously the midsize growing a lot faster, great to see that. I assume that has some positive margin implications and I'm curious if you could ballpark sort of how much tailwind that gives you and then sort of what's offsetting that to leave us with sort of flat to down and gross margin?","Donald Macpherson","Yes, I mean like we said it's an impact. It's certainly 10 basis points to 20 basis points roughly have an impact in terms of mix that we've seen if we continue to grow midsize customers much faster than large. So it's a small impact, but a real one.","Stephen Volkmann","Okay. All right, that's helpful. Thanks. And then just with respect to \u2013 I think you laid in a little bit of extra inventory and I'm curious if that benefits maybe the first half of 2019, I'm sort of a price cost basis?","Thomas Okray","Yes. We added inventory as you saw including some opportunistic pre-buys that we made in Q4, preparing us for what we expect to be strong growth in 2019.","Stephen Volkmann","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie Group. Please proceed with your question.","Mario Cortellacci","Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Actually, just kind of hitting on the medium customers again. I mean, could you walk us through what kind of market share you think you guys could get in the medium customers? And maybe you could talk about how your go-to-market or your sales strategy is different from that of large customers or maybe it's the same?","Donald Macpherson","No, it's fairly significantly different. So we have less than 2% market share today. At our peak, we had significantly more than that. Without contemplating a specific number, we know we've got a lot of runway with midsize customers.","In terms of how we go-to-market, we acquire customers typically digitally with the midsized customer group. We then develop a relationship in some cases that will stay digital and some cases that becomes an inside seller relationship where there will be someone on the phone that talks to them on a consistent basis.","We provide significant technical product support to that group, which is a big value to that group. And what we find is that those customers really value what Grainger has to offer the technical product support, the products themselves and the quality of the products, and the fulfillment all mean a whole lot to that that midsize customer group. So we're seeing great response as we acquire new customers and build those relationships.","Mario Cortellacci","Great. And just a quick follow-up. I mean, could you talk about, I guess, how you guys differ from Amazon industrial supply in your distribution or your products or even your service levels, and maybe where you guys bump up with them head-to-head and \u2013 just competition-wise?","Donald Macpherson","So I'm assuming you're talking about Amazon business, is that\u2026?","Mario Cortellacci","Yes.","Donald Macpherson","Yes. Okay. Yes, so I would say that we are skewed a very much more industrial. We developed personal relationships with customers. We provide services with customers. We provide onsite services with customers. We have sellers. Our fulfillment is designed to make sure that we get complete orders to customers next day.","So our buildings are completely different design. I would say on almost every dimension we are different. And so without going into too much detail on the call, we've built our machine to be able to really be very attractive to industrial businesses and that's our customer base and that's what we're trying to gauge here with.","Mario Cortellacci","Gotcha. Thank you so much.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Patrick Baumann with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. ","Patrick Baumann","Hey guys, thanks for taking my call. I just had a couple of questions here. First one is just an SG&A growth. The profile for 2019 sounds pretty similar to what you did in 2018? Just curious as you look beyond 2019, what this might look like on more of a normalized basis after you're through with all your costs savings plans?","Donald Macpherson","So I would just say that we have \u2013 we think built a muscle in a process to make sure that we're very disciplined with SG&A going forward. Our expectation is that we will continue to get SG&A leverage to 2020 and beyond.","So without talking about specific numbers, our expectation is that the process we built, the way we look at our expenses, the way we drive improvement throughout the business, efficiency and effectiveness will continue to do to perform well going forward.","Patrick Baumann","Okay. On Zoro, what did the business grow in the quarter and for the year? And just curious if you could provide some context on what's driving the change in kind of the assortment strategy there? Is the growth kind of slowing down a little bit? Or you guys just\u2026","Donald Macpherson","Yes. The Zoro business continued to grow very, very strongly throughout the year. If you look at the history of our business in Japan, about this time in the history, they really stepped on the accelerator with the assortment strategy, and we're at the point now where creating some real differentiation with the Zoro business in the marketplace. We think is important and we think we've got an opportunity to do that based on what we've learned. And so we're investing for the future. It doesn't mean that have seen slower growth at Zoro at this point.","Patrick Baumann","Got it. And then last one just really quick on restructuring expense for 2019, do you guys expect you\u2019re restructuring? I haven\u2019t seen anything on the slides here or the press release?","Donald Macpherson","Yes. We expect our restructuring expenses obviously to go down with most of the heavy lifting in U.S. and in Canada behind us, so it will be significantly less than we've seen in the past couple of years.","Patrick Baumann","Okay. Thanks. Good luck guys.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks.","Thomas Okray","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Barry with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Barry","Hey guys. Good morning.","Donald Macpherson","Good morning.","Thomas Okray","Good morning.","Robert Barry","I apologize, I was dropped from the call for the first couple of questions, so if you touched on this already, we can skip it. But did you talk about what you've assumed in the guide vis-\u00e0-vis the tariffs versus what you outlined at 3Q? Any change there?","Thomas Okray","No change at all. And just to clarify our contemplation in the guide, assume the 10% tariff being at 25%, so that's already included in the guide.","Robert Barry","Got it. So if it stays at 10% and there'd be some upside there, I guess?","Thomas Okray","Correct.","Donald Macpherson","Yes.","Robert Barry","Got it. And then just wanted to follow-up on the question about \u2013 I think there was a question about the U.S. operating margin. I think it's implied about flattish, is that right? And I'm just curious what's driving that especially because it sounds like you'll be lapping some headwinds in 3Q and 4Q that seemed to be non-recurring?","Thomas Okray","You're referring to the guide for 2019 for the U.S. segment?","Robert Barry","Yes, the 15.5% to 16.1%, I think it came in at 15.7% for the year.","Thomas Okray","Yes. Sure. As D.G. mentioned earlier, maybe you had dropped off the call. Our GP, we expect to be flat to minus 60 down and with the big impact there being freight as well as the contracts, which still have to be closed for this year are implemented for this year.","So yes, we've got opportunity on the high-end to grow 100 bps in terms of operating margin, but we're being prudent on the low-end given the uncertainty we see in terms of the freight issues as well as the overall economic environment.","Robert Barry","Got it. Just finally, what is the messaging on the end market demand in your momentum? I mean the 4% adjusted in December, it looks like a deceleration and I think the 4Q overall is the deceleration versus recent quarters. Just any color on what you're seeing out there from the demand perspective? Thanks.","Donald Macpherson","Yes. I'd point to a couple of things. One is, certainly the market growth was still reasonably strong in the fourth quarter, a little less than it was in Q2 and Q3 it appears. That's said, we think our performance was very similar on a comparison basis to the market in the fourth quarter.","We talked a little bit about the last week of the year being very slow. But fortunately people showed up, back up to work to start the year. And so our expectation is that there's going to be very modest growth at this point. That's our expectation and we will continue to gain share at a similar pace to what we've done.","Robert Barry","Got it. Thank you.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good Morning. D.G., could you maybe just kind of go back to your comments on tariffs, because you expressed confidence in your ability to price through both inflation and tabs. So if we end up with a 10% or 0% on less 3% compared to 25 in your plan. Should we assume that's a wash with pricing a little less than you would otherwise have gone with?","Donald Macpherson","Nigel, I think your question is what happen is with the tariffs stay at \u2013 go back to 10%. Is that your question?","Nigel Coe","Yes. And then what pricing not be as great as it would have otherwise have been?","Donald Macpherson","Over time that would be the case, I mean typically when if that were to happen there would be some legs. So there might be some benefit during that light period is what we typically have seen historically, but generally our philosophy is we want to make sure we're pricing to market and getting the best cost we can. And so presumably the market price would adjust adjusted some point in the future as well.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And then I hate to ask the obvious question, but can you maybe just touch on your government sales obviously still very strong through 4Q, but with the shutdown, how would that tracking maybe just remind us in terms of your exposure to state versus federal and the proportion of sales.","Donald Macpherson","Yes, great. So we're about 70% stay local about 30% federal. The federal business for us tends to SKU industrial and by that we mean things like the military. Some of those are funded. So far I would say the impact on us has been certainly it's calculable, but not big. It's a small impact for us right now.","I would say, we get a little more concerned if the shutdown goes longer because it has knock on effects to other things. But for us the shutdown in its current form, we don't have huge volume with customers that are shutdown right now. So it's a pretty small impact on us so far. That's it. Obviously if it goes longer we get, we get concerned about some other things.","Nigel Coe","And then total governments about 14% of your sales","Donald Macpherson","Yes. That's about right.","Nigel Coe","Great. Thank you.","Donald Macpherson","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Dankert","Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question here.","Donald Macpherson","Good morning.","Christopher Dankert","I guess just to take another slice at medium, kind of what gives you confidence in maintaining it looks like medium \u2013 mid-teens growth in that business. I mean is \u2013 anything you could share with us, whether it's your number of new customer acquisitions, new users\u2019 size? Any other metrics we can see as far as giving you confidence in maintaining that growth rate?","Donald Macpherson","Yes. We haven't shared this specific. I would say that the new customer acquisition rate gives us confidence. I would say that that the lapse customer return rate continues to be strong. We continue to get customers who have been customers before. And just our numbers through the fourth quarter give us confidence that there's still a lot of momentum to go as we've lapped the price decreases.","Christopher Dankert","Got it, got it. And then thinking about productivity and cost savings beyond 2019 here, obviously you already commented on Zoro in the single channel kind of getting a little bit improvement from lower investment. I guess any other way of think about normalized incremental margins for the U.S. or the other businesses here?","Donald Macpherson","I'm sorry. You're talking about in 2019 or beyond 2019?","Christopher Dankert","Beyond, once we kind a get the cost cuts.","Donald Macpherson","Yes. So our expectation has been that we will grow expenses and about half the rate we grow sales in that that's been kind of our expectation. We don't see anything that would change that at this point going forward. We still feel like we've got a lot of opportunity to improve our cost structure go forward.","Christopher Dankert","Understood. Thanks guys.","Donald Macpherson","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Evelyn Chow with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Evelyn Chow","Good morning, guys. I wanted to touch on Canada for a moment. I know Tom when we met back in November. You had said there's some potential green shoots in the volume inflection in that business. Could you just give us an update on what you're seeing on the ground and how the market is progressing and any line of sight you have into your own inflection?","Thomas Okray","Just to clarify, we had a really hard reset of that business. I think when you look at the cost, takeout numbers, they're bigger than we had talked about taking and as we got into it, we felt like we needed to reset, pretty much everything, everything in the business. That has had a fairly significant impact on volume in the business.","We are now doing some things to improve the customer experience that we think are going to help us grow going forward, adding products to the assortment. Again, we're training our sellers and really working on getting a high performing sales and services team in that business.","Our fulfillment performance is actually pretty good. We're hearing from customers\u2019 that is pretty good and we're starting to see a few wins for the first time in a long time. There, I think what we're starting to get some volume. Now it's going to take a while. The reality is this was a very hard reset and that's why we're backing off of the margin targets for 2019 because it's going to take a little bit longer than we had hoped. It's been a very complicated and challenging process.","I would say we're still confident in the underlying market. The market has been performing reasonably well. We have a business that\u2019s sort of separate out there that we know has been performing reasonably well, so the market has been growing, and most of this has been us resetting that business.","Evelyn Chow","That makes sense. And then thanks for framing the gross margin guidance with your comments and contract negotiations and tariffs. It sounds like freight is the other big piece of that, so any sense of the magnitude that's baked into the guide currently?","Donald Macpherson","Well, obviously freight market has been tight. I think I make a lot of the uncertainty on where we land probably is freight going into the year, whether or not that market stays is tighter, gets tighter or gets looser. It builds in some of the uncertainty. We feel like we are effectively managing freight. We feel like we've got a really good process to improve both our operational freight costs, and our overall freight cost. So I would say its modest impact, but it is an impact.","Evelyn Chow","Thank you, guys.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Cieslak with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Cieslak","Hey, good morning, guys. My first question, I think you'd mentioned that supplier rebates had a positive impact on your gross margins within the U.S. business in 2018. Is there any way you could maybe quantify that or provide some directional color of how much of an impact that was. And then what is the 2019 guidance for your gross margins in the U.S. segment assume for the supplier, rebate dynamics, certainly relative to what you guys saw in 2018?","Donald Macpherson","So our supplier rebates are largely based on volume. We don't disclose how much of what the magnitude of those are. And I would say their supplier rebates for 2019 bake in, an assumption around our volume, which you see in there. So they're linked to the revenue expectations for the business.","Ryan Cieslak","Is it fair to say D.G., though that the supplier rebate benefit is smaller than what you saw in 2018?","Donald Macpherson","To the extent that our volume is slightly smaller, that would be fair to say.","Ryan Cieslak","And then when you think about the ability to maintain the medium size customer growth, I know this question was asked a couple of different ways, but is there anything specific that you guys are going to do differently this year as it relates to digital actions or some sort of investments that you're making that would potentially be a catalyst or recapitalize sort of where the level is? Or are you saying basically you're seeing good momentum and you expect that momentum to continue here into 2019?","Donald Macpherson","I think it's both. We're seeing good momentum and we're actually increasing our digital investments to acquire more customers. So we are doing, but that's part of the digital investment that Tom talked about earlier.","Ryan Cieslak","Okay. Appreciate it guys.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Donald Macpherson","Good morning.","Deane Dray","I just want to make sure I understand how you could get to the higher end of your 2019 sales guidance. Just from what I see you coming out of the fourth quarter, exit rate is a bit softer. You're baking in some soft landing assumptions here. Maybe we'll see how long the government shutdown pinches you, at least for the first quarter. But based upon that, where do you get an acceleration of growth? And might you have to go and consider further price cuts?","Donald Macpherson","Well, first of all, let me adjust the price cut issue first. Our prices are competitive from a market base perspective, so that \u2013 no is the answer to that question. Our perspective is we don't actually see a shift in the share gain we have. So the way you think about it is if the market growth rate is at the top end of what we're saying, then we feel like we will be at the top end of that that revenue perspective.","And so there's all kinds of opinions out there about what happens with market activity. Some of them actually have a little bit of a slowdown now and acceleration later. I don't know whether any of that's true, but certainly there are projections out there that are at the top end of our range. If that comes through, then we will be the top end of our sales range.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then for Tom, just some color around the tax for the fourth quarter, a lot lower. We've heard some companies discuss further clarity on tax reform? Was there any dynamic there? And what was it that drove the decision to exit your clean energy tax program?","Thomas Okray","Yes. I mean, first of all on the tax rate, if you put in the stock-based compensation, then that puts us squarely at the low-end of our guide. So that's the story on that. In terms of exiting the clean energy, it was a nice $0.09 per share pickup for this year and just made the decision that we're going to conclude it.","Deane Dray","So that was at your discretion it's not that the program went away.","Thomas Okray","That's correct.","Deane Dray","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Justin Bergner with Gabelli and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Bergner","Good morning, D.G. Good morning, Tom.","Thomas Okray","Good morning.","Justin Bergner","As you look at sort of your outgrowth going forward and I realized only guiding to 2019 today, but just generally speaking, is it going to shift more towards medium customers driving your outgrowth? I know that large customers have also been a strong contributor, but as meaning customers become a larger base, is that going to become a larger contributor to your outgrowth? Or is it going to stay large contribution as well?","Donald Macpherson","Over the next several years, we expect midsize customers to go faster than large, but we expect the dollar impact of large customer growth to be much higher given that the base of large customer revenue. So we don't feel like we are close to maxed out with any customer segment. We feel like we have strong opportunity really with our customer groups, but we would expect the percentage growth with midsize customers to be higher this year, next year, probably for the next three years at a minimum.","Justin Bergner","Okay. Thank you. And then I'm surprised that price is only modeled or expected to be 100 basis points. I mean, help me understand why all sort of the inflationary and tariff headwinds don't require greater than 1% price to sort of keep up with cost pressures? ","Thomas Okray","Yes. Just to clarify, in the 1% to 4% market growth, we've got 1% is assumed in that, so it'd be 0% to 3% in terms of volume. With respect to our own range in our guide, we've got 1% to 2%.","Justin Bergner","Okay. That makes sense. Thank you.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Graham","Hey, good morning.","Donald Macpherson","Good morning.","Scott Graham","Similar to \u2013 I think it was a question at the top about the 2019 guidance range for the U.S. I guess, I was expecting to hear a tinge of conservatism, and I don't think I'm hearing that from you all. And if I'm wrong in that, please let me know. And by extension, that does mean that the Other Businesses, that goal of 6% to 8% with a midpoint of 7%, that's roughly 100 basis points on a 6% margin from 2018 is a pretty big needle move on a business whose margins have really not moved even though we've kind of targeted higher.","So it does seem that if in fact, the U.S. margin range is kind of going to be what it's going to be, that there's a lot of reliance in an area where we haven't seen a lot of success in reaching to a higher level of margin. Can you maybe give us what the drivers are behind that business to give us some comfort on that?","Donald Macpherson","Sure. So just to be clear, we have seen pretty significant margin expansion in our other category over the last couple of years. And what gives us more confidence as we've actually closed some unprofitable businesses. That portfolio is now much more squarely the tune to the online model and the margins there are much higher than that 6% in aggregate.","So as we go forward, we would expect to have continued margin expansion even with the investments in Zoro that we're going to make largely just the math of having a much stronger portfolio at this point. So we expect that. I would also say, we do expect slight margin expansion in the U.S., although it's modest at least for the guide.","Scott Graham","Okay. We are talking to the as reported 6%, right? Not the sort of stripped down version, right?","Donald Macpherson","I\u2019m not sure. Scott, I\u2019m not sure.","Scott Graham","In other words, the business is \u2013 I think you were referring \u2013 they're through your other, your inter segment, you run some things that could potentially change the dynamic of the Other Businesses margin. We are talking about the Other Businesses margin as reported, right?","Donald Macpherson","Sure, yes. Absolutely, absolutely we are. Yes.","Scott Graham","Okay. Secondly, I know it was some time ago that you set forth your 2019 margin goals. Any reason why now that we're in 2019, we don't maybe take a look at a couple of years and kind of go to higher aspirations?","Donald Macpherson","Well, I mean I would assume that we have higher aspirations. We have not \u2013 right now we're just talking about 2019. If we decide to put out margin guidance going forward, we would do that separately. But yes, I mean obviously we don't \u2013 we're not saying that we're going to stop.","Scott Graham","No. For sure, I would definitely be hearing that message. Last question is this, the slowdown that we maybe saw in the fourth quarter, could you maybe give us a little bit of a feel for the tone of business in January so far?","Donald Macpherson","Well, like I said, I mean it was \u2013 we're happy to see that people came back to work in January and we feel good about our ability to gain share in any market. There's obviously a lot of uncertainty. Most of that is uncertainty around things that we don't control and I don't think we know where to land. I would say that the fourth quarter up until sort of the last week of December, things were very, very, very good. And so the slowdown was a very, very short period of time. And so we were looking to see if people came back to work, and they did, which is good.","Scott Graham","Understood. Thanks.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.","John Inch","D.G., I want to ask you just about the national accounts. If you go back prior to your pricing initiatives, they would traditionally drag gross margins, and I'm curious if we were to normalize for these contracts sort of implementation the 10%, are they still relatively dragging year-over-year on the trend? Or are they flat, up? Like what's going on there?","Donald Macpherson","So are you asking about \u2013 I think you're asking the question on national account. Are their GPs flat year-over-year? Or are you talking about their impact on the company's GP?","John Inch","Yes. Are they flat year-over-year? And just \u2013 I guess if were to normalize for the contracts\u2026","Donald Macpherson","Yes. With the exception of the contract resets that we've talked about, the answer is, yes. They're pretty stable.","John Inch","They are pretty stable. Okay.","Donald Macpherson","Yes.","John Inch","And that's a change right, from what\u2026","Donald Macpherson","Yes. It is actually post reset. What we've seen with all of our large customers is a bit of an opportunity to simplify pricing. They're more willing to buy spot-buys at the prices that they see because they're competitive, and so that\u2019s simplifying things as well.","John Inch","Okay. The other question I had is, it goes back to tariffs. If the tariffs are rolled back or we actually achieve a trade deal, I mean what actually happens to pricing? Does pricing have to get reversed? And how do you \u2013 look, how do you guys think about this dynamic over the next few months?","Donald Macpherson","Well, so for us we actually separate price cost in terms of how we think about it. We're pricing to the market, and we try to get the best cost we can. I think I mentioned this before, typically when there's been things like that that have happened, price will change, but there maybe some lag. So there might be some period where you have some short-term benefit. Ultimately you would expect if tariffs will roll back, that prices would eventually sort of moderate. But typically we get some period of benefit then.","John Inch","You mean, in Grainger prices moderate, so you would actually have to take your list prices down? Is that \u2013 or your contract pricing down or whatever?","Donald Macpherson","Well, so over time the market price will change, and we will be aligned in the market price.","John Inch","Understood. Just lastly, your Zoro investments, I think you said that you were expanding your SKUs. What are the SKUs now? And how much do they expand? And I'm curious, is there an impact if Zoro gets bigger with respect to potentially cannibalizing medium accounts or do you really think they can sort of stick to discrete tracks?","Donald Macpherson","Yes. They're pretty discrete today. There is very little cannibalization. Actually, today, there's several million SKUs that Zoro has. We will go to double-digit million SKUs eventually. Doing that actually creates a little bit more differentiation between a Grainger model, which is very industrial, very MRO-focused versus what Zoro has. And we feel that that will actually mitigate cannibalization to some degree as well. But obviously there's some, but it's very minimal today.","John Inch","Got it. Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Donald Macpherson","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back to D.G. Macpherson for closing comments.","Donald Macpherson","All right. Thanks everyone again for joining us. I would just reiterate a couple of points. One is we're very happy with the performance that we had in 2018. I think we've focused on the right things. Our results were strong and we've got a lot of momentum heading into the future. So I really appreciate all your time, and I hope you are off to a great new year. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

Welcome to the W.W. Grainger Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded.","I would now turn the conference over to our host, Irene Holman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Irene Holman","Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's fourth earnings and full-year 2019 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, SVP and CFO.","As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures with their corresponding GAAP measures are found in the tables of the end of the slide presentation and in our Q4 press release, both of which are available on our IR website.","This morning's call will focus on adjusted results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2019 which exclude restructuring and other items that are outlined in our earnings press release.","Now I will turn it over to DG.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks Irene. Good morning. Thank you for joining us.","On today\u2019s call, I will talk about our 2019 performance and key accomplishments and discuss our growth priorities for 2020. Tom will then cover our financial performance for the quarter and the year in detail as well as our 2020 guidance.","Late last year, we introduced our team members to the Grainger Edge, our new strategic framework that defines who we are, why we exist, and how we work together to achieve our objectives. At Grainger, our purpose is to keep the world working. Whether that means helping a hospital focus on patient care, a manufacturing plant focus on building great products, or school focus on teaching. The work we do in the background helps keep facilities running, so our customers can focus on what they do best. It's a purpose that we\u2019re all very proud of as an organization.","The framework also outlines a set of principles that define the behaviors we expect from our team members working with each other, our customers and our supplier partners. We are holding ourselves accountable to these principles and believe they will help us execute our strategy and create value for our shareholders. These are not just words on a page. We\u2019re committed to making these principles come to life in everything that we do.","The Grainger Edge provides a foundational framework for our strategies we work to consistently serve our customers and gain share. We gain share through two distinct business models that allow us to leverage our scale and supply chain to support customers with different needs.","Our high-touch solutions model serves customers that have complex needs and are looking for more tailored solutions. Through this model, we develop powerful customer solutions, deliver a great customer experience, and develop deep customer relationships. This all starts with what we call advantaged MRO solutions. That means being able to get a customer the exact product they need to solve a problem quickly. And it means understanding more about our products and customers than anyone in order to help them solve problems and to create value for our customers.","This takes the form of intuitive digital solutions, segment specific solutions, and value-added services. We then leverage these solutions to our talented sales and services teams to build deep customer relationships based on an exceptional customer experience. ","Our Grainger U.S., Canada and Mexico operations as well as our crumble and favorite businesses stick within this model.","In our endless assortment model, we provide less complex customers with an expansive product assortment and easy to use website. This business is based on acquiring customers and leveraging our simple and efficient customer experience to develop and maintain strong customer relationships. Our MonotaRO and Zoro businesses fit within this model.","When we execute against these two models, we consistently gain share, we grow profitably, and we deliver strong shareholder value. That's our commitment.","Flipping to Slide 5 and before I jump into 2019 highlights, I wanted to touch briefly on work we have done over the last few years to strengthen the business and to position Grainger for success. This work has ensured that both our high-touch solutions model and our endless assortment model have the capabilities to win in the marketplace.","Most of you are familiar with the pricing reset of our U.S. business back in 2017. This change has allowed us to grow with customer groups we\u2019ve been losing share with for years, most notably midsize customers. But beyond the pricing actions, we have made important news: we have verticalized our salesforce. Our customers today demand more expertise from our interactions and this change enables our sales teams to develop domain knowledge and deepen customer relationships. We have added an inside sales group focused on high-value midsized customers.","We have centralized our call centers to improve service and scale and help manage costs. We have restructured our feedstock inventory management program, and we now have begun expanding capabilities for our customers. We've added capacity to our U.S. supply chain. We have made significant improvements to grainger.com to make search easier for our customers. And we've done all this while realizing significant leverage on our cost structure. These changes let us set the stage for what we accomplished in 2019 and will accomplish moving forward.","Outside of the U.S. business, we have reset the foundation for our Canadian operations for what we believe will become a consistently profitable and growing business. We have shed non-core international businesses over the last few years and are now focusing our efforts on places where we can create a meaningful, profitable, and competitively advantage position. Our attention and focus moving forward will be on a high-touch solutions model primarily in North America, as well as our growing endless assortment model. We continue to evaluate our portfolio to ensure our time, energy, and investment is spent, where we can add the most value for the long-term. Our execution on these efforts over the last few years has laid a strong foundation for profitable growth for the new decade.","Moving to Slide 6, as you heard from our competitors, suppliers, and customers, our market was certainly challenging in 2019 with market growth declining as the year progressed. In the face of these challenges, the Grainger team delivered solid results for the year, mainly in line with the expectations we outlined back in January 2019. To be clear, we\u2019re thrilled with the absolute performance in the year but it was solid on a comparable basis. For the total company, we drove 3% daily sales growth across the company on a constant currency basis. From a profitability perspective, we expanded total company operating margin by 10 basis points in 2019, driven by continued success in leveraging our SG&A, the team did a nice job managing spend in 2019, and we achieved our goal to minimize SG&A growth for less than half the rate of our sales growth. We expect to continue driving leverages we prudently manage costs while also growing the business.","We generated over $1 billion of cash in 2019 and returned roughly the same amount to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. While the absolute numbers were decent in many ways, 2019 was a strong year on the execution front that we believe sets us up well going forward.","In the U.S., we outgrew the MRO market by 150 to 200 basis points in 2019 and our outperformance to the market gained momentum throughout the year. We exited the fourth quarter growing about 300 basis points faster than the market. This performance is driven by our ongoing investments in growth initiatives which support our strategy. We remerchandised $1.2 billion of products in 2019 more than double any time in our history and we\u2019re on track to complete another $1.6 billion in 2020. These category reviews along with marketing activities are driving incremental revenue. We've been testing these strategies and are happy with results thus far.","Return on ad spend steadily increased over the course of the year.","We saw nice improvements in the focus of our sales and services team, particularly around embedding Grainger and our customers to keep stock and value-added services. We reenergized our large corporate account efforts and won some significant contracts in the second half. Our high-touch offers unmatched in the market, and we believe we will continue to gain share with these important strategic customers.","In our endless assortment model, we grew revenue 19% in 2019 driven by strong growth at both MonotaRO and Zoro. We invested to enhance our Zoro offering in 2019 including the addition of roughly 1.5 million skews to the assortment, pushing the total skew count to about 3.5 million products.","We made significant enhancements to Zoro\u2019s technology capabilities, including the launch of a new product information system and a customer analytics platform allowing Zoro to be less reliant on Grainger's infrastructure. We also improved our marketing capabilities at Zoro which would help us gain share profitably moving forward.","In our Grainger Canada business we saw revenue stabilize and customer feedback improve significantly throughout 2019. We expect to return to growth in the business in the back half of 2020 and are confident the platform we have in Canada will prove to be sustainable and profitable in the future.","Even when our results were poor, we made progress. Specifically our Cromwell business in the UK had a very challenging financial year. For context, adjusted total company operating margin in 2019 would have been 12.7% without Cromwell or 60 basis point improvement. Further, we took a non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter to write-off substantially all of the intangible assets, including trade names and customer lists. That said the business made great strides in service and our customers are now talking about Cromwell moving forward.","We also took action in the fourth quarter to take \u00a310 million of administration costs out of the business.","This team has great clarity and understands the urgency required to improve the performance of the business going forward. So while 2019 was certainly challenging, we\u2019re proud of the work we completed to position us for success moving forward.","Turning to 2020, we plan to continue investing to support our strategy. Our expectation is that we will consistently outgrow the market including a target of 300 to 400 basis points of outperformance in our core high-touch business in the U.S. Historically, we've grown approximately 150 basis points faster than the market. Our actions and investments over the last several years provide confidence that we can grow at a more accelerated rate. In 2020, we are focused on several initiatives to support that growth.","We will continue to work the work we began in 2019 to remerchandise our assortment to ensure we have the right products to serve the needs of our customers. For 2020, this includes remerchandising $1.6 billion of products, including selected skew additions to enhance our assortment.","We expect to continue to learn and improve upon the way we execute our marketing activities. We've learned a lot over the last couple of years including analytics focused evaluations around our investments in search and display, radio, catalog and direct marketing. We expect improved share gain from both incremental marketing investments and from effective marketing in 2020. We remain focused on bolstering our expertise in digital and technology solutions in order to serve a more sophisticated and tech enabled customer base. We recently went live with the first version of our new product information system and had made great improvements with our customer information; both support our merchandising, and marketing efforts.","We will invest to enhance our customer experience and strengthen our world-class customer service backbone through network capacity and utilization investments. With our Louisville DC coming online soon, we're at a point where focused investments in DC capacity, while significant service benefits without as much capital outlays we've seen in the recent past.","We're also planning to selectively add sellers to be more relevant in certain segments and geographies. And we will equip our sales organization with the right tool set to ensure they can serve our customers most effectively.","We have developed improved processes with large multi-site customers and continue to be aggressive in helping these customers consolidate with Grainger. We will continue to embed our solutions with a more complex customers to our inventory management offerings. Finally we remain committed to the ongoing turnaround efforts in Canada and with our Cromwell business in the UK. In Canada, the business was slightly profitable 2019 and as Tom will explain, we expect to roughly breakeven again in 2020. This business is now structured to run as an extension of our core U.S. operations. This will help us make the needed strides to return the business to meaningful profitability over the course of the next couple of years by demonstrating a consistent uptick in revenue and margins.","For Cromwell, I mentioned their struggles in 2019. This is a business that is at a crossroads right now. We need to start seeing progress over the next 12 to 18 months to assess whether the business can run profitably. We've made great improvements in service which are expected to translate into revenue and profitability. Our team will be evaluating this closely in 2020.","Successful execution of these initiatives will position us to consistently and profitably outperform the market in 2020 and beyond.","Now, let's talk about our endless assortment business. First and foremost, we\u2019re pleased to have announced earlier this morning that Masaya Suzuki, the current CEO of MonotaRO will now lead the combined endless assortment business across Grainger. I am personally very excited about this. Masaya was part of the founding team at MonotaRO and has been instrumental in the tremendously profitable growth with this business as we first launched 20 years ago. He has also played a critical role in the launch of Zoro in 2011. Under Masaya\u2019s leadership, we expect to continue the strong growth and profitability of our endless assortment businesses.","In the U.S., we plan to accelerate Zoro\u2019s adoption of the MonotaRO playbook in order to capture growth and implement best practices. Specifically, we plan to continue to rapidly expand Zoro\u2019s assortment beyond the $130 billion industrial MRO market. This will allow us to tap into markets and customers that aren't served through other greater channels. Our goal is to have 10 million skews in the Zoro portfolio in the next three to five years, utilizing third-party suppliers with direct fulfillment capabilities. This has worked well for MonotaRO which has 20 million skews and we\u2019re confident will work for Zoro as well.","We're also continuing to develop and improve our marketing and customer segmentation tools at Zoro. We made most of these investments in 2019 and expect to start to see the results here in 2020.","For Zoro UK, we will continue to leverage the Cromwell supply chain and execute our strategy to grow the business and drive profitability. These efforts include expanding assortments, enhancing website functionality, and launching effective marketing and customer acquisition campaigns to create a vibrant marketplace. The Zoro UK business continues to grow very quickly and the economics of this business looks to be quite attractive. We expect this business to be profitable in 2021.","And for MonotaRO, Masaya and his team will continue to execute their successful growth strategy, including additions to the assortment and network enhancements to improve reliability and speed. This business has produced impressive and profitable growth year in and year out, and we expect that to continue. Our endless assortment business has been a great asset for Grainger and we see the opportunity for tremendous growth moving forward.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tom for detail on our 2019 performance and 2020 guidance.","Tom Okray","Thanks, DG.","I'll start with a recap of our 2019 total company adjusted results, then move forward to the fourth quarter results by segment. Overall, we're pleased with our 2019 performance despite a challenging environment. Sales were up 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by 2.5% from volume and price favorability of 0.5%. FX had a negative 0.5% impact. It should be noted that our core U.S. and endless assortment business combined grew at 5% in the full-year.","Consistent with our guide, our gross profit margin was down 50 basis points versus the prior-year. The decline was primarily driven by our lower margin endless assortment business, which is growing at a faster rate than the rest of the company. Contributing to the decline, both MonotaRO and Zoro had lower gross margin. MonotaRO faced freight headwinds in Japan and Zoro\u2019s lower gross margin was driven by unfavorable product mix and promotional activities. Elsewhere, slightly lower gross profit margins in the U.S. were offset by higher gross margins in Canada driven by supply chain favorability.","Despite meaningful investments in advertising, technology, and Zoro, we drove SG&A leverage driven by continued cost management actions. SG&A as a percentage of sales improved 60 basis points year-over-year as our SG&A spend remained flat to 2018. As a result, total company operating margins for the year increased 10 basis points with a 20 basis point improvement in the U.S. Incremental margin for the total company was 17% aided by 22% U.S. incremental margin.","We generated operating cash flow of over $1 billion, which we use to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders, returning north of $1 billion through dividends and share repurchases. We did this while maintaining a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.4 times.","Operating cash flow was 116% of net earnings; our return on invested capital was 29.3% or 80 basis points favorable to the prior-year. All-in considering the choppy market, we\u2019re pleased with the results.","Looking at the quarter, daily sales increased 3% including 3.5% from volume partially offset by 0.5% unfavorable price.","Gross profit margin for the quarter was down 50 basis points due to business unit mix, as well as mix shift headwinds within our large customer group in the U.S. These impacts were partially offset by favorable supply chain improvements in Canada.","SG&A costs increased 3% but slightly less than sales growth, driven by marketing and technology spend in the U.S. segment and investments to support Zoro\u2019s growth. We could have dialed back spend in the quarter to achieve a better short-term profitability outcome. But we\u2019re focused on driving sustainable value over the long-term and continued investment in the business supports this effort.","Operating margin declined 40 basis points in the quarter as SG&A leverage was more than offset by the decline in gross profit margin versus the prior-year.","Earnings per share decreased 2% in the quarter due to a higher tax rate as we lapped the prior-year benefit from our clean energy investments.","Looking at our performance in the U.S. I'll start with sales for our large and mid-sized customers. The U.S. MRO market in line with macroeconomic indicators declined throughout the year. We estimate that the U.S. MRO market was flat to down 1% in the fourth quarter, and was up 0.5% to 1% for the full-year.","In the fourth quarter, our U.S. large customer business grew 3% or 350 basis points faster than the market. Outperformance to the market for large customers accelerated sequentially as our growth initiatives began to take hold.","Our U.S. midsize customer business grew 5% or approximately 550 basis points faster than the market. It's important to note that our growth with these two customer groups remain stable despite slower market conditions in the quarter.","Overall U.S. segment daily sales grew 2.5% in the quarter or about 300 basis points faster than the market. Sales growth in the quarter included 3% from volume partially offset by unfavorable price of 1%, inter-company sales provided a 0.5% positive impact in the quarter.","As noted in our last call, balancing market based pricing with cost, inflation and share gain led to a choppy price result throughout the year. Having said that, we finished the full-year with favorable price of 0.5%.","While gross profit margin was up 50 basis points sequentially, we were down 100 basis points year-over-year driven by a few factors, including the growth of inter-company sales and lower margins, the lapping of prior-year supplier rebates, and a mix shift within our large customer subgroup.","We've gotten more aggressive in helping large multi-site customers consolidate spend with Grainger. This includes pursuing new customers where we won a few significant contracts in the second half of 2019, as well as deepening and broadening relationships with our current customers. This large customer growth can create a drag on gross margins in the short to medium term, while we demonstrate our value proposition and expand share of wallet with these customers. However this is absolutely the right strategy to drive long-term profitable growth.","As we add and expand customer relationships, we're gaining share and more deeply embedding Grainger into what our customers do each and every day. Given the lumpiness of our pricing actions in 2019, we think looking at gross margin on the full-year is more meaningful. In this regard, our full-year margins were down 30 basis points, reflecting the remaining impact of contract renegotiations and large customer mix headwinds. Ultimately, we remain confident in our ability to pass along inflationary cost increases.","SG&A costs were flat on 2% sales growth and was favorable 60 basis points to the prior-year. Operating margin declined 40 basis points in the quarter as the decline in gross profit margin was only partially offset by strong SG&A leverage.","Looking at Op margin for the full-year, the U.S. segment operating margin was 15.8% which is in line with the guidance we set in January of last year and represents an expansion of 20 basis points.","Moving on to other businesses, daily sales increased 9.5% including 7.5% from volume and 2% from favorable FX. Growth was driven by continued expansion of our endless assortment business, which is up a combined 18% between Zoro and MonotaRO.","Gross profit margin declined 10 basis points in the quarter driven by negative mix resulting from faster growth in endless assortment.","Operating margin declined 140 basis points driven primarily by investments in Zoro and performance at Cromwell. Cromwell generated an operating loss of $35 million for the full-year.","Further, while not reflected in our adjusted results, we took an impairment charge in the quarter to write-off substantially all of the remaining intangible assets in our Cromwell business.","Turning to Slide 16, daily sales decreased 11.5% including 10% related to volume decline and 1.5% related to unfavorable price. Price was driven by discounts and mix as we begin to win back large customer business. As we finish the year, daily sales stabilized and we're beginning to see volume growth from new and existing customers.","Gross profit margin increased 595 basis points over the prior-year primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies. While a sizable portion of this benefit is non-recurring, we expect some benefit will continue moving forward.","SG&A dollars were 10% lower than prior-year, but the rate was unfavorable 50 basis points due to volume.","Operating margin increased 545 basis points over the prior-year driven by the increase in gross margins.","Now let's take a look at 2020 guidance. Consistent with last year, we will provide guidance at the beginning of the year and only plan to make updates if we expect results to fall materially outside the guided range.","With that, we expect to deliver another year of solid growth for the company in 2020, as we execute upon our growth priorities and continue to support our customers. For the total company, we expect top-line growth of 3.5% to 6.5% driven by outperformance to the market in the U.S., and continued expansion of our endless assortment business.","In the U.S., we expect the MRO market will remain consistent with where we exited 2019, hovering around flat to slightly negative. Even with this static market, we remain confident that our industry knowhow, deep customer relationships and scale coupled with our growth priorities position us to continue to capture share.","For 2020, we expect to outgrow the broader MRO market by approximately 300 basis points. This is a step toward our stated long-term target to consistently achieve 300 to 400 basis points of outgrowth each and every year. We expect to continue growing our endless assortment business at around 20% in 2020.","As the MonotaRO team delivers consistently strong results and as we rapidly add skews and leverage our 2019 investments at Zoro.","From a profitability perspective, total company gross profit margin is expected to be down roughly 110 to 50 basis points in 2020. This was driven by business unit mix, with the higher growth of our lower margin endless assortment business as well as mix headwinds within our U.S. large multi-site customer subgroup as we focus on consolidating MRO spend for large corporate customers.","As it relates to price, our intention is to remain market competitive while growing share and offsetting cost inflation. Having said that, price is difficult to predict given the muted and uncertain economic environment. We will stay nimble.","As it relates to tariffs, our guidance assumes a status quo environment. Any changes will be evaluated if and when they occur.","Total company operating margins are expected to remain consistent at the mid-point as we anticipate significant SG&A leverage as we grow the top-line while remaining prudent on costs. These top-line and profitability targets as well as continued execution of our share repurchase program are expected to produce earnings per share of $17.75 to $19.25 or 3% to 11% growth.","From a quarterly timing perspective, we do anticipate that both top and bottom line performance will improve in the back half of the year as our growth priorities take hold and we lap tougher comps at the GP level in the first half.","Recall that we increased prices in Q1 2019, which were subsequently dialed back in the second and third quarters. In addition, the full impact of tariff cost increases were not realized until later in 2019.","Continuing with guidance on Slide 20, at a segment level we expect operating profit margins in each of our business units to remain relatively stable. In the U.S. operating margin is expected to be between 15.6% to 16% with a mid-point in line with 2019 performance. As discussed gross profit margins in the U.S. are facing headwinds primarily related to our pursuit of large customer contracts to help grow share and deepen relationships in this choppy market environment.","We expect these GP headwinds will be offset by continued SG&A leverage. For other businesses, we expect 4% to 6% operating margin. After a year of significant investments in our endless assortment model and lower than expected results at Cromwell, we expect our actions in 2019 to produce improved 2020 results.","As we have discussed throughout 2019, we expect operating margin at Zoro will trend favorably in 2020 and return to mid-single-digit profitability by 2021.","In Canada, we expect to roughly break-even again in 2020 as revenue growth build sequentially in response to our improved service level and profitability begins to reflect our cost base reset. As noted earlier, we will lap some non-recurring supply chain efficiencies in the fourth quarter, which will be a headwind to operating margins in the New Year.","From a cash flow perspective, we expect operating cash flow to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. We plan capital expenditures of about $250 million. The large majority of investment this year will center around our U.S. segment and endless assortment business in order to continue our growth in these areas.","We expect the balance of our cash to be used to fund our quarterly dividend and continue executing against our share repurchase authorization. For 2020, we're expecting between $600 million to $700 million of repurchases which continues to reflect our confidence to successfully execute our strategy and growth priorities.","With that, I will turn it back to DG for closing remarks.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks, Tom.","As I look forward to 2020 and beyond, I'm excited about the opportunities that we have in front of us. And I want to thank the Grainger team for their hard work and dedication. We\u2019re well-positioned to continue to gain share in the U.S, to continue to drive 20% growth profitably in the endless assortment model, and to improve the rest of our portfolio. I\u2019m confident in our ability to drive long-term value for all stakeholders. And I'm confident that we're going to continue to extend our lead in the industry.","So with that, I will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","Our first question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please state your question.","Ryan Merkel","Hey, thanks. So first-off, I'm a little surprised by the 2020 gross margin guide down about 80 basis points at the mid-point, I had thought that after the price reset, you were thinking that gross margins would start to stabilize. So I'm trying to figure out for 2020 is the big change to focus on the large accounts or what's really changing?","Tom Okray","Well, Ryan, there is really two things happening. I mean, one, it's just -- it's just the algebra of our endless assortment business unit getting much larger and growing at 20% and the gross profit profiles that that business has. So that's a very big portion of it, which is getting bigger obviously.","And then one of our key growth initiatives is going after the large customers. And maybe just unpack that with a little example. Right now, we've been heavily focused on location-by-location basis. As we stated as part of our growth initiatives, we\u2019re working more with the C-suite to try to get a broader, broader range of locations in terms of going after a bigger piece of the company's pie. And with that, initially you'll have to do some sort of write-down usually to gross margin as it relates to product mix as it relates to your offer. But then over time, there's plenty of levers to increase that gross margin whether it be with product substitution, standardization, reducing overall buy. So we're confident over time that we will improve the gross margin with those customers, but for 2020, we're being prudent in putting that in the guide.","Ryan Merkel","Okay, that makes sense. I guess for my follow-up, sort of related, I'm thinking about the long-term growth algorithm. And so maybe you can help us should we be assuming that gross margins are down sort of 50 to 60 basis points structurally because of its mix, but then you'll offset that with SG&A. So we should think about EBIT growth equaling sales growth. And then if you do better than mid-single-digits, you probably kind of do EBIT growth a little bit better. Is that right?","Donald Macpherson","So Ryan, I guess this is DG. Yes, so in the U.S. business, let's start there, our assumption is that we gained share 300 to 400 basis points faster the market. So if the market grows 2% through cycle, we'd be at 5% to 6%. At that, so what you see this coming year is a projection of market down half a percent, at that you see operating margins flat for the U.S. business year-over-year, so 2.5% growth flat operating margins. At 5% through cycle, we'd expect to get a little more leverage than the slight pressure on GP over time and see some expanding margins in the U.S. So I think it's a good -- this is a good sort of guide on the economics of the business at 2%, 2.5%, 3%, you're probably flat on operating margin in the U.S. If you get more growth than that you\u2019re probably positive.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Please state your question.","David Manthey","Hi, good morning, everyone. First question, when I look at Slide 5, you clearly made many meaningful upgrades here. And I'm trying to figure out how many of these were defensive versus offensive in nature. And essentially, how will we measure the success of all these changes over the next three to five years? It looks like maybe a little bit of sales outgrowth. But are there other metrics, you'll be tracking to see the success of these initiatives?","Donald Macpherson","Well I think I mean these are, to be clear Dave these initiatives on the left hand side in the U.S. are mostly rearview mirror initiatives in the sense that centralizing the call centers has gotten us increased service and lower costs. So we expect to continue to get lower costs. So that's one that you'll see in the SG&A line.","If I looked at our order to cash process and customer feedback in the U.S. right now it is, it is at an all-time high, it got better this year significantly relative to the competition. So some of these moves have been around continue to improve service and you see that in supply chain capacity. Verticalizing the Salesforce, we think you're going to see in terms of part contributing to that 300 to 400 basis point growth faster than the market. And so it's a mix. A lot of these have been done already.","When we go forward, we're going to start talking about some of the initiatives that are on Page 7. We\u2019re merchandising assortments. I mentioned we merchandised $1.2 billion this last year, that's far more than we've ever done in a single year and will do $1.6 billion this year. We see that directly leading to sales growth. And we measure that very tightly, marketing both effectiveness to marketing and increased marketing budget we measure that very, very tightly. We know how much that contributes to growth. But the large customer initiatives that Tom talked about, we know how much that's leading to growth and what impact that has. So we\u2019re tracking -- we are tracking everything.","We wanted to put Page 5 together to say, there's been a lot of change in the business and we feel like we're in a good position to really drive the growth initiatives we're talking about.","David Manthey","Okay, yes, that makes sense. As a follow-up, then and you partially answered this in your answer to the last question. Over the last couple of years, you clearly grow in SG&A at a rate slower than sales growth or even gross profit dollar growth. And your guidance seems to imply more of the same in line with your targets. As a distributor, there's obviously inherent inflation in some of the areas of your costs tag, can talk about the other major areas of expenses that you're keeping flat or reducing in order to keep SG&A in check so well in this lackluster environment. I'm just looking for the big two or three buckets that you think are really the drivers of that performance?","Donald Macpherson","Yes. So if you look at the cost structure, and I'll focus on the U.S. again, there's some big buckets of cost, where our expectation is that we will get productivity on a consistent basis. So in our distribution centers, we continue to automate, we continue to get process improvement to drive dollars costs per line down. In our contact centers, we continue to get productivity; we continue to get productivity in our salesforce through revenue per seller increases. Our expectation is that the cost increases that you talk about will be covered by productivity in those areas. And we basically have developed a process and an expectation and a philosophy that we will continue to drive productivity in each of those areas mostly through continuous improvement to basically offset those costs increases.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.","Deane Dray","Hey, I just want to say appreciate your level of clarity and context in describing some of the changes here on gross margin. That's really helpful. And just to clarify in Tom's answer when you talk about the mix shift to large customers, that you'll sacrifice over the short medium term, the gross margin, but once you build share with these customers longer term, you're better positioned for profitable growth. What's the timeframe on this? I know you say longer term, but are we talking multiple years? I don't think you mean it takes that long because if you're moving to standardization, okay, so just share with us more of the timing of this because it does make sense, just the short-term, long-term seems a little vague?","Tom Okray","Yes, no first of all you've got to remember that we've got a ton of customers. So this initiative is in various stages of development by individual customers. So it's not like you snap the chalk line and you start everything at one-time. So when we're talking about short to medium-term, we're certainly talking about a lot of it will happen within 2021 timeframe. It's really building the trust embedding with the different large customers, so we can reach in mix, so we can have products, the substitution. So we can have standardization, those types of things. So I guess we would look at this as a transition year from 2020 for this initiative.","Donald Macpherson","And Deane I guess I would add to that, when we look at large customers, we track what we call economic earnings, which is a more sort of holistic view of the profitability of customers. And our goal is to make sure that we drive growth and profitable growth through that metric as opposed to just gross profit. So at times, we will take gross profit. It\u2019s in the short-term if we're improving the cost structure elsewhere to provide the ability to consolidate customers and then provide value for those customers.","Tom Okray","I think another thing, important part to notice these are really large multi-site customers. So this is really hitting home runs versus hitting singles and doubles. So this is a very attractive business to get. And just launching off of DG\u2019s comments, we can lever our SG&A at about 2.5% growth, so we can afford to take the time to develop these very important customers.","Deane Dray","Great. And then just a follow-up, could you put this negative price in context because we're hearing elsewhere in the industrial distributors that not only are there some of it is delays in getting supplier price increases through but there's heightened competition within the distributors, how much of that is at play in the negative price that we're seeing?","Tom Okray","I think the important thing when you talk about price is to look at it on the full-year basis. As we said in our prepared remarks, our pricing was very lumpy. You'll recall from previous calls, we were quite aggressive in Q1 and then we dialed that back in Q2 and Q3. We made a conscious decision not to raise price in the back half of the years as to not be disruptive to our customers. When you look at it on an entire basis of the full-year, our price cost was roughly neutral. So and we're happy with that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks. Good morning and just kind of following up on Deane's question, is there any defensive component value pricing with the large customers? Or is that really all emanating from your tactical execution by customer just for share independent of market dynamics?","Tom Okray","I guess there's always some tactical but I would say the majority is the latter. Some of it\u2019s product mix within a given customer, some of it\u2019s customer specific mix.","Donald Macpherson","I guess, I guess, Chris, I think maybe your question underneath the question is has the competitive environment heightened with large customers; I think it's always been competitive. And we will always be in a situation where we have to be effective in navigating that competitive environment. It doesn't feel like it's changed dramatically, but certainly it's competitive.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And then also, I think you talked about how it kind of is in -- by customer, did you suggest that this would be a 2020, 2021 process and then you might open up some gross margin headroom after 2021?","Tom Okray","It's difficult -- it's difficult enough to predict 2020 to try to predict 2021. Ideally, 2021, we would get back to a more a lesser decline in gross margin on a year-over-year basis.","Donald Macpherson","I would say, Chris, that we have a lot of confidence in the value proposition that we have, our service is exceptional. Our customers want to do business with us. Over time, we think that we should be in a position to get price as much as anybody and to be able to continue to have very strong operating margins with our customers. So we\u2019re confident in what we\u2019re doing. In the short-term with trade and with the environment, it's been a little bit lumpy and clearly but we're pretty confident in the long-term ability to improve our margins.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Baughman with JPMorgan. Please state your question.","Patrick Baughman","Well thanks. Good morning, DG, good morning Tom. Maybe just start-off on the mid-size versus large customers. Just wondering into next year or I guess this year into 2020 you\u2019d expect mid-size customers to still outpace large or is that flip with some of these share gains initiatives -- share gain initiatives you\u2019ve been talking about for large? And then somewhat related to that you described the U.S. outgrowth in the quarter as 300 basis points and then you said large was 350 and mid-size was 550. So I'm just wondering what drag down the total segment?","Tom Okray","Sure. I\u2019ll take the first part of the question first. Yes, definitely we would expect medium customers to grow faster than large. I guess the way we look at it is, large at about 300 bps faster than the market, mid-size about 500 bps faster than the market on the low-end.","As it relates to the chart that shows large and mid-size, there's a service revenue component that is included in those charts for large and medium not to get too technical on you. But that is a very important part of our business. That is really embedding with the customer. On the U.S. segment that is reflected on a net basis meaning we adjust cost out. So that's the difference between the two numbers where you're always going to have large and medium be higher than the U.S. segment.","Patrick Baughman","Okay. I can follow-up on that after -- just one more from you, just if you could talk about the path forward at Cromwell. And what's embedded in your other businesses guidance there in terms of losses for 2020? And then on the same topic for other businesses, the magnitude of Zoro investments made in 2019. And whether do you still expect most of that spending to falloff in 2020?","Donald Macpherson","Yes. So let me focus on Zoro and Cromwell, I think other than Zoro and Cromwell, we expect continued improvement in the businesses and we see a nice path. Cromwell we would expect this year to cut the losses roughly in half for this year, that\u2019s our expectation. And I would say there's a couple of things going on at Cromwell. One is certainly the market has not been great and a portion of it has been related to that, a lot of it has been some service issues we had that we have completely worked through. We're hearing much better things from the marketplace, our net promoter score has gone from not very good to quite good actually. And the team is pretty excited about what we're doing. We have a new team over there; we're comfortable with the actions they're taking.","Cromwell is interesting. If you remember why we bought Cromwell was as a platform for the online business, and because we thought it was good business. Zoro UK is actually doing quite well. And we would expect it to be profitable in 2021. So really by the end of the year, we should have a view as to whether or not both of those businesses can be successful and profitable. And that's -- that's when we will really sort of evaluate what we think we need to do.","So as I mentioned beyond that in the prepared remarks, we have taken a bunch of costs out of that business. We have seen great service improvement; we have won a few contracts with customers recently. It gives us some confidence that things are coming back. But it's a steep climb get better.","The investments in Zoro most -- a lot of those investments start to come-off this year. We made significant investments in the fourth quarter, some systems investments that had a few glitches, but we through them we expect improvement this year and then significant improvement again in 2021 with that business. And as I mentioned, we're excited to have Masaya Suzuki lead that business. He has been through this at the same point with MonotaRO and really feel like he's going to help that business accelerate performance going forward.","Patrick Baughman","Thanks a lot.","Tom Okray","So there is no reason we can't see the margin profile longer-term for Zoro be consistent with MonotaRO.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research Company. Please state your question.","Adam Uhlman","Hey guys, good morning. Hey Tom, I guess could you expand a little bit more about your comments earlier about the cadence of earnings to the year, I'm just wondering the fourth quarter costs for Zoro were higher than expected, does that carry into the first quarter here as things are ironed out and then are those the moving pieces we should keep in mind like the customer show other investment spending for Louisville, I'm just trying to get a sense of, should we be bracing for larger earnings designs in the first quarter and then into the second and then recovery in the second half of the year?","Tom Okray","We are talking specifically about SG&A I'll go back to DG\u2019s answer on Zoro. 2019 was an investment year for Zoro where we spent heavily in SG&A related to adding people, technology and advertising that will be reduced significantly beginning in -- beginning in Q1, so that will be a material impact.","The way I would think about SG&A is the way we've talked about it, we plan on growing SG&A at half the rate of sales. We will continue with the productivity that DG talked about in a previous answer.","As it relates to gross profit, we\u2019ve seen no difference than our normal seasonality. We expect Q1 to be greater -- greater gross margin than Q4 of this year. And then we expect it to decline throughout the year with Q4 being a relative uptick to Q3. Does that get answer to your question?","Adam Uhlman","Yes, that helps. And then secondly, could you expand a little bit more about what you guys are seeing in the near-term from a customer spending and general environment perspective, it looked like most of the end-market, or the sales growth by end-market was relatively similar to last quarter, I guess today things stand out to you as notable and then as we think about the investments that are being made into the Salesforce and verticalization efforts from this past year, are there any vertical markets that we should look to see accelerating growth next year as evidence of a payoff on those investments?","Donald Macpherson","Yes, Adam, so what I would say is that, we are privileged to see a very wide swath of the economy with our customers. We have not seen much, much change over the last eight months really; I would say we continue to see a market that is slow growth, but not trailing off in anything worse at this point. And the customer end market results that we've seen the last two quarters, our expectation is they won't be dissimilar to start the year and that they're likely to get a little better as the year goes along. That would be our expectation at this point, not much better, a little bit better as you're going along. So I don't -- we don't see anything all that is unusual in our end markets right now, we haven\u2019t over the last couple of quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please state your question.","Chris Dankert","Just one question from me, thanks so much for the update on large customer prototypes swinging for the fences on volume there. I guess could you get a brief update on kind of medium customer strategy there's still some concern about this being more price competitive pieces of business just how are you balancing digital versus high-touch and what is the go-to-market look like in medium customer in 2020 here?","Donald Macpherson","Yes, so midsize customers are actually less price sensitive and we continue to see much higher margins with midsize customers. We're trying to build -- build a growth so that can become a more meaningful portion of our portfolio. We continue to see the ability into the Grainger brand to acquire new customers. We continue to see growth with our existing customers through our inside sales team, and through fairly simple pricing actions. Our service model really sings things to midsize customers. We continue to get very loyal customers in through the funnel.","We're digital first in the sense that most of our midsize customer acquisition comes through digital first touch. And then we do a lot of work to understand who the customer is, what their profile is and move them through the cycle in some cases to get them to coverage that makes sense for them. That has proven to be fairly successful. As Tom said, we expect it to go faster with midsize customers at higher gross profit than we will have with large.","Chris Dankert","Yes got it. Just one sort of follow-up on that. I mean the 400 to 500 basis points above market in medium customer, anything that helps kind of get our arms around what informs that or why that's kind of sustainable longer-term?","Donald Macpherson","Well, I think the most obvious is we lost a lot of that business. If you remember we were kind of $1.6 billion in that business went down to 800 something million and now we're up over a $1 billion again. There's a lot of customers that we continue to reengage and a lot of our marketing efforts are proving to be very successful with these customers. And once we get customers back and they realize that we are not -- that we're reasonably priced, very high service solution, they are coming back and working with Grainger again.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please state your question.","Karen Lau","Hi, good morning. It is Karen Lau dialing in for John. Thanks for taking the question. So DG I think in the past few years, you had mentioned that given after the price reset, pricing pressure from large accounts has kind of diminished because your prices are more competitive. It sounded like that is really changing a little bit into 2020. I wasn't obviously there's the defense versus offense components, but the whole thing sound a little reminiscent of what happened before you do the pricing reset. So my question is, can you compare the customer's behavior today versus how they were three years ago and then compare your ability to respond to that versus three years ago before the pricing reset?","Donald Macpherson","Yes. So I mean I don't think -- I don't think the situations are at all now, I guess back then, we were losing share dramatically with higher margin customers. We\u2019re not doing that now. Large customer business even back then was very competitive. Most of it was on custom pricing contracts that is still the same today. The large customer pricing -- the advantage we got through the price change was that some of the tailspin was easier to get large customers to sign-up for because they weren't buying things frequently then our prices then made sense that is still the case. We have super pricing discussions with our customers now. They are still competitive. They were competitive back then, they're still competitive now.","Karen Lau","Okay. Maybe looking at it as sort of a different angle. So mid-size obviously has been a focus in the past two years and has been very successful for you guys. I guess the shift to large accounts and I guess the factor that\u2019s kind of deemphasizing midsize account a little bit, is it just a function of you have been very successful and done what you could do with those accounts. So, it's hard to do more to further accelerate the outgrowth in that market. I mean how you are thinking about that?","Donald Macpherson","I would say we are not deemphasizing midsize customers at all. We still think they will grow faster than large. We are making sure that we\u2019re competitive with our large customers. And that's important, obviously given the size of that customer group for us. That is a bigger lever on growth at this point. And so we need to make sure that we are growing with both but we are not deemphasizing anything. We still think there's a long runway ahead from midsize customer.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Buckingham Research. Please state your question.","Robert Barry","I\u2019m hearing from East Coast. Yes just a few follow-ups actually. Yes, it looks like prices assume neutral in the guide. Is that right?","Tom Okray","Yes, basically we're looking at price cost to be relatively neutral. As we said in the prepared remarks, we've got the three variables that we're trying to balance, share growth, market competitiveness in terms of pricing, as well as passing on inflationary cost. And similar to this year, we're going to balance those, those three and we think we'll end up somewhere flattish from a price cost perspective.","Robert Barry","Got it. And I think when you first did the price reset, the goal was to narrow what had become a very large premiums market but still maintain some modest premium to go-to-market as the premium provider and to price that way, is that still true? Or it almost sounds like kind of alluding to the earlier question that maybe you're getting a little more aggressive, more happy to err actually on the side of under versus overpricing the market.","Donald Macpherson","Now, we still have a premium with our list prices, we will continue to do that. It's a modest premium. And we'll continue to have that. And then I think the comment earlier was when you're going after large contracts on a portion of volume; you need to get pretty aggressive. And we've always done that. We just have to continue that.","Tom Okray","Yes, I think you're making too much about price as it relates to large customers versus just a normal business dynamic where you're going from individual locations to a much bigger piece of a total company. That's just -- there's going to be part of as DG says that you're going to have a certain part of the offer that's going to be priced aggressively to get your foot in the door.","Robert Barry","Got it. And just lastly, Tom, on the gross margin cadence through the year I understand in absolute terms higher in 1Q and then down through the year but had you alluded earlier to the year-over-year decline in gross margin being larger in 1Q and then moderating as the year progressed, or did I mishear that?","Tom Okray","Yes, no, no, you heard it correctly. The front half of the year is definitely going to be a larger year-over-year decline than the back half. And that just is a lapping consideration where again, we were heavy on price at the beginning of the year in 2019. Costs didn't kick in until the back half of the year. So yes, that's the correct way to model.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Please state your question.","Mario Cortellacci","Hi, this is Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. I know you guys already touched on the Zoro business and the new roll-off of the investments. I\u2019m just curious, I guess as margins build in that business, do you think that you'll break out Zoro and MonotaRO as a separate segment? I mean some could argue that your multiple doesn't really represent that business at all given where other online marketplace assets trade at?","Donald Macpherson","What I would say is that with Masaya now running this, we think we have a couple of years of really hard work to make sure that we are performing on a path like the MonotaRO businesses then in the U.S. and in the UK. That's our entire attention. We are fully aware of the question and but for right now, we're really focused on making sure we get the businesses to be as successful as possible.","Tom Okray","And as it relates to reportable segments obviously will follow all SEC regulations in terms of doing that.","Mario Cortellacci","Got it. Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. I think your working capital has been a cash flow drag in 2018 and 2019. I just want to know what your assumptions were for 2020 and maybe just a little color on the reason for the headwinds, is it mostly the endless assortment portion?","Tom Okray","No, no. You rightly point out that it has been a little bit of a drag in 2018 and 2019. I would be disappointed if it didn't become more of a tailwind in 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael McGinn with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.","Michael McGinn","Thanks. If I could lean in on the Zoro and MonotaRO discussion as your model continues to shift more towards a reseller base. What does the business look like today in terms of sourcing and along those lines, what kind of ballpark services are you targeting relative to similar BDC, e-commerce peers, is it something similar like Alibaba in Europe around mid-single-digits or higher something like Amazon is charging?","Donald Macpherson","I'm sorry could you, I'm not sure I fully understand the question. So let me just tell you what we're doing and maybe that will help you help answer it. We are not creating a marketplace Ali Baba or Amazon, we actually will have supplier relationships that we have some of them direct ship to customers from Zoro, that's what we've done on MonotaRO. And so the GPs tend to be slightly less there but not dramatically less when you do that because we don't have big package ship, but it's not like it's a fee and that's all we're getting. So I think it's a different model describing.","Tom Okray","Yes, it is going to be a win-win for the suppliers that are drop shipping and certainly for us.","Michael McGinn","Okay, asked it different way, is MonotaRO currently getting a service fee from Zoro and does that go up over time as the business expands?","Tom Okray","Okay, that's a different question, sorry. Yes, there is a variable service fee that Zoro does pay to MonotaRO and it's based on their profitability.","Michael McGinn","Sorry is it based on Zoro\u2019s profitability?","Tom Okray","Yes.","Michael McGinn","Okay. And what is that currently and what do you expect that to trend to as you build to 10 million skews?","Tom Okray","Yes, not going to go into those types of details.","Donald Macpherson","They'll get bigger, as they're successful, it will get bigger in space. It\u2019s very small, it's a very small portion.","Tom Okray","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company. Please state your question.","Justin Bergner","Two quick ones here most have been answered. With respect to the Canadian gross margin improvement, is that sustainable or was there anything sort of one-time that benefited the fourth quarter?","Tom Okray","Yes, as we said in our prepared remarks, some of that was win dated related to supply chain efficiencies. I guess if I were to score it roughly, I'd say half of it will continue, half of it will fall-off.","Justin Bergner","Okay, that's helpful. And then the retail customer segment improved dramatically in the quarter I guess, to mid-teens growth. Just curious if that sort of idiosyncratic or if there's initiatives there some underlying backdrop is favorable?","Donald Macpherson","Just to be clear, retail for us typically does not mean retail stores; it means warehouses attached to retail. And as you would guess that has continued to be a growing business in the U.S. as more stuff shows up at your door. So that's what's driving that growth. That is a growing thing.","Donald Macpherson","All right, thanks. I appreciate everybody being on the call. I would just reiterate we are really confident in our path. We feel good about sharing profitability in the U.S. We feel really good about the online model excited to have Masaya lead that and drive strong growth and profitability there. And we will get Canada and Cromwell right. But generally, I would say we're very excited about where we're going and appreciate you listening to call today. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.

Research","Patrick Baughman - JPMorgan","Operator","Greetings and welcome to the W.W. Grainger First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Irene Holman, VP, Investor Relations.","Irene Holman","Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Q1 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, CFO.","As a reminder, some of our comments today may be forward-looking based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q1 press release, which is available on the IR website.","Looking at our reported results for the year, we had adjustments resulting in a $2 million impact to operating earnings and a $0.03 impact to EPS. Adjustments included restructuring related to Canada. This morning's call will focus on adjusted results which exclude the items outlined in our press release.","Now, I'll turn it over to D.G.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks, Irene. Good morning and thank you for joining us today.","I'll share an overview of the business, including how we deliver value for our customers and a discussion of our results, then Tom will provide details on the quarter, and we'll open it up for questions.","First, let me tell you what we're seeing with our customers. We spent a lot of time with our customers to understand their needs and that's not just with the C suite but with the people who buy our products and the people on the shop or who use them. That way we can deliver relevant solutions that help solve their problems better than anyone else.","And what always excites me are the relationships that we have. Our relationships are a unique competitive advantage and they are getting stronger. I recently spent time with a spice manufacturing company. This is a very successful business. It's been around for over 100 years. And we have very strong relationships throughout the business, including with the safety manager, the operations manager and the plant controller.","And those relationships helped make our two-hour long visit very productive. We discussed a solution to optimize their spend on hearing protection. We had a roundtable with all the plant leadership that surface new opportunities, and we spent time documenting the value Grainger provides to the plant controller.","Now, as customers experience our broad product line, our technical expertise, our great service and our fast and dependable shipping, we're getting more opportunities. Our goal is to accelerate the pace and intensity with which we demonstrate value to our customers so that we can take advantage of those opportunities. Our team is up for that challenge.","As I mentioned before, we create value for customers through two business models. The first is the high-touch solutions model that serves customers with complex needs. Our Grainger U.S., Canada and Mexico businesses plus Cromwell and Fabory all fit within this model.","The second is the endless assortment model that is focused on customers with less complex needs. This model includes Zoro and MonotaRO and delivers value through a streamlined and simple transaction experience. In each model, we are laser-focused on executing a strategy designed to expand our competitive advantage.","So let's move on to our performance in the quarter, and I'll start with the U.S. The U.S. market was choppy to start the year due to the uncertainty around tariffs, the government shutdown and the inclement weather. While we continue to see growth across all of our end markets, we did see market growth slow versus 2018. We estimate that the U.S. market grew about 2% to 2.5% in Q1, including approximately one point in price.","As a reminder, we lapped a majority of the pricing changes in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2018. In the past, we have used COGS as a proxy for volume to measure our growth with large and midsize customers. Moving forward, we're going to use daily sales growth to simplify our communication around large and midsize performance.","In the first quarter, U.S. large customer daily sales growth was 5% and 11% on a two-year stack. U.S. midsize customer growth was 9% with volume growth of about 8%. On a two-year stack, midsize revenue grew 24%.","In the quarter, we continued to refine our approach with midsize customers, including more aggressive marketing and some market-based pricing adjustments. Given what we've seen so far, we are confident in our continued growth with midsize customers. We expect both large and midsize customer growth to accelerate on a two-year stack in the second quarter.","First quarter sales growth in the U.S. included 1.5 percentage points of price as we pass through both tariff and non-tariff related cost inflation. The uncertainty around tariffs made predicting price a bit more difficult to start the year and we're continuing to adjust prices up and down to ensure that we're market relevant. We spent a lot of time last year executing our pricing changes. We've now shifted to spending more time with customers talking about the value that we create.","Our focus is on a few core initiatives that will help us drive growth both through increasing share of wallet and new customer acquisition. With our large complex customers, we're continuing to work with our sellers and other service representatives to get them information that helps them have better conversations.","We launched a value documentation tool last year to help sellers demonstrate the value we bring to customers through activities such as inventory management, energy management and safety solutions.","When I visit our large customers, I'm routinely reminded of our opportunity to gain share. These customers love working with Grainger and there's definitely room to grow our relationships with them.","For the midsize business, we're seeing growth both with existing and new customers. We are expanding our relationships with these customers through pricing programs, including our Red Pass program which has a free freight component, midsize customers with attractive profiles are getting covered by inside sales teams, and that team continues to drive growth with these customers.","Across the U.S. business, we are actively working on improving our merchandising capability, and we will be adding products to our assortment as an outcome of this work. We are also increasing our marketing dollars and seeing very strong returns on those investments. Overall, we remain confident in our position relative to the market in the U.S., including our ability to grow 300 basis points to 400 basis points faster than the market this year.","In Canada, we continued on our path to stem the volume losses and drive towards sustainable profitable growth. With the cost takeout largely behind us, our focus is squarely on initiatives that will help drive top line performance. We believe our service levels have stabilized and we're starting to hear from customers that our service has improved. We have reworked our sales coverage model and our sellers are excited about driving growth.","Finally, we're starting to gain traction as we leverage our U.S. assortment in Canada and improve our website functionality. We've seen early signs that our volume is starting to stabilize, which is encouraging. We continue to expect Canada to be profitable for the year.","For our other businesses, our top line performance was driven by the strength of the endless assortment model. MonotaRO in Japan and Zoro in the U.S. together drove daily sales growth of 22% for the quarter.","On the fourth quarter call, I mentioned that we would be investing to accelerate growth for the Zoro business in 2019. We made incremental investments in systems, marketing, and talent in the first quarter, and we expect these investments to accelerate growth in the next year and beyond.","Looking at our international portfolio, Cromwell continue to be challenged in the first quarter due to several factors, including the Brexit dynamic in the United Kingdom. The other businesses in the portfolio performed well. For the Company, we performed largely in line with expectations in the quarter.","As I mentioned, revenue was a little softer than we'd like, and profitability was strong. Gross profit was down 15 basis points after normalizing for the timing of the North American sales meeting, and we drove strong expense leverage across the business.","Total Company operating margin grew 80 basis points after normalizing for the timing of the sales meeting. We are reiterating our 2019 total Company guidance.","Now, I'll turn it over to Tom who will discuss the quarter's results in more detail.","Thomas Okray","Thanks D.G.","Total Company sales in the quarter were up 3% daily and up 4% daily on a constant currency basis. Sales in the quarter included a negative 0.5% impact from the lapping of a prior-year change in accounting estimate.","More specifically, a small group of U.S. customers were transitioned from cash to accrual basis accounting as a result of their improved credit profile. Excluding the change, daily sales were up 4.5% on a constant currency basis. Volume was up 3% and price was up 1.5%.","Moving to gross profit, our Q1 gross profit rate was impacted by the timing of our North American sales meeting. Suppliers provide funding for our sales meeting, and this funding benefits gross profit margin. We spread the benefit over three consecutive months beginning in the month of the sales meeting.","In 2018, the sales meeting occurred in February, and in 2019 the sales meeting occurred in March. Normalizing for this impact, gross profit margin declined 15 basis points driven primarily by the other businesses. We drove operating earnings growth of 6% in the quarter and operating margin expanded by 80 basis points versus the prior year after normalizing for the timing of the sales meeting.","We continued to drive SG&A leverage as a result of our expense management and productivity improvements, including the 2018 cost takeout actions in Canada. Operating cash flow was down 14% primarily due to the payout of 2018 incentive compensation in the first quarter of 2019.","Now let's take a look at our performance in the U.S. As D.G. mentioned, the demand environment was a bit weaker than expected. Daily sales were up 3.5% and up 4.5% after normalizing for the prior year change in accounting estimate. Sales growth was comprised of volume growth of 2.5%, price inflation of 1.5% and intercompany sales growth of 0.5%.","Our normalized GP rate increased 35 basis points after adjusting for the timing of the sales meeting. Freight was favorable in the quarter versus the prior year due to less reliance on the spot market and better-than-expected spot rates. Favorable mix also contributed to the increase in gross profit margin.","Including the contract implementations, price cost spread was neutral in the quarter. Operating margin normalized for the timing of the sales meeting was up 50 basis points. SG&A grew at half the rate of sales and incremental margin for the U.S. business was a strong 31%.","In Canada, daily sales were down 24% and down 20% on a constant currency basis. Price was up 4% and volume was down 24%. Gross profit margin was down 125 basis points in the quarter due to a higher E&O write-down, which is tied to our lower volume. SG&A improved by more than 30% in the quarter due to our cost takeout actions in 2018.","We stem the losses versus the prior year, and operating margin improved 240 basis points. We expect performance in Canada to continue to improve throughout the year as our top line initiatives begin to take shape.","Moving on to other businesses. As a reminder, other businesses include our endless assortment model in our international businesses. Daily sales were up 9.5% in the quarter and up 12% on a constant currency basis on strong revenue from our endless installment model. Gross profit margin declined 190 basis points driven by unfavorable customer mix at Cromwell and freight headwinds in Japan.","Operating margin declined 160 basis points for the other businesses. As D.G. mentioned, we are making investments in Zoro U.S. to drive long-term growth. Those investments, plus performance at Cromwell, led to the decline in the operating margin versus the prior year.","Slide 13 covers our guidance for the year. We are reiterating our 2019 total Company guidance, which we shared in January. As a reminder, we are not going to update guidance unless we expect to be outside of the range.","A few noteworthy comments on guidance for the total Company. On the top line, we expect sales growth to be driven by U.S. share gains of 300 basis points to 400 basis points for the year, and the continued strong growth of our endless assortment businesses.","With regard to GP, we did not expect the Q1 U.S. gross profit favorability to repeat. U.S. price cost spread, including the impact of the remaining contract implementations, is still expected to be negative flat for the remainder of the year. From a profitability perspective, we continue to drive expense leverage at the total Company level and are confident in our operating margin guidance for the year.","Now, I'll turn it back to D.G. for closing remarks.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks Tom.","Overall, our results in Q1 were largely in line with our expectations. In the U.S., we're confident in our ability to continue to gain share. We believe we have the right initiatives and the right people in place to drive increasing share of wallet with our existing customers and to attract new midsize customers. In Canada, the cost takeout is behind us and our focus is on stemming the volume loss. We believe we will achieve profitability in 2019.","Our online model continues to drive strong revenue growth, and we are driving strong expense leverage and are on track to achieve our productivity targets. Our strategic initiatives position us well for the long term.","Now, I will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Manthey with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","David Manthey","The first question is on corporate expense, which seemed a little bit low this quarter. And I know there's a lot of factors that play in there, but can you talk about what impacted the first quarter? And then how we should think about the second quarter and the rest of the year if there's any anomalies to consider?","Thomas Okray","Yes, nothing really unusual. Corporate expense for the first quarter, anything that's lower is just due to the productivity initiatives that we have in place, but nothing significant that shouldn't repeat throughout the rest of the year.","David Manthey","And lately, I think, in terms of the medium customer growth, you've been mentioning you thought it could stabilize in the double-digit range. I'm not sure if that was revenues or volumes, but has your expectation for medium customer growth changed at all given this quarter?","Thomas Okray","Yes, I don't think our expectation has changed. I would say that as a reminder, we have a very low share of midsize customers. We have about a two share. There's a lot of room to grow. It's still relatively new to us in terms of the initiatives we've got focused on midsize customers. We continue to improve our ability to use marketing to drive new customer acquisition and penetration and our inside sales team continues to learn to get traction, and we're still understanding how to use pricing programs to drive growth. We still believe that we can hit that low double digit number over time and it's just a matter of how fast we can learn and grow.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Nigel Coe","Just wanted to clarify the comments on corporate expense. Again, I don't want to spend too much time on corporate expense, but, analyzing it's about $104 million in 1Q and you've been in the $140 million to $150 million range for the last couple of years. So just want to clarify that 1Q was a good base for the full year.","Thomas Okray","Yes. 1Q was a good base for the entire year. I mean, there's always some lumpiness in terms of corporate expense, but nothing unusual that's happening there.","Nigel Coe","And then, the other margins were down. You obviously called out Cromwell, and you called out investments. I'm just trying to delineate the impact between the two buckets. Can you maybe just call out what was more impactful? And then, just thinking about then on top of that, the minority line was down slightly, which implies a bit of margin pressure in Japan. Is that the case?","Thomas Okray","So, let me start with the investments in Zoro. Most of those investments are of the shape that we are giving that business more independence allowing them to add products on their own. They added about 200,000 SKUs in the quarter and there's about 800,000 SKUs in the pipeline. So they're really stepping on the accelerator.","Those are significant in terms of the margin drag in the quarter. I would say, for us Cromwell is a bit of a wildcard, given what's going on with that market and what we're seeing. It was significant but we were a little less certain about how that's going to progress as the year plays out given all the uncertainty there. But both were significant, I think notable we continue to invest very heavily in getting Zoro some of the independence it needs to drive growth going forward.","Nigel Coe","Right. And no comments on MonotaRO?","Thomas Okray","I'm sorry. MonotaRO - comments on MonotaRO.","Donald Macpherson","MonotaRO business continues to perform well. There were some freight headwinds in the business, but we're pretty confident in the ability of that business to grow and to have very strong operating margins going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Graham","I want to maybe wrap the previous questions together with a little bit more on the guidance. We come out of the chute with our sales lower. You're saying your operating margin in the U.S. is probably going to be flattish for the rest of the year. We started Canada slow, and you're calling Cromwell a wildcard. I guess I'm just wondering you have indicated that even though you're not going to update during the year, do you think you're tracking toward the middle end? Is the high end of EPS guidance now out of reach? Because I think the only thing that's going against what I just said would be lower corporate.","Thomas Okray","I think - to be clear, I think we're only [three] [ph] months into the quarter. We still feel confident in our ability to gain share in the U.S., obviously with the U.S. earnings rate that's the biggest impact on both sales and earnings for the year.","And then, the uncertainty around the market growth in the U.S. is a pretty big uncertainty. Obviously if the market bounce back and was significantly higher than two, we feel like we could hit the high end of the range. If it stays at the low end of that, that becomes hard to do.","Scott Graham","So you would argue right now that the change, the delta in the U.S. businesses are more because of the market or equally to that price cost? Is that fair when we look at the U.S. change?","Donald Macpherson","Well, the uncertainly is more around the market, and our ability to gain share we feel pretty confident in. We still feel confident in the profitability range for the U.S.","Scott Graham","Last question for me. I was under the impression that the midsize customer thinking was mid-teens, not double digit. Was I - am I wrong on that?","Donald Macpherson","Yes. When we talked in the fourth quarter, we talked about double-digit. Again, that'll depend a lot - in large on the market growth rates. But like I said, we're still learning. We've got a long way to - long runway to grow with midsize customers. We're still learning what's working and we're going to continue to make adjustments and we think we can continue to grow very strongly with midsize customers.","Scott Graham","So that 9 should convert into double digit the rest of the year is kind of what you're implying?","Donald Macpherson","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Evelyn Chow","This is actually Evelyn Chow from Goldman Sachs. Maybe just starting out, I noticed you - you have the U.S. price cost guide the same. But now that tariffs haven't really stepped up to the 25% rate, I just wanted to clarify, would you expect to maybe get some pricing back as we go through the year and that's partly what's driving the maintained U.S. price cost guidance?","Donald Macpherson","So, I would say that we continue to look at competitive market prices and we will continue to adjust. We would not expect necessarily the 1.5 price to stay at 1.5 as you see in our forecast going forward. But certainly the adjustments we're making are fairly minor, and they are based on just market competitiveness.","Evelyn Chow","And then, just returning to your comments on the demand environment being weaker than expected, when I actually look at your sales growth by customer vertical, only government really stands out having decelerated versus prior quarter. So is that really where you're seeing the most weakness in your end markets or does that maybe mask some underlying things that aren't coming out in just the total vertical growth?","Donald Macpherson","Yes. So we saw some weakness in government as you highlight. I would say in light manufacturing, we've also seen some weakness in terms of market growth rates. And overall, it's been slightly less than our projections and obviously there's a lot of uncertainty if you look sort of at the forward-looking - what people are talking about there's anything from deceleration to acceleration coming in the back half of the year depending on what you're looking.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Merkel","So my first question is on the U.S. gross margin. Just want to make sure I heard the commentary right. So it sounds like the big change for the rest of the year is going to be the government contract price resetting there, so then price cost is going to turn to flat to maybe slightly down. Is that correct?","Donald Macpherson","No. The government contract has already started to be implemented so you saw a lot of that in the first quarter. There were modest price changes that we continue to make to be competitive with market, but we still feel like the original guide on GDP is the right guy for us and is effectively for the rest of the year. So that's all we're saying.","Ryan Merkel","So just you had a strong start, you just don't expect it to continue and you're sort of referencing of that.","Donald Macpherson","Yes. Sequentially we normally see gross profit go down throughout the year. We have freight favorability, not sure that that will continue, we have some mix pickup as well. So, we're comfortable with the guide that we gave at the beginning of the year.","Ryan Merkel","And then, just turning to Canada, it sounds like you still expect improvement in volume through the year. Can you just run through the initiatives again? And then, more importantly, are you seeing any signs that these initiatives are gaining traction, because it looks like so far in the first quarter we're not seeing too much improvement, but could you help us out there?","Donald Macpherson","Well, we are seeing - what I'd say, we are seeing Ryan is, we're seeing the volume stabilize when we look at the run rate. So we've seen some benefit. I would say that the initiatives that are gaining traction for sure, we've added a number of products from the U.S. to the assortment, and that has gotten a nice pickup and we're starting to see some benefit from that. We expect to add as many as 100,000 items from the U.S. assortment that can help serve customers in Canada, so that's pretty exciting.","We're seeing some sales force effectiveness work. We train all the sellers in the first quarter. We're starting to get some traction with what our sellers are doing in the marketplace, and that's important. I think the most important one is on the service side.","We are starting to see some stabilization with service improvements, closing that many branches just frankly had a very significant impact on service in that market. And we're starting to see some of that stabilize. And so, we feel like those three are very, very important and we see those things will start to see the benefits we talked about.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Deane Dray","Was hoping that you could comment on the impact of weather this quarter. And just I wanted to also point out that there was - you did not use it as an excuse. There were a number of distributors who complained about the weather. Your comment did not constitute an excuse, so appreciate that. So talk about the weather and quantify it if you could. And then also, was there any effects of pull forward where some demand might have been lost in the first quarter and pulled into the fourth quarter. Do you see any evidence of that?","Donald Macpherson","Yes. So, on the second question, we don't see real evidence that there was pull-forward in the markets we serve and the way we serve them, we don't typically see that. We typically are the ones that are stocking items for customers. You don't see - you don't see customers pre-ordering typically.","In terms of weather, I mean the weather events were fairly notable in the news. They had a minor impact and there is a lot of noise in any given quarter and we just - holiday timing was favorable, for Easter weather was a little negative, but none of that was really worth talking about in the quarter. So we didn't highlight that.","Deane Dray","Appreciate that. And I see that Tom provided more precision in volume and price this quarter in increments of 50 basis points. Is that going to be a go-forward practice?","Thomas Okray","Well, we're always looking to improve Deane and sharpen the pencil wherever we can. So, I appreciate you're noticing that.","Deane Dray","That's helpful. And then just last one. Did I notice that freight was less of a drag in the U.S.? You're not using spot market as often and spot rates were better. Maybe just some color there, and that's it for me.","Donald G. Macpherson","Yes. That's correct, Deane. We saw favorable economics in the overall freight market. We didn't use as much in terms of spot rates using more truck loads - full truck loads, all of that contributed to favorability in the U.S.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Barry with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Barry","Just wanted to clarify on the comments about prices. It sounds like there are some places where prices in the market are going down. Is that the case and is that commodity driven or what's driving that?","Donald Macpherson","No, I wouldn't say that prices are going down. I would say, given the uncertainty around tariff, there was a lot of movement in prices. And prices are always adjusting in a minor way up and down, but we don't see any downward pressure on prices in general, that's not what we're seeing.","Robert Barry","And then, I guess, a question on the SG&A growth. So, in the adjusted model, only 2% in the quarter, just how should we think about that kind of going through the year? Maybe it doesn't sound low given the sales growth, but just in the context of the rest of the year, would you expect that to accelerate or do you think you can hold that kind of growth?","Thomas Okray","Yes. I mean, we continue to say we're going to grow SG&A at half while we grow sales, and that's what we're shooting for. We've got a good productivity culture in the company. So that's what we expect to tract to for the remainder of the year.","Donald Macpherson","Yes, I would also highlight that we've talked about sort of north of $50 million in terms of productivity, and we still fully expect to get that. So we feel like we're on track with what our plans.","Thomas Okray","Yes. One of the things that's really helping out Q1 is, if you look at the commitment that was made, $150 million to $210 million, if we look at what we've achieved today, we're already tracking at the high end of that. So that's certainly helping us in the SG&A area.","Robert Barry","Just lastly, could I clarify the comments on the large and medium growing? You talked, I think, about them growing - the growth accelerating on a two-year stack basis. Second quarter, do you also expect it to accelerate just on an annual basis?","Thomas Okray","So we talked about the two-year stack, and obviously last year I think we grew 20% in mid-sized customers. So we do expect to continue to see strong growth in the second quarter. We don't give quarterly guide, but our expectation is continue to see stronger.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzwinksi with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Pokrzwinksi","Just a follow-up on that last question on mid-sized customer. I cannot but notice that the convention changed a little bit in the slides where you're doing sales instead of volume now. So I appreciate the color on 8% volume growth in the quarter. But just thinking about that flip on price from negative to positive, how should we expect that to trend going forward? Is that something that should be a lot more stable going forward? Or if we had kind of a lack of acceleration here through the balance of the year, could that start going the other direction again?","Donald Macpherson","Now we feel like - we've talked about this before as we've made the pricing changes. We feel like we're competitive now. So we should be in a much more stable price and price cost environment that we've been in the last couple of years, and we would expect that to continue.","Josh Pokrzwinksi","And then, I think, related to Deane's earlier question about pull forward, I guess, maybe to look at it from a different direction, I think distributors in general added a bit more inventory in the fourth quarter, yourselves included. Is there any impact that we should think about in terms of the rebate outlook for 2019, especially in light of maybe a bit softer first quarter where you guys are de-stocking a little, better managing inventory a little bit more tightly, and you're not purchasing as much or is that something that you feel like you've contemplated in guidance already?","Donald Macpherson","So, just for everybody's benefit, we manage inventory typically to service levels. We did pull forward some inventory buy in the fourth quarter. Our service levels are very strong. Our expectation is that we'll continue to have very strong inventory levels. It's too early to comment on any impact to the rebate. And right now, I would say, there's very little chance that the rebate will be impacted by last year's pull forward.","Josh Pokrzwinksi","Got it. It's helpful.","Thomas Okray","It was a small full forward last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Glynn","I wanted to follow-up on, I think, Evelyn's question, talked about medium and large customers doing some market-based pricing adjustments. So I think the prior view was, no more resets were needed and you're also seemingly saying very stable price cost environment. So just wanted to drill down into the fresher comments about some further market-based pricing adjustments.","Thomas Okray","Yes. Some of those will be up some of those will be down. We will always be adjusting our prices. We're always going to make sure that we're market competitive. The one thing I would highlight from this quarter was that given the expectation of tariff rates going in and what actually happened, there's probably more market-based adjustments. It's not a price strategy change. It's just making sure that they are competitive going forward.","Christopher Glynn","And then, the accounting change that comparison is just a one-off in the first quarter?","Thomas Okray","It is. We mentioned it in the call last year in Q1 as a tailwind. So we just - for completeness, I wanted to mention it as a headwind in Q1, then we're done with it.","Christopher Glynn","And then lastly, as you look at April playing out and your share strategies with the medium, etcetera, do you expect the second quarter top-line to be consistent with the full year range?","Donald Macpherson","Well, as we've said, our expectation is that we will continue to gain share at the rate we described. And our expectation is, the market growth will be between 1 and 4 as we described as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Hamzah Mazari","My first question is just on the medium customer side. I know you've touched on sort of the two-year stack and growth in Q2, but any comments as to what the makeup of new customers is versus sort of a year ago? Question really is, are new customers adding more to growth than you've seen last year or wherever past comparison you want to use?","Thomas Okray","No, we continue to see strong growth from existing customers and growth from new customers. We're probably going to be talking about that moving forward, but we haven't given a specific percent. But we're pretty happy with both the new customer acquisition and the existing customers.","Hamzah Mazari","And just my follow-up question is just around M&A. Has the thought process that changed at all, D.G.? I mean most of your deals have been in Europe, and Canada the last few years. I think a U.S. deal was in safety a number of years ago. It seems like the market is still very fragmented on the FM side. There's potentially some chunkier deals in areas where you don't play on the FM side as much. Just any thoughts as to how you're thinking about the portfolio. I know you highlighted some issues at Cromwell, but just any broad-based thoughts on portfolio and M&A?","Donald Macpherson","So, I would say that our focus is squarely on growing organically, first. That is our primary focus. For all kinds of reasons, we have not had great success with M&A, and we feel like we're not afraid of M&A, but we are more focused on making sure we grow organically. We think that's best for our shareholders and for team members and for our customers. So that's our primary focus.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Volkmann","Just a couple of quick cleanups, if I may. The timing of the sales meeting this year, does that benefit the gross margin in the second quarter a little bit?","Donald Macpherson","Yes, it will. So we'll be adjusting that in Q2 as well.","Steve Volkmann","And then, the shipping and logistics costs being lower, that seems like given where pricing looks and futures, et cetera, that should be sustainable going forward, but it sounds like you're not really baking that in?","Donald Macpherson","It might be sustainable. At this point, we're sticking with our original guidance, and we certainly hope it continues. Can't disagree with your thought process there.","Steve Volkmann","And then, the final one. It just seems like you maybe were off to a little bit of a slow start on share repurchases, are you still thinking $450 million to $600 million?","Thomas Okray","Yes, we are. I'm not sure it was a slow start. It was 458,000 shares, $135 million. So, that was pretty sizable amount.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Dankert","I guess, first off, thinking about the other business, I guess, do run rate investment cost peak in the first quarter here or there's still kind of some additional initiatives that you guys are still keeping the pedal down and we'll see cost a bit more moving to 2Q and 3Q.","Donald Macpherson","Yes. We will continue to make investments in Zoro through most of this year. We would expect both of those investments to be made this year versus the future years.","Chris Dankert","Which is just on a run rate basis though first quarter versus second, fairly linear?","Donald Macpherson","Yes. I mean, similar I would say. But at a whole company level, not meaningfully different going forward.","Chris Dankert","And then, thinking about Canada, I mean, again, a lot of moving parts and a lot to parse through, but I mean is it fair to assume that we really won't see positive profitability till we get to the back half of the year here?","Donald Macpherson","We would expect the back half of the year to show profitable business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner with G. Research. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Bergner","My principal question is, the level of outgrowth in Q1 was, I guess, 200 to 250 basis points in the U.S. based on the metrics you provided. Could you maybe comment on what limited the level of outgrowth this quarter such that you should be able to get back to the 300 to 400 basis point range as the year progresses?","Thomas Okray","So, I guess - I would start by saying, if you look sort of at a 20-year history, generally we would have said 200 to 250 basis points is pretty good. So, it wasn't a horrifically bad share gain quarter.","That said, we feel like we need to grow faster than that. We feel like 300 to 400 is where we can grow in U.S. There's a number of changes we've made and just we've made really throughout the business, marketing in particular. We've talked about minor, minor pricing adjustments. We've talked about some of the work we're doing with our sales organization to accelerate growth. So, we are focused on making sure that we're taking the right actions to accelerate that 300 to 400 basis points.","Justin Bergner","Just secondly, in terms of the corporate costs, if we end up annualizing near that $25 million per quarter run rate, we'll get to a annual corporate cost that's meaningfully below prior years. And I was just trying to understand what is the enabling driver or drivers there that the track we're on?","Thomas Okray","Yes. I mean, it's just primarily productivity that - or productivity initiatives. No more color than that at this point.","Justin Bergner","But there's not anything funny in terms of stock options or pension or anything that's non-productivity-related that may explain part of the delta or expected delta?","Thomas Okray","I mean, there is one funny thing in terms of Fabory loan forgiveness in the first quarter, that - it's net neutral for the company, but it is showing up in Q1.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Baughman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Baumann","Couple questions. Just a point of clarification on the U.S. segment daily sales growth, it was up 3.5% in the quarter, but then you had a slide upfront showing large up 5% and medium up 9%. So I'm just curious what's happening in other areas maybe that are making that headline a little bit lower.","Donald Macpherson","Yes. There's a couple of things happening there related to our specialty business and also our sourcing business. That's what's driving the reduction.","Patrick Baumann","You said sourcing business? What exactly do you mean by that?","Donald Macpherson","So, the way we look at mid-sized and large customer growth, it accounts for about 90% of the business. The 10% is just some noise in there and didn't see growth for some of our specialty business areas. And so that's what's driving the difference.","Patrick Baumann","And then just on advertising growth, last year was pretty - it was up almost 30%, which I guess the digital marketing initiatives you guys are undergoing. Just wanted to check in on how you guys are measuring effectiveness of the spend and if you expect to continue to grow that bucket at that kind of a growth rate this year.","Donald G. Macpherson","Yes. Our advertising spend is really in three buckets: one, the catalog, one is basically mass media, and the other is digital. We track all of those in terms of return on investment, and all are very strong. The catalog, while we don't produce many books is a very strong return on investment. We see radio as providing very strong returns and continue to see that.","And then, with digital, we continue to see very strong returns, and that's fairly dynamic. We continue to shift in and out of specific channels. Overall, we see nice returns in the first quarter and we expect to see that moving forward.","Patrick Baumann","And then last one for me. Just back to the discussion on price\/cost. You had said including contract implementations that price\/cost was neutral in the first quarter, which I guess it means that it's positive excluding those contract implementations. And then, obviously, you've said that price will be adjusted to remain market competitive. So is then the right inference that there was a benefit related to the timing of price versus cost increases from tariffs in the first quarter, some of which you're going to get back through the year? Or am I misreading that?","Thomas Okray","No, that's correct.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I'd like to turn the call back to D.G. Macpherson for closing remarks.","Donald Macpherson","Thank you for joining us this morning. Appreciate all the questions. I would just reiterate what we said in the opening. We continue to be very confident in the business in the U.S. We continue to be confident in our ability to gain share and to do so profitably. In Canada, we recognize the challenges there, but we do expect to stabilize that business. And given the actions we've taken around cost, that can be a very profitable growth business for us.","We continue to be excited about the online business and the growth and profitability there. And we continue to do a nice job of managing SG&A while continuing to invest heavily in the business, we're going to continue to invest in the business. So, overall, we feel like we're off to a decent start for the year and confident going forward. Thanks for your time.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

Grainger\u2019s First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Laura Brown, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.","Laura Brown","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Grainger\u2019s Q1 quarterly earnings call. With me is DG Macpherson, CEO and Ron Jadin, Senior Vice President and CFO.","As a reminder, some of our comments today maybe forward-looking, based on our current risk of future events and our actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. These documents are available on our IR website together with reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with the corresponding GAAP measures.","Now DG will be making some opening comments regarding the performance of the Company with a deeper dive on our pricing actions specifically in the U.S. He will then turn the call over to Ron to discuss the financial implications of our pricing actions along with updated 2017 and 2019 guidance. After closing remarks, we'll open the call for questions. DG to you.","Donald G. Macpherson","Thanks Laura, and thanks everyone for joining us today. So the main event as Laura implicated was price for the quarter. And as we discussed in November, we are laser focused on creating value for our customers. Customers value our product breadth and delivery capabilities, they value our sales and service model for large customers, and they value our strong customer service capabilities overall. But we all know that our prices have been a significant source of dissatisfaction for our customers. And we really haven't been able to leverage digital capabilities like digital marketing to acquire new customers and to grow with existing customers.","As a result, we've taken action to improve our pricing, so that we can grow share with existing customers and attract new customers. Now in the quarter the volume response to the pricing changes was faster, more immediate and stronger than we anticipated. Given this response, we've made the decision to accelerate our pricing actions this year. This is absolutely the right thing to do for the business and it provides Grainger with a sustainable long-term platform for future growth.","It allows us to market our offer more aggressively. The decision to accelerate involves a large GP write-down in the short-term, but it is accretive to earnings over the long-term. Ron is going to talk about the changes to guidance as a result of this acceleration later in the call. Before I go into more detail on pricing, I\u2019m going to talk about Company results for a few minutes.","Now as a reminder, this morning's call is going to focus really entirely on adjusted results which exclude restructuring. So revenue in the quarter was up 1%, volume was healthy at up 5%. Our gross profit and our operating margin were significantly impacted by the pricing actions which we mentioned before. Operating earnings were down 14%, operating cash flow was actually up 13% driven mostly by working capital.","So I am going to talk about non-U.S. businesses first; so our other businesses which includes our online model and our businesses in LATAM, Europe and China performed as expected. Other business sales were up 12% and that includes a 3% headwind from foreign exchange. Operating earnings for the segment were up 45%. Now the online business is driven by MonotaRO in Japan and Zoro in the U.S. continued to deliver strong sales growth of 23% and the operating margin in those businesses expanded by 100 basis points, so great progress with the online model.","Switching to Canada for a moment, our sales increased 1% in local currency. The good news here is that our service levels have stabilized and we're hearing very good things from our customers in terms of those service levels. We started pricing actions in Canada where contract customers were implementing additional price increases that really are going to offset currency related COGS inflation. As you might recall, during the ERP implementation, we did not take price increases that related to currency translation we otherwise would have.","The service stabilization took longer than anticipated and that has delayed the realization of our price increases. For non-contract customers, we are introducing \u2013 also introducing market-based pricing somewhat to that in the U.S. In the quarter, gross margin in Canada declined 270 basis points versus the prior year and while price increases have lagged our plans, we have seen sequential improvement month-by-month in the first quarter.","Year-over-year in Canada, our operating expenses were up and that's really impacted by two things. The first is 2016 had the sale of the old Toronto distribution center that obviously did not repeat this share. So that was a gain or a benefit in 2016, not repeat in 2017. And the other is we reinstated the annual sales meeting this year which did not take place as we went through the ERP limitation in 2016.","Based on continued service improvements, based on the pricing actions we are taking and starting to see some progress on and based on the strong cost actions we will put in place, we still plan to breakeven as we exit 2017. And as we go forward more fully describe our actions and progress in Canada in the coming months.","So turning to the U.S., U.S. results are really all about the strategic pricing actions that we are taking. Sales in the U.S. were down 1%, but volume was up 4% entirely driven by price. So let's talk about pricing. As we discussed in November, our price structure has been a period of growth across the business. With midsized customers, it has hurt our ability to acquire new customers and it also hurt our ability to penetrate midsized customers.","With large customers, pricing has been a barrier to capturing all of the volume with customers, our customers tell us time and again that they want to consolidate their purchases with us, but our price has been a barrier to that spot buy. So we took action in the quarter to lay the foundation for sustainable share gain and customer acquisition. In January, we adjusted list prices to support large customers consolidating their purchases. That resulted in some list prices going up and some going down. That was a huge change from a list price perspective in the quarter.","In early February, we introduced web pricing for about 450,000 SKUs, which is essentially market based pricing. To get that pricing customers today have to opt in to that price online or on the phone. We also continue to negotiate large customer contracts with the updated pricing structure that's a process that we started in the fourth quarter of 2015. As a reminder, large contract customers generally have competitive prices. We're adjusting the structure to make it more attractive for them to consolidate all of their volume with Grainger.","So our initial results from the pricing actions have been positive. We saw stronger than expected price elasticity on the list price changes that means both places where we've raised prices and places where we've lowered price. For large and midsized non-contract customers who opted into our web pricing program, volume had been declining at double-digits and is now growing at mid-single digits.","Now this is off a relatively small base, but it is a representative base, it represents only a third of our assortment, and we have not yet been able to market web prices aggressively given the requirement for customers to opt into the new pricing. For contract customers where we have implemented pricing changes for the spot buy purchases. Our results are quite encouraging, total volume growth for these customers has increased from 4% to 9%.","We've now work through enough contracts to get a feel for how customers will respond to these changes and these customers are very supportive of these changes. Overall, we've also seen customers buying at their new price points versus requesting quotes. This is a good sign it affirms that more relevant pricing simplifies the process and makes Grainger easier to do business with.","So spending a moment on volume, we've seen the strongest volume growth in two years for the quarter. And we expect to see volume grow in the U.S., about 6% for the year and while some of this is certainly a slightly improved market, our volume performance this year should be improved on a relative basis. So we're excited about the volume trends.","Now based on these results, we've made the decision to accelerate our pricing actions into 2017. The actions will begin in the third quarter and will include three things. We will introduce web prices on the entire assortment SKUs and eliminate the opt-in requirement at that time. We will add digital marketing under the Grainger brand. So we are going to use digital marketing to acquire customers under the Grainger brand, which we've not been able to do, and we're going to accelerate the large contract customer negotiations during the period between now in the third quarter.","We are excited about these actions and we expect them to speed up customer retention efforts to accelerate our customer acquisition and help us gain back the spot buy volume, and we will also help us simplify our pricing structure and accelerate our ability to lower expenses relative to our price complexity today and it also allows to put the pricing change behind us faster, enabling stronger sales growth and improved operating margins.","With these changes, there is obviously an impact this year Ron will talk about, but we do expect to be back on track to hit our 2019 guidance, operating margin of 12% to 13%. Importantly, we are going to eliminate a significant barrier for our customers, while we won't have the lowest price in the market, we will be competitive which will be a very attractive for our customers given our industry leading supply chain and service model.","Ron is going to talk about guidance in a minute, but our expectation is that the pricing acceleration will allow us to change our trajectory and get back to our long-term operating margin guidance by 2019. To do that we are going to have to continue on the cost leverage path that we have been on for the last few years.","Now to be clear, this is a huge change for Grainger. It's not an easy one to execute, but this is absolutely the right thing to do. We will be more competitive. We will provide a much better customer experience and we are going to allow Grainger to compete leading with our strikes.","So with that, I will turn it over to Ron.","Ronald Jadin","Thanks, DG. As DG noted, we've decided to accelerate the pricing actions in the U.S. this year versus spreading them out over a multi-year period to drive faster volume growth across all customers and enables more aggressive marketing to new and existing customers.","On Slide 12, we explain the effect of our Q1 pricing actions and the acceleration. We will post additional reference slides to the IR site after the call. The top of the slide, the pie charts represents the U.S. large and medium business or $7 billion of the approximately $8 billion total U.S. segment, which includes specialty brands and inter-company sales to Zoro. The numbers below the line represents the U.S. segment.","Today of the total $7 billion in U.S. large and medium business 60% or roughly $4 million is competitively priced and we will adjust prices as appropriate with inflation and other factors. $2 billion is less competitively priced and will be addressed through our contracting process. Previous guidance anticipated this taking multiple years. We've since found a way to expedite the process, removing the barrier to accelerating web pricing. This also enables us to regain some of the spot buy business we were losing.","We expect this work to be complete by the end of 2018. So as you move to the pie charts on the right you see that slice of the pie goes away over the course of 2017 and 2018. So $1 billion is also less competitively priced and it is not part of a contract. With the web price acceleration in the third quarter of 2017 and more aggressive marketing will reverse the share decline in acquiring new customers. When you look at the full-year 2017 that slice of the pie will be competitively priced.","First quarter pricing actions that DG mentioned earlier drove price deflation of 4% and GP margin decline of 190 basis points for the U.S. segment. With the acceleration of our pricing action from 2018 into the third quarter of 2017, we now expect U.S. price deflation of 5% for the year and a gross margin decline of 210 basis points in 2017. GP declines at a lesser rate than price in 2017 due to a benefit from COGS deflation as well as favorable mix.","In 2018, the pie chart on the far right and the numbers on the bottom right corner, our pricing strategy will be fully deployed and the negative impact on price and GP rate will be complete.","Now let's take a look at our 2017 guidance. Our first quarter results generated a higher customer volume response at lower price points versus our expectations. Accordingly, we recognized the need to lower our 2017 guidance. The middle column illustrates our 2017 assumption based on our learnings from the first quarter. This would put us at the low end of our January EPS guidance after removing the $0.13 benefit from the accounting change noted in the earnings release. Footnotes A and B on the slide reflect this point.","The last column highlights the midpoint of our revised guidance including the price acceleration. It anticipates an incremental operating earnings write-down to $75 million comprised of $60 million in gross margin decline and $15 million in marketing expense to support the newly visible web pricing. The corresponding EPS write-down is $0.80 getting us to a midpoint of $10.65. Please reference our earnings release supplement for the new sales and EPS guidance ranges.","On Slide 14, the price acceleration is a headwind to 2017 and 2018 gross profit margin, but enables us to recover operating margin by 2019. Our 2019 operating margin expectations of 12% to 13% remain consistent with what we shared at our Investor Day last November. Favorable mix and continued strong cost productivity and volume leverage allow us to stay on track and better positions us for stronger volume share gains and margin growth well into the future.","Now I\u2019ll turn it back to DG for closing remarks.","Donald G. Macpherson","Thank you, Ron. Cost productivity is a key component to making sure that we achieve our forward-looking goals, I think it's important to understand the progress that we've made on cost. So the chart shows that over the last four years, we've demonstrated an ability to manage expenses and to drive productivity and we're going to continue to do so going forward.","We generally look at both expense to sales and expense to COGS, which is more of an activity metric to measure our progress. And you'll hear more from us as we go through the year on how we're going to get to 2019, but continuing this cost leverage path is going to be a very important part of that story and we feel like we've got strong momentum here to continue to improve our cost structure.","So overall, it was a challenging quarter, but we are very focused on what matters to drive value. We continue to be encouraged by the growth and the profit improvement of our online businesses, we've stabilized service levels in Canada, we need to do a lot more to improve both price realization and the cost structure of the business. In the U.S., the pricing acceleration is going to allow us to be more aggressive in our marketing efforts to drive market share gains and to allow new customer acquisition with the Grainger brand.","Most importantly, we are completely focused on creating a flawless customer experience. So a change of this nature is challenging and it's complex. We know this is the right thing to do for the long-term success of the business and we are committed to making the changes needed to accelerate growth and to get back to the profitability that we expect.","So with that, I will open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And now I\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Manthey with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.","David Manthey","Hi. Good morning, all.","Donald G. Macpherson","Good morning.","David Manthey","First question is as it relates to this trade-off between price and volume. They have significantly different impacts on overall profitability, given that prices it reads through at such a high rate. So what I'm thinking about here is as you look at these efforts, do you think that several years down the road you'll be able to breakeven in terms of profit dollars or does your profitability take a secular step down in the process here?","Donald G. Macpherson","Thanks Dave. I think it's a great question. And our expectation now is that we were more than breakeven in terms of profit dollars as we get the volume growth and improve our cost structure to get the operating margins back to our expectations. So it's a significant challenge in 2017 and 2018, but by 2019 we feel like our profit dollars will be at or higher than they would otherwise have been.","David Manthey","Okay. I guess we don't have the slides here, I guess other than the webcast, so I\u2019ll have to take a look at those later, but at your Analyst Day you shared with us some data that showed how more competitive pricing leads to faster growth among medium and larger customers. What happened in the first quarter that surprised you relative to that data? It sounds like something happened that you didn't expect here in the first quarter, but you have that data lined up, it seems like you had a pretty good beat on it initially, what was different?","Donald G. Macpherson","Yes. It\u2019s a great question. So I would say that the behavior at a customer level, so if you think about large customers who go along the new pricing model or small, mid-sized customers that opt-in to web pricing was exactly as we would have expected. I think the web pricing uptick was maybe a little higher without doing any marketing that which will be expected, but generally those two were as expected. The big change was when we altered the list prices that had a big impact \u2013 a bigger impact than we expected both on prices that we raised and prices that declined.","And so that had an immediate impact that we were not fully expecting and that has been the biggest part of the surprise. Now that's long-term not particularly relevant because we will get out of the list price game and we will go to web prices and so web prices are going to be the full story. But in the short-term that has been the biggest surprise that we have.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Please go ahead with your questions.","Ryan Merkel","Thanks. First is the 2019 long-term operating margin guidance of 12%, 13%, is that the new long-term range? Or is that just the signpost to the 2021 guidance that you had previously at 13% to 14%?","Ronald Jadin","Yes, that's just a guidepost for where we're heading Ryan so that's \u2013 we're not saying anything new about 2021.","Ryan Merkel","Got it, okay. And then what gross margin are you assuming in the 2019 guidance?","Ronald Jadin","Sure, so we have guidance for 2017 and 2018 on the pie chart and \u2013 for the U.S. segment, we have expect the U.S. segment in the company going with it probably GP margin improvement of 25 to 50 basis points. So that's where we start to see the volume of the favorable mix outpaced the pricing, because we get the pricing behind this in 2018.","Donald G. Macpherson","Yes. And I would just add a point, we've been talking for probably close to 10 years about unfavorable customer mix and when we make these changes, our expectation is by 2019 that's not going to be the story that we're going to have a favorable mix and start growing parts of the business that haven't been growing that are actually more profitable.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. I don't have the slide deck either. But it sounds like you're saying that 2017 is the bottom for gross margin and that you could actually expect it to rise in 2018 and 2019?","Ronald Jadin","No, we expect 2018 to be the bottom because the changes we make in the second half of this year will also flow through to 2018. We expected to rise in 2019 Ryan.","Ryan Merkel","Got it, okay. And then lastly on price, just two part question, was the two-year plan always for lower prices around that 4% level? And then secondly, can you unpack how you arrive at the price down for? What are the pieces?","Donald G. Macpherson","Well, so that the short answer Ryan is that it's not \u2013 it\u2019s very similar to what we always expected in terms of the price impact overall. So the difference here is we had talked about moving the large customer contracts over three years to four years. And so we had spread out that impact over a longer period of time than we're talking about now.","But the overall impact is very similar to what we always expected and most of the impact is re-pricing - resetting the price for customer acquisition and for spot buy for large customers and given the mix of our business, the spot buy for large customers initially is actually probably the bigger impact, what is the bigger impact, but none of the total expectation of impact is changed at all.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning. Can you hear me?","Donald G. Macpherson","Yes, hello.","Robert McCarthy","Okay, yes. Okay, so two questions, one of substance and probably one of form the substance is first. I mean, could you talk about that your OpEx and operating structure and maybe thinking about your store footprint and your overall footprint in the context of what is a profoundly different changed in business model given these pricing actions?","Donald G. Macpherson","Yes, sure. So let me talk about the cost structure, maybe broadly. So on the branch issue, I think most people are familiar we've gone from [420 to 250] branches in the U.S. So we're relatively pleased with what we're actually seeing from the volume perspective in those remaining 250 branches and that's been a big shift from the recent past.","The other thing to consider here is that these price changes are likely to have an impact on volume through those 250 branches, because a lot of those customers find sticker shock in our branches when they \u2013 especially small ones when they walk into them. So we want to watch that very closely, but we have a very well developed muscle for evaluating branch profitability.","Overall, I would say that more of our volumes going to eCommerce, no question, winning based on eCommerce capabilities is absolutely critical. More of our volume is being shipped. Continuing to invest in our physical distribution capabilities outside of distribution center just important as a way to create competitive advantage and widen our competitive advantage.","There is some changes we're making to areas like the contact centers where we are consolidating contact centers and lowering our cost in contact centers and to my point earlier, we are getting rid of cost, really in every part of the business. Our expectation is that we will get more productive in the sales force, more productive in the distribution centers, more productive in the branches, in headquarters, all of that needs to improve and that's going to be a big focus for us.","Robert McCarthy","The second question little tougher and I'm going to try to be prolific as I possibly can given the environment and what we're talking about here. But obviously DG, these are trends that we've seen with this change that are not particularly surprising, particularly for some investors and particularly for some bearers on Grainger.","I guess you stepped into the new role of CEO, and kind of the October timeframe you have no opportunity to maybe address those concerns in November and kind of reset the bar for where we think pricing actions could take and maybe you get one swing at the back for kind of doing that.","And now you're in a situation where you have to reduce guidance and at least near-term I think it's appropriate to say that management credibility you spend right in terms of the near-term operating environment and what you're seeing in terms of price. How are you going to restore that credibility over time and what should we think about in terms of your feel for how the business is going to go over the next 18 months? What\u2019s the signpost can we look at to say that, how you feel the business is going to shakeout, bottom in 2018, going into 2019, what should we looking for to give us some confidence that what you've reset is kind of the appropriate trajectory?","Donald G. Macpherson","Right. So we are going to over communicate on what we're seeing from the changes we make. My expectation is that we will see the volume growth that we're talking about that will be a signpost, the expense to COGS will be a signpost and we'll talk a lot about what actions we're taking, what we're seeing from a productivity perspective.","But I appreciate your comment and your question. The reality is that this is the biggest change and we had not changed enough prices yet in November to exactly know what was going to happen and it was improved at that point to talk about acceleration, we didn't know we are going to accelerate; now we do.","It is a change I recognize that it's a difficult change, but we're going to basically track very closely what we're seeing from a volume, from an expense to COGS perspective, from a customer satisfaction perspective, from a customer acquisition perspective. The reality is we have not been able to acquire a customer into the Grainger brand for years and we are now going to start acquiring customers for the Grainger brand starting in the third quarter. And so that's a big shift for us and one that we're really excited about and we're confident we are going to get the results.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Adam Uhlman","Hi, good morning.","Donald G. Macpherson","Hi, Adam.","Adam Uhlman","Ron, I guess first on the gross margin guidance for the year, we started the first quarter, down 160 basis points. And then I guess we're expected to stay at that pace for the rest of the year, but the same time, pricing is expected to deteriorate. I guess what is the gross margin get worse as the year progresses?","Ronald Jadin","Couple of things. We expect that the COGS deflation will continue to be a partial offset and we've seen some favorable product mix. The interesting thing is that even though we've reduced the pricing on 450,000 SKUs and of course a million and a half of them by the middle of the year. We're seeing some nice volume lift on those products, still at GP rates that are above the Company average. So we take a big price hit upfront, but then we get that volume and that shows up in mix on those higher margin products. So that \u2013 we've seen some of that in the first quarter, we expect to see more of that as the year goes on.","Adam Uhlman","Okay. Gotcha. And then after you adjusted price on that, first 450,000 SKUs, could you help us out with the magnitude of the reductions that are planned for the remaining products set?","Ronald Jadin","In terms of SKU count, I\u2019m not sure what your question is exactly.","Adam Uhlman","The size of the reduction and price across the remaining SKUs?","Ronald Jadin","So the $75 million is the price reduction for the acceleration in the third quarter of the remaining SKUs. So it's $75 million price reduction. We expect some volume response from that, which is about $35 million. So the net of those is kind of the topline. We'll get a little bit of a GP benefit, if you think of that $35 million at 40% adds another $15 million to margin to GP margin dollars.","So the net at GP, we set at $60 million. So price write-down is $75 million, you get $15 million of it back in the short-term. Right, you don\u2019t get it all back right away, so we set the GP dollar impact at $60 million and we're going to spend about $15 million in marketing across the board of these SKUs, so that we put that in there too.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your questions.","Andrew Buscaglia","Hi, guys. Can you talk a little bit about \u2013 at your Analyst Day you said that this wouldn't be a race to the bottom. How are you thinking of the competitors in your space listening to these price actions, you know they are not really talking about this. And how do you guys discuss internally what you think the implications are of your pricing actions as it pertains to competitors and the race to the bottom?","Donald G. Macpherson","So we certainly don't. Our experience with prices that we change would suggest that we are absolutely not in a race to the bottom. When we have competitive prices and they're in the ballpark we are winning the business and it allows our customers to consolidate their purchases with us. So I\u2019m not going to talk about specific competitors, I would say there are a lot of competitors in the online space who have competitive prices, some of which are growing, many of which are growing.","So when we look at the entire competitive landscape for us and going forward, we feel like having competitive prices at least in the ballpark. This price is really, really important to be able to leverage the full suite of tools that we have to grow the business to create the customer experience we need. And so there's just so many different types of competitors out there in our space that I don't think you can sort of talk about one. The whole market, we have to understand and as we look at the whole market, we are going to have prices that are competitive that makes sense and it's going to enable us to acquire new customers and to grow the existing customers.","Andrew Buscaglia","I guess you just see yourself, I guess, as different from some of your competitors in terms of the actions you have to take. Is that correct? Or is that like your different end markets, I don't know what DC is like the main \u2013 you\u2019re just getting there I guess\u2026","Donald G. Macpherson","We're broader for one I guess than most of the competitors and I'm not sure who exactly you're talking about specifically, but certainly we are broader. I would also say that some of those competitors may not be talking about it, but they've already taken action in some of the things that they've done to try to mitigate it as well. So just depends - it depends who you're talking about, but we're confident in the decision we're making that it's the right thing to do. We are not going to have the lowest price. We're going to be competitive. We are going to be in the ballpark and it\u2019s going to give us the opportunity to grow the business.","Ronald Jadin","I would just add, we've had a great opportunity to benchmark Zoro our own brand in the space. So we have great visibility obviously to that and it's helped us prepare better for what we're doing with our Grainger brand.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital. Please go ahead with your questions.","Scott Graham","Hi, good morning.","Donald G. Macpherson","Good morning.","Scott Graham","Really, just two questions. How do you get comfortable with the pricing guidance for the year? Because we saw this really great volume response indicating success of the strategy in the first quarter. But obviously, much more disruptive to margins than you thought. And you've got more price actions coming. So kind of how do you bracket your full-year guidance of minus 4% on price, given what happened in the quarter? ","Donald G. Macpherson","Yes. Without getting into too many details, Scott, the good news as we know the impact of the list price change, the open web change, the changes that we've made and so we can quantify those. We would expect of course the second quarter to look similar to the first quarter in the sense that we're not making changes until the third quarter. And then the changes we make in the third quarter are similar to some of the changes we made in the first, so we're able to get reasonably comfortable with the range and that\u2019s where that comes from.","Ronald Jadin","Yes. And if you thought about it in terms of price percent it's minus 4% for the U.S., minus 4% in the first and second quarter. It's minus 5% for the year, so implicitly it's minus 6% in each of the third and fourth quarter to DG\u2019s point when we finished the web price changes in the third quarter.","Scott Graham","Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Ron, thank you. The other question I have is now you kind of advertised this now. So how do you guard against volume disruption between now and the third quarter?","Ronald Jadin","Well, I mean I think that, frankly, everybody who competes against us knew this was happening I would say anyway based on what we announced in November, so that's not new. We aren\u2019t seeing competitive reaction that is unusual given our price changes. And so we've talked to all of our customers. We basically have a great conversation with our large customers. They're excited about the change we're on and the path we\u2019re on, we think we're going to continue to gain volume. So we don't see anything that would suggest that the announcement is going to hurt volume in the short-term, we actually is going to help.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your questions.","Chris Dankert","Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just trying to back into some of what you're talking about, it sounds like the Red Pass program go away entirely in the third quarter, since it doesn't sound, but shouldn\u2019t be anymore opt again?","Donald G. Macpherson","So doesn't entirely go away and we'll provide more information as we go. Red Pass is the program that also includes a free freight component for customers that will stay and depending on the type of customer there may be specific pieces of the program that make sense to the different based on the segment. So it doesn't go away entirely certainly once we have open web, the price difference between Red Pass and what customers see will be very, very small. So that is a big difference.","Robert McCarthy","Okay, thanks. And then I guess perhaps on [indiscernible], I guess looking at 2017 margin guidance and then kind of your implicit 2018 numbers for EBIT margin, but it's just like 300 basis point recovery in the 2019 to kind of get to the mid-range your target, I guess what gives you confidence and be able to drive that kind of leverage. We have seen in the model to quite a degree in the past?","Ronald Jadin","Probably half of that is cost leverage, some of it's structural in nature, some of it is volume leverage because we anticipate driving volume that's going to be up in the mid-to-high single-digits feel like that was a long time ago, but that wasn't that long ago and our pricing or to put it back in that range. So that's probably least half of it. And the other half is some of the mix and volume that we're going to get from higher margin customers, DG mentioned before, it's been a decade, we always talk about negative mix with growth \u2013 faster growth of large customers, we should be talking a little bit differently by 2000, even some of that in 2018, but for sure in 2019 overall.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions.","Christopher Glynn","Thank you. Good morning. Just so the acceleration seems clearly response to market and probably what's emerged over the past couple years is a little bit more parity on the service and supply chain edge that you've enjoyed historically. So just wondering where you draw the comfort that what you're describing in the body of your pricing actions. Actually has, as defined of terminus as is implied in the multi-year outlook?","Donald G. Macpherson","So Christy, I would say couple of things. First of all, when we track 20 competitors on customer service metrics and on their perceptions of us, I would not actually say that our service advantage has been diminished. I would actually say we are stronger now than we've been in the 10-year that I've been with the Company on that dimension.","The ability to get complete orders to customers quickly, the ability to provide great experience on the web side, on eCommerce channels and our sales force and service model with large complex customers get very, very high marks and actually higher than they've gotten historically. So I would necessarily say that's true.","In terms of terminus, we're confident that we're in the ballpark from a pricing perspective. We're going to be able to grow the business. We've done a lot of work to understand what those price points are. We've analyzed it, as you might guess quite a bit. And so we're pretty comfortable that that we're going to be in a place to expand margins, operating margins, assuming we continue to get the cost leverage we've gotten. We will continue to do that, but we're pretty confident the price points were likely to end at that.","Christopher Glynn","Okay, thanks for that. And then could you just clarify crystallize again just what the difference in substances, when you talk about web pricing versus list pricing?","Ronald Jadin","Well, historically for us list price has been web price, because the list price has been what's been on the web side. When we talked about open web, the complexity right now is that if you go online and you try to buy something and it's a SKU that we have an open web price on, you will see the list price and you will see the web price and you will have the option to opt-in to that web price. When we remove by the end of this year, in the third quarter we will put everything on web price. We will not have a need to show our list price right at that point. So they will again be one in the same, but only at a new level.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Duncan with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.","Matt Duncan","Hey, good morning guys. So DG one of the things I think you've been hitting at is that there's been some price increase, maybe even on certain product categories. So I\u2019m trying to get a sense sort of where you're having the cut price the most and what categories you're still seeing sort of stronger pricing, where were you priced appropriately and where would you off?","Donald G. Macpherson","So from a list price perspective, when we made the changes January 1 about two-thirds of the price has changed. There were more down than up\u2019s at that time, but there certainly were items where we were not priced high enough and we made those decisions as well. We feel like the web \u2013 we've obviously done a lot of work already to know where web price needs to be. There are some items that we were just priced incorrectly. But in general, we will be more competitive and we will be in the ballpark and that's the strategy that we have.","Matt Duncan","Can you talk all about product categories are you just trying to stay away from that? ","Donald G. Macpherson","Well, it's less typically around product categories than SKUs within categories actually where we will see the changes that we had to make. So they weren't broad categories that we had to lower a bunch or increase a bunch in general and most of it was actually within the category where the numbers were interesting.","Matt Duncan","Okay. And then the second question I've got is just around the 2018 profitability. I'm trying to make sure I understand all the stepping stones here. So if U.S. gross margin is down 120 basis points, what is happening with total Company gross margins? Are you expecting a fairly good level of SG&A leverage next year such that by the time we get the operating margin in 2018? Is it down versus 2017 or is 2018 kind of the same and then you get the big jump in the 2019 with volume? Just trying to make sure we understand the step function here?","Ronald Jadin","Yes. We should see higher operating margin in 2018 for the Company, then we do in 2017 and certainly some of that will come from the cost side, the volume leverage, as well as structural changes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Belfiore with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","Christopher Belfiore","Good morning, guys. How are you doing?","Donald G. Macpherson","Good morning.","Ronald Jadin","Great.","Christopher Belfiore","So I just wanted to kind of talk a little bit more about the 40% or like the spot buy that you guys pointed out in November of the large customer. In terms of that, I know you said it improve all the pricing measures, but is there like a certain group of those customers that you guys saw like heavy manufacturing or specific kind of category that kind of came back and then do you think there is \u2013 do you see like other groups that maybe didn't see the prices, didn't kind of react to the pricing, are they going to come back later or is there any dynamic that you kind of share?","Donald G. Macpherson","So we've set the new pricing for fairly broad swaths of customers and we have not seen anything particularly interesting by customer end market. So we haven't seen differences for manufacturing, healthcare or commercial at this point. We have not seen big differences in terms of the reaction.","Christopher Belfiore","Okay. And then I guess just kind of maybe change things up a little bit, a lot of our U.S. pricing. In Canada you guys noted that there is \u2013 the freighting was an issue in terms of freighting cost from the direct-to-customer kind of shift. Where you guys in terms of percentage of that kind of shift right now and I think you mentioned in November or is that basically once you hit kind of around 70% direct-to-customers, when you kind of neutralize the effect of the higher freighting cost, kind of just an idea where you guys are in that process?","Donald G. Macpherson","Yes. And we are going to talk a lot more about Canada over the next couple of months, but they're over 50% direct-to-customer today and given the ERP change, there is still some fairly inefficient things that are happening to serve customers today. We will improve that over the next six months, so we've got a lot of room to improve and we still feel like 70% probably where we're going to end up in terms of direct-to-customer in Canada. That stills a fairly reasonable number for us.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Please go ahead with your questions.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, I just want to go back to a couple of questions that we got on competitive pricing dynamics. And DG, back in November at the analyst meeting, you shared the assumption that you thought price competition somehow levels off next year. So people have asked this question here, but maybe just to come back to it. What do you think the competitive response is, as you cut cost \u2013 cut pricing, why aren't you also assuming that there will be a competitive response here and this does turn into another race to the bottom?","Donald G. Macpherson","Well, I would say primarily because for large our complex customers, they have competitive prices already. What we're doing is trying to give reasonable prices in the spot buy and that is unlikely to drive significant competitive response when you do that that\u2019s really the way we're thinking about this. The other thing is we just look at prices and what's happened with pricing in the market over time. Our need to reset price is not really based on competitive changes in the marketplace, it's really based on our own pricing and what our customers are asking for and how they buy. So we don't see the market racing to the bottom in general and we really haven't seen that over the last few years.","Deane Dray","Okay. And then second question, also outside of the U.S. I was hoping you could comment on the UK business, Cromwell. And I know you've kind of avoid commenting on specific customers, but you did have a very \u2013 competitors. But you do have a very big competitor that Amazon this month launched their UK business as a direct competition to Cromwell. So update on Cromwell and competitive dynamics there, please.","Donald G. Macpherson","Yes. So competitive dynamics, we are pleased with what we're seeing out of that business. We started the Cromwell direct business. Part of the thesis for buying that business was they had the supply chain and product range that allowed us to build the online model. We're seeing very nice growth with that portion of it. Currency and Brexit has had an impact on the UK economy, but the business is actually performing quite well.","I would say Europe generally favor. We actually saw some decent growth in the first quarter as well. So really the entire international portfolio right now I'd say we feel like there is lots of opportunity to grow and grow margins and so in the UK we're happy with our position right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your questions.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is [indiscernible] filling in for Hamzah. I have a question for you guys around inventory levels. Do you guys think they are where they need to be given the current demand environment and what\u2019s your outlook?","Donald G. Macpherson","So we manage inventories to service level expectations generally and so we are very good service levels right now in the U.S. and in most of our businesses. So in general, we're pretty happy with our inventory levels. Obviously, as you grow the business you have to add some inventory. Typically we get some productivity out of the inventory pool and don't have to add as much inventory as the growth requires. So I think we're still in that situation. Ron do you have anything to add?","Ronald Jadin","Yes, our inventory turns, our working capital turns have been very constant for quite some time, so we would expect those to continue that way. I had given a comment earlier about GP rate decline on Slide 12, which was the pie chart slide, and it mentions on the far right, the U.S. segment declining 120 basis points. For the Company it's difficult to give guidance for 2018 at this point, but certainly we would expect the Company to move in a similar direction to the U.S.","So I'd expect it to be down 120 basis points for the Company as well and then it depends on what happens in the other parts of the business, but we should expect to see that kind of a decline in 2018. So I hope that answers that question. I guess I commented mostly on the U.S. and not the Company at the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your questions.","Robert Barry","Hey, guys, good morning.","Donald G. Macpherson","Good morning.","Robert Barry","I hope you're not already having any regrets about doing these calls. I think on a day like today actually it's particularly useful. So just back to the kind of price volume trade-off, would you expect to turn into a net benefit. It sounds like you expect a lagged effect of price cuts to see the volume response maybe also a larger mix response growing over time in reaction to kind of the given price cuts you're making today, is that right? And why would it kind of grow over time without cutting price more?","Donald G. Macpherson","Right. Yes. That's right. That's our expectation. So in any period that's a fairly narrow period of time, if you reduce price, you will not get the volume back right away. Customers have to realize and particularly customers have to realize that our prices are now more reasonable in order for them to start buying with some frequency.","So we've done a number of trials over the last three years to get comfortable with this, both with smaller customers \u2013 midsized customers through Red Pass, large customers by contract negotiations in every one of those when you change price right away, you don't get enough volume to make up for, but over time, it's actually quite attractive. So that gives us a lot of confidence in the path we\u2019re heading now.","Robert Barry","Gotcha and there was an expectation I know at the Analyst Day that part of the response was that customers would not only raise the volume with Grainger, but kind of mix up into higher margin categories. I mean is that happening and also why would that necessarily have been?","Donald G. Macpherson","Well, so I think it's best to talk about large complex customers on that dimension. So large complex customers often have contracts, they might have specific items that are in the contract, they might have categories that are in the contract, but they also have a discount off of list for their slow moving items.","When we talk about mix, one of the things we're trying to do is to make sure that we are attractive for the entire bundle and the entire bundle would includes slow moving items and those would be better than the average margin for us, but also very attractive prices for them because those items very frequently. So we're trying to make the price structure makes sense, so that we can consolidate the entire purchasing for customers and we find customers respond very, very when we get there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your questions.","Evelyn Chow","Hi, good morning. This is actually Evelyn Chow in for Joe.","Donald G. Macpherson","Hi.","Evelyn Chow","You've taken a lot of very proactive actions on pricing in 2017. But there is also a lot of moving parts, so maybe you can help us understand when you think about your various initiatives that you\u2019re targeting in 2017 and 2018? What would you consider as the lower hanging fruit versus what you believe will take more considered effort to drive?","Donald G. Macpherson","Well, I don't know that there's really any \u2013 I mean with the changes complex in this challenge. I wouldn't say there's any lower hanging fruit necessarily. I would say that we are \u2013 we have built muscles around two areas that I think we are going to be very exciting for us. One is, when we get the price that right with large customers driving that volume. Our sales and service model with large complex customers is very effective.","The other is our digital capabilities and when we get prices that are reasonable and we can start marketing those prices digitally that's going to help drive volume and we're very confident about that too. So those are two things that we're doing that I think is going to be very, very helpful to driving growth into the business and so we're going to track our performance against those two very, very closely to make sure that the price strategy translates into growth and translates into the customer experience and in the margin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Justin Bergner with Gabelli and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Bergner","Good morning, DG. Good morning, Ron.","Donald G. Macpherson","Good morning.","Ronald Jadin","Good morning.","Justin Bergner","I want to start by asking for your 2019 margin guidance, are you assuming a lower gross margin for 2019 than you were assuming at the Investor Day, offset by lower SG&A or how does the margin component sort of line up in 2019 versus what you laid out in November?","Donald G. Macpherson","It's not that different, I think even we had that in Q&A, if I remember in November. We talked about kind of GP being in that for the Company that 39% range, falling below 40%, but not below 39%, probably falls below 39% next year and then bounces back in 2019. As the mix in the volume benefit from mix outweighs the pricing changes, which we kind of lap as we exit 2018.","Justin Bergner","Okay. And then the second pricing question just relates to relative to the November investor event, it seem like that focus was more on the non-contract business. So is it essentially most of the incremental price impact coming from that $2 billion of less competitive contract business now being fast forwarded into one-year versus four?","Donald G. Macpherson","That's exactly, that's the right way to think about it. So we are being much more aggressive, much faster in terms of getting the prices reset on that volume.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your questions.","Karen Lau","Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Karen Lau dialing in for John.","Donald G. Macpherson","Good morning.","Karen Lau","Good morning. Just curious on how much of the volume, which you say is kind locked in within contracts because when you think about competitive response, especially on the spot market, you're now pricing more competitively, but your competitors can also come back and be even more competitive.","So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how much of the incremental volumes that you have baked in are coming from contract volume where the accounts are kind of locked in and so once you get the incremental product purchases they are sort of more guarantees to come through in 2018 and 2019?","Donald G. Macpherson","So, if I understand your question correctly, I would say that the volume growth is a mix of getting that spot buy volume with large customers and acquiring new mid-size customers and penetrating them and we think we're going to get volume out of both. I would say that our experience with the online model would suggest both of those are actually pretty sticky when you've got a strong supply chain, you provide great service. So our expectation is that we'll be able to get growth both through our large contracts and through new customer acquisition with the changes we're making.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Donald G. Macpherson","Good morning.","Nigel Coe","Ron maybe we've talked about the gross margin which in part, I just wonder could you maybe just reconcile what control perhaps the price decline, I think you\u2019ve got four points of price down, I think 50 bps of COGS deflation. So the remaining, I guess it's from 160 down, so the remaining 150 how does that split between cost reductions through bookings?","Ronald Jadin","I\u2019m sorry, which period that you\u2019re asking about?","Nigel Coe","Sorry, this is FY2017.","Ronald Jadin","2017, so there is the price decline, favorable mix is probably one of the biggest offsets that's helping us this year. From a GP perspective, when you think about a 4% price decline this year, that's about $400 million a price. The impact on that for GP is maybe 2.5% right when you do it on a GP basis. There's a fair amount of volume though rate that we're driving just in general at prior year GP rates, so volume component is pretty sizable.","And then the cost deflation, you mentioned and then the favorable mix really helps, so if you think about the pricing impact that\u2019s $400 million driving about 2.5% negative, we're down a little bit less than that for the Company overall in our guidance and it's because of that deflation and mix partially offsetting. So we end up down about 160 basis points for the Company on GP rate and similar for our margin rate, maybe 10 basis points or so of cost leverage.","Donald G. Macpherson","Yes, I would say \u2013 yes, I\u2019d also add that the cost leverage is in a world where you have that much price decline. We are getting significant cost leverage on an activity basis on a COGS basis, but it's a challenge obviously when you have that much price deflation.","Ronald Jadin","Yes. That 10 basis points was a percent of sales not a percent of COGS. Percent of COGS would be a much bigger improvement.","Nigel Coe","And then just on the favorable mix impacts, when you've taken pricing actions of this magnitude the profitable mid-tier customer and the spot purchases from the large customers, does that still increment 40% plus or is it more like a 30% type of volume impact?","Ronald Jadin","It's higher. Yes, it\u2019s 40% plus, yes.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back to Mr. DG Macpherson for closing comments.","Donald G. Macpherson","So thanks everyone for joining the call. Obviously it was a challenging quarter. I just want to conclude by saying that we are facing into the challenges we have, we're facing into them with that the information that we have now and we are confident this is the right thing to do for the long-term health of the Company.","We obviously wouldn't be taking these actions if we didn't think they are right for our customers and for creating value over the long haul. And so it's difficult. There is no question about that, but we are aligned as a team, we are fully committed to making this work to driving the volume growth and to getting the margins back to where they need to be.","So appreciate your time today and we'll see you soon. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."],"9905":["W.W. Grainger (NYSE:GWW) Q4 2012 Earnings Call January 24, 2013  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Laura D. Brown - Senior Vice President of Communications & Investor Relations","William D. Chapman - Director of Investor Relations","Laura D. Brown","Hello, this is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's fourth quarter 2012 results. Please also reference our 2012 fourth quarter earnings release issued today, January 24, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this webcast.","Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.","Today, we reported record results for the year 2012 and reiterated our earnings per share guidance for 2013. We'll discuss 2012 in more detail, as well as comment on January's strong sales start.","At the very end of December, we experienced a dramatic slowdown in sales, contributing to quarterly performance that was below our guidance. In addition, there were 3 items included in our quarterly results that were not part of our November 14, 2012, earnings guidance: at $0.18 per share charge, primarily related to streamlining operations in Europe, India and China to improve the long-term performance of these businesses; a $0.03 per share charge related to the closure of branches in the United States; and a $0.04 per share impairment charge related to our Alliance Energy Solutions business acquired in 2009. The impairment was caused by lower-than-expected operating performance. A schedule detailing these items can be found in the earnings release. These 3 items combined represented a $0.25 reduction to earnings per share, resulting in adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.42.","As a reminder, the 2011 fourth quarter included a $0.16 per share charge from the closure of 27 branches in the U.S. business and a $0.07 per share gain from the sale of our 49% ownership in a joint venture in Korea. These 2 items in 2011 represented a $0.09 net reduction to earnings per share, resulting in adjusted EPS of $2.13.","Excluding the items noted above, net earnings for the 2012 quarter increased 12% and the earnings per share increased 14% versus the prior year. So why did we fall below the low end of our EPS guidance or $2.55 issued on November 14 of last year? There were 2 primary factors: Number 1, first, the sudden and dramatic sales slowdown in the last 1\/3 of December did not allow us to pull back on operating expenses sufficiently to mitigate the negative operating leverage.","To put this in perspective, in the U.S. business, we were anticipating 7% daily sales growth in the first 2\/3 of December and 1% daily sales growth in the final 1\/3 of the month. Actual results were much lower with 5% daily sales growth in the first 2\/3 of the month and a 13% daily sales decline in the last 1\/3 of the month, driven by the timing of the holidays and concerns regarding the economy and the fiscal cliff. Second, legal, M&A and health care costs related to long-term disability came in above our forecast.","Company sales for the quarter increased 7% versus the 2011 fourth quarter. We had 64 selling days in the quarter, one more than the previous year. Given the timing of the holidays in December, the additional selling day added a minimal amount of sales dollars and created the headwind to sales on a daily basis, which increased 6%. On a reported basis, operating earnings increased 17%, while net earnings increased 5%. Items below the operating line, such as other income\/expense and tax rate contributed to earnings performance and are discussed later in the podcast. Reported earnings per share were $2.17 for the quarter, representing an increase of 6% versus the 2011 fourth quarter.","In a few moments, we will more fully analyze our sales results for the quarter. Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Gross profit margins were flat at 43.6% versus 2011 as forecasted in our 2012 third quarter podcast. We'll provide more detail when we review the business by segment.","Company operating margin increased 90 basis points to 11.6% versus 10.7% a year ago. The increase in earnings growth was driven by the 7% sales increase and operating expenses growing at a slower rate than sales. Operating expenses grew 4%, including $1 million in incremental growth-related spending over the 2011 fourth quarter to fund the growth programs, including new Territory Sales Representatives, e-commerce, advertising and incremental expenses for the company's distribution center network. Incremental growth spending for the full year 2012 was $71 million versus 2011. A schedule summarizing incremental growth spending for 2011 and 2012 can be found in Exhibit 3 of this podcast.","Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of December; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2013 guidance and other key items.","As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 7% on a reported basis and 6% on a daily basis. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 6% in October, 8% in November and 2% in December. The 6% increase in daily sales in the quarter included 3 percentage points from price, 2 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from acquisitions and 1 percentage point from Hurricane Sandy-related sales, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline attributable to the timing of the December holidays and extended customer shutdowns tied to concerns about the economy and the fiscal cliff, as explained in the earnings release.","Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, are reported under a grouping titled, Other Businesses.","Sales in the United States, which account for 75% of total company revenue, increased 5% in the quarter, 4% on a daily basis. The 4% daily sales growth for the quarter was driven by 3 percentage points from price, 1 percentage point from volume and 1 percentage point from Hurricane Sandy-related sales, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from the timing of the December holidays. Daily sales increased 4% in October, 6% in November and declined 1% in December.","Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Here is the sales performance for each respective customer end market in the quarter. Light Manufacturing was up in the high-single digits; Heavy Manufacturing and Commercial were up in the mid-single digits; Government and Retail were up in the low-single digits; Reseller was flat; Contractor was down in the low-single digits; and Natural Resources was down in the mid-single digits.","Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent 13% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 14% in U.S. dollars and 11% in local currency. On a daily basis, sales increased 13% and consisted of 8 percentage points from volume, 4 percentage points from foreign exchange, 1 percentage point from price and 1 percentage point from sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from the timing of the December holidays.","By month, daily sales in Canadian dollars increased 12% in October, 8% in November and 5% in December. Sales performance in Canada was driven by strong growth in the Western provinces, led by the Commercial, Oil and Gas, Construction and Utilities end markets.","Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again this group includes our operations, primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America and currently represents about 12% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 16%, 14% on a daily basis, which consisted of 13 percentage points from volume and 5 percentage points from acquisitions, partially offset by a 3 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange and a 1 percentage point decline attributable to the timing of the holidays.","Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for October and November and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at December, which was worse than expected because of the timing of the holidays and customer spending pullbacks related to the fiscal cliff. As mentioned previously, in the first 2\/3 of the month, sales growth was tracking in the mid-single digits, but sales declined in the last 1\/3 of the month versus the prior year. We attribute some of this to the timing of the Christmas and New Year's holidays. In addition, we observed the concerns surrounding the economy and the fiscal cliff resulted in businesses and institutions implementing spending moratoriums.","Many customers we spoke with closed their facilities during the back part of December and furloughed employees for an extended period over the holidays. There were 20 selling days in December of 2012 versus 21 days in the same month of 2011. Total company sales increased 2% on a daily basis in December of 2012 versus December of 2011.","The daily sales growth in December included 4 percentage points from volume, 2 percentage points from price, 1 percentage point from acquisitions, partially offset by a 4 percentage point decline from the timing of the holidays and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products.","In the United States, December sales declined 1%. This decline was primarily related to a 4 percentage points decline from the timing of the December holidays and concerns about the fiscal cliff and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point increase in volume and a 2 percentage point increase from price.","December customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Heavy and Light Manufacturing were up in the low-single digits; Government, Commercial, Retail and Reseller were down in the low-single digits; Contractor was down in the mid-single digits; and Natural Resources was down in the high-single digits.","Daily sales in Canada for December increased 9% in U.S. dollars, up 5% in local currency. The 9% daily sales growth consisted of 6 percentage points from volume, 4 percentage points from foreign exchange, 1 percentage point from price, 1 percentage point from sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 3 percentage point decline due to the timing of the holidays. Similar to the quarter, sales growth in Canada was driven by strong performance in the Commercial, Oil and Gas, Construction and Utilities end markets.","Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 14% in December, consisting of 16 percentage points from volume and 4 percentage points from acquisitions, partially offset by a negative 4 percentage points from the timing of the holidays and a negative 2 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange.","Daily sales growth in the first 3 business days of January followed the same trend as the back 1\/3 of December. Since that time, sales have rebounded nicely and are trending in the mid- to high-single digits. Keep in mind that we are up against a very strong comparison in January. Daily sales were up 17% in January of 2012 versus the prior year. We may be benefiting from some catch-up from the sales decline in late December, though it is difficult to determine for sure. January of 2013 will be the first month we include the incremental sales from Techni-Tool, the business we acquired on December 31, which had 2011 sales of $88 million.","Now, I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.","William D. Chapman","Thanks, Laura. Since we've already analyzed company operating performance, let's jump right into performance by reporting segment. Operating earnings in the United States increased 17% versus the 2011 fourth quarter, and the U.S. operating margin increased 160 basis points to 16.2%.","Excluding $10 million and $18 million in charges during the 2012 and 2011 quarters, operating earnings increased 12%,, and the U.S. operating margin increased 110 basis points to 16.8%. This performance was driven by the 5% sales growth, higher gross profit margins and positive expense leverage. Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 50 basis points, driven by price increases exceeding cost inflation, partially offset by unfavorable customer mix. Operating expenses grew at a slower rate than sales and included $1 million in incremental growth-related spending on areas such as new sales representatives, e-commerce and advertising.","Let's move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings increased 2% versus the prior year, down 2% in local currency. The increase in operating earnings was driven by favorable foreign exchange and modest expense leverage, partially offset by lower gross profit margins.","Gross margins in Canada decreased 150 basis points versus the prior year. The decline was primarily due to unfavorable customer and product sales mix. Lower gross margins and higher operating expenses contributed to a 130 basis point decline in operating margins to 10.7%.","Operating performance for our Other Businesses declined versus a year ago posting a loss of $10.4 million for the quarter versus operating earnings of $5 million in 2011. During the quarter, we decided to implement the following structural changes to the businesses in Europe, India and China to improve long-term performance, resulting in $13.7 million in restructuring charges.","In Europe, we closed 6 underperforming shops and reduced headcount to better align the business with the weak economy in Western Europe. In India and China, we are streamlining these businesses by narrowing the product offering and by reducing headcount.","Excluding these charges, the Other Businesses would have generated $3.3 million in operating earnings in the 2012 fourth quarter. This performance was primarily driven by the businesses in Japan and Mexico, partially offset by modest operating losses from the businesses in Brazil and Europe before the restructuring charges.","Below the operating line, the 2012 fourth quarter had $5 million in other expense versus $5 million in other income for the 2011 fourth quarter. This rounds to a $9 million negative swing that was primarily due to an $8 million gain on the sale of our 49% ownership in MRO Korea that was recognized in the 2011 fourth quarter.","In addition, interest expense net of interest income was $5 million in the 2012 fourth quarter versus $2 million in the 2011 quarter. The increase in interest expense was related to higher average borrowings, higher interest rates and capital leases for the acquired business in Europe.","For the quarter the effective tax rate in 2012 was 37.6% versus 32.9% in 2011. The fourth quarter of 2011 included a benefit from the tax law change in Japan. For the year, the effective tax rate in 2012 was 37.5% versus 36.6% in 2011. In addition to the 2011 fourth quarter favorability, the company settled various tax reviews providing further benefit to the 2011 effective tax rate. Excluding these benefits in 2011, the effective tax rate was 38.1%. The effective tax rate in 2012 benefited primarily from a lower blended state tax rate. The company is currently projecting an effective tax rate of 37.3% to 37.7% for the year 2013.","Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $240 million versus $186 million in 2011. We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business, fund an acquisition and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends.","Capital expenditures for the quarter were $95 million versus $66 million in 2011. We paid dividends of $58 million in the quarter, reflecting the 21% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2012.","In addition, we bought back 228,000 shares of stock for $44 million and ended the quarter with 5.3 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $102 million to shareholders in the quarter.","At our Analyst Meeting in November, we issued sales and earnings guidance for 2013. Today, we reiterated that earnings per share guidance of $10.85 to $12 reflecting confidence in our strategy and industry-leading service. We also raised the 2013 sales guidance to a new range of 3% to 9% growth to reflect the increase in sales from the December 31, 2012, acquisition of Techni-Tool, Inc., which had sales in 2011 of $88 million.","Here are a few additional considerations as you refine your models. For the first quarter 2013, the sales comparison in the 2013 first quarter is the most difficult of the year. We reported 16% sales growth in the 2012 first quarter. Second, we lose a selling day in the 2013 first quarter as we will have 63 selling days in 2013 versus 64 in 2012.","Good Friday falls in the 2013 first quarter. In 2012, the Easter holiday fell in the second quarter. Business typically slows around the Easter holiday with Good Friday representing a very light day.","Finally, the company's annual trade shows held in the first quarter typically result in gross profit margins and operating expenses that are about 100 basis points above the run rate for the full year.","For the full year 2013, sales comparisons get easier as we move through the year. We also anniversary the acquisition in Brazil in May of 2013. Incremental growth spending in 2013 versus 2012 is still estimated to be $135 million, plus or minus $25 million, depending on sales volume.","And finally in aggregate, we are expecting 10 to 60 basis points of operating margin expansion versus 13.8% for 2012 after adjustments. Cost leverage should be better than our original forecast, while gross margin expansion will be muted by the addition of Techni-Tool.","In conclusion, we remain confident in our strategy to gain share and extend our leadership position in the large and fragmented MRO market.","Thank you for your interest in Grainger. Please mark your calendar for the release of January sales on Tuesday, February 12.

This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger\u2019s first quarter 2014 results. Please reference our 2014 first quarter earnings release issued today, April 16, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this podcast."," ","Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.","Today, we reported record results for the 2014 first quarter and reiterated our sales and earnings per share guidance for 2014. In a quarter that experienced weather-related disruptions in North America and macroeconomic weakness outside of the United States, we delivered solid earnings and margins that were in line with the expectations we provided in the fourth quarter of 2013. At the end of this recording, we will talk in more detail about our guidance and assumptions.","Let\u2019s begin with an overview. Company sales for the quarter increased 5%. We had 63 selling days in the quarter, the same as the previous year. Operating earnings increased 3% and net earnings increased 2%. Earnings per share were $3.07 for the quarter, an increase of 4% versus the previous year.","Let\u2019s now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Reported gross profit margins decreased 10 basis points to 45.1% versus 45.2% in 2013 primarily due to the newly acquired businesses. Please reference Exhibit 5. Company operating earnings increased 3% versus the 2013 quarter. This increase was primarily driven by the 5% sales growth partially offset by lower gross profit margins. Operating expenses also increased 5% driven by $31 million in incremental growth and infrastructure spending as well as incremental expenses from the acquired businesses. Our reported company operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 14.9% versus 15.1% in 2013 primarily due to decline in gross margins.","On an organic basis, excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, company gross profit margins for the quarter increased 20 basis points to 45.5% versus 45.3% in 2013. The company operating margin decreased 20 basis points to 15.0% versus 15.2% in 2013, primarily due to lower performance in Canada.","We took a cautious approach to growth and infrastructure spending in the 2014 first quarter given softer than expected sales growth in the first two months of the quarter. Given the pacing of projects and lower than expected spending in the first quarter, we are now anticipating full year incremental growth spending of approximately $115 million. We view our commitment to invest in growth as an example of our leadership in the MRO industry and the ability to continue gaining market share over the long-term.","Let\u2019s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we will cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and in the month of March; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we\u2019ll wrap up with a discussion of our 2014 guidance and other key items.","Before we begin our discussion of sales, please note that although some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays, we use the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales. Company sales for the quarter increased 5%. By month, increases were as follows: 3% in January, 3% in February, and 8% in March. Sales growth in March benefited from the timing of Good Friday that fell in March last year and will occur in April this year. The 5% sales growth in the first quarter included 2 percentage points from acquisitions net of dispositions and 2 percentage points reduction from foreign exchange.","On an organic basis, excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, sales increased 5% driven by 4 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from price and 1 percentage point from higher sales of seasonal products partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline due to the extreme weather that closed some customer and Grainger facilities in North America during the months of January and February. The extreme weather resulted in lost sales volume that is not likely to be recovered.","Let\u2019s move on to sales by segment. We report two business segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations, primarily located in Asia, Europe and Latin America, are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 78% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 7%. Sales results in the first quarter included 2 percentage points from acquisitions, net of dispositions. On an organic basis, excluding acquisitions, sales increased 5% driven by 4 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from price and 1 percentage point from higher sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline due to the extreme weather in January and February. By month, sales increased 6% in January, 5% in February and 10% in March.","Let\u2019s review sales performance by customer end-market for the quarter in the United States: heavy manufacturing and natural resources were up in the high single-digits; light manufacturing, commercial and retail were up in the mid single-digits; government and reseller were up in the low single-digits; and contractor was down in the low single-digits. ","Now, let\u2019s turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 11% of total company revenues in the quarter. The business in Canada continues to face a sluggish macroeconomic environment and unfavorable currency exchange. Sales in the 2014 first quarter decreased 10% and were down 2% in local currency. The 2% sales decline consisted of a 4 percentage points decline from volume, partially offset by 2 percentage points benefit from the timing of Good Friday.","The weakness in the Canadian economy is being driven by lower commodity prices and a reduction of Canadian exports. By month, sales in Canadian dollars decreased 4% in January, 2% in February and increased 1% in March. The 2% sales decrease for the quarter in Canada was driven by declines in the construction, light and heavy manufacturing, mining, retail, government, and oil and gas customer end-markets partially offset by growth from utilities, forestry, transportation and reseller customer end-markets. For reference, approximately two-thirds of revenue is generated in the Western provinces with a higher concentration in natural resources.","Let\u2019s conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America and represents about 11% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 11%, which consisted of 18 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 7 percentage points decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The sales increase was primarily due to solid revenue growth from Zoro Tools and the businesses in Mexico and Japan.","Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for January and February and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let\u2019s now take a look at March. There were 21 selling days in March of 2014, the same as in 2013. Company sales increased 8% versus March of 2013. Sales results in March included 2 percentage points from acquisitions, net of dispositions and a 1 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. On an organic basis, excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, sales increased 7% driven by 6 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point benefit from the timing of Good Friday. Sales were softer in the first half of the month and accelerated as weather conditions improved in North America.","In the United States, March sales increased 10%. This increase was due to 7 percentage points increase in volume, 2 percentage points from the E&R and Safety Solutions acquisitions, net of dispositions, and 1 percentage point from the timing of Good Friday. March customer end-market performance in the United States was as follows: heavy manufacturing, natural resources and retail were up in the low double-digits; light manufacturing and commercial were up in the high single-digits; government was up in the mid single-digits; reseller was up in the low single-digits; and contractor was down in the low single-digits.","Sales in Canada for March were down 7%, but were up 1% in local currency. The 1% sales increase consisted of 5 percentage points benefit from the timing of Good Friday partially offset by 4 percentage points decline in volume. The volume decline was driven by lower sales to the construction, light manufacturing, mining, retail, government and reseller customer end-markets partially offset by growth to customers in the utilities, forestry, heavy manufacturing, and oil and gas customer end-markets.","Sales for our Other Businesses increased 16% in March, consisting of 19 percentage points from volume and price, 1 percentage point benefit from the timing of Good Friday, partially offset by 4 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange. Sales growth in the Other Businesses was driven by Zoro Tools and the businesses in Mexico and Japan. In local currency, sales for the business in Japan grew more than 30%, but were partially offset by a weaker Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.","Looking ahead to April, daily sales growth to date in April is running in line with the sales growth we reported for March. Keep in mind however that we will face some headwinds from the Easter holiday in the back half of the month.","Now, I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.","Bill Chapman - Senior Director, Investor Relations","Thanks, Laura. Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let\u2019s jump right into results by reportable segment. Operating earnings in the United States increased 7% versus the 2013 first quarter, while operating margins were flat at 18.7%. Gross profit margins for the quarter decreased 30 basis points driven by lower gross margins from the newly acquired businesses and faster growth with lower margin customers.","Operating expenses grew at a slower rate than sales, which included incremental expenses from the acquired businesses and $26 million in incremental growth and infrastructure-related spending on areas such as new sales representatives, e-commerce and advertising."," ","For the U.S. business on an organic basis, excluding acquisitions, gross profit margins increased 40 basis points to 46.9% versus 46.5% in 2013 driven by price inflation exceeding cost inflation. Operating margin increased 30 basis points to 19.2% versus 18.9% in 2013 reflecting higher gross margins, partially offset by negative expense leverage.","Let\u2019s move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings decreased 35% versus the prior year. The decrease was driven by the 10% sales decline, lower gross profit margins and negative expense leverage. Gross margins in Canada decreased 20 basis points versus the prior year, primarily due to higher freight costs, along with the effect of unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States. Also contributing to the lower operating performance was increased payroll, benefits and severance, and approximately $2 million in incremental spending related to IT system investments. We continue to invest in the business in Canada through this tougher macroeconomic environment to strengthen our operations and better position the business for the long-term.","The Other Businesses generated $8 million in operating earnings in the 2014 and 2013 first quarters. This performance included strong results from Zoro Tools partially offset by lower performance from the businesses in Latin America and costs to evaluate the new online business in other markets. Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net expense of $2.7 million in the 2014 first quarter versus $1.4 million in the 2013 first quarter.","For the quarter, the effective tax rate in 2014 was 37.7% versus 37.3% in 2013. The increase was primarily due to more earnings in the United States relative to other jurisdictions with lower tax rates. We are still projecting an effective tax rate of 37.4% to 37.8% for the full year 2014.","Lastly, let\u2019s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $168 million versus $176 million in 2013. The lower cash flow was driven primarily by lower trade accounts payable balances related to the timing of inventory purchases. We used the cash flow and cash flow on hand to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends.","Capital expenditures for the quarter were $66 million versus $43 million in 2013. We paid dividends of $65 million, reflecting the 16% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2013. In addition, we bought back 615,000 shares of stock for $150 million and ended the quarter with 3 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $215 million to shareholders in the quarter.","As reported in our 2014 first quarter earnings release, we reiterated our 2014 sales and earnings per share guidance. The sales guidance range remains at 5% to 9% growth. It\u2019s important to note that we slightly revised the composition. The low end reflects more volume contribution and less price realization.","Let\u2019s look more closely at the underlying elements of our expectations. Let\u2019s start with gross profit margins. For the full year, on an organic basis, we continue to expect gross margin expansion to reach 30 basis points at the high-end driven primarily by the United States. On a reported basis, we are forecasting minimal gross margin expansion versus 2013 due to lower gross margins from the acquired businesses.","For the 2014 second quarter, we expect organic gross profit margins to be down approximately 15 basis points due primarily to one-time inventory transition costs in Canada in preparation for the relocation to the new distribution center in Toronto. On a reported basis, we are expecting gross profit margins to decrease by about 60 basis points due to the acquired businesses. Please keep in mind that as you model margins for the second quarter and the remainder of the year, our first quarter included supplier support provided for our annual customer tradeshows. As a result, both gross profit and operating expenses as a percent of sales are inflated by about 100 basis points.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at company operating margin expectations. In 2014, we anticipate operating margin contraction in the first half followed by operating margin expansion in the second half. This is due to the carryover effect of the 2013 second half growth and infrastructure spending and the acquisition of the lower margin businesses. For the full year, on an organic basis, we continue to expect 15 to 45 basis points of operating margin expansion.","On a reported basis, we are forecasting full year operating margin expansion of 10 to 40 basis points, reflecting negative mix from the acquisitions. For the 2014 second quarter, on an organic basis, operating margins are forecasted to decline 40 to 80 basis points due to the incremental growth and infrastructure spending anticipated in the second quarter. Please see Exhibit 4 for more information. For the 2014 second quarter, on a reported basis, operating margins could decline 50 to 100 basis points.","Please mark your calendar for the following upcoming events. On April 30, we will host our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The script from the presentation will be available on our website following the event. On May 6, DG Macpherson, Senior Vice President and Group President, Global Supply Chain and International, will present at the Robert W. Baird Growth Stock Conference in Chicago. The event will be webcast. And finally, we will release April sales on Tuesday, May 13.","Overall, we are pleased with our start to 2014. We continue to invest in the business to gain share and deliver solid returns to shareholders. And we appreciate your support and thank you for your interest in Grainger.

With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. We are pleased to share with you some information regarding Grainger\u2019s first quarter 2012 results via this audio webcast. Please also reference our 2012 first quarter earnings release issued today, April 17, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this webcast.","Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this webcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.","Strong sales growth and consistent execution was the story for the quarter. This performance was largely driven by continued enhancements to the foundation of our business and aggressive investment in our growth programs. As a result of the strong start to 2012, we have increased and narrowed the ranges for our sales and EPS guidance as referenced in today\u2019s earnings release. We now expect sales to grow 12% to 14% and are forecasting EPS of $10.40 to $10.80 for the full year 2012. At the end of this recording, we\u2019ll talk more about our revised guidance and our assumptions.","We\u2019ll start with total company results, and then take a closer look at our segments. Company sales increased 16% versus the 2011 first quarter. We had 64 selling days in both quarters. Operating earnings increased 16%, while net earnings increased 19%. As highlighted in our release, earnings per share of $2.57 for the quarter is an all-time company record and represents an 18% increase versus 2011.","In a few moments we\u2019ll take a closer look at sales results for the quarter; let\u2019s now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Gross profit margins increased 40 basis points to 44.4%, as we successfully expanded gross margins across the business. Due to our size and scale, we were able to increase prices with the market and ahead of product cost inflation. We\u2019ll provide more detail when we review the business by segment.","It is important to note that our gross profit margin follows a fairly consistent annual pattern, with generally highest gross margins in the first quarter. This is primarily driven by supplier funding for our annual customer trade shows in the quarter.","Company operating margins were essentially flat with the prior year at 13.9%. This was a function of strong sales growth and gross margin expansion offset by higher operating expenses driven by Fabory\u2019s incremental expenses, growth-related spending, and higher corporate expenses, including stock-based compensation and expenses related to M&A activity and other corporate support expenses.","Let\u2019s now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we\u2019ll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of March; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we\u2019ll wrap up with a discussion of our revised 2012 guidance.","As mentioned earlier, company sales increased 16% for the quarter. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 17% in January, 18% in February, and 15% in March. Of the 16% sales growth for the quarter, volume contributed 10 percentage points, acquisitions added 5 percentage points, and price added 3 percentage points. Foreign exchange and lower sales of seasonal products each represented a 1 percentage point drag on daily sales growth for the quarter.","Let\u2019s move on to sales by segment. We report two segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations in Asia, Europe, and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses.","Sales in the United States, which account for about 77% of total company revenue, increased 11% in the quarter, consisting of 9% volume growth and 3% from price, partially offset by a drag of 1 percentage point due to lower sales of seasonal products. By month, daily sales in the United States were up 11% in January, up 12% in February, and up 9% in March.","Now we\u2019ll cover sales performance by customer end-market in the United States. We believe that increasing our product line, expanding customer sales coverage, and increasing our eCommerce capabilities is enabling the company to grow faster than the economy and gain additional market share.","As a result, sales to every customer end-market we serve in the United States, including Government, were positive in the quarter as follows. Natural Resources, formerly Agriculture and Mining, and Heavy Manufacturing were up in the mid-teens. Commercial, Retail, and Light Manufacturing were up in the low double-digits. Reseller was up in the high single-digits, and Government and Contractors were up in the mid-single-digits.","In the fourth quarter of 2010, we announced the possible divestiture of our Specialty Brands. Since that time, we have not received an acceptable offer. We plan to continue to operate the businesses and evaluate future options.","Now let\u2019s turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent about 12% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 13% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currency. On a daily basis in Canadian dollars, sales were up 19% in January, up 14% in February, and up 11% in March. The 14% local currency sales growth in the quarter consisted of 13% volume growth and 1 percentage point from price.","From a customer standpoint, sales growth in Canada was driven by strength in the Construction, Agriculture and Mining, Transportation, Retail\/Wholesale, and Heavy Manufacturing customer end-markets.","Let\u2019s conclude our review of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, and currently represents about 11% of total company sales.","Sales for this group increased 104%, the result of strong growth in Japan and Mexico, coupled with the incremental sales from Fabory, our business in Europe acquired in August of 2011. Excluding Fabory, sales for our Other Businesses increased 33%.","Beginning in the second quarter, our Other Businesses will include the results of our newly acquired business in Brazil. This business, formerly known as AnFreixo S.A., is a leading broad line distributor of maintenance, repair, and operating (NYSE:MRO) supplies and had 2011 sales of approximately US$37 million. The acquisition provides us with a solid entry point for physical operations in Brazil, the largest MRO market in Latin America.","Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for January and February and shared some information regarding sales performance in the month. Let\u2019s now take a closer look at March. There were 22 selling days in March of 2012, one less than 2011. Total company sales were up 15% on a daily basis in March of 2012 versus March of 2011. The 15% growth consisted of 8% volume growth, 3 percentage points from price inflation, and 5 percentage points from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1 percentage point drag from foreign exchange.","In the United States, March daily sales were up 9%. This growth consisted of 6 percentage points of volume and 3 percentage points from price. Sales trends in March are more representative of our expectation for revenue growth going forward.","Conversely, sales growth in January and February was unusually strong due to the following factors: number one, customer pre-buying in advance of our February price increase, particularly in our lighting product line; number two, a higher advertising spend; and number three, easier comparisons in January and February versus March.","Consistent with the quarter, we saw positive daily sales growth in March to each of our U.S. customer end-markets as follows: Natural Resources increased in the low 20s; Heavy Manufacturing and Commercial increased in the low double-digits; Light Manufacturing, Reseller, and Retail were up in the high single-digits; Government was up in the mid-single-digits; and Contractor was up in the low single-digits.","Daily sales in Canada for March increased 10% in U.S. dollars, up 11% in local currency. The 11% local currency daily sales growth consisted of 11% volume and 1 percentage point from price, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline attributable to lower sales of seasonal products.","Similar to the quarter, customers in the Construction, Agriculture and Mining, Transportation, Retail\/Wholesale, and Heavy Manufacturing customer end-markets accounted for the largest increases in sales growth. The growth rate in March was influenced by difficult comparisons, particularly in the Government sector, where spending reached record levels in 2011.","Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 110% in March, the result of strong growth in Japan and Mexico along with sales for our business in Europe. Excluding Fabory, sales for the Other Businesses increased 38% in March.","Sales growth in the month of April started a bit slowly, primarily due to the religious holidays, but is expected to be roughly in line with the growth in March.","Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.","Bill Chapman","Thanks, Laura. Since we\u2019ve already covered company operating performance, let\u2019s jump right into performance by segment. Operating earnings in the United States increased 17% versus the 2011 first quarter, and operating margin increased 90 basis points to 17.6%. This performance was driven by 11% sales growth, higher gross margins, and positive expense leverage.","Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 10 basis points driven by price increases exceeding cost inflation, partially offset by higher freight costs and unfavorable mix, as lower sales of seasonal products slowed the sales growth of private label products. Expense leverage in the United States was positive despite higher growth-related spending on new sales representatives, eCommerce, and advertising.","Let\u2019s move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings increased 24% versus the prior year, 26% in local currency. Strong sales growth coupled with higher gross margins and effective cost management contributed to operating margins increasing 100 basis points to 10.9%. Gross margins increased 60 basis points, primarily driven by improved customer mix and higher prices.","Operating performance for our Other Businesses improved versus a year ago, the result of our focus on improving growth and operating results. This group posted operating earnings of $11 million for the quarter versus $6 million a year ago. Strong operating performance in Japan and Mexico, coupled with $1 million in operating earnings from Fabory, drove the improved results for this group.","Below the operating line, interest expense, net of interest income, was $2.5 million in the 2012 first quarter versus $1.4 million in the 2011 first quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to interest on the debt of \u20ac120 million used to finance a portion of the Fabory acquisition.","As mentioned at our November Analyst Meeting and in the 2011 Form 10-K, we were originally forecasting an effective tax rate of 37.9% for the full year 2012. In the 2012 first quarter, the effective tax rate was 37.4%, primarily due to higher earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a lower blended state tax rate.","The difference between the actual effective tax rate and the forecasted rate resulted in a $0.02 per share benefit for the quarter. We are now expecting the full year 2012 effective tax rate to be in the range of 37.4% to 37.7%.","Lastly, let\u2019s take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $106 million versus $118 million in 2011. The year-over-year reduction in cash flow was driven by lower trade accounts payable balances, due to the timing of inventory purchases, and a higher contribution to the company\u2019s retirement plan tied to strong company performance and higher payroll expense in the prior year.","We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business and return $109 million to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $41 million. We paid dividends of $47 million and bought back 291,000 shares of stock. As of quarter-end, the company has approximately 6.8 million shares remaining on its share repurchase authorization.","As reported in our 2012 first quarter earnings release, we raised and narrowed both sales and earnings guidance for the full year 2012. We now expect sales growth in the range of 12% to 14% and earnings per share in the range of $10.40 to $10.80. While our sales guidance is below our first quarter 2012 performance, we expect EPS to expand over the prior year at an increasing rate for the remainder of 2012.","Let\u2019s look more closely at the underlying elements of our revised expectations. First, sales growth in the first quarter, particularly January and February, was stronger than we had forecasted.","Second, unlike the first quarter, we are forecasting operating margin expansion over prior-year in each remaining quarter of 2012. This expansion should come from a more even contribution from both gross margin expansion and better expense leverage.","Gross profit margins in the second quarter should be higher than the prior year but below the 2012 first quarter, which includes supplier support provided for the annual customer trade shows. Year-over-year, gross profit margins for the remaining quarters should exceed 2011 but will remain relatively consistent with the second quarter of 2012. Again, better expense and earnings leverage should come in the back half of the year as we lap our growth investments, such as new sales representatives and eCommerce.","Third, our international business have posted improved performance, which we expect to continue. We believe Fabory will continue to deliver $0.03 to $0.06 of earnings accretion in 2012, while our newly acquired business in Brazil should be $0.03 to $0.05 dilutive this year.","Finally, the lower tax rate of 37.4% to 37.7% forecasted for 2012 should contribute $0.04 to $0.09 per share for the full year. As noted earlier, the first quarter included about a $0.02 benefit from the lower tax rate versus our original forecast.","Thank you for your interest in Grainger.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Holman, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Irene Holman","Good morning. Welcome to Grainger's Q3 earnings call. With me are D.G. Macpherson, Chairman and CEO; and Tom Okray, CFO.","As a reminder, some of our comments may be forward-looking based on our current view of future events. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our SEC filings. Reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures are at the end of this slide presentation and in our Q3 press release, both of which are available on the IR Web site.","This morning's call will focus on adjusted results and now I will turn it over to DG.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks Irene. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today.","I'm going to discuss our Q3 results and ensure an update on the U.S. and MS assortment growth initiatives that we introduced earlier this year. Then, Tom will provide details on the quarter and will open it up for questions.","We have solid result so far this year as we managed through the uncertainty of the current environment. Despite soften global demand, we have accelerated our sequential share gain in the U.S. business and continued to invest for growth in our MS assortment business Zoro.","We have also been diligent in partnering with our suppliers to manage cost and difference expense leverage across our U.S. and Canadian businesses. Year-to-date total company operating margin is up 30 basis points and we driven incremental margins of 26%. We have also maintained the guidance that we set on the Q4 call on January for total company total gross profit margin, operating margin and earnings per share. I want to commend our team members for all the work they done to strive during this environment.","From our recent U.S. customer visit, clear that demand has slowed but it's also through the things are not falling off the cliff. And we have great opportunities to continue to gain share. Earlier this month, I spend time with the large manufacturer in the Southeast. They have seen strong growth due to their ability to innovate.","Our team members have built solid relationships with their leadership and operation staff and are delivering solution that matter. This customer view Grainger has providing exceptional service as part of their operation.","We have leveraged our key stock inventory management system to make easy for this customer to have what they need when they needed. We will have a portion of this customer spend today because of our reliable partnership and our ability to deliver real value; we are exploring ways to expand our offer. This means finding ways for this customer to save more money by ensuring that they are using the right products at the right cost and managing usage and inventory effectively. When we do these things well we gain share. I rarely visit a customer with the opportunity to create value and gain share is not significant. And we do this across our business through two models.","Through out high tech solutions model, we provide relevant products and services to customers to drive efficiencies and to save their money. Through our endless assortment model, we provide value through an expansive assortment that is easily accessed to streamline search experience.","In these challenging times, we continue to focus on what matters. We are investing for growth in both business models. Our strong balance sheet allows us to invest in good times and bad. And we are rigorous in our expense management. We have already achieved roughly $200 million in savings in the last two years and have expectations for continued productivity moving forward.","With that, let's take a closer look at our performance in the U.S. in Q3. Similar to what we are seeing from economic indicators, we estimate that U.S. market growth accelerated from approximately 2% to 2.5% Q1 and approximately 1% in Q2 to about flat in Q3.","We are seeing softness across most end markets including heavy manufacturing, natural resources, contractors and in pockets like manufacturing. We have seen some of our customers particular with heavy manufacturing and natural resources slow production. Healthcare market remains quite strong and we are seeing flat to modest growth in government and retail end markets.","U.S. segment share gain accelerated sequentially in the third quarter by 250 basis points of out growth versus the market. U.S. large business grew 2% and 10% on a two year stack and U.S. midsize grew 5% and 23% on a two year stack.","Let me spend a few minutes providing an update on our U.S. growth initiatives which we introduced in May of this year. As previously communicated, these initiatives fall under two buckets. First, our improvements to our foundation that ensure that we stay competitive, this includes improving the quality of our product and customer data, embedding our keep stock offer and enhancing the customer experience.","Second bucket of initiatives are incremental investments that contribute to our long-term goal of 300 to 400 basis points of growth above market. Our initiatives are beginning to take hold as evidenced by 250 basis points of share gain in the quarter.","Our merchandising efforts are showing strong incremental revenue lift driven by our comprehensive category review process. About $0.5 billion of product revenue has been remerchandised and we're seeing good results. We expect to get through about $1 billion for our assortment by year end.","We made incremental marketing investments in the third quarter and our return on these investments has steadily improved throughout the year, which has exceeded our expectations. We have made solid progress in improving the customer experience and have increased the effectiveness of our order to cash process since the beginning of this year. Our customer feedback suggests that we provide the best experience in our space. We have re-energized our corporate account work and have seen improvements in share gain with this group of customers.","Finally, we are on track to start receiving inbound shipments to our Louisville DC in the fourth quarter. We are encouraged by our ability to accelerate sequential share gain in the U.S. and we remain fully committed to 300 to 400 basis points of outgrowth versus the market on an ongoing basis.","I also want to spend a few minutes on our growth initiatives at Zoro U.S. You've heard us talk about expanding the product assortment of Zoro. Our goal is to add 10 million items over the next three to five years. In the third quarter we added about 350,000 SKUs, which brings us to 800,000 SKUs for the year.","These product adds are driving incremental revenue growth on a first new basis that is similar to what we've seen historically at MonotaRO. Our investment in systems and people to help drive this growth are also going well. We launched a new marketing campaign in September and the results are promising, although early. We are optimistic about the trajectory of Zoro going forward; the bulk of our investments in this business will be completed by the end of this year. And we expect strong growth and profitability moving forward.","Now, the natural tendency would be to cut back on these types of investments during a soft market. While we are focused on long-term growth of our business and we'll continue to make prudent investments while driving productivity.","Now I'll turn it over to Tom who will discuss the quarter's results in more detail.","Thomas Okray","Thanks DG.","Looking at our total company adjusted results for the quarter daily sales were up 2.5%, volume grew 2.5% and both price and the impact of FX were flat to the prior year.","Two of our businesses, AGI and Cromwell are not only facing challenging end markets but are also in the middle of turnarounds. Their results are adversely impacting the company's performance. For perspective the U S segment and endless assortment. businesses combined were up 4.5% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date versus the prior year.","Moving to gross profit. Our total company gross profit margin declined 80 basis points versus the prior year. The decline in gross profit margin was driven primarily by the timing of U.S. price adjustments during the year, which resulted in negative price cost spread in the U.S in the third quarter. Lower gross profit margin of our endless assortment businesses also contributed to the decline.","Year-to-date, our total company gross profit margin is down 40 basis points versus the prior year. For the fourth quarter, we expect the company's gross profit margin to be higher than the third quarter. We drove operating earnings growth of 2% in the quarter. Our operating margin, however, declined 20 basis points versus the prior year due primarily to the investments we're making to drive growth at Zoro. Excluding the investments in Zoro, SG&A leverage completely offset the gross profit margin decline in the quarter. As expected, SG&A grew at half the rate of sales.","As an organization, we will continue to rigorously manage expenses while ensuring we're providing the absolute best experience for our customers. Year-to-date, operating margin has expanded 30 basis points and we've driven incremental margin of 26%. We were also focused on generating strong cash flow while operating cash flow in the quarter decreased 8% driven primarily by unfavorable timing of supplier payments, operating cash flow was up 3.5% year-to-date and close to a 100% of reported net income.","Year-to-date, we've returned $842 million to shareholders through $242 million in dividends and $600 million in share buybacks. We expect to continue to buyback shares in the fourth quarter.","Now, let's turn to our performance in the U.S. The demand environment has slowed throughout the year and the market was flat in the third quarter. Daily sales were up 2.5% comprised of volume growth of 2.5%, flat price inflation, 0.5% increase of inter company sales to Zoro and a 0.5% decline in specialty brands.","In the quarter, we grew 250 basis points faster than the market driven by strong execution of our U.S. growth initiative. U.S. gross profit margin declined 80 basis points in the quarter versus the prior year driven primarily by product cost inflation outpacing price inflation partially offset by favorability and supply chain.","At the beginning of 2019, we wanted to ensure that our pricing was sufficient to cover product cost increases related to tariffs and general inflation. In retrospect, we were a little too aggressive. To ensure that our pricing was market-based, we dialed pricing back in the second quarter, while third quarter gross profit margin was a little below our expectations, we estimate that gross profit margin will be higher in the fourth quarter and the third quarter and the results for the entire year will be consistent with the expectations set at the start of the year.","In an environment with uncertainty around tariffs and market demand, quarterly noise is common place. Year-to-date picture is often more useful on the evaluating performance. More perspective on a year-to-date basis excluding the write down of remaining contract negotiations, our price cost spread is favorable. Further, we continue to effectively manage product cost inflation related to both tariffs and general inflation.","In the quarter both improved sequentially and we expect that trend to continue in the fourth quarter. U.S operating earnings increased 4% in the quarter, U S operating margin was flat versus the prior year as lower gross profit margin was completely offset by SG&A leverage. SG&A was flat on sales growth of 4%. In Canada, daily sales declined 14.5% on a constant currency basis. Price inflation was 1% in the quarter and volume declined 15.5%. Volume remains the main issue in Canada. While optimization of the cost structure is strong, it's taking time for us to stabilize top-line performance.","Operating margin was positive in the third quarter for the first time in 2019 driven by improvement to gross profit margin and continued diligence on the SG&A line. Gross profit margin improved 50 basis points versus the prior year largely due to supply chain efficiencies, offsetting negative price cost spread.","Moving to other businesses, which includes our endless assortment model and our international portfolio. Daily sales were up 9% in the third quarter on a constant currency basis due to revenue growth from our endless assortment model. Together MonotaRO and Zoro daily sales grew 19.5% in the quarter.","Gross profit margin for the other businesses declined 130 basis points driven by promotional activities at Zoro and freight headwinds at both Zora and MonotaRO.","Operating margin declined 220 basis points for the other businesses, primarily driven by long-term growth investments in Zoro U.S. and performance at Cromwell. As we've mentioned in the past, the Cromwell business is facing operational challenges while also experiencing a difficult economic climate. The business is taking action to improve service and the customer experience to drive top-line growth while also improving the cost structure.","Page 14 covers our guidance for 2019. At the total company level, we are reiterating all of our guided metrics. At the segment level, we expect the U.S. segment and other businesses to be within their guided ranges. For AGI, we now expect to finish the year below the guided range.","Now I'll turn it back to DG for closing remarks.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks Tom.","Our performance so far this year has been solid even in a slower growth environment and with the added uncertainty around tariffs. While AGI and Cromwell continue to be challenged, customer feedback is much better in both businesses. We have done a lot of work to get the cost structure and service right in AGI and Cromwell and are well positioned to grow in the future.","I was at Cromwell earlier this month and even with the economic challenges customers were pleased with our improved service, we are exploring how to expand these relationships. We are happy with the growth of our endless assortment businesses and the progress we're seeing with our U.S. growth initiatives. We have driven strong incremental margin year-to-date and are maintaining our total company guidance. We are committed to delivering strong performance over the short-term and long-term.","Our performance expectations remain the following; we expect our initiatives in the U.S. to drive 300 to 400 basis points of outgrowth versus the market on an ongoing basis. We believe Canada is an attractive market for Grainger and we will continue our work to drive profitable growth in that business.","We expect to accelerate growth with our endless assortment model through the strength of MonotaRO in Japan and the investments we're making in Zor0 U.S. Overall, we expected our strong SG&A leverage and operating margin improvement for the year, resulting in incremental margin of 20% to 25%.","Now, we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from David Manthey from Baird. Your line is now live.","David Manthey","Thank you. Good morning. You mentioned the long-term goal of growing SG&A at half the rate of sales growth and you've obviously done a great job over the past several years. And clearly that equation is lot easier when you're growing 8% than when you're growing 2%, but you've actually done it in both environments. What I'm wondering is, as we go forward here -- we're looking ahead to the next year or so. Do you have a specific plan in place that'll keep that expense leverage going or at some point that we just see natural low single digit inflation returned to the cost stack in any case?","Donald Macpherson","Thanks, Dave. I would say that we are constantly working on improving our expenses and our cost structure. We have a built in an expectation that the functions and the business will cover things like merit going forward. And we're working through plans for next year right now as you might guess. But, we feel pretty confident that we can continue to get cost productivity throughout the business and we'll work hard to make sure that we continue to deliver the performance we've been delivering.","David Manthey","Okay. Thanks. And then, DG, when you said that you expect a return to strong profitability in the endless assortment business or something along those lines that improved profitability. I'm just wondering if you can help us define that. Historically when you look at segment contribution margins, following periods of investment you've gotten as high as maybe the mid or higher teens, is that what we should be thinking about for contribution margins in the other business segment going forward?","Donald Macpherson","I would say that if you look at the online businesses, which are part of the other segment. Our expectation is we will return Zoro to profitability and we'll begin the migration over the next several years up to very strong profitability that we see in MonotaRO. And I think, the MonotaRO P&L give you a sense for where we hope to be able to get with the Zoro business. So that's our objective and it'll take several years to get there as we come out of these investments. But we're pretty confident we can continue to grow profits.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ryan Merkel from Williams Blair. Your line is now alive.","Ryan Merkel","Hey, thanks. Couple of questions. So, first, I just want to clarify why gross margins are going to improve in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. I apologize if I missed it.","Thomas Okray","Yes. Gross margins typically improve sequentially Q3 versus Q4 this year. Q4 versus Q3, they typically will improve. And this quarter is going to be no different going into Q4. We are seeing general inflation and tariff inflation going down and that's the main driver for gross profit going up in Q4.","Ryan Merkel","Got it. Okay. And then, you mentioned a price adjustment in the second quarter. Can you just tell us how much did you lower prices maybe on average, and was it broad based across all the SKUs or was it more targeted?","Thomas Okray","It was more targeted. And obviously, we're working on this on a continuous basis. As we said in the prepared remarks, coming up to Q1, we thought we overshot a little bit. So, we went back and really scrubbed. Some SKUs, we raised, some SKUs we lowered overall though we lowered.","Ryan Merkel","Got it. Okay. I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Thomas Okray","One other comment related to the first question on gross margin, we also expect some favorability in supply chain to help us out related to Q4. We see softening in the supply chain area, the transportation area. We expect that to also be a factor in Q4.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.","Christopher Glynn","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon out there. So, a lot of emphasis on the 300 to 400 basis points of long-term sustainable outgrowth. I wanted to narrow that down into medium, get a little more detail on traction on your initiatives and prospect to kind of inflect that growth higher. I think last quarter you talked about things like assortment, sales coverage and digital experience. So, wondering how you're seeing those kind of discreet drivers kind of ramp on the ground level.","Donald Macpherson","Yes. Thanks Chris. We continue to expect our midsize customer growth and share gain to be higher than the overall U.S. share gain. We continue to see that. We certainly given the way we cover and interact with customers, things like merchandising and marketing have an outsized impact. They impact all of our customers, but they have an outsized impact on the midsize customers and that has continued to play out.","And our expectation is that we will continue to grow significantly faster in the next several years with midsize customers than with the whole. And the initiatives are playing out pretty much as expected at this point.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And then, with Canada, just want to, I think you talked a little bit more about sales stabilization and prior quarters. Just wondering where's the cross section between the customer re-engagement you've talked about with stabilized service levels versus kind of softening macro up above?","Donald Macpherson","Yes. I'd say that. We have a number of our sales leaders in and we interact with them frequently and I've been talking to them and I've been in hearing from customer feedback. We are now having conversations and getting permission to grow with our customers. And that's -- it's been several years, frankly, since that's been the case. And so, we are right at the -- it feels like we're right at the precipice now of being able to start climbing again and grow based on the work we've done. And it's been a long haul, but we feel like we're having the right conversations now. So we're a lot more confident now than we've been in several years.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now alive.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone. Hey, I know you're not in the giving of 2020 guidance yet, but just could you talk qualitatively what you're expecting the U.S. MRO market to look like? One of the other big industrial distributors talked about a flattish expectations for the first half. How do you think the operating environment for MRO will be? And then, related to that, what caused you to step up into that 300 to 400 basis points of outgrowth and what might the timeframe be for that? So, two part question. Thanks.","Donald Macpherson","Thanks Deane. So I think, we don't have any crystal ball that's different than others we're seeing. We are planning for a wide range of potential market growth outcomes for next year and building plans around a wide range. I think flattish is not a bad place to start probably and anybody's guess, but that would not be a certainly a wrong estimate at this point. But we are planning for a fairly wide range. We actually are -- we have a set of initiatives that we've talked about that we believe are starting to build by getting us to that 300 to 400 basis points.","If you look at the quarter on a volume basis, we were significantly higher than 300 basis points of growth actually. So we are starting to get confident that we have the right initiatives in place to grow 300 or 400 basis points. And then, things we've been talking about with merchandising, marketing, adding sellers, corporate account growth, reenergizing things like [indiscernible] program. So, we feel like they've got the right initiatives and we're starting to get some of that traction right now.","Deane Dray","Terrific. And just as a follow up, is there any update on gamut? Looks like that website is in transition. You talked a bit about how that might be happening. And then maybe some update on the improvement of the search capability in the rollout there. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Donald Macpherson","Yes. Gamut is no longer a customer facing website. All those learnings have been built into the Grainger processes. We're building a new product information system that will be live in the fourth quarter. We've actually -- when we talk about remerchandising $0.5 billion so far this year, a lot of the insights from gamut are actually in those remerchandising. So if you look at the categories that we've gone through, you see a lot of the lessons there. So we have effectively built what we've learned from gamut into grainger.com, we're getting -- continued to get improved feedback from customers and that will only get better and better as we continue to build out more categories and improve the product information. So we're pretty excited about the path we're on in terms of our search experience right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Robert Barry from Buckingham Research. Your line is now alive.","Robert Barry","Hey everyone. Good morning. Just a quick follow up on Ryan's question. I think Tom, you mentioned seeing inflation going down. Was that just a comment on freight or is that broader?","Thomas Okray","I mean, sequentially, if you look at what we've experienced in Q3 versus Q2, we saw both tariff related inflation and general inflation go down. We expect that to continue in Q4 as well.","Robert Barry","Okay. So, do you expect to be priced cost positive in 4Q?","Thomas Okray","Didn't say that. We'll come back to what we said for the entire year. We expect to be price cost neutral excluding our pricing rate downs that we've done.","Robert Barry","Got it. It just seems a little counterintuitive because the tariff headwinds seemed to be growing. ","Thomas Okray","Actually, if you look at the tariffs, how we've experienced them throughout the year, they've been fairly constant. And now that we're starting to lap some of the tariffs, we're seeing improvement there. The other thing is you have to reconcile between stated tariffs and what we're actually able to negotiate in terms of realized tariff. And we've got two buckets we work on. One is our own imported parts which come from largely from China, which are impacted directly. And the other ones are national brands, which we work with our supplier partners. So stated versus actually realized is a factor as well.","Robert Barry","Got it. And so just lastly, so does that mean in that context, maybe seeing price at zero is less of a concern to you given you been able to negotiate some of this deflation?","Thomas Okray","Well, I think what I would say is, where we're at in terms of our share growth where we're at in terms of our share growth objectives and our share growth initiative, seeing flat pricing for the quarter doesn't get us overly exercised as DG mentioned from a volume basis. We grew share quite a bit and at this point where we're trying to get traction on our share gain initiative that doesn't concern us at one quarter we're priced flat.","If you look at the entire year, we're price cost neutral when you adjust for the reset from the strategic write down. And we're happy with that. It's what our objective was at the beginning of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Josh Pokrzwinksi from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.","Josh Pokrzwinksi","Hi. Good morning guys.","Donald Macpherson","Good morning.","Josh Pokrzwinksi","Just want to follow up. Given that we're now past -- kind of fully passed the price reset, just any observation with some of those customers what percentage of kind of converted to being more core customers versus those were maybe transactional during the process. So imagine you've got a better grasp on that today than maybe you did six or 12 months ago. How satisfied are you with that? And, I guess, hopefully that is the first question.","Donald Macpherson","So Josh, let me, I will answer the question and interpret it. So, tell me if I'm not answering correctly. We tend to look at with our large customers for sure. We had a lot of relationships that were not transactional relationships before. We still have a lot of those and we've expanded some of those. I think the biggest shift has been with mid sized customers where we now have a whole lot more midsize customers that are buying frequently. Based on the price reset and the price reset was largely to make sure that we were growing across the entire customer base consistently. And so we have liked the results we see with the test customers. You still have a long way to go to acquire and turn those -- many of those customers into regular purchasing customers. But we have made great progress with midsize customers.","Josh Pokrzwinksi","Got it. Yeah, that was a midsize customer question, so yeah, definitely","Donald Macpherson","Sure.","Josh Pokrzwinksi","Right. Yes. Well, large wouldn't make much sense. And then, I guess on the price cost dynamic from here, is there anything that happens as a function of the calendar in terms of customers kind of reevaluating the start a year where the progression kind of post 4Q inflex or diflex one way or another? I think from a cost perspective, there's probably equal measures deflation and inflation, but probably, a bit more deflation on the inputs. But just trying to understand how that conversation evolves over time on the pricing front and if there's anything that changes with the calendar?","Donald Macpherson","Well, we have a long history of working with our customers to -- a lot of our contract customers to lock in prices at the beginning of the year. So, we got through a process that we are going through now to make sure we've got the right competitive prices and that process always happens. So, there's always a sort of beginning of the year sort of reset that happens and you see that in our results historically that that will be the same this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today coming from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Your line is now live.","Karen Lau","Hi. Good morning. It's Karen Lau dialing in for John. So, I just want to clarify on the 3Q gross margins dynamic. It sounded like given you said price inflation has differentially come down essentially all of that gross margin degradation is coming from product pricing. I guess part of it maybe you can confirm that the 5% of large accounts that still needs to get price adjusted and is that done over the quarter. And then is the rest of the pricing degradation coming from more broad based pricing adjustments?","Thomas Okray","Yes. It's largely, done, we'll see a little bit in Q4 and then we won't have any in 2020.","Karen Lau","Okay. Yes. It just sounds like I guess given the magnitude of the pricing and gross margin decreased more of that has to do with broader based pricing adjustment. Maybe just follow up on that point. I guess you guys have adjusted pricing since the start of the year, I guess a couple of times. As you go through this exercise, are you seeing sequentially similar, well I guess the ideal volume response that you would hope for or are we -- as you go through, like these pricing exercise, are you starting to see throughout the year like bit of a more diminishing returns.","Thomas Okray","No, I, I think we're seeing good pricing response. Again, I'll go back to -- we see a flat MRO market in the third quarter included in that flat market is a little over 1% in price offset, little bit over 1% in volume deterioration. We were up 2.5%. So that puts us, well above 350 bps. There's also some weather issues related to the hurricanes last year that we didn't put in our prepared remarks and some government lapping differences. So yes, if you look at that, we're very happy with our volume response.","Donald Macpherson","Yes. I would just add that, if you think about some of the pricing dynamic, Tom talked about this. We talked about being priced cost neutral before the reset for the year. We are effectively where we expect to be in aggregate. And we are careful, we made pricing changes all the time, but we're very careful not to disrupt customers with large customers, particularly, we are changing prices around. So, we are a little bit more careful with how many times will change with large customers, but overall we've seen the exact response we expected this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research Company. Your line is now live.","Adam Uhlman","Hey, good morning guys. Had a few questions on Zoro. When should we expect incremental investment spend to wrap up? Are we fully lapping that as we head into the first quarter and should expect profitability to recover there early in the year, is going to take a little bit more time.","Thomas Okray","Yes, so we expect that, we expect profitability just to recover some in the first quarter. We did start investing pretty heavily in the first quarter of this year. And it'll just grow -- from profitability to grow from there. So, we will get some improvement in the first quarter's augmentation.","Adam Uhlman","Okay. And then, the 800,000 SKUs that have been added so far this year. And as we add some more going forward, I'm just wondering if you could comment about, if the gross margin profile of the business is changing. How you look at the categories that you're adding in? Is that more of a build out of the existing one or are there new product categories that are getting you into higher or lower margin categories?","Donald Macpherson","Yes. I think that we are -- first of all, we're adding a whole bunch of categories that we haven't had before. So there's a mix of that in new categories and expanding the operating just in categories. In general, we are creating a fairly distinct value proposition for Zoro and Zoro will become less relied on the Grainger supply chain moving forward. And so, most of those products will be drop shipped. So for the financials, the GP is lower when you have drop shipped items. So, was the expense. But, you'll see that impact to GP slightly over time. And, but we expect most of those items that we're adding, if we talk about 10 million over the next three to five years, we expect most of those items to be third-party ship. We're going to be stocking most of those in Grainger.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Chris Dankert from Longbow Research. Your line is now live.","Chris Dankert","All right. Thanks for taking my question. You guys have given some really great color on gross margin. I guess kind of moving down to SG&A, typically we see a bit of a step up into the fourth quarter here, but your reiteration of the guidance suggests maybe you can hold that flat of the fourth quarter. Is that the right way to be thinking about SG&A and just maybe some -- you can have it on the puts and takes that are in that line?","Thomas Okray","Yes. I think just thinking about it the right way. Year-to-date, we're on a total company level where we're 70 bps favorable for SG&A. We expect that percentage to increase for the entire year. We do have a favorable lap related to variable compensation in addition to just a number of other cost productivity ideas and implementation that'll hit in Q4.","Chris Dankert","Got it. Got. Thank you. And then thinking about, some of the rollback of the investment in the other business in Zoro and MonotaRO. I think you guys had called out rolling back the vast majority of that in 2020. Is that still the plan?","Donald Macpherson","Yes. That's still the plan, Chris. That is, if you think about it, a number of the investments have been system investments. So, we're going live with the new product information system for example, we get through those this year and those do not repeat next year. So, we have most of the investments behind us. We have added people analytics talent, marketing talent that will remain obviously but a lot of the investments are kind of one-timers if they're going to be gone this year.","Thomas Okray","And as you saw in the charts, we're really happy with the sales growth of both Zoro and MonotaRO. MonotaRO constant currency, local currency basis was up over 23% and Zoro was up big double digits. So, very happy with that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Justin Bergner from G. Research. Your line is now live.","Justin Bergner","Good morning, DJ. Good morning Tom. Just quickly on Zoro, did I hear you say earlier in the call that Zoro is currently running unprofitable below breakeven?","Donald Macpherson","No. They actually made money in the quarter just not as much as they will make on a ongoing run rate basis.","Justin Bergner","Okay. And does any of the investment -- price investment or is this all mainly on the SG&A side?","Donald Macpherson","It's both. There are promotional spending, which we're undertaking when are adding new SkUs and going into new verticals.","Donald Macpherson","Okay. On a dollar bases most of it is expense as opposed to price of that.","Justin Bergner","Okay, great. My other question was just around the -- I guess price action you took that affected price cost in the third quarter. Was that price action taken in the second quarter such that you kind of expected the results that you ended up just reporting or was some of that taken in the third quarter? And was that all sort of to correct for some of the pricing you took in the earlier part of the year? It was some of that more in response to current market conditions.","Donald Macpherson","It's taken in the second quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is now live.","Nigel Coe","Yes. Good morning. Why don't you just come back from the gross margin sequential guidance he gave and certainly, when you go back in history, there's a very profound seasonal uplift in 4Q. Can you remind us though what drives that? Is it a mixed impact? Because normally revenues are slightly down. So, just curious what drives that.","And then, the second part of that question is with the task list three 25% rolled in from may onwards and then that's from September, I think you talked about 10% of your U S sales industry [indiscernible] school. I'm just curious why we're not incrementally shrink pressures come from prep and preps are set by other deflation meeting text. But maybe just address that as well, please.","Thomas Okray","Okay. Well, let me take the first one and I might have to get you to repeat the second one where it was, it was breaking up on our phone here. There are many levers that we can pull in terms of, in terms of gross margin for Q4, why is it historically goes up. Traditionally I think what we've seen is, we've seen cost inflation work its way, work its way down throughout the year, and we have better opportunities in terms of related to pricing terms in terms of vendor rebates, customer support, those types of things, which are quarter-end settlements. And we count those as costs, obviously.","Our pricing environment is fairly static throughout the year as DG mentioned with the, the big pricing happening throughout the year. So the main driver in Q4 is really our vendor volume rebates and our customer rebates settlements that we have in Q4.","Donald Macpherson","And if I can get you to, repeat the second question, please.","Thomas Okray","Yeah, I'm, it's pretty just about the impact of the tariff. So the step up from 10% to 25% on the list, three tariffs which would it early May. And then, I think previously close to 10% of your U.S. sales are less three, 10% or less forward. So I'm just wondering why we're not facing some inflationary pressures. Going into Q4 full that would need to be offset with price.","Well, we've got part one and part two, which arguably are a lower amount of our cogs, which are laughing in Q4. So, we'll see less of an impact there. Q3, you're right. Is moving from 10% to 25% or did move from 10% to 25% in May. Again, I will take you back to the actual stated info tear off number versus realize, we are experiencing much less than the stated tariff number on an actual basis. So, it's hard to just look at what's stated and, look at the actual results. You really have to focus on the actual realized results.","And our team's doing a very good job of working with our supplier partners to mitigate those increases.","Nigel Coe","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Patrick Baughman from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.","Patrick Baughman","Hi, DG. Hi, Tom. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the Zoro business, if you could put a finer point on -- you said it's making money, is it making money this year. Is it kind of like a mid single digit type operating margin? I know MonotaROs in the low double digits. Just have a better sense of what the runway is there over the next several years. What the base is this year.","Thomas Okray","We are not going to go into specific breakout of Zoro, let's leave it. It's making a small amount of money this year.","Patrick Baughman","Okay, fair enough. And then, how should we think about the Louisville facility coming on line in the fourth quarter here. And then, into next year brought from I guess, what are your expectations from the market. Our growth or cost perspective and you mentioned supply chain favorability that you expect in the fourth quarter. I know that's part of it. Are respect some just curious any color on that?","Donald Macpherson","I think, I would answer that two ways. One is long-term [indiscernible] facility provides capacity and helpful capacity in a couple of ways. That first thing does it, it allows us to stock probably 200,000 more items in the network, because it's a very good pack up for Chicago, Greenville, New Jersey and even Dallas for some degree. It allows us to stock more items, add more breadth, which provides better customer experience.","And typically that does drive growth. The other thing it does its next to the report. So, gives you [indiscernible] for sale items, before moving items in the network to get a customers who needs them and that's [indiscernible] customers.","We are working through exactly how to bring the building up. We're starting to receive in the fourth quarter and we'll talk more about that at the end of the fourth quarter in terms of what we're using the building for exactly next year and how we're bringing that building up. It's huge and it's going to take a couple of years to get to full capacity for sure that we're going to leverage that building to provide better service to customers next year and improve our cost structure as well. So we'll, talk about that at the end of year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael McGinn from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.","Michael McGinn","Thanks a lot for the time. If I could switch gears to more of a long-term fundamental question regarding the endless assortment model? Having visited your new New Jersey DC, there was a distinct concerted effort on what shows up in a red box versus what shows up in a blue box. I'm just wondering, long-term, what kind of thresholds are you putting on the third-party market and maintain branding? Are they going to get national account freight pricing? How does that feed into your supplier rebate discussions longer-term, if you can just answer those quick questions, would be great.","Thomas Okray","So, we will have, as we build out the endless assortment, we will have partners that provide distinct over branding whether or not it's an acid box or a label is, is probably up for discussion at this point still. But, the idea is, we will make sure we became this overall branding. Zoro will have more ownership for its own state. It will still leverage free contracts that we have at Grainger and leverage some things at Grainger, but in general it will be more independent. The value proposition will be independent and the business was more independent.","Michael McGinn","And the growth of that business, does that feed into the general Grainger supplier rebate conversation or is that something separate?","Thomas Okray","For stuff that we stopped jointly? It definitely will or stuff that we don't it will not.","Operator","Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to DG Macpherson for any further closing or comments.","Donald Macpherson","Terrific. Thanks. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'll just reiterate what we feel are really important about our expectations moving forward. In our U.S. business, we feel that scale really, really matters and gaining share is incredibly important. And so our expectation is that we are going to grow revenue 340 basis points fashion in the market. We feel like we have a great opportunity to do that with a relatively stable gross profit and continuing leverage on the SG&A line going forward. In Canada, we have improved the customer experience. We are re-engaging customers in a positive way. And if we can get volume back into the business, which is our entire focus right now, we're going to be in a place to drive profitable growth.","We're excited about being able to serve them all the investments we're making, even in Zoro excited about the growth path there. And we feel really, really good about a lot of the initiatives we have and the customer experience we're providing. So appreciate the time today and look forward to talking to you soon. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."],"9906":["W.W. Grainger (NYSE:GWW) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 16, 2013  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Laura D. Brown - Senior Vice President of Communications & Investor Relations","William D. Chapman - Senior Director of Investor Relations","Laura D. Brown","Hello, this is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations.","The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's first quarter 2013 results. Please also reference our 2013 first quarter earnings release issued today, April 16, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this podcast.","Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.","Today, we reported results for the 2013 first quarter and raised our 2013 sales and earnings guidance. We raised the low end of the guidance ranges to reflect the solid start to the year and account for an increase in growth spending. We now expect sales to grow 5% to 9% and are forecasting EPS of $11.30 to $12 for the full year 2013. At the end of this recording, we'll talk more about our revised guidance and assumptions.","Company sales for the quarter increased 4% versus the 2012 first quarter, 6% on a daily basis. We had 63 selling days in the quarter, 1 less than the previous year. Operating earnings and net earnings increased 13%. Earnings per share were $2.94 for the quarter, an increase of 14% versus the 2012 first quarter.","Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins increased 80 basis points to 45.2% versus 44.4% in 2012, primarily driven by the United States segment. Company operating margin increased 120 basis points to 15.1% versus 13.9% a year ago. The earnings growth was driven by the 4% sales increase and operating expenses growing at a slower rate than sales. Operating expenses increased 3%, including $22 million in incremental growth-related spending versus the 2012 first quarter. These growth investments include additional sales coverage, eCommerce, advertising, IT systems and expansion of the company's distribution center network.","We took a cautious approach to spending in the 2013 first quarter given the uncertainties surrounding the threat of the fiscal cliff at the end of December. Given a modestly improving economic backdrop and solid performance in the quarter, we are increasing the estimated amount of incremental growth-related spending to $160 million for the year. We had originally forecasted $135 million in incremental growth-related investment in 2013, but also bracketed this number with $25 million on either side based on sales growth. We view our commitment to a higher growth spending as an example of our leadership in the MRO industry and an attractive opportunity to gain market share over the long term.","Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of March; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with the discussion of our 2013 guidance and other key items.","As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 4% on a reported basis and 6% on a daily basis. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 8% in January, 6% in February and 3% in March. Daily sales growth in March was affected by the timing of the Easter holiday, which I will cover in more detail in the March sales section.","The 6% increase in daily sales in the quarter included 3 percentage points from volume, 2 percentage points from price, 1 percentage point from acquisitions and 1 percentage point from sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point drag from foreign exchange.","Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled, Other Businesses.","Sales in the United States, which accounted for 77% of total company revenue in the quarter increased 4%, 6% on a daily basis. The 6% daily sales growth for the quarter was driven by 3 percentage points from price, 2 percentage points from volume and 1 percentage point from the Techni-Tool business acquired on December 31, 2012. Daily sales increased 7% in January, 7% in February and 4% in March.","Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Light manufacturing was up in the high-single digits; Heavy Manufacturing, Commercial, Contractor, Retail and Natural Resources were up in the mid-single digits; Government was up in the low-single digits; and Reseller was down in the low-single digits.","Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 12% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales in Canada increased 4% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency. On a daily basis in U.S. dollars, sales increased 5% and consisted of 8 percentage points from volume, partially offset by a 2 percentage point decline from the timing of the Easter holiday and a 1 percentage point decline from foreign exchange. By month, daily sales in Canadian dollars increased 8% in January, 8% in February and 3% in March. Sales performance in Canada was driven by strong growth to customers in the Construction, Commercial, Forestry, Oil and Gas and Light Manufacturing end markets.","Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations, primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America and currently represents about 11% of total company sales.","Sales for this group increased 4%, 5% on a daily basis, which consisted of 6 percentage points from volume and price and 4 percentage points from the acquired business in Brazil, partially offset by a 5 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The sales increase was primarily due to solid revenue growth in Japan and Mexico, coupled with incremental sales from Brazil.","Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for January and February and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at March, which was affected by the timing of the Easter holiday and customer spending pullbacks related to sequestration within the Government end market.","There were 21 selling days in March of 2013 versus 22 days in the same month of 2012. Company sales increased 3% on a daily basis in March of 2013 versus March of 2012. The daily sales growth in March included 3 percentage points from volume, 2 percentage points from price, 1 percentage point from the acquisitions, partially offset by a 2 percentage point decline from the timing of the Easter holiday and 1 percentage point decline from foreign exchange.","In the United States, March daily sales increased 4%. This increase was due to a 3 percentage point increase from price, 1 percentage point increase in volume, 1 percentage point from the Techni-Tool acquisition, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from the timing of the Easter holiday. March customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Light Manufacturing was up in the high-single digits; Heavy Manufacturing and Contractor were up in the mid-single digits; Commercial and Retail were up in the low-single digits; Natural Resources was flat; Government was down in the low-single digits; and Reseller was down in the mid-single digits.","Uncertainty in the United States surrounding sequestration contributed to a decline in sales to the Government end market. Sales weakness in the Government end market was driven by Federal Government agencies, while sales to state and local government increased versus March 2012. As a point of reference, Government represented 15% of U.S. sales in the 2013 first quarter.","Daily sales in Canada for March were flat in U.S. dollars, up 3% in local currency. The flat daily sales consisted of 8 percentage points from volume, offset by a 5 percentage point decline from the timing of the Easter holiday and 3 percentage point decline from foreign exchange. The Canadian business was closed on Good Friday, whereas the U.S. business was open. As a reminder, we use the number of selling days in the United States as a basis for our calculation of daily sales company-wide. Sales growth in Canada was driven by strong performance in the Construction, Commercial, Forestry, Government and Light Manufacturing end markets.","Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 3% in March, consisting of 6 percentage points from volume and price; 5 percentage points from the acquisition in Brazil, partially offset by negative 7 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange; and 1 percentage point decline from the timing of the Easter holiday. In local currency, sales for the business in Japan grew in the high teens, but most of the growth was offset by the weakening of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.","Daily sales growth in the month of April is currently trending in the high-single digits. As a reminder, the comparison should be more favorable as Easter was in April of 2012. If you normalize both March and April for Easter, daily sales growth in April is running slightly ahead of March.","Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.","William D. Chapman","Thanks, Laura. Since we've already analyzed company operating performance, let's jump right into performance by reportable segment. Operating earnings in the United States increased 11% versus the 2012 first quarter, while the operating margin increased 110 basis points to 18.7%. This performance was driven by the 4% sales growth, higher gross profit margins and positive operating expense leverage.","Gross profit margins for the quarter increased 80 basis points driven by price increases exceeding cost inflation and growth of private label products, partially offset by unfavorable selling mix.","Operating expenses grew at a slower rate than sales and included $20 million in incremental growth-related spending on areas such as new sales representatives, eCommerce and advertising.","Let's move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings increased 11% versus the prior year in both U.S. dollars and local currency. The improvement in operating performance was driven by higher sales and positive operating expense leverage, despite an incremental $2 million in growth-related spending. Gross margins in Canada were essentially flat versus the prior year. The 4% growth in sales and lower operating expenses contributed to a 70 basis point increase in the operating margin to 11.6%.","The Other Businesses generated $8 million in operating earnings in the 2013 first quarter versus $11 million in the 2012 first quarter. The decline in earnings performance for the quarter versus the prior year was primarily driven by operating losses for the acquired business in Brazil and lower earnings for some of the smaller businesses in Asia and Latin America. The earnings decline was partially offset by strong earnings growth in Japan and operating earnings growth in Europe, related to lower expenses from restructuring actions taken in the 2012 fourth quarter.","Below the operating line, interest expense, net of interest income, was $2.3 million in the 2013 first quarter versus $2.5 million in the 2012 first quarter. For the quarter, the effective tax rate in 2013 was 37.3% versus 37.4% in 2012. The company is currently projecting an effective tax rate of 37.3% to 37.7% for the full year 2013.","Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $176 million, up 66% versus $106 million in 2012. Cash flow in the 2013 quarter benefited from higher earnings, lower inventory purchases and a lower management incentive payout versus the prior year. We used the cash to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders, share repurchase and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $43 million versus $41 million in 2012. We paid dividends of $57 million reflecting the 21% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2012. In addition, we bought back 315,000 shares of stock for $70 million and ended the quarter with 5.0 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $127 million to shareholders in the quarter.","As reported in our 2013 first quarter earnings release, we raised the low end of our 2013 sales guidance by 2 percentage points, and we increased the low end of our 2013 earnings per share guidance by $0.45. We now expect 5% to 9% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.30 to $12.","Let's look more closely at the underlying elements of our current expectations. Let's begin with sales. The new guidance range for daily sales growth implies roughly 5% to 10% daily sales growth for the remainder of the year. In the absence of any material changes in the economy, we expect reported daily sales growth to accelerate slightly through the year, driven by contributions from our growth programs and easier comparisons. We anniversary-ed the Brazil acquisition in May of 2013. We have 1 additional selling day in the 2013 third quarter, although selling days for the full year are equal to 2012. And we are now forecasting a range of negative 1 to 0 percentage points related to foreign exchange.","Moving on to gross profit margins. We are forecasting gross margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points for the full year. Gross profit margins in the second quarter should be above last year's second quarter, but below the 2013 first quarter. Consistent with prior years, the first quarter included supplier support provided for our annual customer trade shows. As a result, both gross profit and operating expenses, as a percent of sales, are inflated by about 100 basis points.","Unlike 2012, we are not expecting any interim price increases for the remainder of the year given the low inflation environment for commodities. We're also expecting that stronger sales growth to large customers with lower pricing will create headwinds, particularly in the back half of the year.","Operating expenses should generate 20 to 30 basis points of cost leverage for the full year. Incremental growth-related spending of $160 million for the year will accelerate and will drive sequential increases in operating expenses for the remaining 3 quarters. Roughly 40% of the incremental growth spending will occur in the front half of the year with the remaining 60% hitting in the second half.","Work is underway to build out a new enterprise system for the businesses in Canada and Mexico. Costs for the project are back-end loaded, but could affect 2013 operating margins in Canada by 50 to 100 basis points, depending on the pace of spending.","We expect 40 to 60 basis points of operating margin expansion for the full year versus 2012 through the combination of gross margin expansion and better cost leverage. Finally, we are now forecasting foreign exchange, primarily related to the Japanese yen, to be a headwind of $0.05 to $0.07 per share for the full year.","Please mark your calendar for the following events scheduled during the next 4 weeks. On April 24, we will host our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The script from that presentation will be available on our website following this event. On May 7, Court Carruthers, Senior Vice President and President of Grainger United States, will present at the Robert W. Baird Growth Stock Conference in Chicago. The event will be webcast. And finally, we will release April sales on Friday, May 10.","Thank you for your interest in Grainger.

Chapman - Senior Director of Investor Relations","Laura D. Brown","Hello. This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's fourth quarter 2013 results. Please also reference our 2013 fourth quarter earnings release issued today, January 24, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations website to supplement this podcast.","Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions and competitive and regulatory expectations and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.","Today, we reported results for the year 2013 and updated our earnings per share and sales guidance for 2014. For the full year 2013, company sales increased 5% to $9.4 billion. Net earnings increased 16% to $797 million and earnings per share increased 17% to $11.13. Operating cash flow increased 21% to $986 million. Despite a challenging economic environment, this was a solid year for Grainger as we continued to invest in infrastructure and growth designed to accelerate our share gains within the MRO market and increase our size and scale.","We also updated our guidance. We now expect 2014 earnings per share of $12.10 to $12.85 and sales of 5% to 9% growth. This change is largely due to a weaker Canadian dollar in recent months and the divestiture of a number of the direct-marketing Specialty Brands that were sold on December 31, 2013. Our 2014 guidance issued on November 13, 2013, called for earnings per share of $12.25 to $13 and sales of 6% to 10% growth.","To better understand our performance, the majority of the analysis and commentary for the remainder of the podcast excludes the effects of the charges in 2013 and 2012. Details regarding the charges can be found in the 2013 fourth quarter earnings press release and Exhibit 1 of this podcast posted on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Excluding the charges from the years 2013 and 2012, company operating earnings increased 8%, while net earnings increased 9%. Earnings per share were $11.52 for the year, representing a 10% increase versus $10.43 in 2012. Unfavorable foreign exchange was a significant headwind throughout the year, reflecting a $0.08 per share reduction to earnings per share.","Now let's turn to the 2013 fourth quarter. Results were within the expectations issued at our Analyst Day in November. Guidance for the 2013 fourth quarter included 6% to 8% sales growth and earnings per share of $2.53 to $2.73. Company sales in the fourth quarter increased 7%. Excluding the charges from 2013 and 2012, operating earnings increased 3%, while net earnings increased 6%. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.59 for the quarter, representing an increase of 7% versus the 2012 fourth quarter. Unfavorable foreign exchange was a headwind, while the acquired businesses with lower gross margins and acquisition-related costs negatively affected operating margins. E&R Industrial, E&R, was slightly accretive to earnings in the quarter, performing ahead of our original expectations.","Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Gross profit margins were 42.3% versus 43.6% in the 2012 fourth quarter. The 130 basis points decrease was driven by lower gross margins from the acquired businesses, which accounted for approximately 2\/3 of the decrease. The remainder of the decline related to faster growth with lower-margin customers. In our Third Quarter Podcast, we forecasted that gross profit margins would decline as much as 40 basis points. The actual decline was larger than expected due to E&R's strong sales performance and the addition of the Safety Solutions acquisition in December. In addition, higher-than-expected freight costs, lower-than-expected supplier rebates contributed to the decline.","On an adjusted basis, company operating earnings for the quarter increased 3%. The earnings growth was driven by the 7% sales increase and operating expenses growing at a slower rate than sales. Operating expenses grew 4%, including $31 million in incremental growth-related spending. Incremental growth spending for the full year 2013 was $132 million versus 2012. Operating expenses benefited from $22 million in gains from the sale of fixed assets and the divestiture of the direct-marketing Specialty Brands in the fourth quarter. The majority of the gains were offset by severance and other related costs. A schedule summarizing incremental growth spending for 2010 through 2013 can be found in Exhibit 4 of this podcast posted on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Company operating margin decreased 40 basis points to 12.3% versus 12.7% a year ago. In our Third Quarter Podcast, we shared that operating margins in the fourth quarter could decline as much as 20 basis points. The actual decline exceeded our estimate, primarily due to strong performance from E&R, the Safety Solutions acquisition and unfavorable foreign exchange, which was more of a factor than we anticipated. Excluding the acquisitions, the company operating margin for the fourth quarter would have been flat versus 2012.","Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter, the month of December and January sales so far; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2014 guidance and other key items.","Now let's discuss 2013 fourth quarter, December and January sales, in more detail. As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 7%. We had 64 selling days in the quarter, the same as the previous year. The 7% sales growth for the quarter consisted of 5 percentage points from volume, 4 percentage points from acquisitions and 1 percentage point from sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 2 percentage points decline from unfavorable foreign exchange and 1 percentage point from Hurricane Sandy-related sales in 2012. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 7% in October, 5% in November and 9% in December. December included 2 months of sales from E&R. Sales for this new acquisition had been reported on a 1-month lag and caught up in December. As a result, the sales contributions from acquisitions, which also includes Techni-Tool and Safety Solutions, was higher in the month.","Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations, located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 78% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 10%. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: 10% in October, 7% in November and 12% in December. The 10% sales growth was driven by 5 percentage points from volume, 6 percentage points from acquisitions and 1 percentage point from sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline from price and 1 percentage point from an unfavorable comparison to sales related to Hurricane Sandy in 2012.","Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Here is the sales performance, excluding acquisitions, for each respective customer end market in the quarter. Light manufacturing was up in the low double digits. Heavy manufacturing and retail were up in the high single digits. Commercial and natural resources were up in the mid-single digits. Government was flat, and contractor and reseller were down in the low single digits. Within government, sales to state and local customers, which accounted for approximately 75% of our government sales, grew in the mid-single digits, while sales to federal customers were down in the mid-teens for the quarter.","Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian segment. Sales in Canada represented 11% of total company revenues in the quarter. For the quarter, sales in Canada decreased 3% in U.S. dollars and increased 3% in local currency. Sales consisted of 3 percentage points from volume, offset by 6 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange. By month, daily sales in Canadian dollars increased 1% in October, 3% in November and 6% in December. Sales performance in Canada was driven by growth in the commercial, transportation, light manufacturing and forestry end markets.","Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America, currently represents about 11% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 3%, which consisted of 11 percentage points of growth from volume and price, partially offset by an 8 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. Sales growth in the Other Businesses was driven by Zoro Tools and the business in Mexico. The business in Japan grew more than 20% in local currency, but the growth was offset by the weakness in the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.","Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales for October and November and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at December. There were 21 selling days in December of 2013 versus 20 in the same month of 2012. Total company sales increased 9% on a daily basis in December of 2013 versus December of 2012. The daily sales growth in December included 6 percentage points from acquisitions, 4 percentage points from volume, 2 percentage points from sales of seasonal products, partially offset by 2 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange and 1 percentage point from price. As I mentioned earlier, E&R contributed 2 months of sales in December, so the sales contribution from acquisitions was higher in the month versus the rest of the quarter.","In the United States, December daily sales increased 12%, driven by 7 percentage points from acquisitions, 4 percentage points from volume, 2 percentage points from sales of seasonal products, partially offset by 1 percentage point from price. December customer end-market performance in the United States, excluding acquisitions, was as follows. Light manufacturing, retail and natural resources were up in the low double digits. Heavy manufacturing, commercial and contractor were up in the mid-single digits. Reseller was up in the low single digits, and government was flat. Similar to the quarter, sales to state and local government customers grew in the low single digits, while sales to federal customers were down in the low double digits for the month.","Daily sales in Canada for December decreased 2% in U.S. dollars but were up 6% in local currency. The 2% daily sales decline consisted of 5 percentage points from volume, 1 percentage point from sales of seasonal products, offset by 8 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange. Sales growth in Canada was driven by strong performance in the commercial, transportation, retail, utilities and forestry end markets.","Daily sales for our Other Businesses increased 4% in December, consisting of 13 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a negative 9 percentage points from unfavorable foreign exchange. Strong sales growth of nearly 20% in Japan was offset by the weakness in the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar.","Let's move on to January. The story thus far has been weather and foreign exchange. In the United States, sales, including acquisitions, were flat the first 5 business days of the month due to the extreme cold and snow across much of the country. During the next 10 business days, sales rebounded to the mid to upper single digits. As the month progresses, cold weather and snow in the United States and Canada continued to be an issue. Outside of the United States, foreign exchange in Canada and Japan continued to be a significant headwind. Combined with the softness in Europe, we expect total company daily sales growth in the low single digits for the month of January.","As a reminder, January sales will exclude the direct-marketing Specialty Brands divested at the end of December. These businesses contributed approximately $96 million in revenue in 2013.","Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.","William D. Chapman","Thanks, Laura.","Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, we will discuss performance by reporting segment. As a reminder, results in this discussion exclude the charges detailed in the earnings press release and Exhibit 1 of this podcast, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website.","Adjusted operating earnings in the United States increased 7% versus the 2012 fourth quarter, driven by the 10% sales growth and positive expense leverage, partially offset by lower gross profit margins. Gross profit margins for the quarter decreased 180 basis points, driven by lower gross margins from the acquired businesses and faster growth with lower-margin customers. Of the 180 basis point decline, nearly 2\/3 is related to acquisitions with lower gross margins. Positive expense leverage was driven by the 10% sales growth versus a 5% increase in operating expenses and included $28 million in incremental growth-related spending on areas such as new sales representatives, eCommerce and inventory management. The U.S. operating margin decreased 50 basis points to 16.3%, primarily due to the acquired businesses with lower gross profit margins. Excluding the acquisitions, the adjusted operating margin for the U.S. segment would have increased 20 basis points in the quarter versus the prior year.","Let's move on to our business in Canada. Operating earnings decreased 10% versus the 2012 fourth quarter, down 5% in local currency. The decrease was driven by lower gross profit margins, the 3% sales decline due to unfavorable foreign exchange and negative expense leverage. Gross margins in Canada decreased 20 basis points versus the prior year. This decline was primarily due to product cost inflation exceeding price inflation, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange, which is a function of purchasing approximately 1\/3 of Canada's products from the United States. Contributing to the lower operating performance was approximately $2 million in incremental spending related to IT systems enhancements.","On an adjusted basis, the Other Businesses generated $3 million in operating earnings in both the 2013 and 2012 quarters. Strong operating performance for Zoro Tools offset lower performance from most of the Other Businesses. In addition, the business in Japan generated strong earnings growth in local currency, which was more than offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. We are currently evaluating the operating performance and strategic direction of some of the international businesses that are not meeting expectations.","Other income and expense was a net expense of $2 million in the 2013 fourth quarter versus a net expense of $5 million in the 2012 fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower average borrowings and lower average interest rates in the 2013 fourth quarter versus the 2012 fourth quarter.","For the quarter, the effective tax rate in 2013 was 37.3% versus 37.6% in 2012. For the year, the effective tax rate was 37.3% versus 37.5% in 2012. The company is currently projecting an effective tax rate of 37.4% to 37.8% for the year 2014. The higher expected tax rate in 2014 is primarily a function of higher earnings in jurisdictions with higher tax rates.","Lastly, let's took -- take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $246 million versus $240 million in 2012. We used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business, fund acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $124 million versus $95 million in 2012. We paid dividends of $67 million in the quarter, reflecting the 16% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2013. In addition, we bought back 606,000 shares of stock for $159 million and ended the quarter with 3.6 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. In total, we returned $226 million to shareholders in the quarter.","At our analyst meeting in November, we issued sales and earnings guidance for 2014. As reported in our 2013 fourth quarter earnings release, we adjusted our guidance and we now expect 2014 earnings per share of $12.10 to $12.85 and sales of 5% to 9% growth. This change is primarily related to increased unfavorable foreign exchange and the divestiture of the direct-marketing Specialty Brands.","Now let's take a closer look of some of the assumptions for the full year 2014 and the 2014 first quarter.","We'll start with sales. For the full year, the change from our original sales guidance relates primarily to an increase in unfavorable foreign exchange, largely in Canada, and to a lesser extent, Japan; and the divestiture of the direct-marketing Specialty Brands, reducing total company sales by 1%. Also, January will be the first month to reflect the annual price increase in the U.S. business. We expect 1% price inflation for full year 2014.","Let's move on to gross profit margins. For the full year, on an organic basis, gross margin expansion could reach 30 basis points at the high end, driven by the United States and Canada. On a reported basis, we are forecasting minimal gross margin expansion versus 2013 due to lower gross margins from the acquired businesses. For the first quarter, we expect organic gross profit margins to be up approximately 20 basis points. On a reported basis, we are expecting gross profit margins to decrease by about 30 basis points due to the acquired businesses and faster growth with lower-margin customers. Lastly, the company's annual customer trade show held in the first quarter typically results in gross profit margins and operating expenses that are about 100 basis points above the run rate for the full year.","Now let's take a closer look at company operating margin expectations. For the full year, on an organic basis, we continue to expect 15 to 45 basis points of expansion. On a reported basis, we are forecasting full year operating margin expansion of 10 to 40 basis points, which is a change from the November guidance of 0 to 30 basis points. This change is tied to the divestiture of the direct-marketing Specialty Brands in December and lower sales from Canada due to larger headwinds from foreign exchange.","For the 2014 first quarter, on a reported basis, we are forecasting that operating margins could decline 50 to 100 basis points from the carryover effect of growth and infrastructure spending and the acquisition of lower-margin businesses which occurred in the second half 2013. This will create an unfavorable comparison during the first half of 2014. Now on an organic basis, operating margins are forecasted to decline as much as 40 basis points in the quarter. Please see Exhibit 4 for a schedule of growth spending in this podcast posted on the Investor Relations section of our website.","In 2014, we anticipate unfavorable operating margin expansion in the first half, followed by stronger operating margin expansion in the second half. Lastly, we are forecasting foreign exchange to represent a $0.15 per share drag for the full year 2014 versus our November guidance.","Please mark your calendar for the release of January sales on Thursday, February 13.","Thank you for your interest in Grainger. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Laura Brown at (847) 535-0409, Casey Darby at (847) 535-0099 or me at (847) 535-0881. Thank you."],"10058":["W.W. Grainger, Inc. (NYSE:GWW) Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call July 17, 2015  7:30 AM ET","Executives","Laura Brown - SVP, Communications and IR","Bill Chapman - Senior Director, IR","Analysts","Laura Brown","Hello. This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's 2015 second quarter results. Please also reference our 2015 second quarter earnings release issued on July 17th, in addition to other information available on our Investor Relations Web site to supplement this podcast.","Before we begin, please remember that certain statements and projections of future results made in the press release and in this podcast constitute forward-looking information. These statements are based on current market conditions, and competitive and regulatory expectations, and involve risk and uncertainty. Please see our Form 10-K for a discussion of factors that relate to forward-looking statements.","Today we reported results for the 2015 second quarter, and updated our sales and earnings per share guidance for the full year. We delivered a solid quarter from an EPS standpoint. And while our gross profit margin was less than we expected, we were able to generate positive cost leverage as an offset. I'd like to share with you what we are seeing in the market. We remain in a soft demand environment. Deflationary commodity prices, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the economy in Canada continue to be headwinds.","Despite all of this, we continue to gain share with customers who value a broad product offering, inventory management services, technical services, and fast, reliable delivery. In addition, we are growing rapidly with small customers through Zoro, and MonotaRO. And we remain focused on productivity to fund our growth and infrastructure investments and reduce the effect of lower gross profit margins.","Last month, we announced that D.G. Macpherson will assume the newly created role of Chief Operating Officer, effective August 1st. We expect this move will ensure tighter coordination between operating functions, business units, and business models. Also last month, we issued $1 billion in new 30-year debt. We are using the proceeds as part of our $3 billion share buyback program announced on April 16th.","Before we begin the review of results, I'd like to remind you that there were adjustments to reported results in the second quarters of both 2015 and '14. In 2015, we took $0.02 per share in charges related to restructuring at Fabory, and the shutdown of the Brazil business. In 2014, we recorded a $0.15 per share charge related to the transition of Fabory's employee retirement plan in Europe.","During the 2015 second quarter, Grainger invested in a limited liability company established to produce clean energy. In addition to supporting the operations of this entity, we receive a pro rata share of energy tax credits. Tax credits earned net of operating losses from this investment lowered the company's effective tax rate in the 2015 second quarter, and contributed approximately $0.09 per share to earnings. For the full year, energy credits are expected to result in a 1.4 percentage point reduction in the company's effective tax rate.","With that as a backdrop, let's look at our results for the 2015 second quarter. Company sales for the quarter increased 1% versus the 2014 second quarter. Excluding foreign exchange and acquisitions, organic sales increased 3%. There were 64 selling days in both quarters. Reported operating earnings increased 5% or 1% adjusted. Reported net earnings increased 7%, and adjusted net earnings were up 3%. Reported earnings per share were $3.25 for the quarter, an increase of 11% versus the 2014 second quarter. Excluding the adjustments from both years, earnings per share were $3.27, up 6% versus the prior year.","We also revised guidance for sales and earnings per share, which Bill will cover in detail at the end of the podcast. Our 2015 guidance issued on April 16, 2015, included 1% to 4% sales growth and earnings per share of $12.25 to $12.95. We now expect 2015 sales growth of zero to 2%, and earnings per share of $12 to $12.50, which includes the benefit of the energy tax credits.","Now let's walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins in the second quarter decreased 50 basis points to 42.6%, versus 43.1% in 2014, due primarily to faster growth with lower gross margin customers, lower supplier rebates tied to volume and price deflation versus cost inflation driven by foreign exchange.","Operating expenses for the company declined 3%, driven by lower payroll and benefits. The company generated $28 million of productivity savings to fund $25 million of incremental growth in infrastructure spending. Total company operating earnings were $357 million, an increase of 5% versus the prior year. The reported operating margin was 14.1%, an increase of 50 basis points versus the prior year. The adjusted operating margin was 14.2%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the prior year.","Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics. First, sales by segment in the quarter in the month of June; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2015 guidance. Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. Despite this, we used the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales.","As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 1%. Daily sales growth by month was as follows: up 1% in April, flat in May, and up 1% in June. Results for the quarter included one percentage point from acquisitions, and a three percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions in foreign exchange, organic sales increased 3%, driven by four percentage points from volume, partially offset by a one percentage point decline in price.","Let's move on to sales by segment. We report two business segments: the United States, and Canada. Our remaining operations are reported under Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 78% of total company revenue in the quarter, increased 2%. Results for the quarter included two percentage points from volume, and one percentage point from inter-company sales, primarily to Zoro, partially offset by a one percentage point decline from price. Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States.","Government, commercial, and light manufacturing were up in the mid single digits. Retail was up in the low single digits. Heavy manufacturing and contractor were down in the low single digits. Reseller was down in the high single digits, and natural resources was down in the low teens. Low oil prices continue to affect our natural resources and heavy manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 1% drag on U.S. sales in the quarter.","Now, let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 9% of total company revenues. For the quarter, sales increased 2% in local currency, and declined 9% in U.S. dollars versus the prior year. The 2% sales increase consisted of eight percentage points from the WFS acquisition and four points from price. This was partially offset by a 10 percentage point decline in volume. Based on our estimates, we believe the vast majority of the volume decline is attributable to direct and indirect exposure to oil and gas.","On an organic basis, declines during the quarter in the commercial, oil and gas, retail, construction, heavy manufacturing, forestry, and transportation customer end markets more than offset growth to customers in the government, mining, utilities, and light manufacturing end markets. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 18%, compared to all other provinces, which were up 3% in aggregate.","Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the other businesses, which represented 13% of total company sales. Sales for the other businesses increased 7%, consisting of 21 percentage points of growth from volume and price, partially offset by a 14 percentage point decline from foreign exchange. The sales increase was primarily due to the growth from the single channel online businesses of Zoro U.S., and MonotaRO, and also the business in Mexico.","Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for April and May, and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at June. There were 22 selling days in June of 2015, versus 21 days in the same month of 2014. Daily sales increased 1% in June versus the prior year. The daily sales increase included one percentage point from acquisitions, and a three percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions in foreign exchange, organic daily sales increased 3%, driven by four percentage points from volume, partially offset by a one percentage point decline from price.","In the United States, June daily sales increased 3%, driven by three percentage points from volume and one percentage point from inter-company sales, primarily to Zoro, partially offset by a one percentage point decline from price. June customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Light manufacturing, government, retail, and commercial were up in the mid single digits. Heavy manufacturing and contractor were down in the low single digits. Reseller was down in the high single digits, and natural resources was down in the low teens. Low oil prices continue to affect our natural resources and heavy manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 1% drag on U.S. sales in the month.","Daily sales in Canada, for June, were up 1% in local currency, and declined 11% in U.S. dollars. The local currency increase was driven by eight percentage points from the WFS acquisition, and four percentage points from price, partially offset by an 11 percentage point decrease in volume. As a reminder, we will anniversary the WFS acquisition on September 2, 2015.","In Canada, on an organic basis declines during the month in the commercial, oil and gas, retail, construction, heavy manufacturing, forestry, light manufacturing, and transportation customer end markets more than offset growth to customers in the government, mining, and utilities end markets. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 17%, compared to all other provinces [ph], which reflect to the prior year in aggregate.","Daily sales for our other businesses increased 6% in June, consisting of 20 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 14 percentage point's decrease from foreign exchange. The daily sales increase was primarily due to strong revenue growth from Zoro U.S., Japan, and Mexico. Sales growth in the month of July is currently trending slightly below the growth rate reported for June.","Now, I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman.","Bill Chapman","Thanks, Laura. Since we've already analyzed company operating performance, let's talk about performance by reportable segment. In the United States, gross profit margins for the quarter declined 70 basis points, primarily driven by faster growth with larger customers, higher sales to Zoro, reflecting the lower transfer price used to account for these inter-segment sales, and price deflation exceeding cost deflation. Excluding Zoro, gross profit margins were down 40 basis points versus the prior year.","Operating expenses were down slightly in the quarter, driven primarily by lower payroll and benefits, which offset incremental growth and infrastructure spending of $23 million. Operating earnings for the U.S. segment increased 1% in the quarter, driven by the 2% sales growth and positive operating expense leverage, partially offset by lower gross profit margins.","We also wanted to provide a midyear update on our growth initiatives in the United States. Year-to-date, we have hired 80 sales representatives with a plan to hire several hundred total by year end. Most of the new sellers will call on our large customers where we see additional opportunity to gain share. In addition, ecommerce represented 40% of sales in the first half of the year, up from 35% in the first half of 2014.","Let's move on to our business in Canada. The gross profit margin in Canada declined 110 basis points versus the prior year, driven by unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States, and inventory markdowns related to the Toronto D.C. move, partially offset by price increases, and higher freight revenue. Excluding WFS, gross profit margins were down 30 basis points. Operating earnings in Canada declined 51% in the 2015 second quarter, driven by the 9% sales decline, lower gross profit margins and negative expense leverage.","Because of the affect of foreign exchange, we wanted to also share Canada's results in local currency. Operating expenses in Canada increased 10% in local currency due to the WFS acquisition, relocation to the new Toronto distribution center and SAP implementation cost. As a reminder, in the second quarter of 2014, we wrote off $4 million of capitalized software development costs. Operating earnings in Canada were down 44% in local currency, representing a 330 basis point decline in operating margin. We have taken measured actions primarily in Alberta to reduce headcounts and freeze open roles.","Operating earnings in the other businesses were $15 million in the 2015 second quarter, which included $2 million of restructuring charges. Operating earnings in the 2014 second quarter were essentially breakeven, which included $14 million for the retirement plan transition in Europe, and $2 million for the write off of capitalized software development costs for Mexico.","Adjusting for these items, earnings increased $2 million versus the prior year. The results included strong performance for Zoro U.S. and Japan, and also included an incremental $3 million in expense for the single channel online business in Europe.","Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net $8 million expense in the 2015 second quarter versus a net $2 million expense in the 2014 second quarter. The increase was driven by higher interest expense associated with the $1 billion in long-term debt issued in early June bearing an interest rate of 4.6%. In addition, the investment in clean energy made during the quarter generated losses that contributed to the increase in other expense.","Accounting guidance requires us to record the tax credit provision based on a full year estimate of the annual rate applied to the year-to-date earnings. Accordingly, the 2015 second quarter includes the benefit of half the annual energy tax credits anticipated for the year. When netted against the losses generated in the quarter, the energy investment generated $6.4 million or $0.09 per share of earnings. On a full year basis, the expected impact is also $0.9 of earnings per share. The full year estimate takes into consideration the forecasted operating loss from the date of investment, associated tax benefits, and the tax credits expected for the year.","The tax rate for the quarter was 35.4% compared to 38.2% in the 2014 second quarter. Excluding the benefits of the energy tax credits for the first quarter of 2015 recorded in the second quarter, the tax rate for the 2015 second quarter was 36.9%. In comparison, the 2014 second quarter reflected a higher tax rate due to the effect of the retirement plan transition in Europe. Excluding the retirement plan transition cost, the tax rate was 37.7% in the 2014 second quarter. The company expects to benefit from the energy tax credits going forward, and is currently projecting an effective tax rate of approximately 36.6% to 37.2% for 2015.","Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $213 million versus $161 million in 2014. On April 16, 2015, the company announced a plan to repurchase $3 billion of stock over the next three years. In June, the company issued $1 billion in new 30-year debt to fund part of the share repurchase program. The net EPS impact of the buyback in the quarter was negative by $0.01 as the borrowing cost exceeded the share repurchase benefit. We continue to expect $0.08-$0.12 per share benefit for the full year.","We bought back 1.3 million shares of stock for $293 million in the second quarter, and ended the quarter with 13.7 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Grainger returned to a total $373 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $80 million in dividends, reflecting the 8% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April 2015.","Capital expenditures were $71 million in the quarter versus $90 million in the second quarter of 2014. While we still anticipate full year capital spending of $375 million to $425 million, we are likely to be at the low end of that range. Spending will be back-half weighted as the investment in the new distribution centre in the Northeast picks up.","As reported in our 2015 second quarter earnings release, we revised our 2015 sales and earnings per share guidance to reflect a softer top-line, lower growth profit margins, and a lower effective tax rate. For the full year 2015, we now expect zero to 2% sales growth, and earnings per share of $12 to $12.50. This guidance assumes incremental growth spending of $150 million, although we are currently assessing our spending plan for the back-half of the year given the tenure of business.","Let's look more closely at our current expectations. We will begin with sales. We now expect sales to be flat to up 2%. This compares to our April guidance of 1% to 4% and reflects a weaker economy and lower than expected sales in oil and gas, and heavy manufacturing in both the United States and Canada. We have also revised our full year price realization estimate to negative 1% versus flat, given the current deflationary environment.","From an organic gross perspective, the midpoint of our sales guidance anticipates second half sales consistent with our second quarter results. The low end of our sales guidance at zero is based on further weakness in the economy, oil and gas, and the further strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and as a reminder, we anniversary the WFS acquisition at the beginning of September.","Moving on to gross profit margins; for the full year we now expect gross profit margins to be down about 60 basis points. For the back-half of 2015, we are expecting gross profit margins to contract about 60 to 80 basis points versus 2014. Gross profit margin compression in the second half is slightly worse than the second quarter as we lap prior year pricing actions.","Let's take a closer look at operating margin expectations. For the full year, we expect our operating margin to be down between 40 and 70 basis points depending on volume. Growth and infrastructure investments will continue with the expectation of fueling market share gains. In the back-half of the year, we intend to drive continue productivity and manage expenses to fund the incremental growth in infrastructure spending. However, margins versus the second half of 2014 are forecasted to decline 90 to 110 basis points, primarily due to the anticipation of back-half weighted gross spending. Please see Exhibit 4 for more information.","The other interest and expense section of the income statement will look dramatically different going forward. Interest expense will increase in the second half of the year due to the new $1 billion debt offering, which carries a 4.6% interest rate. Also the loss from the clean energy investment is expected to be $9 to $11 million per quarter for the third and fourth quarters.","Finally, earnings per share; as noted in our revised guidance, we now expect EPS of $12 to $12.50, reflecting the headwinds from the economy and the expected margin compression from lower gross profit margins, and continued growth in infrastructure spending, partially offset by our productivity programs. As a reminder, similar to April guidance, our new EPS guidance reflects the benefit of the $0.8 to $0.12 of accretion from the $1 billion in incremental share repurchases in 2015, all of which should be realized in the back-half of the year. Finally, our EPS guidance includes the lower tax rate of 36.6% to 37.2% for the full year.","Finally, please mark your calendar for the following important dates: On August 13th, we plan to release July sales. On August 19th, Paul Miller, Vice President of Global eCommerce, Customer Information and Innovation will present at the ITG Industrial Conference in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. And finally, we will host our Annual Analyst Meeting on November 12th, which will be held at our headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois.
