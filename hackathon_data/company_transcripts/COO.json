At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Kim Duncan, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Kim Duncan","Good afternoon. And welcome to The Cooper Companies\u2019 third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. I\u2019m Kim Duncan, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today\u2019s call are Bob Weiss, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Matz, Chief Financial Officer; and Al White, Chief Strategy Officer.","Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including all revenue and earnings per share guidance and other statements regarding anticipated results of operations, market or regulatory conditions, and integration of any acquisitions or their failure to achieve anticipated benefits.","Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and are subject to risks and uncertainties.

These are publicly available and on request from the company\u2019s Investor Relations department.","Now, before I turn the call over to Bob, let me comment on the agenda for the call. Bob will begin by providing highlights on the quarter, followed by Greg who will then discuss the third quarter financial results. We will keep the formal presentation to roughly 30 minutes, and then open up the call for questions. We expect the call to last approximately 1 hour. We request that anyone asking questions, please limit yourself to one question. Should you have any additional questions, please call our investor line at 925-460-3663 or email ir@cooperco.com.","As a reminder, this call is being webcast and a copy of the earnings release is available through the Investor Relations section of The Cooper Companies\u2019 website.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob for his opening remarks.","Robert Weiss","Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the third quarter conference call. Let me start by highlighting three key points. First, we had another strong quarter in CooperVision and gained significant market share. For calendar Q2, we grew 9% against the market at 4%. Our market share gains were across-the-board including single-use and non-single-use lenses and in every geography, the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Our momentum is very strong and we expect it to continue.","Second, the rollout of our daily silicone hydrogel family of products comprising clariti and MyDay continues to do very well. Sales this quarter were $39 million and pro forma was 51%. clariti continues to do well as the mass-market offering, and MyDay is looking good as a premium offering. The only negatives we were seeing are a lack of pipeline fill and general sluggishness in the Americas market, which only grew 1% last calendar quarter, the slowest the Americas has grown in six years.","This is leading us to be more conservative about our fourth quarter estimates. So we\u2019re now forecasting daily silicone sales of $52 million to $57 million in the fourth quarter or $150 million to $155 million for the year. From a timing perspective, July was a good month and August was a good start to Q4.","Third, CooperSurgical posted another tough quarter, down 4% in constant currency. Even with its recent challenges, I still believe strongly that the global women\u2019s healthcare market and its \u2013 in the global healthcare market and its long-term potential. As such, I have decided to increase our focus on women\u2019s healthcare by having Al White assume management of the business in addition to his current corporate responsibilities. With Al\u2019s direct involvement our recent acquisition of Reprogenetics and the launch of several new products I see a much brighter fiscal 2016 for CooperSurgical.","With Al\u2019s change, Dan McBride will remain in his role, running CooperVision, while assuming additional responsibilities including CooperVision\u2019s business development and more involvement in our corporate activities including investor relations.","I believe these changes will strengthen our organization and help us achieve our long-term objectives. I\u2019ll expand on these takeaways as I walk through the quarter\u2019s performance. But I want to confirm, we remain very optimistic about the underlying fundamentals of our business and believe we are well positioned to deliver solid results going forward.","On a consolidated basis, Q3 revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $462 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.97. Regarding earnings, we were hurt by currency both within operations and below the line, but our tax rate came in better than we expected. So overall, the quarter met our expectations.","CooperVision posted revenues of $386 million, up 10% year-over-year with pro forma growth of 7% or 8% excluding solutions. We had a strong quarter in Asia Pacific and EMEA, but the Americas were softer than we would have liked. I agree with some who have said recently that the market is being negatively impacted by channel inventory contraction in UPP or Unilateral Pricing Policy.","This is in spite of our new fit data, which continues to be solid. For CooperVision, we didn\u2019t really see any channel inventory contraction, but we did experience \u2013 we did not experience any expansion either even with this success of our clariti product. Overall, this feels like an anomaly and we should see the market and CooperVision return to better growth, supported by a shift to daily silicone hydrogel lenses in the near future.","Looking at silicones, our silicone hydrogel family of products delivered strong growth this quarter up 15% or 17% pro forma to $215 million. In addition to strong daily growth, our monthly Biofinity family grew 12%, and our Two-Week Avaira family grew 11%, both pro forma. We remain under indexed against the market in both the two-week and monthly silicone space and silicones represent roughly 77% of the market and for us 70%. So we anticipate growing our two-week and monthly silicones nicely for many years.","Regarding one day silicone hydrogel, sales of clariti and MyDay combined were $39 million equating to pro forma growth of slightly over 50% for each, both was driven by our strong product portfolio, which includes the two-tier approach to the daily silicone market with clarity positioned as our mass-market offering and MyDay as our premium offering.","Remember, the contact lens market is being driven by dailies growth and we strongly believe, we have the best product offering in the space, as the only company with premium in mass-market lenses, including a full portfolio of sphere, toric, and multifocal lenses.","Regarding clariti, we\u2019ve made great progress on our manufacturing build-out in our \u2013 in excellent shape to meet demand to the end of fiscal year and into next. From a launch perspective, we\u2019re in good shape in Europe and that business continues to grow nicely. In the United States, we\u2019ve made significant progress distributing fitting sets and we\u2019re now aggressively selling product as opposed to dealing with the administrative task of getting fitting sets out to the doctors.","Regarding MyDay, sales are still ramping in Europe and we\u2019re beginning \u2013 we\u2019ve begun selling lenses in the U.S. with very positive early feedback. Similar to Europe, our U.S. launch is on a branded and private label basis. Regarding capacity, we\u2019re continuing to sell everything we can make and we\u2019re bringing on additional lines to help meet the demand.","As anticipated, MyDay is fitting perfectly into the high end segment of the daily silicone market in Europe and in the U.S. Our specialty business remained strong this quarter with torics up 7% and multifocals up 12%, both on a pro forma basis. We are the global market leader in specialty lenses and we\u2019re taking market share.","Regarding Proclear, sales of this hydrogel product line were down 1% pro forma, driven by softness in our daily \u2013 in our non-daily Proclear product lines. On a regional basis, the Americas were up 4% pro forma, led by Biofinity and clariti. Clariti was still very small in Q3, but we anticipate our U.S. growth will accelerate as we roll out \u2013 as the roll out progresses.","Europe posted a solid quarter of 9% pro forma. I continue to be impressed by that team as they\u2019re posting strong results, while completing the Sauflon integration activity. Meanwhile, Asia Pacific was up 12% pro forma with strong growth in the number of markets. Our Sauflon integration activity \u2013 on Sauflon integration activity, we integrated several Sauflon distribution centers this past quarter, and we are in good shape to finish all integration activity impacting operating expenses shortly.","Regarding manufacturing activity, which includes start-up costs for our new Costa Rica and UK facility and rightsizing of certain manufacturing activity due to Sauflon, we anticipate finalizing remaining decision shortly. From an accounting perspective, we expect to incur certain charges associated with this work throughout fiscal 2016, and we\u2019ll highlight these items as they occur. It\u2019s worth noting there is nothing unexpected, just work that needs to be completed as we incorporate the manufacturing benefits we\u2019re receiving from the Sauflon acquisition.","Additionally, on manufacturing, remember that the clariti lines costs roughly one-third our equivalent lines, they are received in one-half the time, and they have better flexibility around shifting production from one product to another. A large reason for this is the material formulation which provides the ability to produce silicone lenses without alcohol.","We\u2019ll be incorporating these advantages into our manufacturing processes over time, and it will reduce CapEx while also yielding a lower cost per unit. We have also been successful in incorporating CooperVision\u2019s high-volume manufacturing expertise into Sauflon\u2019s manufacturing base. I believe this will result CooperVision\u2019s gross margins strengthening in the back-half of next year as the manufacturing positives work their way through the P&L.","In particular, I believe we\u2019ll see clariti\u2019s gross margin be accretive to the company\u2019s gross margins as we exit 2016.","Now, let me comment on the overall contact lens marketing in the calendar second quarter. Overall, the market was up 4% and CooperVision was up 9%. Asia-Pacific was up 11%, while CooperVision was up 16%. The Americas grew 1% with CooperVision up 8%, and in EMEA the market grew 2% and we grew 8%.","If we look at the market on a modality basis, the single-use market continued to drive growth up 13%, while we grew 16%. Non single-use lenses declined 2%, while we grew 6%. As you can tell, our growth was strong and we continue taking market share in all regions of the world and in all modalities with our strong product portfolio.","In general, when I look at the market, I expect it to grow 4% to 6% going forward. Having said that, the Americas has been a drag. As I mentioned earlier, there have been some commentary about channel inventory and the impact of UPP and I\u2019m not going to disagree with that. In spite of that, CooperVision numbers have been strong. But I\u2019m sure there is some negative impact from the market softness.","Regarding UPP, as many of you are aware, there\u2019s a lot of illegal activity around UPP, so hopefully that gets resolved shortly and we get back to business as usual.","Overall, the market should be fairly stable going forward with dailies continuing to be the growth driver. And needless to say, I believe we\u2019ll continue taking market share for the foreseeable future, led by Biofinity and our strong daily portfolio.","Moving to CooperSurgical, this was a challenging quarter. On the fertility side, we continued making progress by growing disposable products and rationalizing lower margin capital equipment sales. Roughly, two-thirds of that business is outside the U.S., so currency clearly impacted results with fertility down 11%, but up 1% in constant currency. Meanwhile, our office and surgical business was down 6%.","As we discussed on our last earnings call, the slowdown in certain products \u2013 or procedures in patient activity due to noise associated with mesh slings and morcellation is hurting the overall marketplace. We\u2019re not directly involved in these areas, but this is impacting patient visits and surgical activity, thus impacting several of our products.","Based on this, I believe another challenging quarter in Q4, but I do believe this is a temporary matter. When you look at our current product launches, including the EndoSee Hysteroscope we acquired last year, our acquisition of Reprogenetics and now Al\u2019s direct involvement, I\u2019m optimistic 2016 will be a much better year for CooperSurgical.","Now, let me touch on guidance. Our expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter are for consolidated sales of $467 million to $484 million, including $385 million to $400 million for CooperVision, representing a 9% to 13% pro forma growth, and a $82 million to $84 million for CooperSurgical which includes $5 million from our recent acquisition of Reprogenetics. We\u2019re forecasting a strengthening in gross margins to around 64% and this supports non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.07 to $2.17.","Greg will go through the details, but let me say our full-year constant currency non-GAAP guidance is 27% to 29% growth, which is very strong. Given we still \u2013 we\u2019re still working through budgets and there\u2019s significant currency volatility, we won\u2019t be providing detail fiscal 2016 guidance until our October, I\u2019m sorry, our December earnings call. The only direction will give is that we\u2019re targeting non-GAAP earnings per share growth in the low to mid-teens for next year. From a longer-term perspective, we are targeting operating margins over 26% in 2018.","Regarding strategy, we\u2019re continuing our successful strategy, which I frequently articulated in the past. This includes investing in our businesses to take market share by expanding geographically aggressively rolling our products and investing in emerging markets. We do all this while remaining keenly focused on delivering solid earnings per share and cash flow, and we remain focused on delivering strong shareholder returns.","In summary, before I turn it over to Greg, let me say the remainder of the year should be a solid and 2016 should be a really good year for us. Our profit margins are solid. Our cash flow generation is strong, and I remain bullish on future. With that, let me express my appreciation to our employees, our number one asset. Their hard work and dedication to creating value is the backbone of our success.","And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg to cover the financial results.","Greg Matz","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Bob provided an overall summary of our performance, including a review of the market and our revenue picture. So let me start with gross margins.","Looking at gross margins, in Q3 the consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 59.1% and 62.4%, respectively, compared with 64.9% for GAAP and 65% non-GAAP in the prior year. The primary difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is related to product and equipment rationalization due to Sauflon acquisition and facility start-up costs directly attributable to our two new manufacturing facilities located in Costa Rica and the UK. Both of these facilities will be initially dedicated to our expansion of daily silicone manufacturing.","The year-over-year decline in non-GAAP gross margins was driven by a significant negative FX impact to revenues, slightly offset by some favorable FX impact to cost of goods sold and product mix, led by Biofinity.","CooperVision on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis reported gross margins of 57.9% and 61.8%, respectively, versus 64.8% for GAAP and non-GAAP in Q3 of last year. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is largely related to product and equipment rationalization from a Sauflon acquisition and the facility start-up costs mentioned earlier. The year-over-year decline in non-GAAP gross margin was due primarily to FX, partially offset by product mix, led by Biofinity.","CooperSurgical had GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins of 65.2% and 65.4%, respectively, which compares to Q3 2014 of 65.3% and 65.8% GAAP and non-GAAP, respectively. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP relates to approximately a $160,000 of restructuring costs, the year-over-year decline in non-GAAP margin is mainly due to product mix.","Now, looking at operating expenses, SG&A, on a GAAP basis, SG&A expenses increased by 19% from the prior year to $191.8 million, or approximately 42% of revenue, up from 37% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A increased approximately 6% to $165.7 million, or 36% of revenue in line with the prior year. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP was comprised of $17 million legal settlement with J&J and $9.1 million in charges largely related to integration of restructuring costs for the Sauflon acquisition.","Now, looking at R&D. In Q3, R&D on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis was $18.3 million and $16.4 million, respectively. The main difference between GAAP and non-GAAP was related to assets written off related to the Sauflon acquisition. On a non-GAAP basis, R&D was 3.5% of revenue, down from 3.7% in the prior year.","Now, looking at depreciation and amortization. In Q3, depreciation was $41.4 million, up $15.7 million year-over-year, which includes $10.8 million of accelerated depreciation related to the Sauflon acquisition, not included in our non-GAAP numbers. And amortization was $12.5 million, up approximately $5.7 million, primarily due again to Sauflon acquisition.","Moving to operating margins, for Q3 consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $50.3 million and 10.9% of revenue versus $96.6 million and 22.3% revenue in Q3 last year. This drop was primarily due to integration related costs and increased amortization from the Sauflon acquisition, manufacturing facility startup costs, a J&J legal settlement, as well the negative impact of currency.","Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $106.1 million and 23% of revenue versus $108.5 million and 25.1% of revenue for the prior year. The reduction in operating income and margin were driven by the reduction in gross margin, largely from the impact currency and the top line.","In Q3, CooperVision had GAAP operating income and margin of $46.4 million and 12% of revenue versus the prior year Q3 of $88.4 million and 25.3% of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income and margin were $97.7 million and 25.3% of revenue versus $97 million and 27.7% of revenue in the prior year.","CooperSurgical had GAAP operating income and margin of $15 million and 9.7% of revenue versus the prior year of $18.4 million and 22.3% of revenue. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $19.5 million and 25.6% of revenue versus Q3 2014 of $22.4 million in operating income, a 27.1% of revenue. Primary reason for the year-over-year decline in operating income is due to the reduction in revenue.","Now, looking at interest expense, the interest expense was $4.7 million for the quarter, up $3.2 million year-over-year primarily due to the acquisition of Sauflon and a higher interest rates on our bank pricing grid. Included in Q3 2015 in the other expense category is approximately $1.8 million of FX losses. These FX losses for the quarter were associated with our intercompany loans, some of which are in restricted currencies which are difficult and expensive to hedge.","Now, looking at the effective tax rate, in Q3, the GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were negative 1.4%, and a positive 3.1%, respectively versus Q3 2014 GAAP effective tax rate of 6.1% and non-GAAP effective tax rate of 7.3%.","As we\u2019ve mentioned before, the effective tax rate continues to be below the U.S. statutory rate, as the majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. The current quarter reduction in the ETR is largely due to the higher amount of dollar or higher dollar amount of Q3 discrete items related to the prior years, which were reversed in this quarter.","With respect to Sauflon, we\u2019ve made significant progress incorporating them into our global trade arrangement. We anticipate being substantially complete by the end of the fiscal year.","Looking at earnings per share, our Q3 earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was $0.91 and $1.97 respectively versus $1.80 and $2 for GAAP and non-GAAP in the prior year.","Net currency impact on earnings per share year-over-year for Q3 was unfavorable by $0.54. Due to differences in rates and mix from our Q2 earnings call, Q3 was negatively impacted by an additional $0.06, of which $0.03 is on the intercompany balances I mentioned earlier, which is in the other expense line.","One thing to point out is that we always highlight the euro and the yen and pound, which may at times overshadow the FX pressure that comes from many other currencies that influence our results. As an example, when we look at the changes in rates from our June guidance to now, we see negative movements in most of our other currencies like the Aussie dollar down 10% and the ruble down 18%.","Looking at balance sheet and liquidity, in Q3 we had cash provided by operations of $96 million less capital expenditures of $66.4 million, resulting in $29.6 million of free cash flow. Excluding integration costs of $12.9 million and litigation settlement costs of $17 million, adjusted free cash flow was $59.5 million. Total debt decreased within the quarter by $39.8 million to $1.308 billion. Inventories increased approximately $3.5 million to $406 million from last quarter, due to an increase in daily lenses.","For the quarter, we are seeing months on hand at 6.5 months, seven months on hand adjusted for inventory and equipment rationalization charges and facility start-up costs, consistent with seven-month last year and down from 7.6 adjusted months on hand last quarter.","Days sales outstanding is at 55 days, which is down from 56 days in the prior quarter, and up from 53 days last year. We mentioned the J&J legal settlement today, so let me provide a little context.","In July, CooperVision made a one-time lump sum payment to J&J of $17 million to settle their existing patent disputes and agree on a combination of cross-licenses and reciprocal covenants not to sue on current core products, including all silicone hydrogel lenses. This settlement was worldwide in scope with no royalty obligation for either party. Neither party admitted any liability as part of the settlement.","Now, turning to guidance. In order to provide a little more color for your models, I will share some additional specifics on our Q4 and fiscal 2015 non-GAAP guidance. For clariti, I will start with Q4 guidance, and then share what will \u2013 that will look like on a full-year basis.","Regarding foreign exchange, the rates for our main currencies we are using are 1.12 for the euro, 121 for the yen, and 1.54 for the pound. We\u2019re expecting an additional unfavorable $0.02 impact in Q4 to EPS. The negative FX impact to EPS for the year is now forecasted to be $1.76, and the impact to revenue is expected to be $154 million.","For the fourth quarter, the revenue range for the company is $467 million to $484 million, or 10% constant currency growth at the midpoint. CooperVision\u2019s revenue range is $385 million to $400 million, a 11% constant currency growth at the midpoint. CSI\u2019s revenue range is $82 million to $84 million, 4% constant currency growth at the midpoint, which includes $5 million of revenue from Reprogenetics.","We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be around 64% for the quarter. OpEx is expected to be around 39%. Operating margin is expected to be around 25%. Interest expense is expected to be around $5 million. Our Q4 effective tax rate is expected to be between 7% and 8%. Our expected share count will be around 49.2 million shares, and our non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.07 to $2.17, or a growth of 22% to 27% on a constant currency basis.","Looking at the full-year, the revenue range for the company is $1.808 billion to $1.825 billion, or 6% pro forma growth at the midpoint. CooperVision\u2019s revenue range is $1.499 billion to $1.514 billion, 7.5% pro forma growth at the midpoint. CSI\u2019s revenue range is $309 million to $311 million, down 1% in constant currency at the midpoint.","We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be around 63.5% for the year. OpEx is expected to be around 40%. Operating margin is expected to be around 23%. Interest expense is expected to be around $18 million. Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 7.5%. Our share count is expected to be roughly 49.2 million shares for the year, and our non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the range of $7.51 to $7.61, or 27% to 29% constant currency growth.","Finally, we expect both capital expenditures and adjusted free cash flow for the year to be north of $200 million.","With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session.","Kim Duncan","Operator, we\u2019re ready to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Lawrence Keusch","Hello, thanks very much. Bob, I was wondering if you could again help us understand really what changed with the initial outlook for $175 million in single-use silicone hydrogel sales to the new range of $150 million to $155 million.","Robert Weiss","Yes, Larry. I think the biggest change is clearly the U.S. ramp up and the fact that when we look at the growth how we\u2019re doing with clariti and with MyDay this last quarter, that\u2019s up over 50%, so we\u2019re putting up robust numbers. Since so much of the ramp up were right on a more robust U.S. market, the U.S. market is clearly the soft-spot, more so in what\u2019s going out the door from manufacturer to the supply line than it is on on-eye. When we look at the on-eye data, there is a good market, a healthy market.","When we look at the pipeline, in this case, it\u2019s the efficiency of the authorized distributors that is actually flat in a market that is for us growing quite robustly. So that disconnect of the fact that we\u2019re not, and we had anticipated building up a pipeline - as you may recall in the last call, I mentioned that we expected a pretty robust expansion of the pipeline for Cooper given our new product rollouts.","We don\u2019t see that right now and so I will emphasize it\u2019s heavily the U.S. and heavily the pipeline. And quite frankly, we\u2019re happy with the growth of this product portfolio. So it is performing well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Brien of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","JP McKim","Hi, good afternoon, everyone. This is actually JP in for Matt. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to touch on \u2013 you gave a little color on 2016 EPS guidance, and just given kind of that demand profile you gave for Q4 this year, can you talk about what gives you the confidence that maybe the demand in the U.S. will come back to meet those numbers?","Robert Weiss","Yes, we\u2019re anticipating that 2016 will be a more robust U.S. market manufacturer out the door. I think we\u2019re all keenly aware of the numbers that Alcon put up and J&J put up as far as their public reporting. But the delink as I mentioned is not so much, is the market good on-eye, not so much is the market great in terms of the conversion from a two-week modality to a one-day modality. That\u2019s all going very nicely.","There\u2019s only so much more efficiency authorized distributors the middleman can get. There\u2019s no logical reason, given the fact that we had a very shrunken pipeline a year ago for Cooper in October a year ago, it contracted down to a very efficient level. With the new product rollouts you expect that to grow. And so, we are confident that there\u2019ll be to some degree a bounce as we roll out new products, getting product into the distributor to see the demand in the marketplace.","So we\u2019re not at all toning down our expectation for the market pull-through growth. If anything, some of the moves by one of our competitors that are moving into \u2013 from a two-week into a one-day silicone hydrogel modality with another product, will only add to that shift from the two-week modality which doesn\u2019t pay \u2013 it doesn\u2019t pay a lot of money. So, if we think about the market, it\u2019s $2.6 billion at the manufacturers\u2019 level in the U.S. You got, let\u2019s say, $35 million soft contact lens, whereas carving out the hard is not generating a lot of revenue.","And so they are only generating on average $75 a patient. That shift to the one-day modality, as it continues to accelerate is still a 400% to 600% shift, and the two-week wearer is still is the bulk of the wearers in terms of numbers. They don\u2019t generate \u2013 they just don\u2019t generate a real lot of revenue. So we\u2019re enthusiastic that all the manufacturing momentum is pushing the market that way. The underlying dynamics are pushing the market that way and feeling good about it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Mishan of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Matthew Mishan","Thank you very much for taking my questions. Given some of the slowness in the ramp of clariti a little bit, or the slowdown in the ramp of your expectations, do you think that going into next year that SG&A and marketing expenses are going to be maybe a little bit higher than you would have thought with the full MyDay and clariti roll out next year?","Robert Weiss","No, I really don\u2019t expect any real change on that. I really think the \u2013 it\u2019s really the push-pull with the distributors in the middle that will bring about some growth and expansion. But the on-eye activity, we\u2019ve shifted our energy already from getting the fitting sets out there, which consumed a lot of energy in the first-half of this year to now sell-through, meaning, really converting the market into the silicone hydrogel one day modality.","So we don\u2019t need any special emphasis on that point. We have the product availability, because the ramp-up on the manufacturing side has been extremely robust. So we\u2019re good on that front, and it\u2019s now really execution in the field, and we do think the market is prime for them.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Christpher Pasquale","Thanks. Just two questions, I want to try and understand the market issues and the guidance a little there. First, UPP has been out for more than a year and, Bob, you talked about the fact that distributor inventory levels have been trending down for some time, and we\u2019re already at what we saw we\u2019re pretty low levels. So what\u2019s causing the negative inflection there and what gives you confidence that that\u2019s [recover that you had] [ph] visibility to be able to tell it is going to recover?","And then specifically on the daily silicone hydrogel guidance, you\u2019re bringing it down by about 14% for the year, it seems pretty large revision. Can you just talk about what you thought you were going to be seeing in the fourth quarter, you already given this very back-end loaded outlook for the year. What do you think [indiscernible] now that you\u2019 re saying is not and is that a delay into next year, or do you think it doesn\u2019t materialize at all? Thank you.","Greg Matz","Yes. I think I got most of that. You were cutting out. But you\u2019re correct, UPP will anniversary moving into the third calendar quarter. So it\u2019s a year ago now that the robust roll out of UPP occurred for the most part. And most notably, the market share leader going very deep with UPP, all the other manufacturers going with new products only following the concept, your UPP is about promoting new products to the practitioner, where they have to invest a lot of time in the conversion in that.","So on the one front from a market perspective, that step down that occurred with UPP is going to anniversary, and therefore, we\u2019ll have better year-over-year comps as the market goes. Relative to the middleman, the authorized distributors, we know there was consolidation leading to efficiency and we know that the manufacturers were doing a better job coordinating with the authorized distributors in terms of creating efficiency. An example of that would be more direct shipments from the manufacturers to the eye care professionals when it comes to torics which are hard to inventory because of the large number of SKUs.","So the distribution channel is more efficient. I would conjecture, it can\u2019t get much more efficient than it is now. So I think that will have flushed out and that\u2019s been leading to some suppression of the growth from a manufacturer point of view out the door the last two years, ever since the big consolidation took place, if you will. So I\u2019m pretty bullish about that.","Relative to visibility, we always said there would be in that $175 million objective for silicone hydrogel, a good chunk of pipeline fill in the fourth quarter. And we\u2019re just not assuming that is going to occur anywhere close to where we thought. So it wasn\u2019t so much an on-eye demand as it was. If you\u2019re creating a lot of demand in the marketplace you\u2019re going to want to backfill that, so that your authorized distributors are not going on backorder on a product you\u2019re just creating demand on.","I think that is a pretty efficient system now, and part of it really is the efficiency of the torics, because we are the one company that has a multifocal toric and a sphere in the silicone hydrogel modality. So we basically have cut back assumptions on how massive of a pipeline fill you need for that part.","Relative to next year\u2019s outlook, we\u2019re feeling good about the supply chain of products available and the reception of on-eye in the market, and therefore still quite bullish about top line growth into 2016 and beyond.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joanne Wuensch","Hi, good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?","Robert Weiss","Yes, Joanne, I can.","Joanne Wuensch","Terrific. If I heard you correctly, you gave some commentary for EPS next year, but no commentary for revenue. And it seems like most of the questions this evening are related towards revenue. How do we get from the current growth rate towards like higher one over the next couple of quarters? And\u2026","Robert Weiss","So \u2013 oh, I\u2019m sorry, go ahead, Joanne.","Joanne Wuensch","Sorry. And what is a proper rate range would be for next year?","Robert Weiss","Well, we\u2019re not going to \u2013 for a number of reasons, one of which is volatility, currency, we\u2019re not going to get into clariti until we get through our budgeting process which we\u2019re in the middle of and we will shed light on that in December. But we\u2019re not going to at this juncture. Suffice to say, we still believe we will continue to gain market share and you can see the numbers we put up against the marketplace. And we\u2019re feeling good about solid top line. We\u2019re just not ready to give a range of what to expect on the top line next year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Your line is open.","Brian Weinstein","Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Last quarter, you guys took down total revenue guidance, but I think it was $40 million or $44 million or something like that. Part of it was a little of a miss in Q2. But then also you guys had cited issues with the solutions business being down a little bit more than expected and a little bit faster slowdown in some of your legacy products.","I didn\u2019t hear you really mention those types of things on this call. So is kind of the takedown in guidance exclusively related to the U.S. issues that you have been talking about or are we still seeing some of those older legacy products decline faster than expected and what\u2019s going on with the solutions business. Thanks.","Robert Weiss","Yes, the solutions business was surprisingly benign for the quarter, meaning down slightly, but much less than the marketplace. So our guidance \u2013 our further guidance down has nothing to do with legacy and solutions. It really is going from the $175 million down to that $152 to $157 million range.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Larry Biegelsen","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Bob, we\u2019ve gotten very, very positive feedback on MyDay, but we\u2019ve gotten mixed feedback on clariti\u2019s comfort. Is that something that could be improved?","And then, on the manufacturing changes in 2016, maybe it wasn\u2019t clear to me, but will those costs be taken out of non-GAAP earnings, and if not how should we think about gross margins in 2016? Thanks.","Robert Weiss","On the positive feedback on MyDay and the clariti, mixed clariti feedback question, MyDay is very early in the game in the U.S. and certainly it performed well as a premium product outside the U.S. It is clearly in a league that is targeting TruEye and Total 1, and that is a different league, it\u2019s great \u2013 it\u2019s a great product. And I would say a lot of the people probably going into MyDay are getting there from TruEye. And, therefore, it\u2019s silicone hydrogel to silicone hydrogel.","The history of conversion to silicone hydrogel lenses has not been a rocket ship. It\u2019s been kind of stair step. Some of you may recall when OASYS and Acuvue Advance came out in the \u2013 about 2007, 2008 timeframe, there was an attempt to totally shift the patient from the Acuvue to lens to a silicone hydrogel and a lot of patients reacted negatively.","They basically said, I can still feel the rigidity of a silicone hydrogel lens, put me back in my hydrogel lenses. And that\u2019s actually one of the reasons even today in the FRP and the plant replacement modality, it is only 77% silicone hydrogel, which translates probably a more like 70% wearers and 30% of the \u2013 because there\u2019s a premium that you pay for that.","So toning and affecting for that premium, about 30% of the people are still staying in their hydrogel lenses, because they\u2019re not as rigid. The same thing is going on with clariti to some degree, where we\u2019re going after moist. Moist is not a silicone hydrogel, and therefore you\u2019re going to have some patients that are going to go from moist to clarity, or any other silicone hydrogel and say, I can feel it, it\u2019s more rigid than what I\u2019m used to. And some people are not going to give it the chance and some people will adapt to it. But it\u2019s what \u2013 every eye is different. Every patient is going to be a different battle on that conversion front, if you will.","On the manufacturing startup costs, the intent is, there are a number of moving parts in manufacturing going on right now and into next year. We have two new plant startups that will be ramping up in Costa Rica and in Speedwell in the UK. There will be some call out of those startup costs that will be specifically called out as part of restructuring of manufacturing activity.","On the negative front relative to what\u2019s in the ongoing reported cost of goods, when we transition from a one plant only model, let\u2019s say, in Hungary to, or in Budapest to a new startup in Costa Rica. Even though labor costs will be lower in Costa Rica and certainly much lower than our other plants in Puerto Rico and UK and Rochester. So, ultimately, there will be a huge advantage. Short-term, it\u2019s negative, because you are ramping up without having the full critical mass, and there will be some drag on cost of goods and gross margins in 2015, 2017, and probably all the way into 2018 until you have a robust plant in Costa Rica.","Speedwell in the UK is less problematic, because that\u2019s kind of a one product, smaller model, if you will that comes into play. But some of them will be called out that the new plant startup, some of them will not, it will be in the cost of goods a blended gross margin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Steve Willoughby","Thanks for taking my question, guys. I kind of have a three-part question and then a separate question. So I will just ask them all at once, if you don\u2019t mind. The three that are kind of related, Bob, you talked about the inventory reductions in the channel and things, and I think this might be like the fourth year in a row we talked about inventory is coming down, and I think even at one point you talked about how they couldn\u2019t contractually go any lower. So, I guess, the first part of it is, have inventories gone and the channel gone even lower.","And then the second part of that is, you talked about distributors and retailers not really taking on inventory here in the third quarter, I would say you\u2019re guiding down a bit for the fourth quarter, so you \u2013 are you not expecting distributors and retailers to take on inventory, and if that\u2019s the case, why are you now not expecting them to take on inventory. And then, my separate question is just, what are your thoughts on the new daily product from J&J coming into the market here soon? Thank you.","Robert Weiss","All right, the first one on the inventory reductions, you are quite right that that we talked about for the third year in a row, in October last year, inventory reduction with the authorized distributor relative to Cooper.","The inventory reductions we\u2019re talking about now is \u2013 there have been some of our competitors that have talked about their pipeline inventory reductions. With Cooper we\u2019re not saying they reduced inventory. It\u2019s already at a very efficient level. We\u2019re saying, we were guiding to an expansion of the inventory held by authorized distributors for new product rollouts like clariti and like MyDay, and that is just not happening.","And we\u2019re \u2013 given the efficiency of the authorized distributors, we are not expecting it to happen anywhere to the same degree that we once anticipated. Part of that is the efficiency as I pointed out of getting toric lenses to the patients where \u2013 or to the eye care professional, where much of it is going around the authorized distributor. They like carrying spheres. It\u2019s very easy, limited SKUs, multifocal limited SKUs. Toric is a pain in the neck.","So we have come up and workaround to make the system as efficient as it possibly could be. On the authorized distributors, retailers in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re basically saying we\u2019ve toned down the pipeline feel for the new product rollouts, and part of it for efficiency and part of it is just how tight authorized distributors are managing it.","As far as the new J&J product that is coming out in the one-day modality, which is OASYS, it\u2019s one-day. If I were J&J, I would do exactly the same thing. They\u2019re basically trying to trade out TruEye or this is conjecture, because I\u2019m not sure they formally announced, but the conjecture out there is just going to come out, go into the premium modality with a sphere and basically trade out the TruEye product which has not done well in the U.S. market with several missteps.","If I were them, I would do that. The negative of it is it\u2019s clearly that it could accelerate two things. One is people leaving the non-silicone hydrogel bucket and then going in play. But more importantly people transitioning from the two-week modality owned pretty much by J&J. They have well north of 70% or almost 80% share of that two-week wearer base and they\u2019ll be putting those in play and we\u2019ll take our chances on that. So I love that.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jon Block of Stifel. Your line is open.","Jonathan Block","Great. Thanks. And I will see if I can also just try to maybe ask a question and a half. The first one, Bob, if you try to isolate the on-eye data in the U.S., again on-eye, what do you think the trend line of your market share gains are there? I guess, I\u2019m just trying to tease out, do you think J&J\u2019s aggressive pursuit of UPP, and B&L are gaining back of some of the share in the U.S. again on-eye?","And then, second question, just shifting gears, can you just talk to the additional manufacturing capacity that you expect to come online for MyDay in fiscal 2016 relative to 2015? And is MyDay still teed up for Japan approval next year? Thanks, guys.","Robert Weiss","All right, I think I got that all. The on-eye data for Cooper is \u2013 we have to look at it in two pieces. The independents, where there is kind of a battleground that J&J has basically invited themselves into very vocally with their UPP policy. And then, the all other, the retailer half, the retailers \u2013there is a very clear divide. Retailers do not like UPP and independents love UPP. It\u2019s as black and white as a Republican and a Democrat, I guess. Maybe, that is a poor example, because maybe it is not black and white.","But they\u2019re on one line or the other clearly in the way they view the world. So it\u2019s hard to walk the tightrope. Cooper, our loyalty is pretty black and white also. We\u2019re loyal to the eye care professional who writes prescriptions, and we\u2019re not at all loyal to those that do not write prescriptions. That\u2019s where we draw the line. And we think there are better ways than UPP to show your loyalty to the eye care professionals be it independent, or be it working in a retail setting.","And when it comes to where is J&J doing well, they are doing better with independents, no doubt. One would say they\u2019re probably doing horrendous in some areas with the certain retailers. And so the overall numbers don\u2019t look very good, and we\u2019ll see what happens, as they annualize the UPP decision that they made on their full product line a year ago.","Relative to the ramp up of MyDay, it\u2019s going to be pretty robust on two fronts, both our continued expansion in Puerto Rico and our new facility called Speedwell in the UK, which is dedicated to MyDay. So throughout 2016, really much more the back-half, we will be coming online with a pretty robust amount of ramp up. Will we catch up with demand in 2016, probably not. The third piece you asked about is Japan and so far so good in terms of our expectation for MyDay into Japan in by the end of 2016.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good evening, guys. Just a couple of questions here. Let me just ask them all and we\u2019ll go from there. So, Bob, I know you\u2019ve not given guidance for next year on the top line, but with the OASYS daily coming out with the market a little punky here, Bob, it should maybe a get a little bit healthier under value, and although that\u2019s I guess a question that is fully answered. Where do you think the CVI versus the market \u2013 CooperVision versus the market could go over the next 12 or 18 months? That\u2019s question number one.","And then, Greg, two clarifying questions. You mentioned in the gross margin for CVI FX and mix, the offsetting impact of those two. But what was the impact of kind of the timing when you closed down those December facilities. If memory serves that usually weighs down gross margin this quarter a bit as well? And did I hear you correctly the gross margin on clariti exiting 2016 could be accretive to CVI at a companywide whichever you said, that would imply north of 63%, I think, when you acquire that line, it was in the low to mid 50s, I just want to make sure I heard that correctly? Thank you.","Robert Weiss","Okay. Well, I\u2019ll do these and then Greg can fill out what I don\u2019t cover in the gross profit. In terms of top line and how we feel about it relative to the new products coming out be it the OASYS daily or the various other products being talked about in the activity of B&L and others. We\u2019re feeling a lot of that we liked to move. We like the emphasis of stirring up the pot in the two-week modality and seeing where they end up. Some will go to monthly, and many will go to one day. So the shift to one day looks as exciting as ever and we like our product portfolio as much as ever.","So we kind of love the direction of that, I would expect a more robust market in the U.S. in 2016 and 2015, 2015 I would describe as pretty anemic for the two reasons we talked about the authorized distributors and the UPP, in fact. But that does annualize and who knows how long UPP will be around to throw stones at, I guess.","As far as the gross margins, you did hear me correct about clariti that clariti will be a contributor to our gross margin story, meaning, a net plus to the midpoint and the back-half of next year, so all has done very well with the ramp up. I did hedge a little by saying, as we ramp up Costa Rica that puts a short-term drag in the fact that you don\u2019t have critical mass in that ramp-up mode for couple of years. But the rest of the mass production is doing so well. We\u2019re pretty bullish on the composite part.","Relative to the timing and implications of the shutdown, you\u2019re right, it was a shutdown that we do as a \u2013 for plant maintenance, is the end of December early January. So that has a ripple effect. Although we flatten it a little it still kind of ripples into the third quarter historically. And foreign exchange impact on our gross margin is a whopping number. It\u2019s like 200 basis points.","So were it not for foreign exchange we would be doing cartwheels on our gross margin story and that will be accolades to our production guys on just how well they have improved cost and efficiency in spite of a shift in the one-day mix. So they\u2019re hurtling, basically hurtling that which is a pretty extraordinary story, all lost in the world of foreign-exchange unfortunately. Greg, anything you want to add to it?","Greg Matz","No, I think, Bob, you covered it. I think the mix aspect of the manufacturing variance as I had kind of combined in that mix. And so what you saw is \u2013 definitely the strong part of it was FX, as Bob mentioned. You got a little bit of offset because the cost of goods sold, FX was positive. And then, you had the manufacturing variances in Biofinity leading from a product mix standpoint, helping to offset that FX. FX was huge for the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Lichtman of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Steven Lichtman","Thank you. Hi, guys. I just want to add on the CSI side, the slightly slower growth you saw in office and surgical this quarter versus last, do you sense it\u2019s more of the negativity around the broader market, maybe getting worse or is it more company specific? And if it\u2019s the latter, what are some of the general changes you\u2019d like to see looking ahead?","Robert Weiss","Well, clearly, I\u2019m a firm believer that we\u2019re actually doing well with the broader market. The broader market is bumping right now and it\u2019s so surrounded by a lot of litigation dealing with all those issues in mesh and slings and morcellators. And you can\u2019t pick up a paper today without seeing some legal advertisement in that arena. So it\u2019s slowed up the market. You have a lot of gun-shy gynecologists out there. And that ripples into some of our products that are used tangentially with some of those procedures.","So I think our product portfolio is good for the mainstay of things like doing hysterectomies and minimal invasive surgery in general. We have a concerted effort of refreshing the product portfolio, which is for the most part very mature. And so, products like Endosee, that handheld hysteroscope, and now Reprogenetics not much on the part you\u2019re on. This is more on the IVS\u2019 part, but we are making a concerted effort within all CooperSurgical to add some muscle to it in terms of organic growth potential.","And Al\u2019s role clearly is going to be a catalyst in that area where our intention is. We\u2019ve been a little slow at M&A activity, perhaps on average over the last two, three years, is to kind of move that process along. And we think there are opportunities out there that we\u2019re at least going to kick the tires pretty heavily on.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Bob Weiss for closing remarks.","Robert Weiss","Well, I want to thank you for joining us on this call. And we\u2019re, as you can tell, excited about the rollout of our products and opportunities \u2013 and very excited about the outlook for 2016. Perhaps, I didn\u2019t say clear enough, but targeting growth mid-teens \u2013 low-teens to mid-teens next year, coming off of a 27% to 29% growth is pretty stellar.","We are proud about that and we\u2019re really down about the fact that it still got massed by foreign exchange, but we also know we\u2019re not the only company on the planet that\u2019s being hammered by that or not the only company in the United States being hammered by that. I know there are some companies in Europe probably looking stellar over the same thing.","But anyway, we look forward to updating to you on the story as we get into our year-end numbers in December. And I think our next session will be on December 3. So we look forward to updating you at that time. You okay? Thank you for participation.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may all disconnect.

During today\u2019s call, we will discuss the results included in the earnings release along with the updated guidance and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Our presenters on today\u2019s call are Al White, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Andrews, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements, including all revenues and earnings per share guidance and other statements regarding anticipated results of operations, market or regulatory conditions, and integration of any acquisitions or their failure to achieve anticipated benefits.

Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2018 earnings conference call. We made a lot of progress this quarter, and I\u2019m happy to say our strategic investments are paying off through accelerated revenue growth and strong momentum.","As we continue driving success by capitalizing on current market conditions and our strong product portfolio, we have accelerated investment activity around several initiatives, including advertising and promotions associated with key accounts at CooperVision and PARAGARD and CooperSurgical. We\u2019re confident this investment strategy will result in continued strong revenue growth.","Regarding our third quarter consolidated financial results, we reported revenue of $660 million, up 19% year-over-year, which is an all-time high for the company. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3, up 14% year-over-year. Overall strength in revenues, gross margins and a lower tax rate were offset by planned spending and incremental currency headwinds, including FX being $0.10 worse than we had forecast for the quarter.","Looking at our two businesses, CooperVision posted record quarterly revenue of $489 million, up 12% or up 9% pro forma. We saw a noticeable uptick in our daily silicone hydrogel lenses with pro forma growth of 43%, driven by MyDay and clariti posting solid growth worldwide. CooperSurgical posted record revenues of $171 million, up 44% or up 6% pro forma, led by stronger than expected growth of 9% from PARAGARD.","Moving to the detail. CooperVision posted solid revenue growth in all three regions with the Americas up 8%, EMEA up 6%, and Asia-Pac up 4%, all pro forma 14%. The Americas strength was driven by a very strong quarter for clariti and MyDay. In particular, the launch of MyDay Toric is going extremely well and we\u2019re seeing a halo effect on the sphere, where MyDay sphere posted really strong results.","EMEA posted solid results against a very challenging comp with growth in the region driven by our full suite of silicone hydrogel products, including our dailies and our Biofinity and Avaira suite of products. Success was especially evident within our key accounts, where we have been heavily focused and gaining traction.","Asia-Pac continued posting very strong results, driven by our silicone hydrogel dailies and Biofinity. This is a fantastic growth region for us and our investment strategies around key accounts, sales force expansion and geographic expansion continue yielding a lot of success.","So overall, Q3 was a very strong quarter for a number of reasons and we expect the strength to continue based on our momentum. On products, Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 7% pro forma.","Regarding Biofinity, we were slightly capacity constrained again this quarter, but have already added capacity and will be adding even more in the coming months. This capacity expansion will help the entire Biofinity franchise, but especially Biofinity Energys, where demand has exceeded supply, as this new product has been more successful than expected.","Regarding Avaira, total sales declined slightly, but the Vitality upgrade is now finished outside of a few small markets, where we\u2019re awaiting final regulatory approval. A nice takeaway is that, we had growth outside the Americas, where we\u2019ve generally been able to focus on selling rather than transitioning the product, and that\u2019s a good sign for future results.","Turning to product categories, we remain a global leader in Torics and Multifocals and grew 9% and 10%, respectively pro forma. Growth was driven by our silicone hydrogel lenses, including MyDay Toric, which is being received extremely well in numerous markets; and clariti multifocal, which posted strong growth.","Turning to the broader $8.3 billion soft contact lens market, we\u2019re continuing to see strong growth led by the shift to daily silicone hydrogel lenses, broader product offerings and geographic expansion. Daily lens has continued to drive the majority of the growth now accounting for roughly $4.3 billion, or 51% of the overall market. And within dailies, it\u2019s no surprise that silicone hydrogel lenses are driving the majority of that growth.","With respect to new fit data, CooperVision saw significant strength with new fits solidly outpacing our market share and this was especially true for silicone hydrogel dailies. This strong new fit data is a great sign for continued robust growth and is a nice segue in a topic I want to spend a couple minutes on and that\u2019s key accounts.","Key accounts is a general term we use, which includes global retailers, regional chains and certain buying groups. This is a topic many of you have heard me discuss recently, as these accounts are growing faster than the overall market, and we expect that to continue as a sustainable long-term growth trend.","As such, we have been proactively investing in this area and our performance has been exceeding expectations, which is reflected in our revenue growth and strong New Fit Data. We further accelerated investments in this area in the third quarter, expanding our key account management sales and support teams, while increasing related promotional and advertising activity.","This is in conjunction with our heightened investment activity enhancing our distribution and packaging capabilities to improve our ability to provide customized product offerings. All this activity is focused on supporting our partners and shifting new wearers to CooperVision faster than in the past, as we look to capitalize on our robust portfolio silicone hydrogel product and current market conditions.","A key part of this strategy is remembering, we operate in an annuity business. And while the upfront cost to win new patients will tail up, the revenue from these patients will continue for many years as new wearers stay with their lenses on average seven years.","It\u2019s also important to add that the independent practitioner remains an important part of our business, and we will continue fully supporting this channel, including through our unique digital marketing and support platforms such as Eye Care Prime. Given all this, we are more confident in our future revenue growth and are raising CooperVision\u2019s Q4 pro forma revenue growth guidance to 8% to 10%.","Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported quarterly revenue of $171 million, up 44% or 6% pro forma. This was driven by our office and surgical products, which grew 8% pro forma, led by PARAGARD up a healthy 9%.","Regarding PARAGARD, based on the momentum we\u2019ve been seeing, we have increased promotional and advertising support and recently added a number of additional sales reps. We remain confident this product offers a high-margin multi-year growth opportunity and are investing accordingly.","Outside of PARAGARD, but still within office and surgical products, we had a very strong quarter with strength in several focused products, including our Endosee Hysteroscope and our next-generation uterine manipulator, adding to some unexpectedly strong buy-in activity at some of our older products.","Meanwhile, fertility grew 4% pro forma, led by fertility solutions, which includes products such as media and medical devices growing double digits. This growth was offset by softness in our genomics business, where significant time was spent completing the transition away from carrier screening and NIPT.","This process wasn\u2019t easy, but we moved quickly and are now returning our full focus to the IVF clinics, which is exactly where we want to be. We\u2019re a global leader in fertility and our engagement with fertility clinics around the world is very strong. We offer market-leading product throughout our portfolio, including media, micropipets, embryo transfer catheters and certain genetic tests. And this product portfolio has been growing nicely, which we expect to continue.","In conclusion, I want to highlight that I\u2019m really excited about our market positions for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical. To summarize a few key points, CooperVision posted a very strong quarter with 9% pro forma growth, led by strength throughout the world, including a nice uptick in the Americas and very strong growth from our daily silicone hydrogel franchise.","CooperSurgical posted pro forma growth of 6% with strength seen in several areas, including PARAGARD growing 9%. Given our strong product portfolios in both businesses, combined with current market dynamics, we\u2019re excited about the future and look forward to maintaining our strong momentum.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Andrews","Thank you, Al, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today\u2019s earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.","As Al mentioned, revenues were strong this quarter and gross margins also showed nice improvement, increasing to 67.4% from 64.8% last year. CooperVision\u2019s gross margin was 65.9%, up from 65.5% last year. Improvement was seen from positive manufacturing efficiencies due to the higher volume moving through our plants and favorable product mix of Biofinity and the shift to Avaira Vitality being key drivers. This is partially offset by the negative impact of currency and a modest increase in rebate activity.","CooperSurgical\u2019s gross margin improved significantly to 71.7%, up from 62.4%, driven by the addition of PARAGARD. Regarding expenses, consolidated operating expenses grew 20.8%, driven by advertising and promotion activity supporting key accounts and PARAGARD, and a 27% increase in R&D related to new product development work, including activity around myopia management.","Operating income grew an impressive 27.5%, with operating margins improving to 27.8%, up from 25.9% last year. Below operating income, we reported $22.8 million of interest expense and an FX loss of $2.7 million from negative currency moves against our intercompany loans.","Our effective tax rate was 6.2%, which was lower than expected, primarily due to the realization of investment credits associated with offshore manufacturing expansion and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.","Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $3, with roughly 49.7 million average shares outstanding. Within this, FX was $0.10 worse than we had forecasted. We had posted 100 \u2013 we posted $183 million of free cash flow for the quarter comprised of $235 million of operating cash flow, offset by $52 million of CapEx.","Free cash flow is very strong, helped by improved working capital management, including executing on an advantageous receivables program. With this strong cash flow, we reduced total debt to $2.294 billion and net debt declined to $2.146 billion.","Our bank-defined leverage or net debt to adjusted EBITDA decreased to 2.45 times, which moved us a tier lower in the pricing grid, thus reducing our borrowing rate by 25 basis points.","Regarding guidance. For fiscal Q4, we expect total company revenues in the range of $634 million to $649 million, including CooperVision revenues of $468 million to $477 million, up 8% to 10% pro forma; and CooperSurgical\u2019s revenue of $166 million to $172 million, up 3% to 6% pro forma.","Non-GAAP EPS guidance is $2.90 to $3, assuming a roughly 8% effective tax rate. Within this, our FX assumptions from the time we provided guidance last quarter reduced revenue by roughly $10 million and reduced non-GAAP EPS by $0.13.","On a full-year basis, this translates to consolidated revenue guidance of $2.15 \u2013 $2.515 billion to $2.53 billion, with CooperVision at $1.869 billion to $1.878 billion and CooperSurgical at $646 million to $652 million. Full-year non-GAAP EPS guidance is $11.55 to $11.65, and free cash flow is still expected to be around $423 million for the year.","Regarding fiscal 2019 guidance, we\u2019re not going to get into details at this time other than to say that we\u2019re focused on driving strong revenue growth and low double-digit constant currency operating income growth. As is our practice, we\u2019ll provide full guidance on our December earnings call.","And with that, I\u2019ll hand it back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me, okay?","Albert White","Hi, Jeff. Yes.","Jeff Johnson","All right, great. So, Al, I just want to dig into the key account commentary a little bit. I guess a couple of questions on that. One, breadth versus depth of those accounts, these investments in that, have you won any new key accounts any that you can talk about versus how much are you going deeper maybe capturing more business there?","And then how much of the new distribution center capabilities, I think, in Rochester some of the new robotics and labeling stuff that you\u2019ve been working on hasn\u2019t yet come on, or maybe it does here in the near-term? But how much does that maybe set you up in the near to \u2013 or longer-term, I\u2019m sorry, to kind of win additional in that business, or take even bigger share in those retail accounts and other key accounts?","Albert White","Yes, Jeff, good questions. On the first point on key accounts, this is \u2013 we\u2019re talking about new business here. So one of the things that\u2019s interesting is, as we\u2019ve done more work with what we\u2019re calling key accounts in some of the large retailers and other operations around the world, we\u2019ve been winning new business there.","So when we go in and win business with a new account, that is frequently a multi-year contract. And some of those contracts are very large, and we\u2019re in the early stages of those contracts. So when you win that kind of business and you get the opportunity, you have the chance to go in there and be aggressive and work with the partner in terms of increasing your advertising, your promotional activity with that partner to drive new wearers to your products faster. That\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about doing.","So we\u2019re kind of in a unique opportunity here, where we\u2019re winning some business, we won business, we actually have some business opportunities that we\u2019re working on that we\u2019re pretty excited about. So we\u2019re talking about executing upon contracts. And that\u2019s different than what we discussed in the past.","We talked about adding sales force and putting more feet on the street. We\u2019ve done that. Well, that\u2019s proven to be successful. Some of that success has resulted in some new multi-year contracts, and now we need to execute on that. So pretty excited about that and it kind of props up our future revenue growth.","If you look at the DCs, we have been doing a lot of work on that. You\u2019re exactly right to really upgrade our distribution centers and our capabilities around labeling and packaging and shipping smaller units and so forth. A lot of that activity is in process right now. We\u2019ll start that at the very beginning of this next fiscal year and kind of slowly roll that out through our distribution centers. So we don\u2019t have shipping problems and so forth, and you\u2019ll see that in the coming years.","Now, one of the things that you naturally get any time you\u2019re doing the kind of work we\u2019re doing in DCs, which includes opening brand-new distribution centers, expanding distribution centers and upgrading distribution centers, is you build those out for future growth. So you naturally end up with inefficiencies there, because you have excess space or excess capabilities and so forth and you grow into those over time.","So I think, we\u2019re probably at that stage from a distribution perspective, where we\u2019re on the front side of that and we\u2019re dealing with the burden of higher costs and so forth. But as you said or kind of alluded to, right, it positions us really, really well to be able to win these contracts and continue to be able to offer things, the key accounts that, that they require in order to to win bigger pieces of their business.","Jeff Johnson","Yes. And I guess, my follow-up on that would just be, so if I look at your FX guidance, it looks like the cut you made the full-year kind of fits perfectly with the $0.10 and the $0.13 that you\u2019re talking about as headwinds this quarter next. But that would also mean none of the revenue upside, or at least the pro forma organic growth upside is not flowing through the EPS and that\u2019s \u2013 I would assume that\u2019s just again, because you\u2019re reinvesting that, it\u2019s the DC investments, it\u2019s the promotional investments in the new key accounts things like that. Is that the way to think about it that you \u2013 that just doesn\u2019t flow through because of those investments?","Albert White","Yes. You\u2019re absolutely spot on. So FX kind of brought us back. We incorporated that. Our tax rate came in a little bit lower this quarter and little bit. It looks like it could be a little bit lighter. But we are increasing our investments. Most of that stuff, the vast majority of those incremental investments are associated with winning wearers faster from contracts that we already have.","I think, that\u2019s a key point. This isn\u2019t about putting feet on the street, hoping to win businesses, this is executing on business that we want. And we\u2019re in a great position from a competitive standpoint of having products available, premier products available in the marketplace. We have the most robust silicone product portfolio in the market right now and now is the time to be proactive and aggressive and capitalize on that.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Larry Biegelsen","Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Hey, Al, can you just clarify one thing in Jeff\u2019s question. Could you \u2013 is FX $0.23 worse since last time, or is it $0.13 worse since last time?","Albert White","Yes, it\u2019s $0.10 worse in Q3 and $0.13 worse in Q4, so $0.23 in the back-half of the year, but at $0.10 and at $0.13 by quarter.","Larry Biegelsen","Perfect. Then for my questions, I wanted to focus on 2019 now. When you look at the full-year 2018 guidance for Cooper overall, it\u2019s about 6%. It looks like pro forma CVI about 8%, but the second-half is much stronger than the first-half of the year. So how should we think about the momentum into fiscal 2019? Should we be looking kind of at full-year 2018 guidance as the jumping-off point for the second-half of 2018 as the jumping-off point? I did have one follow-up.","Albert White","Well, I\u2019ll tell you. I look at it a little bit more as the second-half of this year. We have good momentum in both businesses right now. We\u2019re investing accordingly to take advantage of that. I would anticipate, you see that return, so to speak, starting to show up in revenues in the \u2013 in fiscal 2019.","Larry Biegelsen","That\u2019s helpful. And then, sticking with that fiscal 2019, just turning to EPS, I heard the commentary there. But could you maybe quantify some of the headwinds, tax, how do you see that sequentially at this point, interest and FX? So could you just help us just refine some of the comments you made or Brian made in his prepared remarks versus how to think about earnings in 2019? Thanks for taking the questions.","Albert White","Yes. I think that if you look at headwinds kind of and Brian was referring to operating income growth, we obviously have taxes. We\u2019re probably looking right now, I would say, at around an effective tax rate of, let\u2019s say, 14% something like that with respect to next year. And I will fine tune that number as more tax information comes in and we do our work and so forth.","So we can give you a better number in December. But right now I think, that\u2019s probably a fair number to plug in there. We\u2019re doing a great job on cash flow generation. We\u2019ll be generating cash. We\u2019ll be focused from a capital perspective and kind of paying down debt, maybe looking at a couple of small tuck-in acquisitions if we can find them and some stock buybacks.","But I think, we\u2019ll get in a situation, where debt reduction will help offset any future interest rate increases. We\u2019ll see how that plays out. Again, we\u2019ll have more color on that by the time we hit December. And then FX, and FX is always a little bit of the wild card.","So when I look at it though, one of the points, I think, that\u2019s an important takeaway is, we are doing incremental investments here in order to drive our revenue growth. But as a company, we\u2019re still going to put up strong OI growth. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re going and saying, hey guys, double-digit or low double-digit OI growth on a constant currency basis is something you can still expect from us even with these enhanced investments.","So next year by nature it\u2019s a little bit more of a challenging year for us, if nothing else just because of having to hurdle the big jump in the effective tax rate.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions.","Albert White","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Lawrence Keusch","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So, Al, I just want to stay on the topic of the spending. And look, I think, clearly, the top line reflects a lot of the efforts here. And I think, you\u2019ve been, in fairness, suggesting that you were looking to invest more. But I just want to be ultra clear as we think about this going forward. Do you anticipate that you will be in investment spending mode here for the next several quarters? I don\u2019t know, if you want to sort of think of it as you move into 2019?","And I guess, the other part of that question is, there\u2019s a lot of proactive nature to this and focusing on the accounts. But I\u2019m also wondering if you\u2019re seeing anything out there in the marketplace that also suggest you that you need to spend more to keep that top line engine going?","Albert White","Yes, Larry, I would say, probably a key point here is, no. We\u2019re not seeing something out in the marketplace, it\u2019s saying, \u201cOh, we have to go spend a bunch more money in order to drive our growth or to keep it at certain decent number.\u201d We\u2019re looking at it saying, \u201cFrom a market position, where we\u2019re today with our products and with our offerings and our capabilities, we believe we\u2019re in a position right now where we can execute and take a lot of share.\u201d","And what I\u2019m talking about is new wearers, new fits, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re seeing that in a New Fit Data, which continues to be very strong for us and our New Fit Databeing solidly ahead of our market share.","So when I look at something like that and I say, okay, New Fit Data coming in strong. We\u2019re winning business from key accounts. We need to execute on that and take advantage of it and convert wearers. You convert a new wearer and you spend a couple of extra dollars to get that new wearer and obviously, and you\u2019re promoting, you\u2019re working with your partner, you\u2019re making that happen. You have that wearer for a long period of time, as I mentioned, seven years on average.","So you\u2019re getting a fantastic return on that. So right now, it\u2019s a matter of saying, \u201cHey, we can drive higher growth.\u201d I mean, you haven\u2019t seen CooperVision posting numbers like 9% pro forma growth in the long time. That\u2019s a really solid number. Our guidance for this quarter 8% to 10% pro forma growth, it\u2019s a really solid guide.","So I look at this as, hey, we\u2019re investing and so forth, but we\u2019ve proven that it can be a successful. We just put up a good number in Q3. We\u2019re guiding to a good number, and we feel confident we\u2019re going to be able to put up good numbers.","Now when you look at the future, we\u2019re working on another opportunities out there. I mean, frankly, I hope we win those opportunities and we continue to capitalize on them. So you never know with the market. You have competitors, they come out with new products and they do different things. But when you have opportunities, you take advantage of the opportunities. And to me, that\u2019s exactly where we\u2019re at right now.","Lawrence Keusch","Okay, perfect. That makes a lot of sense. And then I guess, just the second question is, so in Asia-Pacific, which on a comp-adjusted basis decelerated last quarter and then accelerated this quarter. Again, just thoughts on what\u2019s doing well there in Asia-Pacific, because it feels very strong right now?","Albert White","Yes. The Asia-Pacific region is strong. You\u2019re right on that. The thing I love about that region when you look at it is how diversified the growth is. We\u2019ll talk a lot in the Americas about the trade up to dailies and the trade up to daily silicones within that.","You look at the Asia-Pac region, we\u2019re getting growth from our full portfolio of products there. Daily silicones are doing really well. Our Biofinity is doing well. Even some of our traditional hydrogel products are doing well there. You\u2019re seeing diversified growth geographically. Meaning, there\u2019s a number of different countries that are driving growth there for us. And you\u2019re seeing opportunities with some of the key accounts some of the bigger chains and so forth there that we\u2019re getting in the door and having some opportunities with.","Keep in mind, we\u2019re under indexed in Asia-Pac. So we\u2019re investing there in order to be able to drive that growth. I think, some people at certain points have thought that our investments in sales force expansion and so forth was really a U.S. dominated theme, but it \u2013 but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s also Asia-Pacific. And you\u2019re right, we do have a good runway there for many years of strong growth.","Lawrence Keusch","Okay, terrific. Thanks, Al.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Block","Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Just two relatively quick ones. The first one, I also want to go back to the key accounts and just flush out a couple of things. Just the margin profile, Al, the key accounts, it seems like some of these wins are certainly helping to keep the top line momentum and we see that in your fiscal 4Q guide.","But on the margin side, is it really the upfront cost to win the business, or is it the ongoing margin structure of the key accounts? Is that a bit lower due to the fact that there are larger accounts and maybe some pricing concessions, maybe if you can flush it out a little bit?","Albert White","Jon, a lot of that is really upfront costs. And what we\u2019re trying to do right now is change the way we\u2019ve handled some of these opportunities from the past. So if we had a similar opportunity with some of these key accounts, we would go in there and we would convert whereas to our products working with our partner trying to make that happen.","Now at times, we would \u201ctighten\u201d our belt so to speak, because currency would move against us. Well, that is an example, would mean pulling back on some of that activity. Now that would pull back on some growth opportunities, but it would put a little better earnings in the very near-term to the bottom line.","What we\u2019re talking about right now is saying, let\u2019s not react to short-term currency moves. Let\u2019s take advantage of the portfolio we have. Let\u2019s invest those upfront dollars. Let\u2019s win those new wearers and we\u2019ll keep those wearers for a long time, so the returns are very strong on those. You\u2019ll see that in the outer years. There\u2019s not a situation here where the margins are worse. Now each individual contract is different. But I would certainly not look at it as ongoing cost as much as I would look at it as upfront cost.","Jonathan Block","Okay, got it. So arguably, to your last point, those wins should start to payoff and materialize at some point, call it, back-half fiscal 2019 into fiscal 2020 is when we would see those returns really sort of flush through the P&L more meaningfully?","Albert White","Yes, depending upon the timing of any other new contract and so forth we KRW. But I think that if revenues start to come down, then our profit situation will be better than what it would have been before the strategy is being implemented.","Jonathan Block","Understood. Okay. And then just a quick shift over to the CSI part of the business and more specifically PARAGARD. So the revs at 9%, I think, last quarter was up 11%, I believe. I think that 9% was actually up on the difficult comp because of what went on right before you guys acquired the assets.","So maybe just, Al, a high-level thoughts, good returns from the sales hires, are you ready to go ahead and say, hey, this is a high single-digit grow or mid single-digit plus, or how do we view PARAGARD longer-term? Thanks.","Albert White","Yes. Boy, the guys are doing a fantastic job there. I was impressed by that number and continue to be impressed by the work that the team is doing there around PARAGARD. And I\u2019ve seen some of the new advertising work and I think it\u2019s spot on. So I\u2019m really excited about it and excited about the numbers.","I still would probably temper some enthusiasm there. I think, we\u2019ll probably get a mid single-digit, maybe strong mid single-digit kind of growth number in Q4. And probably thinking our product has been in the market a long time. So maybe I\u2019m being a little conservative thinking mid single digits. But it\u2019s a little tough one to answer like I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself on that one. But the numbers keep coming in pretty strong.","So for now, I would probably lean towards mid single digits. And frankly, if we can get mid single-digit growth out of that product at the margins that it has and the cash flow that it throws off, we would be really happy with that. Now, if we can invest a little bit more and get that to be a more sustainable kind of upper mid single-digit or even in the upper single digits, that would obviously be fantastic. So we\u2019ll see how that plays out, but pretty good results and pretty good momentum there right now.","Jonathan Block","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Brian Weinstein","Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. Talking about the new fits in your comments that you\u2019re outpacing the market, can you give us an idea about what the share of new fits are? And specifically, where were you referring to that? Was that Americas? Is that worldwide? And is that within the specific product category or not?","Albert White","Yes, Brian. So we get New Fit Data in different markets, a lot of that comes from the Americas here. We \u2013 what we try to do every single quarter and we kind of have it standardized internal model on the New Fit Data is look at all the data that we get here and from around the world and we pull that together and say, okay, what\u2019s the trend behind that?","Now, it\u2019s not the best data in the world, because there are some people who don\u2019t supply data, you can only get so much information. But frankly, over the years, we\u2019ve accumulated a pretty good internal model that shows what the New Fit Data is and on an overall basis and then also down to some of the levels like on dailies and even sublevels like daily silicones and so forth, where we get some decent information.","So when I look at that, the strength overall. So if I look at our overall New Fit Data strength, it\u2019s quite a bit, I\u2019m not going to go into specific numbers, but it\u2019s a decent amount ahead of where our market share is. And again, another quarter in a row, where we\u2019ve seen that kind of strength and we\u2019ve really seen some robust improvements in the daily silicone hydrogel fittings side. So when it comes to the New Fit, dailies SiHys, that\u2019s where we\u2019re strongest and that\u2019s where we\u2019re really trying to capitalize right now.","Brian Weinstein","Great. And then as a follow-up on the Biofinity constraints. What do you think that, that cost you in the quarter? And do you say that you probably would have those taken care of in the fourth quarter? I think, I missed that comment. Thanks.","Albert White","Yes. So we had a \u2013 we have had a little bit of capacity issues with Biofinity, meaning, demand has been ahead of supply. That was true a little bit last quarter, it was true again decent part of this quarter. We have already added new production capabilities. So our capacity is up to the level right now that we needed to be. We\u2019re adding more Biofinity capacity in this quarter.","So we\u2019re in a pretty good situation in terms of now being able to meet the demand that\u2019s out there. I\u2019m not going to quantify that other than to say, it did impact us. It probably impacted \u2013 well, it did, I think in my mind impacted Biofinity Energys probably more than the rest of the Biofinity franchise just in that, that product launch went really well.","People are excited about it, and there was \u2013 there is a lot of demand for that product and that\u2019s, that kind of caused a little bit of a problem there. We obviously didn\u2019t get into it until really now, because now we fixed the capacity problem. So now we\u2019re unconstrained and the team can go out there and aggressively sell Biofinity, including Biofinity Energys.","Brian Weinstein","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joanne Wuensch","Hi, guys. Can you hear me, okay?","Albert White","Yep.","Joanne Wuensch","Wonderful. This is the first time, I think, in my memory that I\u2019ve heard you discuss the concept of key accounts and now investing them, I think, this with us previously. But I really want to make sure that I \u2013 that we spend just a moment more on it. Is there a reason that this is being discussed at this stage? Is there something in the market? Is there something in your portfolio? Why is this coming up now?","Albert White","Yes, great question, Joanne. If you look at the marketplace over the years and where we\u2019ve had a lot of strength, as you know, we\u2019ve had a lot of that strength with independent practitioners be that here in the U.S. or in different spots around the world. We\u2019ve had a lot of this success there. And that links back to the broad product offering we have with Torics and Multifocals and specialty lenses and so forth.","Once we completed the Sauflon acquisition and brought clariti in, we had a mass market daily silicone hydrogel in, not only a sphere, but a Toric and a Multifocal and a unique product that we\u2019re able to offer the marketplace. Not only can we offer it, we can make it. We have capacity. We can and we can expand capacity relatively easy. That\u2019s allowed us to walk into a lot of these buying groups in these large retailers, who are heavy on the daily side, where we\u2019ve had historically a difficult time winning business, winning some of these big opportunities.","Well, what we build out a sale team \u2013 sales team, we went in there. We tried to win some of those opportunities, and say, hey, we\u2019re here. We have the products. We have some of the best products out there in the marketplace. We can supply you. We don\u2019t have capacity issues. We\u2019re a market leader in terms of logistics and distribution. We can offer you unique capabilities in terms of labeling and packaging and so forth. That has been successful.","That\u2019s been successful. And there\u2019s always a little question mark around that about how you\u2019re going to do? Well, that CooperVision sales team Dennis Murphy and team has done an amazing job there, an amazing job, and they won some new opportunities. And once you get those opportunities, you try to take advantage of them. So that\u2019s kind of a position we\u2019re in.","We did start talking about a little bit, but it\u2019s just become more important now. And now it\u2019s driving up our revenue growth a little bit here in the near-term, it\u2019s also driving up some of our advertising and promotional activity.","Joanne Wuensch","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. As a second question, I can\u2019t say as a follow-up. I\u2019m going to spend a little bit of time in foreign exchange, because that\u2019s impacting the third quarter, all of your fourth quarter guide and clearly it\u2019s going to be there for over 2019. Can you walk us through at today\u2019s rate, what type of impact do you think you will be seeing in 2019, and remind us of the impact on gross margins, because it seems to me that will be \u2013 it will show up there also?","Albert White","Yes. So we\u2019re not going to get into kind of those specific numbers as we move into next year. I mean, now we\u2019ll go through guidance and we\u2019ll update guidance and so forth in December and incorporate current FX rates in there. And you\u2019re right. I mean, that is something we have to deal with. It\u2019s a headwind out there.","But I think that one of the points I wanted to make, at least, for next year is on a constant currency basis, we still are planning on delivering low double-digit operating profit growth. So we have some issues below the line there, but we\u2019re still intent on driving that.","Now you might say, okay, well, wait a minute. You guys are going to invest and you\u2019re going to have heightened investments. Fine, I\u2019m okay with that, because you\u2019re going to drive better revenue growth, how are you going to drive double-digit OI growth in the face of some currency and so forth. But we are anticipating gross margin expansion.","So we do have a lot more volume coming through the plans. For us, volume is a good thing. It drives down our unit costs. We have more efficiencies, as we utilize equipment, utilize space and so forth and manufacturing.","So I would say that versus maybe six months ago or something like that, probably when I look at fiscal 2019 a little bit better gross margin than what I was thinking we were going to do, but heightened expenses associated with that. But net-net still allowing us to deliver that double-digit constant currency that II growth.","Joanne Wuensch","Okay. Thank you very much.","Albert White","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. I just want to follow-up with another question on the efforts you\u2019re making here to push forward into the channel with marketing dollars. I\u2019m interested in sort of the ways in which your go-to-market dollars has been allocated maybe differently this time around versus in the past. And whether that be as you pointed out some of the larger customers versus just different mediums, I\u2019m just kind of curious how the strategy here is different now than it would have been a couple of years ago and just trying to get a better vision for where those dollars are being spent?","Albert White","Yes, it\u2019s a good question and probably an important one, because when you look at some of our competitors in the marketplace and how we talk about advertising promotional sales dollars. What we\u2019re talking about here is partner-related activity. So that\u2019s not TV ads. We\u2019re not talking about, hey, we\u2019re going through a big strategic shift here and we\u2019re going to have TV ads all over the place and ads all over and magazines and so forth. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about.","We\u2019re talking about doing what we\u2019ve done well for many, many years, which is partner or work with our partners be their independent practitioners or buying groups or retail operations and so forth, work closely with them to help them be successful. A lot of those contracts, a lot of the work we do has buying discounts.","So the more a retailer buys from us, the lower their pricing is. We want to work with them on that. We want more wearers coming to us faster. We want them to have the opportunity to get better price and we try to link all that together and be a good partner with them.","The activity we\u2019re talking about is investing in that \u2013 those \u2013 that sales side of that, the advertising, the promotional, trying to link that all together. So we\u2019re a good partner with the big retailers. But it\u2019s very similar to the advertising promotional sales work that we\u2019ve done over the years.","Isaac Ro","Okay, makes sense. And just quick follow-up on the surgical side. Can you maybe give us a bit of a sense of what\u2019s embedded in the guidance for the rest of the fiscal year, as it relates to the impact of PARAGARD? I think, you talked a little bit about the long-term growth potential. But just trying to get a handle on kind of the next, whether it\u2019s three to six months kind of what\u2019s the reasonable expectation as we exit the calendar year and start to benefit a little bit more from some of the marketing dollars you talked about?","Albert White","Yes. I would kind of think of PARAGARD being somewhere around that $45 million number for Q4, which means our full-year PARAGARD number is a couple of million dollars higher than what we thought it was going to be last quarter. And if you look at that, you\u2019re probably talking somewhere in that kind of mid-ish, maybe mid even to slightly up or kind of single digits.","I think, that\u2019s probably where we\u2019re going to come in, in the fourth quarter. Obviously, that can change a little. It\u2019s not that big of a product, the dollars aren\u2019t that big. So if a little bit pushes into a quarter, that can swing it. But I think, we feel pretty good about that right now being at least a mid single-digit growth.","Isaac Ro","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Albert White","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Brien with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Matt O\u2019Brien","Thank you and good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just to put a maybe a little bit finer point, Al, on the outlook for the business next year, you\u2019ve got currency going against, so you\u2019ve got a higher tax rates, You are going to spend more money, which I think everybody understands. Is this a business that can have some EPS growth next year of a really difficult comparison? And then should we expect the big snapback in 2020 as maybe some of these investments wind down a bit?","Albert White","Yes, I mean, we\u2019ll see where FX ends up right in December. But as of today, I would certainly anticipate EPS growth next year, that\u2019s for sure. I mean, we need to hurdle the tax rate. But outside of the tax rate and we\u2019re generating a lot of cash and we\u2019ll be paying down some debt. And yes, as of today, I don\u2019t know, why we wouldn\u2019t be growing EPS year-over-year.","If I look at the following year assuming similar tax rate, yes, then you\u2019re going to see a much better fiscal 2020 EPS growth rate than you would see in fiscal 2019. That\u2019s true. I think that when you look at our tax structure and so forth too, obviously, the tax rate is moving higher as part of tax reform. We\u2019ll implement plans and strategies and so forth to do our best in terms of where we produce product and how we produce and ship and so forth to manage our tax structure.","So yes, I would expect growth rates to be a decent amount better in 2020. And when I kind of look at 2020, 2021 and so forth, and these investments that we\u2019re doing right now should return pretty good numbers in those years. And by the way, I don\u2019t want to go overboard here in these investments.","I mean, when you look at, our Q4 guidance that we\u2019re giving is adjusted down $0.13, that\u2019s the exact amount of FX hit that we\u2019re taking. So I don\u2019t want anyone to walk away from this call being, like oh, my God, these guys are spending like crazier, this is out of control or some, because that\u2019s not the case at all. I mean, the spending is highly focused as return metrics associated with all of that and it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re talking millions and millions of dollars here, certainly, not tens of millions of dollars.","Matt O\u2019Brien","Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. And then as a follow-up. Can you talk a little bit about the MyDay Toric roll out? Where you\u2019re at as far as rolling that up to your accounts? And then sorry to do this to you a little bit just on the investment side, again. But I think historically, you\u2019ve talked about getting to 30% market share here with some of these investments, these capabilities that you have now with Sauflon. Can we expect you getting to that metric faster, maybe by a year or two, or any kind of qualitative commentary be helpful there? Thanks.","Albert White","Yes. The MyDay Toric roll out is going really well, but we see that in many markets. We see it right here in the U.S., where that the \u2013 that product is being received really well. And what\u2019s exciting about that is the halo effect that we\u2019re seeing on MyDay is here, because that product had a really nice quarter.","So we\u2019re really excited about where MyDay is at right now, and how that products being received in the market. And it kind of confirms, if you will, the strategy that we\u2019ve had about having a multi-pronged approach of a premium daily silicone in mass market and a more traditional hydrogel. So it \u2013 we\u2019re in good shape and that\u2019s being received well.","So I\u2019m really happy about that. Obviously, saw the strong uptick in terms of daily silicone hydrogel numbers. So I think, that\u2019s good. I think that if you look at, I think, you\u2019re kind of alluding that to some past discussions, when \u2013 it\u2019s very general numbers. When you look at our market share and you kind of go, okay, you guys have 23%, a very strong 23% global market share. But you\u2019re in that 30% range for Multifocals and 30% range for Torics and you\u2019re kind of in that 30% for FRPs and so forth and for silicones in general.","We have been running at about 16% market share in dailies. Now that is improving. So that has \u2013 that\u2019s been true for a number of quarters. We actually moved up to 17% global market share in dailies this quarter. That number is accelerating. That is accelerating. So as the when we move that up and get to the same level and take our total market share up towards 30%, we\u2019ll see when that happens. But based on where we are today and the momentum we have today, yes, you\u2019re right that will happen faster.","Matt O\u2019Brien","Great. Thanks so much.","Albert White","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Matthew Mishan","Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Al, is it a fair assumption that over the next couple of years MyDay or at least these dailies total 1 pretty much round out the full family of the dailies SiHys. And then traditionally, it\u2019s positive for the brands. But kind of what do you think several brands doing around the same time can do for the category?","Albert White","Yes. I think it\u2019s fantastic. I really do. I mean, you talk about a tradeup strategy, that\u2019s great for the industry and great for the wearer that is right where we\u2019re at right now. We\u2019re still in the early innings of that. You want patients wearing daily lenses. That\u2019s what\u2019s best for the patient. For their eye health, it\u2019s best for them to wear daily lenses. Throw that lens out every day, put a fresh clean one in every day. You want them wearing silicone hydrogel lenses for the oxygen permeability to water content, the things we talk about in terms of the best combination of a lens that you can offer your patients.","So this is not only a situation, where you have manufacturers offering premier products and it\u2019s good for the manufacturer. Well, it\u2019s good for the wearer also. So this is good for the marketplace. It\u2019s good for the health of people. It\u2019s good for manufacturers and the fact that you have \u2013 you mentioned J&J and Alcon\u2019s products and ourselves as leading products in that space is to me fantastic. And we should all continue to push that and be successful with that strategy, and I think we will be.","Matthew Mishan","Great. Got it. And just a follow-up. How should I think about the accounting for rebates? Is it a net number reflected in sales, or do you get the full benefit in sales with an offset in advertising and promotion?","Albert White","It\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 the rebates are a reduction in revenues. So it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s taken as an immediate reduction in revenues in the quarter.","Matthew Mishan","Okay. Excellent. Perfect, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Christian Moore","Hi, this is Christian on for Robbie. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe taking a look at the overall contact lens market, strong results obviously from you today at 9% pro forma and the competitors as well. It looks like that market is kind of ticked up to the 7% range above the historical 4% to 6%. Kind of \u2013 if you could maybe break it down for us how much of that is attributed to the same product pricing uplift? How much is geographic expansion? And then how much of that is from that shift of overall product mix to dailies SiHys?","Albert White","Yes, you\u2019re exactly right. The market is stronger, and there\u2019s different dynamics that are driving that strength by competitors. So if you look at someone like J&J, as an example, they\u2019re in a fantastic position. And I think those guys are doing a great job right now trading wearers up. And I think, they have a long road in front of them, the success there, because I think, they have a good team that\u2019s smart, that\u2019s doing a good job on that.","So I would envision, they continue to be successful, driven by product trade up and you have obviously talked about our situation of focusing on winning some new wearers and capitalizing on our product portfolio, which includes the high-end and the more mass market silicone. But that, that is the driver of the market. That shift to dailies that we\u2019re talking about is the driver of the market.","Pricing, frankly, at the end of the day is relatively flat. You can look at a list pricing and pricing out there and say, is it increasing? Yes. I would say, it is increasing, but we\u2019ve seen rebate activity also. We\u2019re starting to annualize that rebate activity, but rebate activity kind of offsetting that. So that pricing will be relatively neutral.","The other component, you\u2019re right is geography. So there is still some geographic expansion. The established markets are relatively flat from a wearer perspective. But when you go into Eastern Europe and you go into China and certain markets, emerging markets around the world, there\u2019s definitely still wearer expansion there. So I wouldn\u2019t put a big part of the growth attributable to that, but that\u2019s certainly consistent kind of underlying driver of growth.","Christian Moore","Great, thanks. And then maybe focusing in on the daily SiHy space, Bausch & Lomb launching their products into the space in 4Q. What do you expect that you obviously you\u2019ve seen accelerating results there? But do you see that as a benefit for all players in the market to help accelerate utilization there, or could pricing get worse than just kind of your high-level thoughts there?","Albert White","Yes. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have much to say on that. I don\u2019t want to speculate on when Bausch is going to launch their product or how or where they\u2019re going to launch it, or what price they\u2019re going to launch it. So when information comes out on that, I\u2019m happy to comment on it. But for now, I\u2019d say, I\u2019m not in a position to speculate or guess what\u2019s going to happen there.","Christian Moore","Okay. And maybe just one last one kind of on the geographic perspective. I know that last quarter you mentioned that getting from the gray market activity under control. You expected a deceleration in Europe going into the back-half of the year. But we actually saw acceleration across geographies in the quarter. Do you see that trend continuing into 4Q? And then any commentary on if and what type of gray market activity you\u2019re still seeing? Thanks.","Albert White","Yes. The gray market activity that team has done a really nice job of working through that. So there\u2019s not a lot to discuss on that. I would say that, yes, Europe had a good quarter, very challenging comp. They certainly had a nice quarter. They have good momentum there that Mark already runs that, that business over there. He is doing a really nice job over there, and I would expect that to continue.","There has been a heavy focus there, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks on key accounts and success around key accounts, and we have good traction there. And that\u2019s a region that links perfectly into the discussion we\u2019ve been having on key accounts and why we\u2019re investing. So I would envision that continues in Q4.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks. And maybe, Al, just to jump back to key accounts for a moment there. And is there a way to maybe quantify what percent of the global market actually runs through key accounts? And so you\u2019re 23% globally. As you invest in that part of the channel, what is sort of the upside potential maybe in share points or dollars over time once perhaps return start coming in from these investments? And then I have a couple of follow-ups. Thanks.","Albert White","Yes. I think, the key account discussion is a tough one, because it\u2019s a pretty long discussion that one of the issues that you have is key accounts are not all the same. So you have some large retailer, some very large retailers, where the optometrist is essentially independent optometrist. They\u2019re not an employee of the retailer, so they\u2019re renting space, so to speak, from the retailer.","Then you go to the other extreme, where the optometrist is employed by the retailer themselves. Now, as you can imagine, if it\u2019s an employee relationship, there\u2019s a lot more influence by the corporate office than if there is an independent relationship. And then you also have buying groups and so forth in there.","But a large portion of the market is going to be related in some form to key accounts. And I would say, that\u2019s especially true because of buying groups. When you get into places like the U.S., you talk about independent practitioners. They\u2019re not nearly as many true independent practitioners as there have been historically.","So that market is moving, that\u2019s why I kind of talk about a long-term sustainable trend. The market is definitely moving to these buying groups and allowing people to work together and buy in volume, take advantage of store brands and special packaging and offering and so forth, anything they can do to help lock down their customers.","So I guess, just high-end answer would be key accounts are pretty sizable part of the market, but again, that much more complex than just a generic term.","Anthony Petrone","Yes. And the follow-up there would be just from time to time, the business has seen various different ebbs and flows within the distributor channel. And it seems like this is certainly a channel that\u2019s linked closely to distributors and different stocking levels and the like. So is there any \u2013 anything we should be looking out for as it relates to the level of stocking quarter-in and quarter-out as this process takes hold?","And then last, just your comments, Al, just as you\u2019re looking at 2019, is high level competitively, J&J obviously at their Analyst Day has an aggressive launch plan and then Alcon, CIBA should be spun at some point next year, so just any thoughts there? Thanks again.","Albert White","Yes. We have not seen anything in terms of stocking level. So I know that there has been some discussion kind of in prior quarters, prior years certainly without some prior quarters in terms of some stockings, some up and downs associated with channel inventory levels. We haven\u2019t really seen anything on that. Ours have been fairly consistent here. So I wouldn\u2019t attribute anything either way to kind of channel inventory for us.","On a go-forward basis, the way that we\u2019re handling these relationships, I would envision, we\u2019ll not have situations, where you get inventory or stocking levels moving up or down to a material level. If they do, we\u2019ll obviously communicate that is being part of the positive if it is or part of the detriment if it goes the other way. So we\u2019re pretty open and transparent on that and continue to be.","From a competitive standpoint, yes, it\u2019s another and like I said at Bausch, it\u2019s a little pop on Alcon. I know there\u2019s rumblings out there about them launching a new product and about them spinning into their own standalone company and Novartis doing that. And I don\u2019t know, you guys \u2013 I\u2019m not going to speculate on that one either you guys probably have as much if not more color than I do on some of that.","And yes J&J has been pretty public about wanting to grow the business and I think that\u2019s fantastic. And I think, they\u2019re going to continue to grow the business. And I think they\u2019re going to continue to put up good numbers and I\u2019m \u2013 and that\u2019s good for the entire industry.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Willoughby","Hi, good evening. Two questions for you. I guess, first, just regarding the Brian\u2019s comments regarding 2019 in terms of low double digits operating income growth, excluding FX. I guess, Al or Brian, just what I\u2019m looking at it tax rate going from 8% to 14% and then given current FX rates. I\u2019m looking at about an 8.5% headwind to EPS growth, which would then put potential earnings growth next year in kind of the low single-digit range versus the 7% current consensus. So just wondering if you have any comments on that and then I have a follow-up?","Albert White","Yes, Steve. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re too far off on that frankly, at the end of the day. This is always a tough one, right? Because currency moves and a significant part of our business is offshore unlike some other medical device companies and so forth here. We have a large part of our business offshore and it\u2019s growing nicely.","So we do get hit more by FX than other companies. And then we\u2019re in a little unique position, because of our fiscal year that we do get hit by that tax rate. So we\u2019ll obviously update for currency\u2026 We\u2019ll see where that stands in December, but I think, yes, I think generally speaking, you\u2019re in the ballpark, yes.","Steve Willoughby","Thanks, Al. And then just a second question kind of a couple of parter here. I guess, given the conversation around key accounts and Joanne commented that it\u2019s never really come up before. It seems like from my stance, key account is being sort of a focus of the company for much of the last decade. And so I\u2019m just wondering kind of where new key account wins can come from, particularly given that you\u2019re really the only company that does private label in the space?","And then just wanted also to be clear, you\u2019re not really assuming any impact from any potential competitive launches whether it\u2019s one of your contacts Bausch or Alcon, et cetera? Thanks, guys.","Albert White","Yes, competitive launches, I mean, we\u2019re \u2013 for our \u2013 for respect to this guidance, we\u2019re basically a month in, right? So there\u2019s no launches out there, we have two more months. So no, there\u2019s really nothing in there obviously for competitive launches other than what we know as of today.","So I mean, I\u2019m not quite sure what to add outside of that I know there\u2019s a lot of questions out there on a competitive standpoint, but we\u2019re working on what we have. When you look at key accounts, Steve, yes, we talked about key accounts in the context of kind of buying groups in the context of working with some retailers you talked about some that we\u2019ve discussed in the past here in terms of Costco or somebody in terms of private label opportunities.","Where things have changed for us is our opportunity to go into these folks who some of who we have a relationship with and some of whom we have not had a relationship with and be able to go in and say, we have market-leading daily silicone hydrogel products.","We have capacity to be able to supply them. We have the logistics to be able to get them to you. We have the packaging and the labeling to be able to do something unique for you. And we now have a sales team in efforts, where we can promote and work with you to ensure the success of those. That is a different animal than what we\u2019ve had in the past.","Now I know we\u2019ve owned Sauflon for a few years. It\u2019s taken us a little while to get everything behind us. It\u2019s taken us a little bit to get all of our distribution stuff cleaned up going in the right direction, manufacturing, sales and marketing teams within key accounts and so forth. But we\u2019re in that position and we\u2019re doing really well. And we\u2019re investing there and we\u2019re starting to reap the rewards of all that work.","Steve Willoughby","Okay, thanks. Make sense, Al. I appreciate it.","Albert White","Yes. Sure. Yep.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Steven Lichtman","Thank you, guys. Al, you mentioned that the independent practitioner remains important even as you increase investments on key accounts. I\u2019m just wondering from \u2013 relative to investment dollars, is any of the work you\u2019re doing on key accounts coming from spend previously earmarked toward independent practitioners and you\u2019re shifting some resources, or is this all incremental investment?","Albert White","Yes. That\u2019s a great question. No, it would be incremental investments. I mean, when you look at the independent channel, we are continuing to invest there. I mentioned like Eye Care Prime as an example. And if people aren\u2019t aware of that, I would encourage you to kind of go look at the website for Eye Care Prime.","But I mean, that\u2019s a relationship management and marketing software tool that we offer to optometrist right now. And we have it in 12 countries and we have over $45 million patients that we work with through that tool. Yes, that\u2019s kind of a unique offering and we have other things like that.","So we are continuing to invest and be active with respect to independent practitioners. They\u2019re a core part of our business and they remain a core part of our business. So I would not want anybody to think that in anyway we\u2019re not going to fully support our independent practitioner friends.","Steven Lichtman","Got it. And then,. Al, you also mentioned potentially some tuck-in deals. Fair to say that M&A likely remains focused on the surgical side of the business? And what generally are your areas of focus as you look for some portfolio adds there?","Albert White","Yes, I\u2019d say that with respect to M&A, we\u2019ll see if we can find stuff. I would say, it\u2019s going to be smaller tuck-in stuff whether that\u2019s vision or surgical, we\u2019ve kind of done some small tuck-ins on both side of those. We\u2019ll see if we can make something work there.","If not, I don\u2019t mind paying down debt right now that, that would be okay to do and to earmark dollars to share buybacks is something else I\u2019m certainly comfortable with. So I think, we\u2019re in a raising rate environment when you start looking at saying a little different utilization of cash, maybe even historically, if that makes a little bit of sense.","Steven Lichtman","Got it. Thanks, Al.","Albert White","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. And I\u2019m not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Albert White, President and CEO, for any closing remarks.","Albert White","Great. Thank you. Well, thank you, everyone. I appreciate it. Obviously, if you have any questions or comments or anything, reach out to us through our Investor Relations group and be happy to connect on that and look forward to catching up with everybody again in equity conferences and so forth and then our \u2013 on our December earnings call. So with that, we\u2019ll go ahead and end the call, operator. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."],"5984":["Cooper Companies Inc.

Welcome to the 2015 fiscal fourth quarter and full year conference call. For the full year we reported record revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share. We delivered on our objectives to gain share in the $7.3 billion contact lens industry and we delivered on our objective to generate over $200 million in cash flow. We also delivered on our goal of completing the vast majority of our Sauflon integration activity while continuing to push into 1 Day silicone hydrogel space with clariti and MyDay. I believe we have set the stage nicely for continuing market share gains combined with earnings and cash flow for many years to come.","Now, let me touch on three items I want to highlight. First, fiscal fourth quarter was not as strong as we would have liked. We encountered unexpected integration disruptions in Europe along with a weak quarter in the United States. This resulted in slower than expected CooperVision growth including $39 million in daily silicone hydrogel sales, which came in below our expectations. We also experienced significant weakness in our contact lens solutions business. ","Second, our goal has been to de-risk the Vision business by completing the vast majority of the Sauflon integration activity by the time of this call and we\u2019ve done that both with manufacturing platforms in our operating infrastructure. Third, currency continues to be a significant headwind and this is reflected in our guidance. For fiscal 2013 we are forecasting $0.58 negative impact to earnings per share from currency. This may be larger than many of you expected, but remember that our currencies outside of the euro, the yen and the pound generated significant portion of our revenues and several of them have weakened significantly against the dollar over the past year.","On a pro forma basis, we\u2019re guiding to roughly 10% to 14% non-GAAP earnings per share growth. From a revenue perspective of guiding CooperVision to midpoint of 6% constant currency growth, in CooperSurgical to a midpoint of 2.5% pro forma growth. I\u2019ll expand on these as I walk through the quarter performance, but I want to confirm we remain optimistic about the underlying fundamentals of our business and we believe we\u2019re well positioned to deliver solid results in fiscal 2016 and beyond.","On a consolidated basis, Q4 revenues declined 3% year-over-year to $456 million in non-GAAP earnings per share or $2 per share up 18% pro forma. For a full year, perspective non-GAAP earnings per share were up 26% pro forma. Regarding revenue CooperVision reported revenues of $373 million down 3% year-over-year, but up 5% in constant currency and up 7% in constant currency excluding solutions.","Although solid the results were negatively impacted by three items I mentioned earlier, so let me provide more color. First, consolidation of several Sauflon warehouses into the main European distribution facility resulted in unexpected issues, which reduced service levels from \u2013 of the second half of September through October and into November.","We managed to ship a lot of product prior to the fiscal year end, but there were significant disruptions during the fourth quarter. We\u2019re shipping product at acceptable fulfillment levels, but it should be noted that some of the financial repercussions from this event will negatively impact Q1. These financial repercussions include customer concessions, which are make whole payments treated as a direct reduction in revenue.","These cost have not and will not be excluded from operating \u2013 our operating results, as we\u2019re not going to adjust revenue on a non-GAAP basis. Regarding the impact, revenues or earnings I\u2019m not going to estimate these numbers. ","The second item relates to the U.S. where we had a unexpectedly weak October. Our momentum was good going into the month, so this is very frustrating; J&J released a new one day silicone hydrogel lens including a massive number of fitting sets with aggressive launch discounts, which negatively impacted us.","To be fair as optimistic as we were about our daily portfolio the competition is definitely getting tougher and this is a good example. ","Lastly, our contact lens solutions business was very weak this quarter down 36% in constant currency or roughly $8 million. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, the contact lens solution industry is experiencing significant pressure from the market move to 1 Day.","We\u2019ve been streamlining our focus to strategic accounts as we expect the business to decline just not to this level. We expect the business will stabilize but likely continue to decline with the market. ","Regarding our other areas of interest we had a strong quarter in Asia-Pacific growing 13% in constant currency. I\u2019m also happy to report. We didn\u2019t see any real channel movement this quarter and noise around UPP or Unilateral Pricing Policy seems to be quieting down as we wait for the court ruling on the Utah Law impacting UPP practices.","Looking at silicones, our silicone hydrogel family of products delivered strong growth this quarter up 16% in constant currency to $212 million. Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 11% in constant currency which was solid. We remain under indexed against the market in both the two-week and monthly silicone space with silicones representing roughly 78% of that market and us at 72%. So we anticipate continuing to grow our two-week and monthly silicones nicely for many years.","Regarding one day silicone, sales of clariti and MyDay combined for $39 million in constant currency growth of 48%. For the full year one day silicone totaled $137 million or 45% pro forma growth. We remain very optimistic about our daily silicone hydrogel family of products and are 100% committed to our growth strategy, which includes a two-tiered approach with clariti positioned as our mass-market offering and MyDay as our premium offering.","Remember, the contact lens market is being driven by 1 Day growth and we strongly believe we have the best product offering in the space, as the only company with the premium in mass-market lens, including a full portfolio of one day sphere, toric, multifocal, silicone hydrogel lenses. Regarding clariti, manufacturing remains in excellent shape to meet the demand of 2016. From a launch perspective, we\u2019re in good shape in Europe and the product continues growing nicely. In the U.S. sales are ramping and we continue to aggressively launch the product. ","Regarding MyDay, sales continue to ramp in Europe; and we\u2019re successfully launching the product in the U.S. with very positive feedback. Regarding capacity, we\u2019re continuing to sell everything we can make and we\u2019re bringing on additional lines to help meet demand. ","As anticipated, MyDay is fitting perfectly into the high-end segment of the silicone hydrogel market. I\u2019m also extremely pleased to announce that we have received regulatory approval for MyDay in Japan. ","For competitive reasons, I won\u2019t provide details on the timing of our launch, but I do believe this is very nice positive for us in Japan is an extremely large daily market with roughly $750 million in annual sales. Our specialty business remained strong this quarter with torics up 8% and multifocal up 7%, both in constant currency. We\u2019re the global leader in specialty lenses and we are taking market share.","Regarding Proclear, sales of the hydrogel product line were down 4% in constant currency, driven by softness in our non-daily Proclear product lines in sales modalities continue shifting to silicones. On a regional basis, the Americas were up 4% in constant currency, led by Biofinity, clariti and MyDay. Even with the integration disruption in Europe we\u2019re 3% in constant currency or 8% excluding solutions. Meanwhile, Asia Pacific was up 13% in constant currency with strong growth in a number of markets. ","Lastly our manufacturing activity, we made a number of decisions around rightsizing our platform of older hydrogel lines into a corresponding actions with, which included writing off certain lines in accelerating depreciation on others.","From an accounting perspective, we expect to incur charges associated with these activities through fiscal 2013 and we\u2019ll highlight these items as they occur. This activity along with ramping up our new UK and Costa Rica manufacturing facilities is all on schedule. Now, let me comment on the overall contact lens market for calendar Q3 and remember most of this information is on the last page of our earnings release.","We continue taking share with the market up 8% and CooperVision up 9%, the underlying story sure was the market strength spotted by J&J, which put up strong numbers rebounding from four extremely weak quarters. Given their historical comps, I expect them to post three more quarters of strong growth. So we\u2019ll see the overall market continue to appear robust, having said that, these higher market growth rates are not actual reflection of the market growth.","Our market grew 4% on the trailing 12 month basis and I believe the true market growth is currently in the 4% to 6% range. Regionally, the Asia Pacific market was up 6% with CooperVision up 12%, EMEA was up 4% with CooperVision up 10%, and the Americas was up 11% with CooperVision up 6%.","If we look at the market on a modality basis, the single used market continued to drive growth up 14%. As you can see our growth remains diverse and strong. Going forward I expect the market to grow 4% to 6% over the next five years and most likely closer to 6%. The drivers continue to be the shift in daily\u2019s geographic expansion and an expansion of the wear base. Pricing has been relatively flat but if we see increases, we would be able to hit 6% or even higher. And I believe we\u2019ll continue taking a market share led by Biofinity and our strong daily portfolio. ","Moving to CooperSurgical, we have a lot of \u2013 we\u2019ve made a lot of progress this quarter and becoming more bullish on the feature of this business. Our fertility business is returning to strength and we have several exciting product launches. On a pro forma basis. CooperSurgical declined 2%, but fertility was up 3% and I believe we\u2019ve turned the corner in that business. We now have a full executive team in place, we\u2019re finishing our work around rationalizing non-CooperSurgical manufactured capital equipment. We also acquired Reprogenetics in August and entered lab services business with IVF genetic testing.","Our first quarter with the business was very successful, overall I\u2019m confident. That fertility business is going to drive a lot of growth in the coming years. Our medical device products, which are focused on office and surgical procedures declined, again this quarter down 5%. We made significant progress in this part of the business through just \u2013 with several products in the early launch stages. I\u2019m confident that our aggressive focus of these product launches will return this part of the business to positive growth in the very near future. Overall, I expect a much better year of CooperSurgical and I look forward to reporting on this business as it progresses.","Now, let me look a little more at guidance. Our fiscal 2016 guidance for CooperVision [indiscernible] 7% constant currency growth. Our CooperSurgical is 1% to 4% pro forma growth. Regarding non-GAAP EPS, we\u2019re guiding to pro forma growth of roughly 10% to 14%, which equates to a non-GAAP range of $7.60 to $7.90. We normally don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, but given the impact of currency on the first quarter. We were going to make an exception. Expect fiscal Q1 consolidated sales of $435 million to $447 million, with CooperVision posting revenues in the $356 million to $366 million range and CooperSurgical in the $79 million to $81 million range.","Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance is a $1.52 to $1.62, which is approximately flat to up 5% pro forma. Regarding cash flow we expect around $300 million of adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2016, which excludes acquisitions and integration expenses, CapEx will be high the first half of the year, but much lower in the back half. Now that the majority of the integration work is completed and the business is getting back to normal generating significant cash flow is incredibly important this year.","From a longer term perspective, we\u2019re updating our operating margin target to incorporate many successes. We believe we see over the coming years offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange. We\u2019re now forecasting operating margins to be 27% or higher in 2020. Regarding strategy we continue our successful strategy, which I have frequently articulated in the past. This strategy includes investing in our businesses to take market share by expanding geographically, aggressively rolling out new products and investing in emerging markets. We do all this while keenly focused on delivering solid earnings per share and cash flow, with the focus on delivering strong shareholder returns.","Now, before I turn it over to Greg, let me make a few summary comments. Fiscal 2015 represented challenges, but I\u2019m proud of where we stand today. We could argue that we moved too fast integrating Sauflon with the vast majority of the work is behind us and our team is incredibly focused on delivering a strong year. We continue taking share even as competition in the contact lens industry has increased. Our portfolio of products is very strong, and we have an incredibly solid manufacturing base.","I also strongly believe we will see CooperSurgical return to growth this year. All this should result in a solid 2016. With that, let me express my appreciation to our employees, our number one asset. Their hard work and dedication to creating value is the backbone of our success.","And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg to cover our financial results.","Greg Matz","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m going to focus primarily on our non-GAAP results for the quarter, for a reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please refer to our earnings release. Bob provided an overall summary of our performance, including a review of the market and our revenue picture. So let me start with gross margins.","Looking at gross margins, in Q4 the non-GAAP gross margin was 63.9% compared with 63.2% in the prior year. Factors, which impacted our non-GAAP gross margins, were favorable FX impact to cost of goods sold, favorable manufacturing variances and product mix led by Biofinity. And these were offset by a negative FX of foreign currency impact to our revenues. Full year non-GAAP gross margin finished at 63.5%. CooperVision on a non-GAAP basis reported gross margin of 64.3% versus 62.8% in Q4 of last year. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP gross margin was due to favorable FX on cost of goods sold manufacturing variances in mix, partially offset by unfavorable FX on revenues. ","CooperSurgical had non-GAAP gross margin of 62.2%, which compares to Q4 2014 of 64.9%. The year-over-year decline in non-GAAP margin is due to the inclusion of Reprogenetics, which has a gross margin in the low 40s and other manufacturing costs. ","Now looking at operating expenses, SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, SG&A decreased approximately 2% to $166 million or 36% of revenue in line with the prior year. Looking at R&D, in Q4, R&D on a non-GAAP basis was $16 million or 3.5% of revenue down from 3.7% in the prior year.","Looking at depreciation and amortization, in Q4, depreciation was $37 million, up $8.5 million year-over-year, which includes $6.5 million of accelerated depreciation related to the Sauflon acquisition, not included in our non-GAAP numbers. And amortization was $13.1 million, down $900,000. For the year amortization was $51.5 million and depreciation was $139.9 million including $22.7 million of accelerated depreciation excluded from non-GAAP numbers.","Moving to operating margins, for Q4 consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $42.3 million and 9.3% of revenue versus $39.4 million and 8.4% of revenue in Q4 last year. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $109.2 million and 24% of revenue versus a $108.9 million and 23.3% of revenue for the prior year. For the fiscal year, non-GAAP operating income and margin were $414.5 million and 23.1% of revenue.","In Q4, CooperVision\u2019s non-GAAP operating income and margin were $100.2 million and 26.8% of revenue versus $98 million and 25.4% of revenue in the prior year. CSI\u2019s non-GAAP operating income and margin were $20.8 million and 25.3% of revenue, which is Q4 2014 of $22.9 million, operating income at 27.8% of revenue. The primary reason for the year-over-year decline in operating income is due to reduction in gross margin. Interest expense was $4.8 million for the quarter, up $1.5 million year-over-year, primarily due to the acquisition of Sauflon and higher interest rates on our banking pricing grid. The total interest expense in fiscal 2015 was $18.1 million.","Looking at the effective tax rate, in Q4, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 4.3% versus a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 8.7% in Q4 2014. As we\u2019ve mentioned before, the effective tax rate continues to be below the U.S. statutory rate, as the majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions of lower tax rate. The effective tax rate was favorably impacted by lower income due to integration activities. The non-GAAP full year 2015 effective tax rate was 6.6%.","Earnings per share, our Q4 earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was $0.75 and $2 respectively, versus $0.63 and $1.95 for GAAP and non-GAAP in the prior year. For the full year, on our EPS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was $4.14 and $7.44 respectively. Non-GAAP EPS on a pro forma basis, which is just for constant currency, grew approximately 18% in the quarter and 26% for the year.","During Q4, we repurchased approximately 368,000 shares with an average share value of a $139.60 per share, for a total cost of $51.3 million. This leaves approximately $118 available for future share repurchases under the current approved plan. Looking at FX, the net currency impact on earnings per share year-over-year for Q4 was unfavorable by $0.31. The total impact for the year was a $1.76. From a revenue perspective the impact was a reduction of $35 million for Q4 and $153 million for the fiscal year.","Looking at the balance sheet, in Q4 we had cash provided by operations of a $104.5 million plus capital expenditures of $58.3 million, resulting in $46.2 million of free cash flow. Excluding integration costs of $14.7 million, adjusted free cash flow was $60.9 million. Total debt increased within the quarter by $42.1 million to $1.350 billion primarily due to the acquisition of Reprogenetics and share repurchases, which were offset by operational cash flow generation are partially offset.","Looking at inventories, they increased approximately $13.7 million to $419.7 from last quarter due to an increase in daily lenses. For the quarter, we are seeing 7.5 months on hand, adjusted to exclude inventory and equipment rationalization charges and facility startup costs up from 6.6 months last year and seven adjusted months on hand last year. We\u2019re expecting this to trend down over 2016. Day sales outstanding was at 57 days which is up from 55 days in the prior quarter, up from 53 days last year. We\u2019re also expecting DSO to trend down to more customary levels over 2016.","Now, turning to guidance. In order to provide a little more color for your models, I will share some specifics on fiscal 2016 and Q1 2016 non-GAAP guidance. We will continue to incur some Sauflon integration cost as we wrap up the integration work. But it will be much smaller than 2015 and mostly in cost of goods sold after Q1. Regarding foreign exchange, the rates for our main currencies are 1.05 for the euro, 123 for the yen, 1.5 for the pound. With these current rates, we\u2019re expecting a negative year-over-year impact to revenue of approximately $58 million and an unfavorable $0.58 impact on 2016 earnings per share.","When looking at the euro, yen and pound, these currencies makeup approximately 75% of our total foreign denominator revenue, which equates to about 40% of our total worldwide revenue. These currencies have an estimated $0.35 impact in 2016 EPS. The remaining currencies have weakened considerably year-over-year and now comprise approximately $0.23 of the negative impact in 2016. ","For 2016 guidance, the revenue range for the company is $1.834 billion to $1.874 billion, or approximately 4% to 7% pro forma growth. CooperVision\u2019s revenue range is $1.509 billion to $1.539 billion, or 5% to 7% constant currency growth. CooperSurgical\u2019s revenue range is $325 million to $335 million, or 1% to 4% pro forma growth. We expect non-GAAP gross margins to be around 64% with Q1 being a little later aggressively improving over the year. OpEx is expected to be around 40%. Operating margin is expected to be around 24%. Interest expense is expected to be around $21 million. ","Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 9%. This is higher than 2015, which benefited from some higher discrete releases and integration charges more than we would be experiencing in 2016. Our expected share count would be around 49.2 million shares. Our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range is $7.60 to $7.90, which equates to pro forma earnings per share of 10% to 14% growth. CapEx expected to be around $200 million, adjusted free cash flow is expected to be around $300 million. ","For Q1 2016 guidance, couple of points, the revenue range for the company is $435 million to $447 million or 2% to 5% pro forma growth. CooperVision's revenue range is $356 million to $366 million or 3% to 5% constant currency growth. CooperSurgical revenue range is $79 million to $81 million or 1% to 3% pro forma growth. Non-GAAP earnings per share range is $1.52 to $1.62 or 0% to 5% pro forma growth.","With that let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session.","Kim Duncan","Operator, we\u2019re ready to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Larry Keusch","Thanks. So, Bob, the 5% to 7% growth for CVI for fiscal 2016 maybe you could talk a little bit about how you think that will compare relative to the market growth. And it would seem to me that that would actually be less than you guys have done in the past again relative to the market. So maybe talk about in that answer just sort of the dynamics that you see within your business.","Bob Weiss","So, Larry, you're correct, it's less than we have guided particularly in 2015 and earlier in terms of a multiple. We're estimating the market will be 4% to 6%. So if one were to take the midpoint at five and then compare that to the midpoint of the CooperVision at six that would kind of frame it. In 2015, with a little bit of hindsight we were guiding closer to 3X the market. And the rationale for that was that the prior year we had grown at 2X the market we were bringing on clariti and the Sauflon acquisition and on a pro forma basis expected to accelerate growth. We did put up good numbers that on a quarterly basis, calendar year basis 8% two times the market, but to answer your question, we\u2019re \u2013 you can compare the 6% midpoint to the 5% midpoint as we look ahead to 2016.","Larry Keusch","And just any thoughts around single-use silicone hydrogels. How do you think about that for 2016?","Bob Weiss ","Well, clearly the silicone hydrogel single-use market is exploding within the 1 Day market. The 1 Day market continues to drive the entire market growth. Once again, this year this would be I think at least for last four years in a row, the 1 Day market was the driver of the market. Having said that, there is as we know increasing activity in the space with J&J now introducing an Oasys one day silicone hydrogel lens more targeted to the premium space.","So we continue to expect the expansion of the premium space, we also continue to expect that there will be swapping out of a hydrogel for silicone hydrogel most notably clariti going against Moist and Daily AquaComfort Plus. So that mass market hydrogel space we view clariti is still primed to make good headway there. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Chris Pasquale","Yes, thanks. I just want to follow-up on the FY 2016 guidance and the 6% midpoint there for CVI and it seems like you\u2019ve got a few things working in your favor as we go in to FY 2016. I understand you are coming off of a tough couple of quarters here, but you'll have a full year of clariti fully rolled out in the U.S., you are going to have a growing contribution from MyDay in the U.S. and now at least the partial year of MyDay in Japan. ","So it seems like this actually sets up as an above trend year, you guys are not looking at it that way. Can you help us sort of reconcile that beyond the European distributor issues in 1Q? Are there other things that you view as sort of headwinds?","Bob Weiss ","We have come off of a quarter with 7% and our fiscal quarter and obviously, there was a fair amount of things going our way. Then, we also were really taken back by October, which relative to how we were trending in August and then into September was noteworthy to us. So are we being \u2013 are we approaching it a little differently, perhaps, we\u2019re making the statements that we will continue to gain market share or we gain more than we\u2019re kind of laying out in this map, who knows. But if you look at our track record on revenue in 2015, we have four misses in four quarters. So we just don\u2019t think it\u2019s prudent to be as bullish or whatever term you want to use in our forecasting in 2016.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital. Your line is open.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you and good evening. You listed that there are three forces that negatively impacted the quarter and it's rolling into your guidance next year. And is there any way to quantify how much each one of those hit you?","Bob Weiss","We\u2019re not going to get into quantifying those forces but in some cases it would be too speculative. But in terms of looking at 2016 Q1, we mentioned that part and parcel because of the disruption or because of disruption that occurred in Europe we are making some concessions and we clearly now can get into putting much color on that other than to say it's a direct hit on revenue. So that will have the impact of suppressing our underlying growth somewhat. And we will not be calling that out in the sense of traditional call out up since it is impacting the revenue line.","So that is one factor that will impact top line growth albeit kind of one time from our perspective meaning going forward. We expect to have more robust delivery. We\u2019re at the point now, we are delivering in Europe. So, on a go forward basis, we feel pretty good about that. But it's still a roll into the first quarter. ","The other things we talked about lens care, which had a pretty big impact in Europe on the quarter. And we expect that to moderate the overall industry, we do think we will be artificially inflated in 2016 with J&J having easy comps and really the one, the UPP story if you will.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Mishan with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Matt Mishan","Great, thank you for taking my questions. I got two, I wanted to squeeze two in here if I could. First, I guess I just wanted to try and understand a little bit, you cited that the competition is one of the reasons why the daily silicone hydrogels kind of fell off in at the end of the quarter. But you also said that MyDay was selling everything it could, which means it was particularly weak I guess in clariti and given that J&J Oasys is in the premium space versus clariti in the mass market space, if you were surprised that you saw that weakness as a result of that. And then the second question is I\u2019m just trying to get a sense with Sauflon, there was three pieces to it when you bought it, I think it was a $190 million sales and about $80 million of that was the clariti piece. What\u2019s left of the other $110 million like what have you rationalized over the course of last year?","Bob Weiss","Well, obviously when we \u2013 to take your last question or comment. Of that $195 million, $200 million business that we bought, clearly the one that is captivating the growth is clariti. And clariti relative to this last quarter, while it missed our target still a combination of clariti and MyDay grew 48%. So that silicone hydrogel space, 48% constant currency is good. It obviously isn\u2019t as good as we cited and quite frankly, we didn\u2019t anticipate October going soft in the U.S. and a lot of that softness is a reflection of all the energies at J&J put into the marketplace literally flooding the marketplace.","And that Stymied [ph] I think room for any other competitors to do as much as they normally would. As far as the non-one day clariti piece of that acquisition of Sauflon, yes, clearly lens care is dropping off and dropped off much more than we thought. Part of that was probably self inflicted with the disruption in Europe. And we think we have our distribution and pipeline if you will put back together. A lot of lens care happens in Europe. That\u2019s where it's more strategically tied in with key accounts. And so we will continue to have of that available to those strategic accounts recognizing it\u2019s not a growth area and it\u2019s pretty clear that one day is a direct competitor of the lens care industry.","But I\u2019m not going to get in to much more color on that and we look at that as a package clariti and MyDay is ramping up nice. Yes, it\u2019s true down the road in 2016 we'll have availability of MyDay in Japan also which is a big one day market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Steve Willoughby","Hi good evening and thanks for taking my questions. Bob, I have two for you. First just a follow up question to Larry Keusch's question. And I apologize if you did say this. Within the 5% to 7% CVI growth, how much are you assuming for one day silicone hydrogel revenue in total versus the I believe the $137 million or $139 million, you did this year?","Bob Weiss","I didn't quote it and we\u2019re not going to get ourselves into what we did last year. We started off with a number and then we changed it one time and then finally came in at 136. Our focus is yes, that's going to be a growth area but we\u2019re not going to put up the target we're shooting for.","Steve Willoughby","Okay and then secondly, I know a lot of times in the fourth quarter for companies they will look at potential impairment charges and I was wondering if that consideration has happened at all yet given the Sauflon business seeming to underperform both initial and most recently revised expectations.","Bob Weiss","So relative to Sauflon overall has done exceedingly well from what it\u2019s done for the Company and what it\u2019s done for the bottom line. Were it not for foreign exchange as I pointed out, we had 26% pro forma earnings per share growth. So great on the bottom line we grew 2X the market, great on the top line. It really is more about our \u2013 the targets we set than it was about the performance we delivered. In other words no one would be complaining today if we were to report basically $9.20 in earnings per share this past year, which is what we would have reported, as we had the same rates as we did in 2014. ","No one would be complaining on that front. They\u2019d see the 26%, so we're actually jazzed about everything about the acquisition. It\u2019s done exceedingly well on many fronts and we've frequently talked about just how good the costs are coming down in the production cycle and how good the ramp up is. So from an impairment perspective nothing to talk about but having said that we did take rationalization charges we did make some decisions on which products stay and which products go or which platforms we\u2019re accelerating and which ones we\u2019re decelerating. And clearly, I think in Greg's commentary, was referenced to some of the non-recurring call outs that are part of that integration process we always anticipated.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew OBrien with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Matthew OBrien","Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. Just to follow-up a little bit more, Bob on the Daily side high softness in the quarter, you had as guided to $52 million to $57 million for Q4 midpoint is $55 million, you are $60 million short there. I\u2019m just \u2013 I\u2019m trying to tease out how much of that, what\u2019s the majority shortfall was in the quarter, was it the integration issue which seems transitory, or was it the Americas shortfall with J&J hitting the market. And the reason I ask that is that\u2019s supposed to be a big growth driver for you going forward can daily [indiscernible] grow double-digit teens or even 20% in 2016.","Bob Weiss","Well. I think we\u2019ve put enough color on our outlook for 2016 to say we\u2019re bullish that daily silicon hydrogels are doing well and probably will accelerate more, so than decelerate as a growth driver. And said another way it grew I think 46% this past year, the single use silicone hydrogels over the prior year and 48% this past quarter, so there\u2019s modest acceleration, but clearly not as much as we expected. When it comes to the topline shortfall, I would say it\u2019s a combination of three factors, all of which are about one-third, one-third, one-third\u00b8 roughly.","The U.S. and the discussion about the J&J rollout impacting the marketplace is about one-third, one-third have to deal with silicon hydrogel, I\u2019m sorry with lens care drop off we talked about a substantial drop off 36% in our lens care business in the fourth quarter. And then the third piece was some of the damage are residual fuel in Europe and the integration disruption. Those three are the composite of the $20-ish million drop off versus guidance, so about one-third, one-third, one-third. As far as outlook for silicone hydrogel one day, we\u2019re bullish, but we\u2019re not going to say that the we\u2019re still bullish it\u2019s going to drive our expectation, we\u2019re going to go 3x the market as was the guidance with hindsight that we put up in 2015.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Larry Biegelsen","Hi, guys thanks for taking the question. Bob, on the last call you talked about August getting off to a strong start so can you help us out that the weakness in October, continue into November. And is there any plan to sell the solutions business and I do have a follow up on MyDay, if that's okay. Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Okay, well, you're right. August was a good month and things dropped off in October a lot, particularly in the U.S. and some of the problems we ran into in Europe exacerbated the most. We thought we\u2019re in pretty good shape in early September, found out we weren't in as good shape as we thought by mid-September and had a bumpy ride with our integration if you will in Europe, from mid September until pretty much the end of November.","Having said that, we had what we call a very respectable November that is built into our first quarter guidance, as well as our fiscal year guidance. And the fact that we now have our system back to where it belongs in terms of service to our customers, not that we\u2019ll always be happy where we are, but it's clearly back to where it was when we started the integration in Europe. So we're happy about that. As far as solutions, we spent a good chunk of time last year evaluating our options on the lens care business, would we be a buyer, would we be a seller, what would we do.","And look at our lens care relative to how it ties in with the lens portfolio. And particularly key accounts that\u2019s concluded that we are a holder on it. We're not going to try it; we're certainly not going to invest in a big way. We are going to service our key accounts. And I might add it's a pretty efficient process particularly where you get into those areas in the world where there's a tie-in of lens and lens care and a direct-to-consumer and are number of countries where that is the case. So it's strategic albeit we're still trying to hamper its growth by succeeding in 1 Day. [indiscernible].","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for that. On MyDay, the approval in Japan has obviously a positive development for you guys being the largest daily market in the world I believe. And so I'm trying to understand maybe the product \u2013 the MyDay production capacity as you go through 2016. The gross margin on that. I think you\u2019re supposed to end this year, I think in the mid-to-high teens, if I\u2019m not mistaken. So where do you expect to be as a margins for MyDay. Can you give us an update on the production capacity and I assume that\u2019s the reason you are just not launching right away in such a big market. Thanks for taking the questions.","Bob Weiss","Yes. MyDay is ramping up very nicely. I think I might have missed on the last call that we doubled our capacity between from six months earlier. So there is a nice ramp up and that ramp up translates to cost of goods coming down. So there is good improvement on gross margins, albeit we still have a long way to go and we have a lot of startup lines and any time we get into a startup line kind of take a step back with the startup cost.","And by the way that is a continual \u2013 continuous drag on some of our gross margins, as we add new lines as opposed to cutting it off where we are. We do step back and put a little drag on our MyDay gross margin and our overall gross margin. It\u2019s just the way it is for now. But net - net we\u2019re happy with the progress we\u2019ve made on improving yields, yields obviously mean as you improve yields, it\u2019s a 100% gross margin on that improvement, because if you\u2019re getting 20% or 30% more units of the same line. It costs you just as much instead of throwing them in the garbage can, you\u2019re getting to keep them. ","So that\u2019s a very positive direction and adds to the throughput as well as bringing the cost down. But having said that, we are still capacity constrained and therefore, how and when we will approach. Japan is still to be determined in our mind in terms of sharpening the pencil and where we are going to go and how we\u2019re going to go. And we are not going to get a lot more granular on our overall strategy with it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Your line is open.","Brian Weinstein","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ve heard you talk a lot about kind of what growth rates and what they are going to look like next year, but I\u2019m still not totally sure about how you guys strategically are prepared to respond to the tougher competitive market with J&J flooding the marketplace. What are the steps that you guys can proactively take or how does your strategy change to respond to what J&J is doing in the marketplace? ","Bob Weiss","Well. In some respects they\u2019re helping us. I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s all bad news. Where J&J is coming into with Oasys one day, which again is silicone hydrogel lens going after primarily total launch they are trying to keep a wall between Oasys one day and Moist because they have too much to lose. So there are two separate markets. It's true that Oasys one day is in the same part as it is MyDay, but in the area MyDay we like our product, we think it can go ahead with total one, which is an excellent product. And so now there are three lenses fighting that battle there, we are still capacity constrained. So it will be a while before we're butting heads against what do we sell the next product we make we're not near that point at this juncture.","Obviously have the alternative of go to Japan, with MyDay figures and will go to the U.S. although it\u2019s kind of trade-offs. Relative to the other half of the part in the one day space for the big part of the market called the mass market. That is still moist and moist is what clariti is about the one thing that clariti has in the one day space and it's the only one that has half of it is a one day silicone hydrogel, toric, sphere, and multifocal. Well it's the only show in town and there \u2013 and we have an immensely favorable cost structure. So we're feeling real good about our ability to address the mass market. In the one day space with the silicone hydrogel products, you already know in the FRP market, the frequent replacement market, the two week market and the monthly market is 78% silicone hydrogel.","Doctors suffered for 10 years from Johnson & Johnson, from Alpine, and from Bausch & Lomb how important our position, how important silicone hydrogel is. That story hasn't gone away. Nothing has changed, doctors just don't forget that oxygen is important because they are selling a one day lens. The fact of the matter is one day lens is worn for X. amount hours I\u2019d say 14 hours. A 30 day lens or a two week lens is what is worn for the same length of time. So there's no distinction whatsoever, between the importance of oxygen in the one day market or the two week market or the month end market. That may not be understood by many. But the doctors and the healthcare professionals get it and understand it.","Operator","Thank you our next question comes from the line Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Anthony Petrone","Great, thanks for taking the questions. A couple just on the overall U.S. [indiscernible] in the quarter and I guess specifically around multifocals and that was also lighter than expected. So with J&J\u2019s push is there sort of the halo effect beyond dailies into other modalities. That would be the first question. And the second question is just on the slower rollout of clariti and MyDay and totality. Does that have an impact on the 2016 operating margin outlook of 26% just given that those two are operating margin accretive. Thanks.","Bob Weiss","First of all, I think you said operating margin of 26%. I\u2019m looking at Greg right now.","Anthony Petrone","By fiscal 2018.","Bob Weiss","So 2018, I\u2019m sorry.","Anthony Petrone","The longer-term outlook.","Bob Weiss","Okay, got it, got it. In my commentary I mentioned that we\u2019ve up to 26% to 27%, but that\u2019s five years out, 2020.","Anthony Petrone","Okay.","Bob Weiss","So we\u2019re still directionally headed where we are headed on that front. Was there a halo effect with the J&J strategy? Absolutely. There was considerable tie in their marketing approach. And let\u2019s call it arm twisting on the marketing approach that clearly has some halo effect on some of their other products.","So it was not only the pipeline sale in the one day silicone hydrogel space that was the event, but there was some pull even in the two week space, which is the space that is declining in total. As far as MyDay and clariti and that rollout, no, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything one way or the other that needs in terms of directionally our operating performance targets. ","multifocal \u2013 I\u2019m sorry operator. Multifocals just to comment on that we had a reasonably good quarter on multifocal at 7% or 8%, I think it was and while it\u2019s true that, that growth would have been better had we had a more robust U.S. and a more or less of disruption than we had in Europe, it would have resulted in better numbers in that area also. Go ahead, Operator. ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff Johnson","Hi, thanks guys. Good evening. Just couple of questions here for me. One, just Bob on the European integration issues, can you give us a little color there just kind of, I guess my sense would be Sauflon relatively small compared to your bigger operations. What is that that can trip you up so much that lasts a month and a half and shaves maybe seven days million in revenue often. And any color on the concessions that, I know you don't want to quantify and I'm not asking you to quantify and but why are you happened to give some revenue back to the customers themselves. What's that \u2013 what form is that taking?","Bob Weiss","Yes, plain and simple, if you integrate your products with key accounts and you're used to getting the product on time and particularly if it's direct-to-consumer and I'm talking about big change, the change in Europe or big part of what Europe is about. And all of a sudden you throw on that back order, and backlog it's not a pretty situation. So in some cases it directly interfaces with their customers. So rest assured we were fully appreciative to what the disruption meant to their franchise in their business. And took every step humanly possible to an including [indiscernible] as we could at it to fix it as soon as we could.","Part of the complexity is when you shutdown bunch of locations that are throughout Europe in different countries put them in one country, you obviously put a burden on yourself to be able, let's say it we a Germany for example, and I shutdown Germany and integrate it to Belgium. And then I can't go to the customer and say I can get it to you two days later now because I did some for my benefit. So all that activity doesn't matter if it's the CooperVision products or the Sauflon products quite frankly they don\u2019t care, back orders to back order, the concessions are basically a reflection on dialogue with some of those customers as you go through how to reasonably address the wounds.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.","Jon Block","Great, thanks guys. I'm going trying to slip in 1.5. I guess, just to start with the EPS guidance. You put out some parameters on EPS of low to mid-teen 2016 EPS growth last quarter. Now you look at it as sort of low to maybe mid single-digit growth, I get it, I mean FX hasn\u2019t incremental headwind I\u2019ve got maybe $0.35 to $0.40 but not the $0.80 that it implies. So Greg or Bob can you talk about what got so much worse on the operations relative to three months ago. And then the second question and has been a bunch of questions on market share, but you are guiding CVI of six, market of five so it implies call at 1.2x. In the past you\u2019ve been around maybe 1.8x, just importantly Bob when you look at your portfolio of lenses is this a new normal 1.2 or when you look out should the share gains accelerate as you get through some of these issues in 2017 and beyond. Thank you.","Bob Weiss","First on the EPS guidance is the low-to-mid teens going to the 10 to 14. So we are still saying low single \u2013 low-double digit to teens in the 10 to 14. With respect I think you\u2019re saying your model does not get to the $0.58 in foreign exchange or rest assured and Greg could add to it here that $0.58 is what the implications are of the currencies moving forward from 2015 to where we are today on those exchange rates. Not only the pound, the yen, and the euro, but also the other currencies that Greg alluded to. ","From a market share perspective, yes, you\u2019re right, Historically, we\u2019ve grown more like 2x the market the last five, six years, seven years. And we\u2019re moving the guidance if you will from 2x the market in 2015, fiscal year 2015 to 1.25. A little of that is the concessions not much. ","A little of that is some of the disruption that is now occurring surrounding the J&J rollout in the U.S., a little of that is the disruption in the European either with the integration. And in fact of the matter is if we removed all those with the 1.25 guidance go way up from there. No, we probably still be guiding to 5 to 7 for us and 4 to 6 of the marketplace. Not because anything has changed and I think you heard me mention that, it could be that the market is at the higher end of that given the easy comps with competitors like J&J. But in fact that they have easy comps only means the market is a little bit more robust perhaps than it is underlying that and it doesn\u2019t change what we should get independent of that. ","Operator","Thank you. That concludes the Q&A session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Bob Weiss for closing remarks.","Bob Weiss","Well, I want to thank you everyone for joining us today. Obviously, I wish I had a lot more stellar things to say about this last quarter. But all of just reiterate we think we did a lot of things in the integration right, very optimistic about our way forward for not only 2016, but many years to come we think we have the right products and the right strategy. And we respect the competition not to diminish the work they\u2019re doing. So we look forward to updating you, I believe March 3 is our next update and we're looking forward to it. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect.

Another solid quarter, we march on: top line growth of 9%, GAAP earnings per share of $1.79, up 32% versus the prior year; non-GAAP earnings per share, $1.74, is up $0.29 or 20%; and free cash flow of $64.5 million means our trailing-12-month free cash flow was $245 million.","Some highlights and key events. Our silicone hydrogel family of soft contact lenses continues to show strong growth with worldwide sales up 22% in constant currency, now accounting for 43% of CooperVision revenues. Additionally, I'm proud to announce that just this week, we have officially launched our branded daily silicone hydrogel lens, MyDay, in Europe. Demand is very strong for this lens, and we're very optimistic about the future. We also continue to see a lot of success in our entire silicone hydrogel family of products with Biofinity and Avaira. The combination of these products should continue our momentum for years to come.","With the most recent calendar quarter, we grew 2x the market, which grew 4%. We achieved 23% operating income and even exceeded 20% in net income as a percent of revenues. We are very pleased with our IVF or fertility growth, which was 180%, and adjusting for acquisition comparability, grew 20% over the prior year comparable period. Our free cash flow delivery resulted in our debt-to-cap now moving to single digits. We have a very strong balance sheet, as well as a strong free cash flow.","On the revenue results, during the third quarter, our silicone hydrogel family continued to drive our top line and our bottom line. Silicone hydrogel revenues were $143 million, the halo effect of Biofinity Toric in Japan continues. In Japan, Biofinity constant currency sales are up over 100% versus the prior year. The halo effect of Avaira Toric is contributing to solid growth of the Avaira 2-week family.","As previously mentioned, we have launched MyDay, our branded single-use silicone into Europe this month. We expect this newest addition to our silicone hydrogel portfolio of soft contact lenses to help continue our silicone hydrogel revenue growth momentum for many years to come.","I'm extremely happy to say that we believe we, once again this calendar quarter ended June 30, gained share across the board. All regions, all modalities, all lens types, sphere, torics and multifocal in both materials, silicone hydrogel and non-silicone hydrogel. This demonstrates the breadth of our reach and the product portfolio.","Geographically, foreign exchange headwinds continue to reduce CooperVision revenues, down 4% in the quarter. Excluding foreign exchange, CVI constant currency growth was 9%. Last year, it was the euro and this year, it's the yen which is down 25% versus the third quarter of 2012. It was over $200 million of revenue in Japan. This is not only impacting our revenue, but is also negatively impacting our gross margin, as well as our operating income and bottom line, I might add. But even with this major nuisance on the strength of our product lines, we are putting up some solid numbers. From a revenue perspective regionally, we have put up solid constant currency growth in all locations: Americas up 9%; EMEA or Europe, 8%; Asia-Pac, 8%; and worldwide, 9%. Our growth drivers in the Americas: trading up Biofinity, including the halo effect of Biofinity multifocal with the entire family doing well. Also, while off a much smaller base, Proclear 1 Day and the Avaira Toric and family are a significant contributor.","In Europe right now, currency is helping off at some of the yen. Driving our 8% constant currency growth in this region is the entire Biofinity family and 1 Day, including single-use silicone hydrogel.","In Asia-Pac, while foreign exchange took its toll on revenue, our constant currency revenue is up 8%. Drivers include tremendous success of the Biofinity family, especially with the halo effect of Biofinity Toric and Proclear 1 Day.","The worldwide soft contact lens market in the second quarter -- calendar quarter was up 4% in constant currency, while CooperVision was up 10%. For the trailing 12 months ended June 30, the soft contact lens market, now $7.2 billion worldwide, was up 4% in constant currency. CooperVision was up 11% on the strength of Biofinity, Proclear 1 Day and Avaira.","For the calendar quarter, the market was up, growth was sponsored by 1 Day. While industry data is no longer available for silicone hydrogel material, most likely, this trade-up material remains a solid growth material. CooperVision was up 22% in constant currency in fiscal third quarter of 2013, and CooperVision silicone hydrogel now is 43% of our revenues. Soft contact lens market continues to be a trade-up market. This includes the premium products: silicone hydrogel lenses; torics and multifocals; and trade-up of a 1 Day disposable expands patient revenues by 400% to 600%. Even more important, the 1 Day wearer generates 300% to 500% more profit. Also, it is important to understand that torics and multifocals have a long way to go in capturing the market opportunity, especially outside the United States. Geographically, growth is reasonably balanced with the Americas and Europe up 4%, and Asia-Pac up 5% in the calendar quarter, second quarter. Drivers continue as 1 Days in silicone hydrogel trade-up. Also, we believe torics and multifocals continue to expand faster, off of a lower base outside the United States.","CooperSurgical, our women's health care franchise, turned in $81.5 million in revenue, up 27% versus the prior year's third quarter on the strength of a $27 million contribution from our IVF business or fertility business, which now accounts for 1\/3 of CooperSurgical revenues. Revenue growth of our fertility business was up 180%. And adjusting for acquisition comparability, the IVF product growth was 20% over the prior year's comparable period. And we're pleased to see our office and surgical procedures product lines achieve a breakeven following last quarter's declines. This reflects some returning momentum in the surgical procedure area in spite of continued softness with our closure device. And remember, we are in a transition mode with this product of Carter-Thomason CloseSure device as we roll out an upgrade of the product. This, in essence, results in lost revenues during a trial period -- trialing period. We continue working through this rollout and remain optimistic we'll see improvements over time. Adjusting for acquisition comparability, including the 20% for fertility, CooperSurgical growth was 6% above the prior year.","In terms of guidance, we have taken our non-GAAP earnings per share range and have again taken up our bottom line end of our guidance range for revenue for fiscal year 2013. This results from the strength of our third quarter results, the bottom line brought about by solid top-line moderating foreign exchange movement, a 23% operating income margin and the third quarter and favorable tax movement. The favorable tax movement includes the effects of geographic mix, tax rate reduction, specifically in the U.K., and the effects of some positive discrete tax items. The yen took its toll with about a $13 million hit on revenue due to a 25% decline in the yen versus the prior year. In spite of this, we overcame it and its effects with our positive top line performance and the strength of our gross profit percent in prior year's comparable -- versus prior year's comparable periods. Our new guidance for non-GAAP earnings per share for the fiscal year is $6.23 to $6.28 versus our prior guidance of $6.15 to $6.25. This reflects the ongoing strength of our product portfolio, including Biofinity and the Proclear 1 Day, as well as the lower effective tax rate for this fiscal year. Importantly, in spite of increasing our guidance, we continue to invest in geographic expansion and R&D, with emphasis on D or product development. This D is what has accelerated our rollout of new products, like MyDay, our new branded 1 Day silicone hydrogel. This branded product is now launching in Europe this month.","Regarding free cash flow guidance, we're increasing our free cash flow range to $180 million to $210 million, while reducing our CapEx to $180 million to $210 million. This mainly reflects the timing of CapEx or capital expenditure payments as we continue to aggressively manage our free cash flow.","As a general comment on capital expenditures, our production plans remain on schedule. And I am pleased to say our manufacturing for MyDay and other products is meeting or beating our internal expectations. I might add one other thing, we are pleased with our -- how we're progressing with fiscal year 2013 and how it's shaping up, and are anticipating low double-digit earnings per share growth again next fiscal year.","On strategy, we are continuing with our successful strategy, which I have frequently articulated in the past. We believe it is solid and it has delivered results. CooperSurgical is putting up solid results and is leveraging its infrastructure. This franchise was built with the solid understanding of the value of critical mass in the women's health care market, targeting the OB\/GYNs. We follow the professional wherever they go, be it the office, the surgicenter, hospital or IVF centers. Although the call points are different for each, the leverage is considerable. CooperSurgical's third quarter gross profit percent was 64%, its operating margin was 20% and due to minimal capital requirements, CooperSurgical is a significant contributor to our free cash flow. We are dedicated to the strategy and will continue tuck-in acquisitions to leverage the CooperSurgical structure and products.","At CooperVision, the strategy is more complex and is much more global in nature. The $7.2 billion soft contact lens industry, because of the uniqueness of our manufacturing platforms and product portfolio, we are the only participant that aggressively promotes silicone hydrogel and non-silicone hydrogel, that is the Proclear family. We emphasize branded and non-branded products. Note private label does not mean lower operating margins. We actively promote and specialize in custom lenses with a high gross profit, I might add. We support all modalities that the eye care professional prescribed for 1 Day, 2-week, as well as monthly lenses. And we support all type of lenses, spheres, torics and multifocals. With approximately 30% share in the high-growth specialty lens categories, torics and multifocals, it is acknowledged by eye care professionals that we're pretty good at specialty contact lenses. Few eye care professionals would challenge why the success of Biofinity Toric for astigmatism put a great design together with a great material and great things can happen. We happen -- we have seen similar successes for this same reason with Biofinity Multifocal, which shipped to market in the middle of calendar year 2011.","On the capacity front, with the possible exception of Avaira Toric, we are ahead of plan to deliver considerably more product where we had previously been supply-constrained. The Biofinity family, Proclear 1 Day are all in good capacity shape. Our newest challenge will be to ramp up 1 Day silicone hydrogel as we -- as it is yet a niche market.","On pricing, like the rest of the soft contact lens industry, we have a trade-up strategy. Our new wearers and existing wearers are targeted for silicone hydrogel lenses, the Proclear family and the 1 Day or our single-use lenses. Each creates more revenue per patient. A 1 Day modality, for example, results in 4x to 6x more revenue per patient. While this strategy sacrifices the gross profit margin, it generally creates 3 to 5x more profit per wearer. Of course, the strategy competes head on with the lens care space since we are shifting the wearers' resources from lens care to contact lenses only. Competing for lens care dollars is more of a problem for some of our competitors. In my opinion, we continue to be one of the most focused company in the industry lacking many distractions that some of our competitors are going through. I might add, with Biofinity, Avaira and Proclear, we have a lot to talk about with eye care professionals around the globe.","As we look down the road over the next several years, we expect to continue improving operating margins and de-leveraging -- or delivering above-average shareholder returns. We expect to continue to average double-digit earnings per share growth while investing in geographic expansion and new product development. In today's market, we have a solid product portfolio to leverage in all modality, multiple materials, all lens types and we retain our expertise to emphasize customizing lenses for the 10% to 20% of those lens wearers requiring other than standard lens sizes and\/or designs. We have a lot of work to do before we come anywhere close to having exploited our #1 contact lens family, Biofinity. This is particularly true when it comes to geographic expansion and fully developing the Biofinity family of Torics and Multifocals around the world. The same applies to Avaira, where the Avaira Sphere was anxiously awaiting the relaunch of Avaira Toric. This combination has now put us in a much better position to exploit the U.S. 2 week space owned by Johnson & Johnson and to also exploit our private label strategy more aggressively with this family. While we already have pretty respectable gross profit and operating margins, from a cost perspective, we have considerable upside yet to be fully developed. Upsides include the complete elimination of silicone hydrogel royalty, with the expiration of patents in September 2014 in the United States and in March 2016 in the rest of the world. The reduction of our manufacturing cost by, among other things, improving molding cycle times, increasing capacity utilization and improving yields in general. Each of these are key goals for us. As previously mentioned, our expansion plans include: a low-cost labor location in Costa Rica that is now being built. This is a multi-year project that will further help us minimize costs or manage our costs.","Also, given the considerable amount of free cash flow we generate, we will continue to look for tuck-in acquisitions and geographic expansion opportunities like Origio in our 2 businesses. The key requirement, however, is that each acquisition must exceed our minimum investment hurdle rates. Each must achieve, over time, a hurdle rate that exceeds 10%. Additionally, the markets for both women's health care and soft contact lenses are much less developed outside the United States and we generate a considerable amount of cash offshore due in part to our level of manufacturing outside the United States. And as such, we will continue to be -- to aggressively invest in global expansion opportunities. With over 95% of the people on the planet outside the United States, we believe we will find opportunities to invest in other countries for decades to come, thereby sustaining our low effective tax rate indefinitely. And finally, we again this year demonstrated we are opportunistic when it comes to buying back our stock in order to enhance total shareholder return.","In summary, before I turn it over to Greg, let me say how pleased I remain with our ongoing progress on many fronts. We continue to outperform the marketplace, most recently growing 2 to 3x the market rate of growth. Our top line growth in a so-so economy, a low inflationary economy remains solid, and I am very pleased at our upper single-digit organic constant currency growth at CooperVision during the quarter.","Our family of products, Biofinity, Avaira, Proclear 1 Day and now 1 Day silicone hydrogel, MyDay, as well as women's health care, our global fertility products are all promising growth going forward. We continue to execute well and invest in geographic expansion in a new product pipeline. While we are still very early in our expansion programs in each of the BRIC countries and there are challenges in each, I am very pleased with our progress to date. Our women's health care franchise has now become more global with the Origio acquisition made 1 year ago. Our balance sheet is very strong. Our debt-to-cap, which was near 40% only a few years ago is now single digit at 9%. We remain keenly focused on delivering consistently improving results, mindful of our desire to invest and leverage prudently, thereby delivering a respectable total shareholder return. Lastly, as always, a reminder that at Cooper, our #1 asset is our employees. To them, a big thank you for consistently delivering great results. And now, I'll turn it to -- over to Greg to cover more financial highlights.","Gregory W. Matz","Thanks, Bob. And good afternoon, everyone. As Bob shared with you a pretty thorough review of the market and our revenue picture, let me start with gross margins. Looking at gross margins in Q3, the consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 65.1% compared with 63.5% for GAAP and non-GAAP in Q3 last year. We continue to see strong headwinds due to the impact of foreign exchange, predominantly the yen, on our revenue and the related direct impact on gross margins, which had approximately a 90-basis-point impact year-over-year.","In addition, we continue to experience a negative mix impact due to Origio, which we purchased in July 2012. Despite these headwinds, we continue to run favorable margins due to a reduced CIBA royalty strong product mix led by Biofinity and increased manufacturing efficiencies. Looking sequentially, we saw our gross margin drop from a high of 66.2% to 65.1%. This is primarily attributable to our normal seasonality of manufacturing variances, including the impact of the December plant shutdown as that inventory turns, as well as FX. We saw the continued degradation of the yen, which add a 30-basis-point impact. For Q4, we're looking for gross margins to be in the range of 65.5% to 66%.","CooperVision, on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, reported a gross margin of 65.4% versus 62.8% for GAAP and non-GAAP in Q3 last year. Factors driving the year-over-year gross margin improvement were the reduction of our royalty expense, product mix and manufacturing efficiencies. The major headwind on gross margin was FX, largely the weakening of the yen.","CooperSurgical had a GAAP and a non-GAAP gross margin of 64.1%, which compares to Q3 '12 of 67.1%. As previously discussed, our margin is primarily attributable to our acquisition of Origio in July of 2012.","Now looking at operating expenses. In the quarter on a GAAP basis, SG&A expenses increased by 6% from Q3 last year to $152.1 million, and were 37% of revenue versus 38% of revenue in the prior year. Part of this increase reflects CooperVision's continued investments in geographic expansion. Also remember that we acquired Origio in July 2012 and our current quarter has 3 months of expenses versus the 1 month in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis SG&A grew 9% year-over-year. The difference is GAAP SG&A for Q3 '12 included $4 million of Origio deal costs, which was excluded to get to non-GAAP last year. SG&A was up 1% sequentially. As we discussed in the past, CooperSurgical was impacted by the medical device excise tax. And we had about 700k of medical device excise tax in the quarter that hit SG&A, we expect about $2.4 million in 2013.","R&D expenses. As we look at R&D in Q3, R&D increased by approximately 13% year-over-year to $14.9 million, or up about $1.7 million. R&D was 3.6% of revenue, up from 3.5% in Q3 '12 and down from 3.8% sequentially. As we discussed in the prior quarter, we would expect that R&D will continue to grow slightly faster than sales in fiscal 2013.","Depreciation, amortization. In Q3, depreciation was $23.4 million, up $1.5 million or 7% year-over-year; and amortization was $7.7 million, up $1.8 million or 31% year-over-year, for a total of $31.1 million. Origio amortization for the quarter was approximately $2.1 million.","Moving to operating margins. For Q3, consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating income and margins were $93.6 million, or 22.7% of revenue, versus $77.3 and 20.4% of revenue for GAAP, and $81.3 million and 21.5% for non-GAAP in Q3 '12. This represents a 21% increase in operating income over Q3 '12 GAAP numbers and a 15% increase over non-GAAP. The increase in GAAP operating margins is due to a combination of improved gross margin and the elimination of the 2012 Origio deal cost and GAAP operating expenses.","Interest expense was $2.3 million for the quarter, down 2% year-over-year. Looking at the effective tax rate, in Q3, the GAAP and the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 2.3% and 5%, respectively, versus Q2 -- I'm sorry, Q3 '12 GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate of 6.2% and 6.1%, respectively. As we discussed before and as Bob mentioned, the effective tax rate continues to be below the U.S. statutory rate as a majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates.","In Q3, the single biggest factor impacting our effective tax rate was the drop in U.K. statutory rates from 23% to 20%, which was enacted in July. This had a favorable quarterly impacts of about 230 basis points, so our 5% non-GAAP rate would have been 7.3% without this. We now expect the full year GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 5.5% to 7%, and the non-GAAP effective tax range to be in the range of 7% to 8%. This will result in an estimated Q4 non-GAAP rate of 9.5% to 10.5%. When thinking about these ranges in our future effective tax rate, remember, there were some nonrecurring items so far this year, including the U.K. statutory rate reduction impact and our deferred tax liabilities I just mentioned, the favorable settlement of a foreign tax authority audit we mentioned in Q2 and the multiple years of R&D tax credit, which was renewed in Q1. These will amount to roughly 200-basis-point reduction effective tax rate this year.","Another driver in the lower effective tax rate is the reduction of the CIBA royalty, which increased offshore profits, and which we will continue to see going forward.","Earnings per share. Our Q3 earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis were $1.79 and $1.74, respectively, versus $1.36 and $1.45 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in Q3 '12. Our earnings per share is up 32% and 20% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively, versus the prior year.","Touching on share repurchase. There was no share repurchase activity in Q3. There still remains $184.5 million available under this program. Regarding foreign exchange, currency continues to have a big impact on our business from a year-over-year perspective, and even some continued negativity since we gave guidance on our Q2 earnings call. From a year-over-year perspective, currency negatively impacted us by $0.17 and this was mainly driven by the yen, which was down 25% year-over-year. From our Q2 earnings call when we last gave guidance, currency negatively impacted Q3 EPS by $0.02 and is projected to negatively impact Q4 by an additional $0.02. As we look at the fourth quarter, we continue to see a significant negative impact on a year-over-year basis of around $0.16. This does include some favorable impact of seeing some of our lower cost pound inventory flow through the P&L in Q4. Regarding our Q4 guidance, we used roughly today's rates of euro being 1.32 and the yen at 100.","Looking at the balance sheet and liquidity, in Q3, we had cash provided by operations of $103.1 million, capital expenditures of $38.6 million, resulting in $64.5 million of free cash flow. Inventories were basically flat at $340 million from last quarter. For the quarter, we're seeing months on hand at 7.1 months, up from months on hand to 6.6 months last year, and down from 7.8 months last quarter. AR continues to be well managed with DSOs at 53 days, up slightly from 52 days last year but down from 54 days at the end of last quarter.","Before I turn it back to Kim, I wanted to touch on guidance for Q4. And Bob mentioned some of this, but just to reiterate it, total company revenue for Q4 is expected in the range of $410 million to $425 million for a year-over-year growth rate of 4% to 8%. We expect CooperVision's Q4 revenue to be in the range of $330 million to $340 million or a year-over-year growth rate of 4% to 7%. This equates to a constant currency growth rate for CooperVision of 8% to 11%. We expect CooperSurgical's revenue in the range of $80 million to $85 million with a year-over-year growth rate of 3% to 9%. We expect non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 to be in the range of 65.5% to 66%. Non-GAAP OpEx to be around 41.5%, non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%. As I mentioned earlier, we expect the Q4 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 9.5% to 10.5%. Our Q4 GAAP earnings per share is estimated in the range of $1.76 to $1.81 and excludes the impact of the potential Aime transaction. Our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share is also estimated in the range of $1.76 to $1.81. This being based on a diluted share count of 49.9 million shares. Finally, we expect capital expenditures for the year of $180 million to $210 million and free cash flow of $180 million to $210 million. With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session.","Kim Duncan","Operator, we're ready to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Kim Gailun, JPMorgan.","Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So just 2 quick ones, the first is on gross margin. And as we look at it sequentially in the quarter, you were down just over 100 basis points and gave a lot of detail in the call, so thanks for that. And I think essentially, what you're saying was FX sequentially was about 30 bps worse. And most of the rest of that was manufacturing variances. So just hoping you could clarify that, was there any mix impact sequentially? And then the follow-up is just with the lower tax that we're seeing this year and how we should be thinking about earnings growth for next year. You had a bunch of different moving parts in the tax rate this year, and how we should think about that number as we get into '14?","Robert S. Weiss","Great. Yes, thanks. On the gross margin, I think you nailed it. We basically had that the yen go against this a little bit from our last guidance. So from a sequential standpoint, we did see about a 30-basis-point impact. And we do have, if you look back and I just have data for the last 5 or 6 years in front of me, and you can see that Q3 is always kind of our lowest gross margin quarter. We see that dip, it's normal. We have a number of manufacturing variances that come through, including we have traditionally shut down our plants in December in order to do some maintenance and get it prepared for the year, and that flows through naturally in the Q3 timeframe. On the tax side, we have had a lot of kind of one time items pop up this year. We're not in a position where we want to give guidance for next year. I did want to highlight that there are some things that are one time in nature, and that's kind of why I brought that out. On the other side, I did mention but you have a certain amount number of discrete items that reversed occasionally each year, and the size of those items are really -- we don't know those in advance, and so that has an impact that can actually raise the rates. So at this point, we're not going to go through and give yearly guidance for 2014 on the tax rate.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to focus on MyDay, if I could. So obviously, you just launched the product. Bob, you mentioned that demand is strong. Could you give us an update on pricing relative to DAILIES TOTAL1 and TruEye? Will you be able to meet capacity, meet demand -- do you have enough capacity to meet demand going forward in fiscal 2014? Any more color on the U.S. approval timing and the production plan? And just lastly, Bob, on MyDay. Could you just give us some reassurance that as you ramp up, we won't have production issues that we did with Biofinity?","Robert S. Weiss","All right. As far as the pricing of MyDay, I'm not going to get into all the details other than to say we're obviously not going to price at the high point at both TruEye and TOTAL 1 are, which is the reason that the market remains a niche market. So expect our pricing is not -- it's going clearly be below that sphere of -- in that tier of pricing. As far as demand, demand is going to be -- it's certainly exceeding our capacity throughout 2013, throughout 2014. And once again, that is purely a function of our ability to ramp up in long lead times on equipment that are 12 to 18 months, which really will push us out to 2015 and beyond. As far as the timing in U.S. and what we expect in the U.S., the approval to sell in the U.S., we expect within the next 12 months. Whether or not we immediately go-to-market once we get that approval will be a function of not overextending our reach. So if the demand is robust in Europe and we've committed to customers, we're going to honor those commitments first in Europe and then we'll take it from there as we ramp up. As far as the risk of not being able to ramp up, it's more about plugging -- getting the equipment, plugging it in, validating it. It is not novel equipment, it's equipment we have been using in the production of both Avaira, as well as the production of MyDay. So I think it's more execution, unlike Biofinity when that really got started way back when in 2006, '07 and '08. It was a material that was challenging to us and a huge learning curve, not only the equipment -- that the production equipment came into play, but also the material came into play. So I think we'll be on that.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien, William Blair.","Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","To kind of follow up a little bit on Larry's question about MyDay. As I recall, the big market right now that's the big chunk of overall daily silicone hydrogel revenue is Japan. And I'm just curious, I think I get the strategy as far as going to Europe first, but when you've talked about some pretty big demand there, and I think that's a relatively small market. So is it fair to characterize that, that potential revenue opportunity is something along the lines of a few million dollars, maybe $10 million at the high end over the next 12 months or so? And then within there, as MyDay gets to be a bigger and bigger piece of the overall business, certainly, it's going to weigh on gross margins, but the absolute contribution on the revenue side may be much higher. So should we expect a higher level of share repurchases or a higher dividend rate to offset what may be going on throughout the P&L?","Robert S. Weiss","I kind of lost you some place along there, but let me comment on Japan. You're correct, Japan is the biggest 1 Day silicone hydrogel market. The gating of the 1 Day silicone hydrogel market and the rate limiter has much more to do with price points than it does whether or not demand is there for silicone hydrogel. So the reason we're not going straight to Japan has a lot to do with the approval process we are embarking on going down that path, and we'll get to Japan at some point in time. As far as is the product limited by way of revenue potential, I think, not. In the next couple of years, we're not worrying about can we sell the product. It's kind of where do we sell it in one order and how do we control the process so we don't offend people that can't get the product? So that's really the rate limiter. But in the perfect world, if Japan were available, who knows we might have that -- meaning we have the approval process, we might very well go there first, but that's theoretical. As far as I think some of those other questions you asked, you're going to have to maybe repeat them.","Gregory W. Matz","Buyback.","Robert S. Weiss","On the buyback.","Gregory W. Matz","Yes, I think, Matt, when you mentioned buyback, we just don't -- we don't really comment on that.","Robert S. Weiss","In other words, any buyback done by us, we have the approval to go into the market and we go into the market opportunistically, but we clearly do not define what that means or the parameters of that. I would view that as not linked with anything else we're doing. Maybe the only limiter would be use of cash in terms of investment opportunities and other things on our plate.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson, Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Let me ask Bob one question and then I do have a follow-up after that. But it might be picky and you guys have good fourth quarter revenue guidance out there for CVI. But if I look at your fiscal third quarter growth of 9% constant currency for CVI and then your calendar 2Q was 10%, does that -- is it overreading to say July slowed down? Can you give us any kind of July or maybe kind of what you're seeing so far to start this quarter off, update on the CVI side?","Robert S. Weiss","I think it is, #1, July, of course, is in the reported period and I think you're doing a bifurcation of maybe the calendar data and the CLI data and...","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Exactly.","Robert S. Weiss","But relative to the guidance we're giving, I think it's pretty in sync with the run rate we had, both in the quarter ended June 30, which was the 10%, and the 3 months ended in July, which is the fiscal period, which was 9%. But quite frankly, that got weighted somewhat by a non-soft contact lens piece, the Aime products business, if you will. So I don't think you can read any slowing in the bifurcation or in our guidance.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just another couple of questions here on MyDay. First, I just want to confirm, it doesn't sound like there is really any revenue or margin implications for MyDay in the quarter. And then, Bob, I'd like to hear -- in the quarter you just reported, sorry. And then, Bob, I'd like to hear kind of maybe your bigger-picture thought on MyDay. It sounds like you guys are probably going to come out at a $500 to $550 price point somewhere in there for MyDay. But long term, do you think we have to get that price point down into the $400, $450 range? Where do you think daily si-hy pricing has to settle out? If we look at traditionally kind of a 20% or 25% trade-up cost is what takes these lenses out of niche territory into more of a reasonable trade-up range, where do you think long term that pricing on daily silicone in general needs to go for users to really start taking it up faster?","Robert S. Weiss","Well, I think if we look way down the road, you're going to end up with products in different categories at that cost. As cost comes down over time, the -- it will start taking on a profile a lot more traditional albeit the strategy of the industry has always been trade-up and hold the premium, some premium. My only problem with TOTAL1 and TruEye is that there is a limit and you're -- what you're trying to hone in on is where is that limit? There's no doubt that moist establishes a good guideline of what is affordable, it's the biggest product in the category. And so you know the price point can be at least moist. And you know the price point since moist is not -- silicone hydrogel can be higher than moist. So I think that's one parameter of that we know works in the marketplace. There is -- the market is willing to pay a premium for silicone hydrogel above hydrogel, so it's some place above moist. But clearly, there's a point where it cuts off, and that's where the sharpening of the pencil comes into play, which is we're not going to get too far into the details on that.","Gregory W. Matz","Yes. And, Jeff, to your other question on margin. Obviously, MyDay has a margin well below our standard margin, but it's in the rounding based on the volume of the product at this point for the quarter.","Robert S. Weiss","Yes. So to your point, we did not -- it was not a contributor to the quarter and that the rollout of the MyDay itself is a fourth quarter event as we speak now in Europe.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby, Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Just one follow-up question on a comment that was just made on MyDay first. And then I have a follow-up, too. If you could -- can you just give us an update on your progression in improving the yields and margins on MyDay and kind of where you stand? I think in the past, you've talked about maybe a 10% gross margin on that product. Just wondering where that is now.","Robert S. Weiss","Let's just say we're still early in the startup cycle, the production. And there are things on the new equipment as it comes in that will be more accommodating to the product. And you're right, the learning curve will continue to improve. We're well into the last meeting when we initially started the product and when we initially rolled it out as a private label. The private label product for the most part was a negative gross margin. The costs have come down so we're in positive territory, but we have a long way to go relative to where we expect to take it.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Okay, great. And then my next question is just on the competitive environment now that TOTAL1 is both in the U.S. and in Europe. I was just wondering, it looks like you guys are still obviously continuing to outgrow the market in overall in the dailies. I was just wondering about what your thoughts are maybe longer-term on some of your competitors start to launch new lenses, Sauflon gets FDA approval, things like that.","Robert S. Weiss","Well, I think as long as the price point is where it is on TOTAL1 and TruEye, this is the market that today is, let's say, something around or a little less than 5% of global market, or around that number, predicated mainly or targeted mainly at Japan. So it's, I would say, not all that much is happening in Europe and the U.S. in the extreme premium part of this market. As part as Sauflon is concerned and Clariti, it's my understanding they do have approval in the U.S. But having said that, I think they now have order for equipment, so I think like the other people in this space, everyone is in the process of ordering equipment, whether you're J&J or Alcon or Cooper or Sauflon, your -- there is a lead time on equipment in ramping up.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch, BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Can we turn for a second into CSI? What was the Origio contribution in the quarter?","Robert S. Weiss","The Origio, we had -- Greg, you want -- do you have that number?","Gregory W. Matz","Well, Origio was accretive. We've incorporated that into our business model, so we don't break that out separately.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And it looks as if in your guidance, you tightened the guidance range and looks like the CSI came down a little bit on the top end. Any particular reason for that?","Robert S. Weiss","I just think that's in sync with our run rate off the quarter. I think we brought it down $5 million at the top end, and that's a reflection that they're kind of marching more towards the middle of the range than towards the top of the range this time. I think the closure, as the year progressed, the closure device and our conversion there, which started a little in the third quarter in terms of the numbers we put up in the third quarter kind of ripple into the fourth quarter, and it's more whether or not you round it in the -- round it down in the third quarter.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Chris Cooley, Stephens.","Christopher C. Cooley - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick ones. One, when I think about silicone hydrogel sales as a percentage of total CVI, just looking back over the last roughly 8 quarters, it's flat sequentially here in the 3Q. Should I think about that as greater growth obviously with ClearSight and Proclear in the dailies category? Or is there anything structural that we should be thinking about just in terms of your portfolio products in terms of what the ceiling may or may not be for silicone hydrogel as a percentage of total CVI revenue? And then just as a quick second one, any update on the immediate transaction there in terms of estimated time of closure, so I'm assuming we have to change that or make adjustments for that to the full year once that closes?","Robert S. Weiss","I think, Aime?","Christopher C. Cooley - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Yes, Aime.","Gregory W. Matz","Yes. So, Chris, on the Aime transaction, we're still working through that. Once we determine that it is definite and that we definitely have a deal at that point, we will book that and you will see that flow our -- through our earnings. We are hoping that's in Q4, but again, we have a couple of milestones that we're still working through at this point.","Robert S. Weiss","Chris, on the second comment on silicone hydrogel, as far as it being I think 43% in the second and third quarter, I think that's just your -- when does it round up to next level. Obviously, we're happy with the 22% growth on a much larger base, and so the constant currency contribution in growth is much higher than the total. And clearly, it continues to gain the size of our pot, if you will, as well as the market at a very respectable rate. So no, I don't read anything into the 43% and the 43%.","Operator","A question from the line of Jon Block, Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","The EPS growth is certainly very solid this year, and I guess you can make the argument adjusted for some of the FX headwinds. It looks like it could even be mid-20% growth year-over-year or higher. I know you quickly mentioned, Bob, low double-digit next year. And I'm not asking for detailed guidance, but just wondering at a high level if you can talk to some of the variables that may lead to the deceleration. I'm guessing one is a potentially higher tax rate, but just any other stuff to point to, is it investments getting rated for greater ramp in MyDay? Anything there would be helpful.","Robert S. Weiss","I guess I would just say, we continue to invest money in the company, both on geographic expansion, as well as R&D that is expanded more rapidly than the top line, meaning the emphasis to D, not the R. So it's only a matter of having time to digest that. And also keep in mind that as the yen has declined throughout the year, we still already have a hurdle to overcome first quarter next year as that will still take its toll. And those numbers have been pretty big. I think Greg pointed out the $0.17 for this quarter, $0.16 forecast for next quarter, which I think adds up to $0.54 for the year. So that's been a big hurdle and granted we've had some good things go that have minimized that this year from the point of view of the royalty and other factors in our cost of goods area. So when you put it all together, it's clearly too early to go beyond the guidance we're giving in our -- in my comment, if you will, that is going to be low double-digit.","Operator","Final question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla, Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A question for Greg. If you look to the fourth quarter for the gross margin guidance, you're expecting a sequential ramp-up. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that would assume that 1 Day degradation on gross margin is just really not going to happen. And so as you look to 2014, can you talk about the gross margin impact from the 1 Day rollout? And secondly, how do you think about 2014, Bob? Maybe you could talk a little bit about your expectations for market growth and maybe any comments on top line for the company.","Gregory W. Matz","Yes, I mean on the gross margin, I think if you look back in the last few years, and again, I mentioned that I have 5 years in front of me, that Q3 has always been the lowest gross margin of the year, and you will see our -- and you will see it go back up in Q4. So you've got a natural process and a lot of it is around manufacturing variances, a little bit more revenue in the quarter. All of that stuff contributes to a higher margin in Q4. And so from that perspective, we feel very comfortable with the guidance that we've given. Again, we're not going to give guidance in the next year. MyDay is still -- it's still a small product compared to our other product portfolios. So even though it has a lower-than-average gross margin, it's -- again, it's not going to drive our gross margins in the coming year just based on the volume.","Robert S. Weiss","Just a couple of comments on your questions. Piggybacking on what Greg just -- comment he just made that MyDay is not going to be a major influence next year. That is still predicated on timing of equipment. The equipment lead times are 12 to 18 months, you're only as fast as the longest piece of equipment it takes to get. So it is unlikely. Quite frankly, impossible to get the equipment in, get it plugged in, get it assembled, get it validated, make products and have the product make it out the door to any significance next year relative to any equipment we now have on order. So that is -- clearly, capacity is the governor in 2014. And therefore, MyDay is just not going to be a big factor in that process. Relative to market outlook, I would say that we're, there is no indicator I've seen that says the market should be outside of that range we've given in the past 4% to 6% in a kind of a post deep recession economy that we had. So we're now, in my opinion, at the 4% to 6% range and we've been running most recently towards the bottom end of that range at 4%. But I do think we'll start to accelerate a bit. As far as our guidance, our guidance would be eliminated at this point in time to say and we continue to expect to gain share. We're not saying we're going to match what we've done the last 1 to 2 years at 2x to 3x the market. We're going to gain share, by how much that is one we're not going to attempt to put a lot of color around right now.","Operator","With no further questions, we'll turn the call over to Mr. Bob Weiss for closing remarks. Please proceed, sir.","Robert S. Weiss","Well, I want to thank everyone for calling in today. And once again, for those of you that have New Year's activities, our apologies for the overlap and have a great happy New Year. For everyone, I look forward to updating you on our year-end results in December, I think it's December 5, very much like today, the 5th.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Kim Duncan, Vice President, Investor Relations and Administration. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Kim Duncan","Good afternoon, and welcome to the Cooper Companies\u2019 third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss the results included in the earnings release, along with the updated guidance and then use the remaining time for Q&A.","Our presenters on today\u2019s call are Al White, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Andrews, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements, including all revenue and earnings per share guidance and other statements regarding anticipated results of operations, market or regulatory conditions, and integration of any acquisitions or their failure to achieve anticipated benefits. Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods that maybe incorrect or imprecise and are subject to risks and uncertainties.","Events that could cause our actual results and future actions of the company to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements are set forth under the caption, Forward-Looking Statements, in today\u2019s earnings release and are described in our SEC filings, including Cooper\u2019s Form 10-K, all of which are available on our website at coopercos.com. Should you have any additional questions following the call, please call our investor line at 925-460-3663 or email ir@cooperco.com.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Al for his opening remarks.","Al White","Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2019 conference call. For the quarter, we reported $679 million in consolidated revenue, up 3% year-over-year or up 5% pro forma. CooperVision posted revenues of $509.1 million, up 4% or up 6% pro forma. CooperSurgical posted revenues of $170.3 million, flat year-over-year, up 2% pro forma. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.23. These results were driven by our market-leading products and strong operational execution, and we expect this success to continue.","Now, as I walk through the quarterly results today, the numbers would be on a pro forma basis, but it's mostly constant currency now as other adjustments are minimal. For the quarter, CooperVision posted growth throughout the world with the Americas up 5%; EMEA 3%; and Asia Pac up 13%. All three regions were led by our daily silicone hydrogel lenses MyDay and Clariti, which grew 23%. Biofinity also performed well with Energys and torics leading the way and our Avaira franchise was solid leading the RFP, or two-week and monthly silicone hydrogel growth of 6%.","Moving outside of brands, torics grew 8% and multifocals grew 2%. Touching on the details, Asia Pac continues to post very strong results. Our growth in that region is highly diversified from a product and geographic perspective, and it's driven by a fantastic team. Growing double digits for as long as they have with the momentum to keep it going is not easy, so I wanted to highlight that and say great job to the team.","Second, EMEA was a little softer than we were expecting, largely due to lower stocking levels as that region experienced fluctuations, working through challenges associated with Brexit. And finally, just a reminder that our consolidated third quarter growth from last year was 9%, meaning this was a very solid quarter off a tough comp. And looking forward, we\u2019re guiding Q4 to 6% to 8% and that's against a very tough 10% comp, so our business remains strong.","We're also continuing to take share as we stay on the offensive with our strong product portfolio and our successful key account strategy.","Moving on to our myopia management strategy, I'm going to focus on MiSight rather than the broader specialty unit, as that's where most of our future investments will be dedicated. As you'll remember, MiSight is our innovative myopia management lens that is selling in several European countries, Canada, and a few Asia-Pacific countries.","I'm proud to announce MiSight exceeded $1 million in revenues this quarter for the first time ever, more than doubling on a year-over-year basis. The lens is supported by strong five-year clinical data, and we're continuing to see significant interest and accelerating demand for the product.","Regarding the U.S., we're continuing to work with the FDA and hope to provide a meaningful update prior to calendar year-end. Given there are currently no FDA-approved myopia management contact lenses, an approval would obviously be a major milestone and cement our leadership in this extremely exciting space.","With this positive activity, we've ramped up pre-launch investment efforts in the U.S. to get a better understanding in the market, and we've accelerated sales and marketing and educational activity outside the U.S. These investments will add several million dollars in additional cost in Q4, but I'm excited to see the results as I remain extremely excited about MiSight's potential and the positive halo effect it will have on the rest of our portfolio.","Moving back to the quarter for CooperVision, let me briefly walk through our ongoing infrastructure investments as this is an important part of our customized solution strategy to support our long-term growth initiatives.","We're continuing to invest and support key accounts and independent practitioners by upgrading our distribution and packaging operations, our IT systems, and our overall customer service capabilities. We're also enhancing manufacturing by maintaining an intense continuous improvement mentality, while expanding facilities and increasing the use of automation.","Lastly, we're also investing in sales and marketing activities, including increasing in-store promotional activity, education, advertising and new sales and marketing hires. These efforts are critical to our long-term success as we need the appropriate infrastructure to support our partners in growing their contact lens businesses for many years into the future.","Moving to market data and important trends. On a trailing 12-month basis, the market grew roughly 7% to $8.7 billion with the primary growth driver being dailies up 11%. The market continues to be healthy, and I remain comfortable targeting growth in the mid to upper part of the 4% to 6% range I frequently discussed. This growth will continue to be driven by several factors including the shift to dailies, the trade up from traditional hydrogel to silicone hydrogel dailies, geographic expansion, and growth in torics and multifocals.","To put some numbers to some of this, roughly 41% of dailies sales are now in silicones, compared to 83% of FRP sales and I believe we'll see daily silicone sales approach or even reach the FRP levels, as pricing comes in line and new products are launched.","From a dollar perspective, this means that roughly $2 billion in current daily hydrogel sales should be converted to silicone dailies, which will drive solid market growth for many years to come. Additionally, new wearers entering the market in daily lenses drive significantly more revenue than existing FRP -- I'm sorry, than exiting FRP wearers, so the transition we're seeing to daily lenses from two-week and monthly lenses is another underlying positive factor in the market's growth.","With respect to CooperVision, our daily market share is roughly 18% compared to 31% within the FRP space, so there's a long runway for us to continue growing faster than the market. The key remains executing on our core strategies and winning new wearers, and I'm very happy to say that New Fit Data is very strong, showing our momentum is continuing.","Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported revenues of $170.3 million, up 2% with our office and surgical business roughly flat and fertility up 5%. Within office and surgical, PARAGARD was unexpectedly flat given continued ASP improvements, but we believe there were two factors that impacted performance with those being our decision to pause certain advertising programs, including TV ads to take the time to assess the returns on these initiatives; and some channel inventory contraction at the physician level.","We found a clear correlation between our consumer awareness campaigns and unit growth, so our challenge moving forward is to optimize the return on this activity. There is more work to be done, but I'm confident we'll be successful given the strength of the sales and marketing team we've built, and a significant amount of insightful direct-to-consumer information we've obtained.","The question right now is what's the long-term growth opportunity for PARAGARD? And the answer in that revolves largely around unit and price performance. When looking at these two items, I feel comfortable reiterating that PARAGARD should grow in the mid single-digits and I believe in the upper part of that for the next several years.","This is supported by roughly 3% annualized unit growth, which we believe we'll be able to obtain through normal sales and marketing activity and then roughly 3% coming from price. As we've discussed, our experiences have shown that we can push the unit growth rate higher than 3% through higher advertising, but we need to keep working and challenging ourselves as to the returns we're getting from that activity.","On price, we have an adjusted price since we acquired the product, but we've seen our competitors increased their base price on the hormonal side of the IUD market. Given current market conditions, we're currently evaluating a price increase, noting that any potential price increase rose through the P&L over time due to Medicaid and contractual arrangements.","Regarding fertility, growth was led by our device portfolio, which includes consumable products like IVF media and our market-leading Wallace embryo transfer catheter. We also saw stabilization in our genomics business, as our restructuring activities are now completely behind us, including our lab consolidation efforts where we reduced the total number of labs from 16 to three, which will result in significant efficiency improvements going forward.","Overall, the fertility space continues to offer mid to upper single-digit long-term growth potential, so we're investing in sales and marketing talent as we expand internationally, driving product improvements through R&D and implementing new selling and advertising programs.","Outside of commercial part of CooperSurgical, we're making a lot of progress upgrading our infrastructure, including expanding our headquarters in Connecticut, increasing our distribution capabilities, such as adding a new facility that just went live in Europe and expanding our Costa Rica manufacturing facility.","Regarding the Costa Rica project, production is growing and we're on target with our build-out plans, including tripling the size of the facility to accommodate the relocation of several production lines from other facilities around the world.","Once completed, this facility will be a state-of-the-art manufacturing location, including what we believe will be the most technologically advanced fertility manufacturing operation in the world. The team is doing a fantastic job, handling all the complexities associated with this activity, and I'm extreme pleased with the progress.","Before concluding, I want to wrap up by mentioning, we just refreshed our corporate brand with a new logo, brand identity and website. This is an exciting step for the organization and better ties the visual representations of CooperVision, CooperSurgical and Cooper Companies together. You could check it out on our new website at coopercos.com.","I'm also happy to say, we're continuing to make nice strides with our ESG incorporate responsibility efforts, including expanding our philanthropic efforts, increasing support in our local communities, and increasing our environmental sustainability efforts.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Andrews","Thank you, Al. Good afternoon everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.","Al covered revenues, so I'll focus on the rest of the financials and guidance. Consolidated gross margin for the quarter was essentially flat at 67.3% versus 67.4% last year. CooperVision's gross margin was 65.6%, down from 65.9% last year, due largely to higher secondary handling costs as we complete the distribution center upgrades that we've discussed before.","CooperSurgical's gross margin increased to 72.4%, up from 71.7%, driven primarily from improvements in our fertility business where we're starting to see the progress following the completion of our genomics integration activity.","Consolidated operating margin increased nicely to 28.4% from 27.8% last year, as we saw leverage from consolidated operating expenses only growing 1.3% year-over-year. Investments were very targeted in key areas, including selling and marketing, and distribution within CooperVision and selling customer service and distribution within CooperSurgical.","Interest expense was $16.7 million and our effective tax rate was 8.9%, which included additional excess tax benefits received from the exercising of stock options. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $3.23, with roughly 50.1 million average shares outstanding.","Free cash flow was $121.3 million comprised of $196.7 million of operating cash flow offset by $75.4 million of CapEx. Net debt decreased by $122.8 million to $1.702 billion and our adjusted leverage ratio declined to 1.83 times.","One last matter from this quarter was that we implemented a soft freeze on our pension plan effective August 1, 2019. Like many companies, our focus is shifting to what our employees are requesting and that's programs such as the 401(k) and our new employee stock purchase plan. This move did not impact our financials, but you'll see it in the Q, so I wanted to mention it.","Moving to guidance, our pro forma revenue growth ranges are basically unchanged, while EPS is being raised. For the full year, we're now guiding consolidated revenues to $2.635 billion to $2.655 billion with the CooperVision range being $1.966 billion to $1.976 billion, which remained 7% to 8% full year pro forma growth; and CooperSurgical at $669 million to $679 million, which remains full year pro forma revenue -- pro forma growth of 4% to 6%.","Full year non-GAAP EPS guidance is being raised $0.12 on the bottom end to $12.27 to $12.35. Calculating this for adjusted the fourth quarter shows CooperVision revenue guidance of $503 million to $513 million, up 6% to 8% pro forma; and CooperSurgical revenue guidance of $171 million to $181 million, up 1% to 7% pro forma; and non-GAAP EPS of $3.22 to $3.30. Note the Q4 assumption is for roughly 10.5% effective tax rate.","Regarding FX, rates have moved around a lot around over the past three months, with the pound and yen making decent moves. But the ultimate impact is a minimal change from last quarter, with a fiscal year impact on revenues being a negative $67 million and a negative $0.60 to EPS. Our assumptions are based on generally current rates including the euro at $1.10, the pound at $1.22 and the yen at $1.06.","Regarding fiscal 2020 guidance, it's too early to provide much detail, but at a high level we remain focused on taking share by driving strong sustainable revenue growth and posting low double-digit constant currency and operating income growth. Having said that, we remain very excited about MiSight and there could be incremental investments in that product depending on the timing around an approval from the FDA and\/or from accelerating demand we\u2019re seeing outside the United States. As is our practice, we'll provide full guidance for next year on our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call, which is set for December 5.","And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Larry Biegelsen","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just two from me to start with the Q4 CooperVision guidance. Al, I think to reach the midpoint, you need to accelerate growth on a nominal and a stacked two-year basis. So, what drives the acceleration in Q4? And how much was that kind of Q3 impact from Brexit? Is that something you will quantify for us, it's something you'll get back in Q4 and I have one follow-up.","Al White","Yes. I think that when you look at Q4, if you kind of compare it sequentially to Q3, you'd say the Americas are going to be similar, probably a little bit stronger, I would expect, in Q4 than they were in Q3. Asia-Pac is somewhat similar, and I think EMEA puts up a better number. And you kind of touched on it there, we did see some destocking this quarter, so assuming that we don't get a rebound in that, we'll just have a regular kind of quarter for EMEA. I think they'll post a stronger number than what they posted this quarter. That pushes you somewhere to 6 being equivalent to this quarter to as high as 8 in Q4.","Larry Biegelsen","That's helpful. And then on 2020, appreciate the color. Can you give us a little color right now on where kind of FX would be -- the impact for sales and EPS at this point? And the tax rate Al, is it still 13% to 14%? Is that the right way to think about tax for 2020? Thanks for taking the questions guys.","Al White","Yes. I think that on the tax rate side, probably 14% is the right way to think about it. I mean you're right, I do think of it in that 13% to 14% kind of range. At the end of the day, we've had some excess stock comp benefit and that's been around 1.5% for the last couple years, so that could certainly push it lower, but somewhere in that range and probably 14%, but right now it's probably the best number to go with just as a placeholder. We'll, obviously, update that in December. FX, I think right now kind of current rates is neutral to may be a little positive for next year, and we'll update that obviously in December when we get there, but right now at least we don't have anywhere near the headwind that we\u2019ve had this year.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. So, Al, the only other place in CVI that maybe was a little short of our number other than the EU question that Larry just asked was on multifocals, up 2%. Is that competition there? Was there any specific destocking in multifocals in the EU that would explain that? Just kind of what's going on in the multi-focal category would be helpful.","Al White","Yeah, Jeff. I think, it's tied more to competition than anything. Some of our competitors have put out some pretty good lenses recently. We have a significant market share in the multifocals space. We do, as you know, really, really well in that space, but there is some heightened competition there.","The next real step for us is probably tied to like MyDay multifocal. I can tell you, we'll come out with that lens eventually and it's going to be received incredibly well in my opinion. It's just a matter of production on that. So I think for right now we\u2019re probably looking at closer to kind of low-single-digit growth in multifocals where the market would be more in the upper-single digits.","Jeff Johnson","Yes. And when do you think that MyDay multifocal could roll? And then as a follow-up to that, I\u2019ll count that just as my first question as a follow-up to that, you did talk about some pre-launch activity in Q4 for the myopia lens in the U.S. for MiSight. That would suggest to me you have some confidence that you hear something good before year-end from the FDA.","And as we\u2019ve talked to some people out there, sounds like the FDA is really just concerned about putting contact lenses on eight-year olds, not necessarily on the process of reducing myopia progression. So, it would seem like a low bar you have to kind of hurdle to get them to approve this product, but just any commentary you can provide would be helpful? Thanks.","Al White","Yes. On the multifocal, let me hit that one first. On MyDay multifocal, no timeline on that one yet. We have some significant demand, and not only significant but actually accelerating demand on MyDay right now and that's even with us raising price. We dropped the rebate in the U.S. We've raised price in a lot of markets, and MyDay demand is actually accelerating.","So I'm not sure the multifocal is going to be out that soon. So -- but at the end of the day, that's not that detrimental to us. The multifocal market is still 4% or 5% of the overall market, so we'll update on that as soon as we can. We're bringing production lines on, and we\u2019ll continue to bring them on next year, so the faster we can ramp up production, the faster we'll get a multifocal out there.","On MiSight, yes, I mentioned in the prepared comments, I think, I\u2019m keeping my fingers crossed. We\u2019ll have a nice positive announcement prior to calendar year end on that product. So I think you're right on your commentary on the FDA. We\u2019re working with them right now trying to get through that process. So, I won't comment too much more than that other than to say, fingers crossed, and yes, we are accelerating, pulling forward, if you will, activity associated with that from a pre-launch perspective.","And then, we've seen really, really strong demand in MiSight outside of the U.S., and that's just been fantastic, and that's kind of accelerating also. So, we're doing a lot of work right now on understanding the market and launch activity and engaging sales professionals and so forth on that side.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joanne Wuensch","Good afternoon. How are you all doing today?","Al White","Good. Joanne, how are you doing?","Joanne Wuensch","Excellent. It looks like the contact lens market has accelerated somewhat over the last few quarters, and particularly this quarter. Is there any particular reason why?","Al White","Yeah. I think that you're starting to see people grab more and more and more a hold of the shift to daily silicones. I mean, for a little while you had J&J in there just a little bit and Alcon a little bit and you had us a little bit, but capacity constrained in spots.","And then, we've extended our portfolio. You've seen J&J ramp up capacity of their daily SiHy's. Obviously, Alcon has some stuff going on. I mean, that's your biggest shift. So as you\u2019re seeing wearers exit the market, a lot of those wearers are FRP wearers. They are two week or monthly wearers. The new wearers coming into the market are daily wearers, so that's a pretty significant trade-up. And then, the trade up, if you will from a traditional daily hydrogel wearer to a silicone hydrogel wearer is another 20% or so trade-up.","So we've talked about this for a number of years, right? I think that its gaining traction is what it comes down to. And I think it\u2019s going to continue to gain traction as you get capacity ramping up new products and so forth from out. I quoted that number of $2 billion that needs to be converted over.","If you convert just that $2 billion over that changes to somewhere around $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion of revenue adding $400 million to $500 million of revenue to the industry. That will probably take five to 10 years. But then you also roll in the other factors, some growth in wearers around the world, the torics, the multifocals, the other stuff that's going on. And then, the general transition to more daily wearers and it's all just a lot of really good positive trends.","Joanne Wuensch","I like to hear that. You had spoken about owning to a key brand strategy a couple of quarters ago. Could you just give us an update clear on how that's going? Thanks.","Al White","Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, we are focused on that. We mentioned a lot of the investment activity we're doing. We put the key account team in place, and it's a fantastic team. They're doing really, really well. We've had some very nice wins in the key account -- within the key account team. We're working on some other stuff right now that's really exciting. So I hope that, you will continue to see some stuff in the near future here, it's going to be pretty positive. I'm pretty excited about. It's going well.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you. And have a great weekend.","Al White","Thanks. You too.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Matthew Mishan","Great. Thanks for taking questions. Hey, Al, one of your competitors is working to improve the productivity of its new manufacturing lines. I\u2019m just curious like how confident you are that -- with the manufacturing process that you acquired with Sauflon can still be a competitive advantage for you moving forward?","Al White","Oh, yeah. I'm very confident with that. I think in my opinion right now looking at it, I mean we have the best manufacturing team in the contact lens industry and we have the best lines that are out there right now. So that Sauflon acquisition was just phenomenal for us. And linking in that technology into our real high volume technology we have, and pulling those together to standardize those lines, I think that's a true competitive advantage for us. And frankly I think you see that in our margins. You see that in the strength of the CooperVision margins that are out there. And we can't rest on our laurels there and we\u2019re not. We have a very highly focused intense continuous improvement mentality within manufacturing. So we are really working hard to drive continuing production improvements and cost reduction. So I feel good about that on the manufacturing side.","Matthew Mishan","Okay. And then on the revenue growth side, I think you -- I think that's the first time you mentioned targeting growth at the high-end of the market. But you've been coming in well above that for like the last couple years. Are you suggesting like the recent -- that recent growth in this 7%, 8%, is it a viable target for you moving forward?","Al White","No, no, no. It definitely is. So I would say that, I continue to believe that we can put a pretty strong growth. I talked about it in the context of the market at 4% to 6%, and we talked about ourselves taking share, we'll talk about that 6% to 8% growth. So I think we can continue to put up those numbers. I do think that the actual market growth could get stronger. I don't think that will be detrimental to us. But I do think the market growth can be stronger.","You can use Alcon as an example. They come out with PRECISION1, great product they're trading up for DACP wearers and they're getting 20% or so trade up from that. I mean, that alone is going to increase them. But we're going to continue to put up our numbers in growth. So I feel pretty good about our growth and I think the market kind of is stable here to maybe even a little bit improving.","Matthew Mishan","All right. Thanks Al.","Al White","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys, this is Jerome [ph] for Matt. Thank you for taking the questions. I guess the first I want to touch on what you just mentioned then. Obviously, over the last couple quarters, clariti growth has been great. I mean this new competitor bringing a product in the next couple months. Probably going to take a little while to scale, but now that you've seen the product sort of how do you think that stacked up against your product portfolio?","Al White","Yes. I think that our product portfolio is very strong. I mean, we have -- keep in mind, clariti has sphere toric and multifocals, so it's a full set of products. MyDay is out there right now as a sphere toric also. So, we're now in good shape. Now, we do need to expand parameter ranges, we had a base curve for instance to MyDay. So, there's a number of things we're doing to continue to expand our existing portfolio.","So, we're quite ahead of a lot of people in the game right now. So, I mean competition's going to come that's part of where we are. That's the industry we live in. We have good big competitors, but we're not sitting around doing nothing that's for sure. We're expanding the portfolio, getting product out in more countries and locations, and so forth. So, we still have many years in front of us of upside from that type of activity.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then obviously PARAGARD has been on the tariff for the last couple quarters, it moderated maybe a little bit here in Q3. I know you guys have been a little hesitant to go down the television advertising route. So, I guess the question is one, I mean have you restarted your television ads yet? And then two, kind of what is the hang-up from pushing a little bit more aggressively into that DTC channel? Thank you.","Al White","Yes. Great question. Yes, on the TV ads, we have not started those back up. So, we thought about this a little bit in the past. We were running TV ads and some really heavy promotional activity in addition to kind of the social media, print media everything else that we're doing. So, we stepped back from some of that activity.","As we discussed, we've kind of talked about this openly to see what the impact would be to see how closely the correlation between those advertising campaigns and our unit sales were and to really understand the -- kind of the cost\/benefit of that. A lot of that activity is very expensive to do.","So, we're doing exactly what we said we would do and exactly what you want to do and we have great Intel on that. I do think that you'll see us come back with some TV ads, are going to be more focused, more targeted TV ads. Because there are certain markets in the U.S. where we can target and be very successful with those TV ads. So, I think you're going to see more. We're just trying to fine tune in that.","But if I do step back, I'd say PARAGARD's going about 6.5% year-to-date and I think that's a decent number. I think PARAGARD's going to grow around 6% if we just look at core unit growth from doing what we're doing well plus price gets us to around that 6% number and we can drive that number higher. We've proven we can drive that higher. It's just going to be the cost benefit of doing a lot of that activity.","So, still learning, still working through it, but clearly we feel very positive about that product. And I talked for a while about a mid-single-digit grower and I would be more comfortable at this point saying, yes, mid-single-digit is, right but the upper part of that mid-single-digit is probably the most accurate.","Unidentified Analyst","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Larry Keusch","Thanks. Al could you -- you alluded to in your prepared comments about New Fits doing very well. Can you provide just some more color in any way you can on -- to helping us think about that kind of how the New Fits are going?","Al White","Yes, the New Fit Data was strong this quarter, no question about it. We saw an acceleration in some areas in new fit data that excite me and specifically, when it came to new fits on the daily silicone hydrogel side. That's what I would really point to. I think this quarter we hit an all-time high in some of those metrics and one of the key metrics certainly we hit an all-time high. So that's where the market is going. Market's going to daily silicone hydrogels and that's where we're focused and that's where we're excelling. And when I see that new fit data coming through, it makes me feel really good, because it might not happen immediately, but it's going to happen. When you're getting the wearers, you're going to get the revenues associated with it.","Larry Keusch","Okay. Perfect. And then just one other one, again, sort of you alluded to accelerating demand for MyDay toric. So maybe you can talk about sort of geographically where you're seeing that? Your ability to actually, meet demand particular that continues to accelerate and maybe we\u2019ve been there just sort of again how you're thinking about your manufacturing capacity and expansion plans?","Al White","Yeah, Larry, that's a great question. MyDay toric came into the market and it has been received so well. We had that halo effect where it brought this sphere up. And we\u2019re in this situation where we've been increasing our manufacturing capacity so the team's doing really well there with the existing lines we have. We've ordered a number of new lines that will be coming in over time. So we're going to be growing capacity. We've taken price up in many markets around the world and we've actually -- you've seen that in the U.S. through a reduction in rebates.","Having said that, MyDay demand continues to accelerate in the face of all that, so that's the great news. The challenge for us ends up being avoiding back orders and those types of problems. So we are putting stuff in place right now with respect our supply chain to ensure that we don't go into back order situations and we take care of all of our customers. And right now we're kind of playing in that fine line of ensuring we give high quality customer service, while we're ramping up production.","And I think that you're going to see production come online, I don't want to get in too much detail for competitive reasons, but you're going to see production coming online in this next fiscal year and especially at the tail end. So I think we're positioned well to put up good numbers next fiscal year and then I think we're positioned frankly extremely well to really put up some good numbers in fiscal 2021 as that capacity comes on and we can expand our offerings and our parameter ranges and get back to, as I mentioned, to, Jeff, like a MyDay multifocal and so forth on the market.","Larry Keusch","Okay. Terrific. Thanks very much.","Albert White","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Trevor on for John. Thanks for taking my question. So, first, on Vision, has the rebate activity on dailies remains suppressed relative to six to 12 months ago? And should we view that as a tailwind to reported revenues looking forward over the next few quarters?","Albert White","Yeah. Rebate activity is kind of flattened out. There's a little activity and there always seems to be here in someone will run like a small promotional activity for back-to-school and some of that kind of stuff. So you'll see everyone saw some rebate activity come in. But at the end of the day a lot of that has stabilized. I do think we're working through some of that still, but it stabilized which is good news. And you are seeing some base price increases, so I think the trend there is at worst neutral and probably -- slightly positive.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks. And then on surgical, where would you say your winning share from on PARAGARD? Is that just you\u2019re getting larger volumes from current prescribers, or are you to bringing in new docs in order to expand the product a little bit?","Al White>","Yeah. I think both. I think both. Some of it is just awareness. It's consumer awareness and it's also awareness to the physicians. So we're out there doing physician training and so forth.","The product had kind of gone quiet, so to speak, for a number of years before we bought it. So, to get back out there, to get into some training programs and talk to physicians who are working through school, I think, we're picking up some new docs and I think we're also picking up some wearers from some of the consumer awareness activity. So that's what kind of makes me feel pretty good about that 3% unit growth. We've actually been growing a little bit faster than that. So, I think, we'll be able to hold that for a number of years.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Cooley with Stephens. Your line is now open.","Chris Cooley","Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Al, just two for me. On PARAGARD, I appreciate the additional color there about volume and pricing. Curious, just to get your take on overall category potential. Obviously, it tapered here a little bit with the lack of advertising. So just where do you see the broader IUD category here in the States? And specifically, the non-hormonal segment of that going relative to maybe other markets? And then, I've got a quick follow-up on Vision.","Al White","Yeah. The kind of IUD market in total in the U.S. is some \u2013 it's over $1 billion, it was, I'll call it, close to kind of $1.1 billion. And you're seeing decent growth within the space. So, as IUD market, you're probably seeing around 2% to 3% unit growth, plus price. We're a little bit on the higher end of that from a unit growth perspective. As I mentioned, we haven't taken price recently, but looking at that.","And then, when you look at how the non-hormonal market, because keep in mind, we have the only non-hormonal IUD product in the U.S. market. When you compare that to markets outside of the U.S., the non-hormonal penetration rates are higher than they are in the U.S. So, I think we could just do our job and get out there in the market and make sure people know the products available. The trends are in our favor there.","Chris Cooley","But just to be clear, no change in your long-term view there, even though you had a little bit of a step back here in the most recent quarter?","Al White","Yes, absolutely, no change there. No, we pulled back on that intentionally, right? We saw some destocking, which probably isn't a surprise. We were doing all that advertising and promotions and you got a little buy in from physicians and some distributor kind of activity.","You get that kind of stuff, while you're doing all of that. And then you pull-back and you get a pause in the marketplace. But no, I don't have -- I'm not stepping back at all from the positive feelings I have about PARAGARD. It was just a much more profitable quarter, if you will, with the pull-back in some of that.","Chris Cooley","Understood. And then, just lastly for me, on the Vision side, just looking ahead, if we do see some volatility just in the economy, is there anything different when we think about the current contact lens market here in the States versus say the 2007, 2008 timeframe?","We saw purchase go to maybe more to the six to nine month versus the full annual supply at the time of the exam? With the shift to dailies and with the focus now on key accounts, should we be thinking about that, if we're trying to risk-adjust numbers in the out years? Or is that now changed structurally such that, you purchased still a full year supply at the time of the exam? How should we think about that going forward?","Al White","Yeah. I think that, the market overall probably in a little better place than it was then. But to be fair, if we get an economic slowdown, even with the shift to dailies, even with the things we've seen and all of that continuing, you can't get somebody that doesn't wear their daily lenses every day. They could always wear five days a week and wear their glasses for over the weekend or something like that, which would take the year's supply of lenses that they purchase out to make it a 15-month supply or a 14-month supply. So, it wouldn't surprise me if you saw that. Any time you move to that kind of environment people are trying to save money. Those are the kind of things that are pretty easy to do to save money on a Saturday or Sunday, you just put your glasses on. But I still think, you go to 2009 contact lens market in the middle of the recession grew 3%. I would be really surprised under any scenario to see it get down there or lower.","Chris Cooley","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks. One on CVI and then one on PARAGARD. Just could you recap in terms of where silicone hydrogel penetration is in dailies right now? And maybe what that -- the value of that market is in dollar terms? And then, as you think of silicone hydrogel material becoming more evenly weighted within dailies specifically where that total markets can go?","And then a follow-up on PARAGARD would be, it was trending I believe at around $170 million run rate last quarter. So it's a little bit of a step-down this quarter, so trending around 17% market share. When you think of the positioning of PARAGARD within the IUD space, is it still possible that that market share could double over time in the IUD market? Thanks.","Al White","Yes. I'll take PARAGARD first. Yeah, I do think it could. I mean there are markets outside of the U.S. where you see hormonal or non-hormonal on equal footing. And you'll see 30%, 35% even 40% there\u2019s several markets where you get it's kind of 50\/50. So I do think there is the chance to make that happen. It just takes time and it takes effort. And we want to make sure that we do that in the most intelligent way possible. And that maximize our return.","So, I think if we went out with a massive marketing program and blanketed the U.S. with television ads and so forth, we can push a PARAGARD really fast. I really do think that. And the TV ads, where we did metro New York and San Francisco, we saw some really positive responses on that.","But I don't think it's going to happen that way. I think it will be more of a general trend in that direction. So, I would say with a product like that, with the margins we're getting on it, if we can get that kind of mid-single-digit 6% growth and push that up some time, we're going to be pretty happy with that, so no reason to push that further at a -- from a negative return perspective.","On SiHy and daily SiHys, right now 41% of dailies SiHys are being fit in silicone. So, I think that's probably key numbers. The market right now, a little bit over half of the market is in dailies and 41% of that being in daily silicones. It gets a little confusing with the numbers. But right now, if you look at a two-week and monthly market, about 83% of that is being fit in silicone hydrogel lenses.","So there's no reason daily silicones in my mind don't get up to that kind of same level. And when you look at that conversion, you're talking about another $2 billion in product. That's the big shift right there, right? Where it's to go from 41% up to the 80% level, and that 41% that I'm quoting right? Where I think it was 39% last quarter, 38% a quarter before I can't remember exactly, but somewhere around there. It continues to move up a point every quarter.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Robbie Marcus","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe first just a housekeeping question. Can you walk through how FX impacted the P&L on sales gross margin and the bottom-line?","Brian Andrews","Sure. I'll take that. Yes. So, in Q3, the impact to sales was about $13 million. So, that's about a $3 million -- that's a detriment, so $3 million better than our previous guidance. To EPS the impact was a negative $0.06, which was $0.06 better than our previous guidance.","Robbie Marcus","Okay. And then as you think about fiscal 2020 and I realize you haven't given guidance yet, so it's more in a hypothetical sense. What's your confidence in driving above peer operating margin expansion here? We see with a pretty good topline this year, FX is eating away a lot of it. And maybe you could just give us the year-to-date number to help us calibrate on operating margin. But how do you think about your ability to expand operating margin going forward? Thanks.","Al White","I'll answer this and certainly let Brian jump in. We can\u2019t continue to expand operating margins. I don't see anything that's preventing us from doing that.","I mean, we're going to get some leverage we're doing a lot of investment activity right now. I kind of walked through that. And that's within CooperVision and within CooperSurgical also.","So, we will get some leverage in that. We're just really building out right now in anticipation of some big years going forward, because just as I touched on with the MyDay capacity expansion and so forth, we see a lot of good things in the future.","So, we're kind of getting ourselves ready so to speak in front of a lot of that. So, we'll get some leverage from some of that kind of activity. And I think when you look at products like PARAGARD, that's another one that we're going to get some pretty good operating margin improvement from a product like that because that has really a high operating margins.","Brian Andrews","Yes. And I guess just to add to that. I mean, we've talked about this in prior quarters around just how we kind of manage our key accounts really down to the operating margin levels. So, -- and as we continue to evolve in those relationships, I'd expect operating margins to improve. We've got some push and pull. I mean, we've got -- with rates going down even though that's great for interest expense; our pension service cost goes up. It runs counter to that.","And -- but I think in general, I mean, Al's hit the nail on the head, we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019ll expect to see some expansion. But it's -- with the thinks we're doing, especially around also distribution where we said this year it's a little bit elevated and I\u2019d expect a little bit of leverage next year.","Robbie Marcus","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Willoughby","Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I've actually got three things for you. First a quick one Brian. Was there any M&A contribution in the quarter?","Brian Andrews","Not really. I mean it was -- when you look at last year, you had a couple million dollar positive and then a couple million dollar negative. So, the net impact was zero on a consolidated basis.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. And then secondly Al, more commentary that in the past on PARAGARD as it relates to price. What are your thinking on timing of potential price increases? And if you can remind us how much of a discount PARAGARD is to the hormonal competitors right now? And if you think you can bring that up to parity? And then I have one quick last one.","Al White","Yes, Steve. We bought that -- and Teva had done the price increase. Remember we talked about that, because there was kind of all the disruption in the channel and so forth as we worked through that. So, this will be the first price increase that we've done. So, we are very actively right now kind of going through and evaluating, where we stand and how the price increase rose through the P&L and when to do it. So I would expect something in the near future here in terms of price increase. We are priced below our competitors, who are in the hormonal side of that depending upon what product you look at it. I mean, it can be 15% or so kind of beneath them. There's a lot of different factors that go into that pricing. But there's certainly some room for us to take a decent increase in price and still be priced below them as one more tool kind of in the toolbox in order to be able to sell the product in addition to the fact that it's the only non-hormonal product in the market.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. And then just last thing for you, Brian, on the tax rate. I believe you said 10.5% for the fourth quarter. Doing my math that it looks like it implies about 7.5% for the full year which is actually flat to slightly down year-over-year. Am I thinking about that the right way because that adds based on my math kind of 10% to 15% -- $0.10 to $0.15 of EPS this year versus your guidance a quarter ago?","Brian Andrews","Yeah. That's right.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Al White, President and CEO for any closing remarks.","Al White","Thank you. Thank you for everyone who called in. I know we have our next call beginning in December, I think December 5, so I look forward to catching up with everyone. In the meantime, have a great long weekend and we'll talk soon. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program and you may all disconnect.

Ma'am, you may begin.","Kim Duncan","Good afternoon. And welcome to The Cooper Companies third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. During today's call, we will discuss the results included in the earnings release along with the updated guidance and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Our presenters on today's call are Bob Weiss, Chief Executive Officer; and Al White, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Strategy Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that this call is contained forward-looking statements, including all revenue and earnings per share guidance, and other statements regarding anticipated results of operations, market or regulatory conditions and integration of any acquisitions or their failure to achieve anticipated benefits.","Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods that maybe incorrect or imprecise, and are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Should you have any additional questions following the call, please call our Investor line at 925-460-3663 or e-mail ir@cooperco.com.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Bob for his opening remarks.","Bob Weiss","Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2017 conference call. This was another solid quarter with share gains, improving margins and strong cash flow.","On a consolidated basis, we reported 556 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.64. CooperVision posted another strong quarter with 7% as reported revenue growth or up 8% in constant currency. Daily silicone hydrogel lenses grew 47%, while Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 10% both in constant currency. CooperSurgical posted revenue growth of 13% up 4% pro forma with Fertility up 26% or 6% pro forma.","Moving to the details, CooperVision posted third quarter revenues of 437 million, up 8% in constant currency. By geography, the Americas grew 2%, EMEA grew 13%, and Asia-Pacific grew 13%, all in constant currency. The Americas stands out as it was soft, but based on market data the entire market was soft. We continue to see good data in the Americas so it appears this was an anomaly and we expect stronger growth in future quarters. Overall, revenues continue to be driven by our silicone hydrogel lenses led by MyDay and Clariti in daily space and Biofinity in the monthly space.","Regarding daily, our two tier approach within the daily silicone hydrogel space allows doctors to offer premium in mass markets lenses with the latest materials. MyDay is our premium daily silicone hydrogel lens and is offered as a very high quality sphere and toric. Our Clariti products are sold on a mass-market basis and remain the only daily silicone hydrogel lenses family with the sphere, toric, and a multifocal offering.","In addition, Clariti is competitively priced against several daily hydrogel products that we maintained a nice competitive advantage. Overall, we continue to believe where it deserves the healthiest modality compared with the highest quality, oxygen permeable materials to ensure the best health for the eye. This is done with daily lenses using silicone hydrogel lenses such as MyDay and Clariti.","Moving to other products, Biofinity continues to perform extremely well all around the world. This includes the full product offering of spheres, torics, multifocals along with our expanded offerings of Biofinity Energys and Biofinity XR Toric. We continue to see diversified geographic strength from Biofinity and expect solid performance for many years to come.","Within the two-week space, we're continuing to transition wearers to our upgraded Avaira Vitality lens from our legacy Avaira products. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, this is a large and time-consuming endeavor, but I'm happy to say our customers are receiving this upgrade very positively. Our timing remains the same which is to finish the transition by roughly the end of fiscal 2018.","Turning to product categories, we remain the global leader in torics which grew a solid 11% in constant currency, primarily driven by Clariti one-day Toric and Biofinity Toric along with the rollout of MyDay Toric in Europe. We believe there's still a lot of room for growth in this category both by modality and by geography. Multifocals grew 7% in constant currency, we have a diversified set of products in this space and arguably the best multifocal design on the market with Biofinity multifocal and we expect continued growth.","Turning to the global contact lens market, for calendar Q2 we grew 7% versus the market that was up 4%. This included growing faster than the market in each geography with the Americas growing 2% against the market, up 1%. EMEA growing 11% versus the market up 6% and Asia-Pacific growing 12% versus the market up 8%. By modality, single uses lenses continued driving growth with CDI up 14% and the market up 12%. And finally CDI's non-single use lenses grew 4% while the market declined 3%.","On a trailing 12 month basis, CooperVision also reported very strong numbers growing 8% versus the market up 4%. Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% market growth driven by the continuing shift to improve technology such as wider suite of silicone hydrogel lenses, the continuing trade up to dailies and to specialty lenses, geographic expansion and the expansion of the wearer base particularly outside the United States. And given our strength in these areas along with our broad private label offering, we expect to continue growing faster than the market.","Turning to a different topic, we completed the acquisition of a small specialty contact lens company named Procornea in August. This added a leading ortho-k technology to our lens portfolio and increases access to several fast-growing myopia control markets. This acquisition supports our specialty lens strategy led by our MiSight products. Myopia control is currently in its infancy, but we are developing a nice specialty lens platform to remain a leader as this market starts taking shape. Note, the financial terms of this acquisition were not disclosed.","Moving to CooperSurgical, we reported third quarter revenues of 119 million, up 13% driven by organic growth and acquisition. On a pro forma basis, we grew 4% in Fertility with Fertility leading the way up 26% or 6% pro forma. This quarter was an improvement over the last two quarters, and I believe Q4 will continue another step up in the right direction.","With the IVF, we are continuing to work through integration matters, but we are making progress. We're also continuing to execute on our growth strategy as the global leader in medical devices and genetic testing within the Fertility space. The IVF space remains a global market with long-term, strong growth dynamics and we look forward to continuing our positive trends.","Our office and surgical products business grew 1% for the quarter, with strength in our disposable hysteroscope EndoSee offset by weakness in the older product lines. Before turning it over to Al, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for their hard work and dedication. I also want to especially send our best wishes to those impacted by the storm in Texas including our employees located in that area.","And now, I will turn it over to Al.","Al White","Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Bob covered revenues, so let me focus on the rest of the financials and guidance.","For the quarter, consolidated gross margins were 64.8%, up nicely from 63.6% last year with both CooperVision and CooperSurgical posting improved gross margins year-over-year. CooperVision's gross margins were 65.5%, up from 64.2% last year, driven by the product mix shift gains and currency, partially offset by higher cost inventory tied to our annual plant shutdowns in fiscal Q1.","As a reminder, our inventory turns through the P&L over six months, so our plant shutdowns in fiscal Q1 resulted in higher cost inventory turning through the P&L in our fiscal third quarter. Bob mentioned the Avaira transition and I want to comment quickly that we did experience higher sequential cost associated with switching patient from Avaira to Avaira Vitality mostly from writing off inventory.","Having said that, we excluded these unique transition costs totaling 2.8 million for non-GAAP repurposes. To be clear, this is a very positive transition for us as we are providing a high quality replacement product while realizing manufacturing improvements to significantly improve future gross margins. We expect we will see most of this benefit in the back half of next year and into fiscal 2019.","CooperSurgical posted a nice bump in gross margins to 62.4%, up a 120 basis points from 61.2% last year. These improvements were driven by success around our integration efforts within Fertility along with the margin improvement in our base medical device business. Consolidated operating expenses grew 10.5% in the quarter driven by investments throughout the Company.","We spent time in prior quarters discussing investments including our sales force expansion, but I want to highlight that we expanded our investment activity this past quarter to include other parts of the business such as distribution. It's important to remember our revenue growth has been strong for many years and we believe that will continue for many more years.","As such, we need to ensure our infrastructure is capable of meeting our higher throughput and more stringent customer demand. Ensuring, we maintain a strong global distributions platform is at the top of this list. Combining these investments with other areas such as sales and marketing, the SG&A spending will likely remain elevated.","Regarding the financial impact of this quarter and into the future, we use currency upside to support these investments and we will continue to do so. We had currency as a headwind for many years in tightening our belt. So, it's nice to have currency as a tailwind to now support needed infrastructure investment.","Moving to operating income, we grew OI by 9.5% with operating margins improving to 25.9% from 25.6% last year. Below operating income, we reported 8.3 million of interest expense and our effective tax rate was 6%, both in line with our expectation. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.64 with roughly 49.6 million average shares outstanding.","Moving to the balance sheet, total debt decreased to $174 million in the quarter to approximately $1.21 billion. This pay down was driven by strong cash flow and a reduction in cash balances. Regarding cash flow, we posted a $117 million of free cash comprised of roughly a $115 million of operating cash flow offset by $30 million of CapEx.","Before moving to guidance, I want to mention the CooperVision has recently entered into a settlement agreement with respect to the class action complaints relating to UPP or Unilateral Pricing Policy. The settlement includes a payment of $3 million and is still subject to court approval. We have excluded the settlement accrual and related costs from our non-GAAP earnings.","Regarding guidance for fiscal Q4, we are guiding CooperVision revenues to 435 million to 445 million, up roughly 5% to 7.5% pro forma, against the tough 11% cap. And note, I am highlighting pro forma rather than just constant currency as we're including the small revenue from CooperVision's Procornea acquisition in the prior quarter to provide a true organic growth rate.","CooperSurgical's Q4 revenue guidance is 117 million to 120 million, a roughly 3% to 6% pro forma. Regarding non-GAAP EPS, we are guiding to $2.60 to $2.70 up roughly 9.5% effective tax rate. Within this guidance is an assumption that severe flooding in Texas negatively impact CooperVision revenue by 2 million, CooperSurgical's revenue by 1 million and EPS by roughly $0.03.","On a full year basis, this translates the raising consolidated revenue guidance to 2.129 billion to 2.142 billion with CooperVision at 1.67 billion to 1.68 billion and CooperSurgical at 459 million to 452 million. We are also increasing our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to $9.66 to $9.76.","Before concluding, I would like to make a brief comment about next fiscal year. We are comfortable stating that we expect as reported non-GAAP EPS growth to be in the low double-digits for fiscal 2018. This includes assumptions around the investments I discussed earlier. In other words, we anticipate using at least some of the recent positive currency tailwinds to support our continuing infrastructure expansion plan.","With that, let me conclude by saying, we remain focused on expanding our business and gaining global market share while delivering consistent solid financial results. And this quarter was certainly another step in that direction.","And with that, I will hand it back to the operator for the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And now our first question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Brian Weinstein","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I am wondering if you could it talk at all about any kind of pricing benefit that you guys are seeing. I know you've raised some pricing on strategic lenses in April. What benefit has that been giving you? And can you talk about the difference how you're going about your price increases versus how some of your competitors do that? And did that cause any kind of an issue in the market? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Sure, Brian. Pricing gets a lot of questions and has historically got a lot of questions. It is true there are some competitors raising prices -- list prices. It's also true that as an industry we've been trading up, we've been more about trading up. So, 90% of the action of growth in the industry is trading up, less than 10% has anything to do with pricing and that's been that way forever for 30 years. So pricing sometimes is a tactic, it allows you to do things as you are shifting wares from a two week modality into a one day and a one month modality. So, you may do something with your list prices.","At the end of the day, it's the net growth that matters, it's the trading up that matters. And I would say pricing is nothing more than a minor tactic in achieving whatever you're trying to do. The industry has done a phenomenal job of moving now people out of the two weeks space into the monthly, into the one day space. The growth of the industry the last four years plus has been the one day modality in the U.S.; and for the last 10 years, it's been the one day modality outside U.S. So, I'm not going to comment too much more on the granularity of pricing tactics.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joanne Wuensch","Hi, thank you very much for taking my question. Two of them. One, could you please walk us through your EPS guidance bridge roughly $0.14 at the midpoint that you raised it? How much of that is from tax, FX and probably some other components in there?","Bob Weiss","Al, you want to?","Al White","I'll take that one. Yes, from a tax perspective, we came in probably just a little lighter maybe than expecting in Q3, but Q4 as we guided to 9.5%. So for a full year basis, we're probably you know in that 7.5 little bit north of that maybe range. So I wouldn't put much in there from tax. From an FX perspective that's a little bit of a different story. We had about $0.06, $0.16 -- I am sorry, $0.16 benefit from FX this quarter.","And when we look at Q4, we have about a $0.12 FX benefit, so some nice benefit coming from currency in Q3 and Q4. We obviously invested a lot of that and as I talked about, we're taking the opportunity here to do some upgrades especially within distribution throughout the business to ensure we meet customer demand going forward. And there really wasn't much else there, so it's pretty much driven by, doing what we were doing. And then outside from foreign exchange [Indiscernible] reinvest in the infrastructure and business.","Joanne Wuensch","Thanks. So, here's my second question is, last quarter you're helpful to give us some idea of how fast you are ramping up your sales force. Could you give us an idea of where the sales force hires are and how the productivity is progressing? Thank you.","Al White","Yes, I would say that we have put a lot of energy the last 12 months into sales force expansion. And while I won't quote exact numbers in terms of feet on the street, I would say we have expanded our sales force year-over-year 20% in vision. So a lot more feet on the street, we're still under indexed against all of our primary competitors and even a smaller competitor. Having said that, the productivity I think is reflective in the fact that we continue to grow twice the markets. So we're getting a lot of results out of that expanded feet on the street. It does take 9 to 12 months to have sales persons fully productive, so we\u2019re still marching up that curve very nicely.","It's a global expansion. It's not only the U.S. So, we continue to find Asia-Pacific as largely been a bootstrap pay as you go basis, but hire as many as you need to continue to expand your coverage in Asia-Pac. In Europe, we're borderline almost number one now in the marketplace neck-and-neck with Alcon and continue to add two feet on the street in Europe also. So, it's going very well. We're happy with the progress. We're happy with the availability of what is out there to have and attract into the CooperVision family.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeff Johnson","Bob, I wondered first questions if you could just talk on the North American market, obviously, it came in a little softer than we might expected. I think the numbers at the end of the press release are growing, so that I don't it includes the promotional activities, but maybe if you could just talk about kind of what you think is going on in the North America market this quarter? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Sure. Yes, you're going to have to mute I think there is something because it is in the background, okay, that's good. Yes, the Americas, the North Americas, as I indicated was soft, we think the on eye activity is good. So, the throughput is good, the trading up is phenomenal going from two week to one day. So really some of the anomaly I think if we look at the last six quarters since J&J started their activity and whether it's the migration from UPP or whether it's consolidation of distribution whether it's some of the tactics that J&J has used in the marketplace by way changing distribution channels, there is a host of activities that could lead to tough comps and hard to figure out what's going on. Net, net, net over a multiyear period and I have to go multiyear even though our UC like to go 12-months, the market is very good. But I must admit it's been I'd say one quarter does not a trend make. This quarter clearly is not indicative of a trend nor do I think it's indicative of the market strength, which is fine on a -- clearly on our worldwide basis. Sorry, I don't have a better answer than that, but it's -- I would admit it's pretty squirrelly.","Jeff Johnson","Okay. And a very quick follow-up for Al maybe promotional activity on Clariti and MyDay went up [Indiscernible] May 1st. CVI gross margin maybe a bit softer than we were looking for. Can you quantify any impact of those promotions? Or was it much to the P&L at all this quarter? Thanks.","Al White","Yes, it's challenging to quantify that, right. No, I would say, it was not a big impact to the quarter though suffice it to say.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Larry Keusch","Two quick ones. Bob, you sort of mentioned this. But can you talk a little bit about the recent trends in the two-week segment of the market? My sense is that, that category is accelerating in its erosion, if you will. So, I am just curious, if, A, you think that, that's consistent with what you are seeing and what you guys are really doing to try to continue capture those two-week patients as they come loose? And then the second question for Al is, could you just -- I am really just trying to think about next year's cash flow generation and obviously CapEx is very cyclical for your business. So I just wanted to get some sense of how you are thinking about CapEx needs for next year?","Bob Weiss","I will deal with the first one. You are absolutely right. There is an acceleration of the two-week space shifting into the daily and to a lesser extent the monthly. We have been putting up pretty good Biofinity numbers. So yes some of them are waiting for the monthly category. I applaud the efforts that J&J has in that arena. They are about 90% of that market or a little more. So that's the wear base. And we want that wear base and they know it out of the two-week and to other spaces and primarily the one day modality.","Since they have adopted that strategy, really when they came out with the one-week product and then the one day product meaning a one-week oasis and then a one day oasis, they have really accelerated the depth of that two-week space. And we find that, we are getting our fair share. Obviously, when you look at the Clariti and MyDay numbers 47% growth over a higher base, so year-after-year that base goes up and it continues to grow very impressively. And clearly the U.S. is a big part of that growth because of that shift from the two-week into the one day space.","Al White","Yes, I would say on the CapEx question. Obviously, we are closing out a strong year here. We are going to have free cash flow well in north of 400 and our CapEx looking like it's going to be in light 150. I would say that because of the way it's calculated in terms of whey you write the check, I think that we will close out strong year. It would not surprise me if next year's CapEx -- I would be surprised but not higher, certainly could be in that 150 to 200 depending upon what we do.","As I mentioned distribution as an example, wouldn't surprise me if we have new distribution facility as an example in each business next year. So I could see -- certainly see CapEx being higher next year. On the flip side, our operating cash flow will continue to grow and year-over-year free cash flow continued to improve. So fiscal '17, strong close to the year should result in strong free cash flow. Fiscal '18 even with higher CapEx, if we have it, it's going to be an even stronger free cash flow year as what I would say at this point.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Larry Biegelsen","I have one for Bob on the Americas, one for Al on 2018. I will try to ask them both upfront, if you need me to clarify, I will. But Bob back to the Americas, I mean the 12 months, it's been weak -- the last 12 months have been week. So, it's not just a one quarter phenomenon, I guess what I'm trying to understand is what gives you the confidence that it's going to recover, if it's unclear based on your earlier answer exactly what's going on. I mean one theory is that it was the destocking a year ago, and that's just kind of rolling out. So can you give us any color as to why you're confident you know that the market will recover? You know, it's not just a J&J phenomenon obviously your results in the Americas have also been depressed. So a little bit more color on that would be helpful? And then second for Al, you talked about EPS, but you didn\u2019t talk about sales. Consensus right now is about 7% on the top line. I'm assuming that underlying excluding currency. Are you guys comfortable with that? And is currency about a 3% tailwind to sales and $0.60 to EPS next year? Thanks for taking the questions guys.","Bob Weiss","Okay, on the Americas. Our confidence really comes back to -- if we look at from a four year perspective the Americas has done well. More like 4% and we do have the acceleration of the trading up and keep in mind I've mentioned in the past that a trade up of an oasis non-compliant wear is 800% trade up to an oasis one-day compliant wear. So two week non-compliant referring it as a monthly and buying it in -- available in a two year supply because they buy a one year supply at two weeks which turns into a two year supply on a monthly basis.","They then shift to buying 730 lenses and they're very compliant because they don't have lens care regimens and all that stuff. So, we're highly confident that once you get through the noise level of everything that's gone on including just how much J&J sells the pipeline in the third and fourth quarters of 2015 that kind of created anomalies throughout the next period.","And to including some of the antics of going direct, trying to go around the middle man and to including some of the consolidation going on with partnerships of large retailers, so there's a lot of moving parts, but underlying that is the market that looks very healthy from a wearer perspective and a trading up perspective. So, we're highly confident, we'll see normalized correlation between that shift and the revenue line in the future.","Al White","And Larry when it comes to guidance, I'm not going to provide too much color yet. It\u2019s a little early. The business has obviously been performing well from a top line perspective and we don't fluctuate significantly. So, we'll see how that plays out, but I don't want to give specific numbers on that yet or frankly with respect to currency as much as the markets move. You know making the statement that we\u2019re comfortable staying low double digits and use 11% as the midpoint you can argue that that's conservative. And certainly when you look at our Q4 guidance here of 14 to 18% as reported, we obviously strive for stronger numbers. At this point in time though, still months and months and months away from next year and giving guidance, I think it\u2019s prudent to just stick with where we are right now. And we'll update it accordingly when we get on the December call.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Willoughby","Good afternoon thanks for taking my call. I had a question. Two questions for you. First on the CSI business, if I remember correctly a quarter ago, you commented how you saw some of the headwinds of that business were going to abate here in the third quarter. And so just if could provide any more color on exactly what's going on there? And how long you expect the pressure you are seeing on the office business to continue? And then I guess just one last question on the Americas, Bob, do you think there is any impact from the increase rebating activity sort of pulling forward demand because there is just more annual supply sales happening these days?","Al White","No, I think the surgical.","Bob Weiss","Yes, I think surgical price. The third part it was to touch weaker than certainly at least I was expecting it was going to be the Fertility business did okay there was still some integration activity and the probably linger to little bit longer than I thought it was going to.","So I think it we will see a little bit stronger fourth quarter performance there. The base there is so, yes, there is a lot of legacy products there so, EndoSee, as Bob mentioned are disposable history to scope is doing really well and we're continuing to make a lot of progress there, but some of the base products are a little bit harder to get moving there.","So I still think that business is more along wise of the 3% to 4%, 5% maybe kind of growth business that component that base business component of it. So that was a little bit lighter it's hard to get into the any individual quarter and pinpoint the specific issues associated with it, but I do think you'll see a little bit of improvement on that in Q4 also.","Al White","On rebating particularly into the Americas, I think there is a silver lining to the whole of rebating. I think you are right that the rebating activity has increased and that makes sense when you think about what we're doing as an industry moving from the two weeks space and trying to provide that incentive to and do you fit in the one day modality. So there is a lot of energy is being spent on trial you'll like it. If we can get to there to try it once you realize how convenient it is, they'll probably stay and not go back ever again because it's just too convenient, and I speak as the user not and not only as user who used to clean the lenses every day.","So I don\u2019t worry about cleaning lenses every day. I throw them away every day. So the strategy of rebating and creating that extra incentive to say hey net, net, net this is not to expensive right now. Keep in mind there is a list price, now, list price is getting higher and higher relative to the net. And so I can net out take my money and spending our lens care and shifted into the one day modality and feel real good about that and the convenience lone behold down the road, it could be that the rebates start diminishing, once you're a new fit and no longer a new fit, but a re-user who knows what will happen.","So I think more important to have your list price, full list price of that cards or list price of the hotel room, I don\u2019t care what list price you are talking about where you suddenly provide a $1,000 list and the $500 refund well. It's a $1,000 list and a $1,000 bill certain times, so that's kind of same in this industry as every other industry on how you play that out.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks. Al, I wanted to start by circling back on the guidance update and the impact to currency here. So you guys have been looking for currency to be neutral for the year which implied about a 2% -- sorry $0.02 headwinds in the back half. Now, it sounds like there is actually going to be $0.28 positive in the back half, so the implication is that on a constant currency basis full-year guidance came down by about $0.15. Is that math correct, and if so, what\u2019s driving that?","Al White","Yes, I mean, I am not sure exactly how to and in terms of what's driving it, I mean obviously currency has been moved in our favor. So, when you look at it, the numbers are roughly correct, that\u2019s true. I mean some of these are given ranges especially on forward-looking guidance, but that\u2019s true. The answer to that though is the investment side. So when we gave guidance last quarter, we saw the currency strength, already it\u2019s a matter of fact that when we guided we guided with some relatively conservative FX rates. And we were getting in front of especially distribution is the best example I can give.","You guys have heard, you\u2019ve done survey work and you\u2019ve heard some distribution issues that we\u2019ve talked about it in the past. We have a lot more volume going through our distribution center. A lot of our business is driven by daily growth. We have -- customers are demanding a higher level of excellence when it comes to shipping that\u2019s both through within Vision and Surgical. Our business is about growing and growing pretty consistently. So we are getting in front of that and we started that at beginning of last quarter.","Now it\u2019s much easier to do that so to speak and report good numbers when you have currency at your back. We went a number of years when we were fighting currency. And so putting up pretty good numbers in the face of currency and now it\u2019s kind of flipped the other side. So we are taking advantage if you will of the currency situation to invest some of those dollars.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Matthew O'Brien","Thanks so much. So two questions. Al, can you just be a little more specific on how much you\u2019re going to be investing between this year and next year? How much of its coming this year and how much of its coming next year and exactly where those investments are going to be going domestic versus international? And then may be for Bob, on the Procornea side, that asset I think if I know it has a pretty sound presence in China. Is there an opportunity to accelerate your contact lens business in China as a result of that acquisition? And then myopia control as a segment I think can be overtime hundreds of millions of dollars. I mean when do you think that acceleration in that market occurs, is it sometime this decade? Thanks.","Al White","I mean a lot of investment is going be offshore. So obviously I mentioned distribution a couple of times and you are going to continue to see that. We will have probably a couple of new distribution centers coming up within Vision and Surgical and an expansion of existing distribution centers. So you\u2019re going to see a lot of activity there. We are not going to hold back on sales and marketing investments either. And as we\u2019ve mentioned, Bob has talked you through, we are at around 2 times in the market. We have a lot of momentum, a lot of really good products. We are going to continue to invest dollars in both business to drive market share gain.","So you are going to see that, and when you look at how much, some of that\u2019s frankly to be honest with you gets dependent upon currency. I mean if the euro outwards that and continue to give us the opportunity to do some investments, we are going to take advantage of that. A lot of those are variable factors and we can be around that. But we do believe in the long-term of the business and we are going to invest accordingly.","Bob Weiss","On Procornea, we obviously haven\u2019t given a lot of air time at this juncture. But you are correct that big part of their business is in fact in China. Relative to whether or not and to what degree that will allow us to accelerate, our overall franchise in China, I would assume yes there will be some benefits, but quite frankly a lot of what makes, what's okay and what Procornea is about and myopia control, it\u2019s pretty much in the hands of a specialty area where people really focusing on what it takes to slow the progress of myopia particularly in younger generation, younger part of the generation.","So I don't think there's a real lot of spill over there. We are tremendously excited about the space, but we also are realistic to say this can be a long haul development. Myopia's going up around the world significantly. It\u2019s gone from you know basically 20% of the world and it will be approaching 50% of the population by 2050 and directionally, it's clearly headed that way. What's causing it very much is taking people off rural area the countryside, putting them in schools is one of the leading thoughts.","Having less natural sunlight is a thought. Whatever the real reason is, it\u2019s clear that myopia is going up around the world and that the world will need a better portfolio of products to address high myops which run into problem later in life with retinal detachments and various other forms of eye challenges, so we're excited about it but it\u2019s not going to be immediate so we're looking beyond the next five years I think in terms of where it starts moving the needle.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Andrew Hanover with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Andrew Hanover","Thanks for taking our questions. So I thought I'd start with Al with my first question and then follow it up with Bob for my second. But I wanted to Al just go over guidance real quick and just understand CVI five to seven at pro forma guidance? And what the contribution was in terms of the acquisition last quarter I would say a year ago? And then Bob on torics and multifocals have somewhat of an easier comp this quarter, you're launching Clariti Toric in the U.S. and MyDay Toric in Europe. Any color you can give there in terms of some of the pushes and pulls in the quarter?","Al White","Yes, couple of comments on CooperVision revenue that we did not disclose the financial terms details of that acquisition, but it was small. So I can tell you there's a minimal impact to revenues on CooperVision from that. If you look at our guidance from CooperVision from last quarter to this quarter certainly some of that was currency, as we saw the improvement in currency within the business, but it would take -- we actually take the business up even more than that. So operationally, the underlying fundamentals of CooperVision are very strong and the kind of 5% to 7.5% growth that's given for the next quarter would be an improvement, right, the only reason that it looks like it\u2019s less than an as reported basis is because we're coming off a lot of different comps.","Bob Weiss","On the dynamics of toric and multifocals, we have a lot of activities going on around the world both as to products and as to geography. In terms of a lot of activities that's leading to solid growth in Asia-Pac with MyDay Toric continuing to roll out there and torics in general by far the most mature market in the world and that's a relative term not really mature is the Americas where Torics are far advanced compared to the rest of the world by a factor of more than 50%, meaning there's a lot more penetration.","For example in Japan and Germany, there has been a history in the past of dealing with astigmatism by RGPs, big in Germany, big in Japan, but new -- the newer generation, the young adults are not getting RGPs. They are getting torics when they have astigmatism. So, tremendous growth opportunity is there. We're happy with the numbers we're putting up. We're happy with some of the progress we've made with MyDay Toric, which is early in the game in terms of rolling it out now into your and later next year in the U.S. We're happy with Biofinity extended range, the made to order. So a lot of good things that should keep a solid momentum in that specialty contact lens area.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Jon Block","First one Bob or Al maybe just the optimal capital structure [indiscernible] chatter out there that there were certain limits health assets that might be for sale. I know you are not going to comment specifically on those assets. But can you talk to your leverage or appetite for more acquisitions in CSI considering it still seems like the integration is going on with some of the deals that we've done last year? That's the first question. And the second one just small P&L question. Any details on the 3.2 million other income gain in the quarter, an lastly Al, I want to make sure I heard you as the 2.8 million that was excluded from non-GAAP results that was specific to the Vitality transition, that's the case and it was excluded in this quarter, but not the past couple because it was larger than expected? Thanks guys.","Al White","Yes, let me write a couple off here something if you want. The Vitality you are right 2.8 million, it was something like a $1 million or maybe a little bit less last quarter. We had not called it out at that point. Now, it's moved up to a point here where I think it's worthwhile to actually highlight as we mentioned. It will occur again I think probably a similar amount in Q4, probably again in Q1. And then it will tail off that transition is getting done. So I don\u2019t believe it's ever going to be that larger to the number, but it's important enough I think from our perspective to be transparent kind of highlight that.","If you look at the 3.2 million the other income and there are lot of that' is going to be associated with foreign exchange, so that's going to be below the line FX gains on our intercompany loan. So we kind of see that fluctuate, you will see that the gains on quarter see at as a loss on quarters that just kind of maneuvers around currency, but that's what the majority of that would have been. If you look at our optimal capital structure, I guess the way I'd say I look at it is this quarter our bank defined net funded debt to EBITDA, which is the way I look at it, it was 1.71 time. So from a leverage perspective, we're probably a little bit on the light side right now.","Obviously, we look at things like investing in the business, we look at acquisitions, we look at share buybacks and so forth as different avenues and enhanced shareholder value and we will continue to do that. I think that from a leverage perspective defined that way. If you start getting below 1.5 times or certainly as you move toward the one or lower, you are getting yourself kind of unlevered in today's lower interest rate world. If you are going to be move up towards north of three or certainly as you move towards 3.5, if you were to move that high right here you would have to raise a question mark on that as your leverage risk is going to go up.","Operator","Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. This does conclude today\u2019s Q&A session. I would now like to return the call to Mr. Robert Weiss for any closing remarks.","Bob Weiss","Well, I want to thank you for joining us today for an update on how the year is progressing. We have a lot of positive activities going on as you can see. We look forward to updating you as we approach and come out with our year-end numbers. and I believe that\u2019s on December the 7th. And so, we look forward to giving you an update at that time. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. That does conclude the program.

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator for today.","At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.  Later we will be conducting a question-and-answer session.  (Operator Instructions).  Today's event is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Kim Duncan, Senior Director of Investor Relations.  Please go ahead.","Kim Duncan","Good afternoon, and welcome to The Cooper Companies' second quarter 2012 earnings conference call.  I'm Kim Duncan, Senior Director of Investor Relations.  And joining me on today's call are Bob Weiss, President and Chief Executive Officer; Greg Matz, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Al White, VP, Investor Relations, Treasurer and Chief Strategic Officer.","Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including all revenue and earnings per share guidance, and other statements regarding anticipated results of operations, market conditions and integration of any acquisitions.","Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise, and are subject to risks and uncertainties.

These are publicly available and on request from the company's Investor Relations department.","Now, before I turn the call over to Bob, let me comment on the agenda.  Bob will begin by providing highlights on the quarter, followed by Greg who will then discuss the second quarter financial results.  We will keep the formal presentation to roughly 30 minutes then open up the call for questions.  We expect the call to last approximately one hour.","We request that anyone asking questions, please limit yourselves to one question.

As a reminder, this call is being webcast and a copy of the earnings release is available through the Investor Relations section of the Cooper Companies' website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob for his opening remarks.","Bob Weiss","Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon and evening, everyone.  We continue to maintain the same strategy and we continue to execute on it.  This quarter was another successful step within our long-range objectives of taking market share, posting gross margin expansion, investing in infrastructure, delivering double digit earnings per share growth and delivering significant free cash flow.","Let me address the elephant in the room, however, and that's our results versus analyst expectations.  First off, as we discussed last quarter, we did have costs tied to the Avaira recall, the start-up costs on the single-use silicone hydrogel lens, Biofinity start-up costs in Puerto Rico, and higher manufacturing costs for Avaira, so nothing new on that side.","More importantly, for new items, if you will, year-over-year currency reduced revenues $4.8 million or $0.07 in earnings per share.  Outside of that was another $0.02 for shutdown expenses associated with our Australian manufacturing plant and a smaller amount of start-up -- or shutdown costs tied in with our CooperSurgical acquisition of Summit Doppler which was acquired in 2011.  Most of these were built into our previous annual guidance we provided in the first quarter of 2012 or our call in March.","In fact, overall, we were quite pleased with much of our progress and particularly our gross margins.  Even given the current foreign exchange impact and the overall economy, we have left intact of our guidance range for the year excluding the charges associated with the recent credit refinancing or the non-GAAP, if you will.","Some other key events or takeaways today to consider, our strong cash flow led us in the quarter to get upgraded by S&P to a triple-B-minus in investment grade.  This update in our financial strength also led to a recent amend and extend of our credit agreement, increasing our credit to a $1 billion line of credit, lowering our interest borrowing grid, eliminating our term loans and extending our lines of credit for the $1 billion to May 2017 or 16 months.","We recently announced a very exciting acquisition where we have tendered to purchase Origio, the world's number one IVF company.  This is a perfect fit with our existing IVF business which has been doing great.  One other very important note of course is the relaunch of Avaira Toric following receipt of clearance from the FDA.","Our silicone hydrogel family is driving our growth.  During the second quarter, our silicone hydrogel family continued on its path to sponsoring our overall revenue growth.  Silicon revenues -- silicone hydrogel revenues were up 32% to $103.8 million in constant currency.  The family now reflects 36% of CVI\u2019s -- or CooperVision's sales.  The exciting rollout of Biofinity Multifocal [into $150 million] plus silicone hydrogel multifocal market continues.","We are very pleased to now be returning to the marketplace with our Avaira Toric relaunch.  This will once again allow us to aggressively get behind the Avaira product family targeting the two-week part of the US  market, which accounts for over 50% of U.S. market and is largely owned by J&J's Vistakon.","Geographically, foreign exchange has taken its toll on the second quarter.  Foreign exchange negatively impacted CooperVision sales by 1.7%, almost 2%, or $4.6 million.  This is the first meaningful foreign exchange headwinds we've had in quite a while.  CooperVision revenue growth was 6% in constant currency.  Regionally, we have had solid results in constant currency with perhaps the Americas being somewhat the soft spot for out-the-door revenues during the fiscal quarter, reflecting softness in the market in the last two weeks of April which rebounded quite nicely in May.","Recently, the Americas was up in constant currency 4% during the quarter, Europe up 6%, Asia Pacific up 10%, overall worldwide 6% in constant currency.  Our growth drivers were in the Americas trading up to Biofinity including the success of Biofinity Multifocal, as well as the solid performance in the 1 Day category by Proclear 1 Day Sphere.  In Europe, it was same as the Americas, Biofinity, including Biofinity Multifocal sponsoring growth.  In Asia Pacific, primarily the Biofinity Sphere launched in Japan and Proclear 1 Day Sphere throughout the region.","The overall soft contact lens business grew in constant currency 6% during the calendar quarter or in the first quarter of 2012, while CVI CooperVision was up 12% in constant currency.  On a trailing 12-month basis, a key way we look at it, the market was up 5%, and we were up 9% on the strength of Biofinity and Proclear 1 Day.  For the calendar quarter, the market grew -- growth was sponsored by silicone hydrogels, multifocals, torics and 1 Days.  I might point out that silicone hydrogel information typically in our earnings release is not there.  It was not available from industry sources on a worldwide basis.","The market continues to be a trade-up market with geographic expansion an accelerating contributor.  Trading up includes the premium products, silicone hydrogel, lenses, torics and multifocals.  Trade-up to a silicone hydrogel is a 20% to 40% increase.  More importantly, a trade up to a one-day disposable gross revenue per patient 400% to 600%.  The one-day wear generates 300% to 500% more profit.  Toric and multifocal have a long way to go capturing the market opportunity particularly outside the US.  Geographically, softness in Europe for the quarter plus 2% was more than made up by a strong Americas which was up 10%.","CooperSurgical, our women's healthcare franchise, had another solid quarter.  With $57 million in revenues, it was up 13% or 8% excluding acquisitions.  Drivers continue to be surgical procedures, hospital and same-day surgery, where revenue was up 22% and now accounts for 39% of CooperSurgical.  Devices used by gynecologists during laparoscopic procedures such as closure systems, retractors, injectors, uterine manipulators and related trades are driving the growth in this area.","Importantly, these are high-margin items.  CooperSurgical\u2019s overall gross profit margin during the quarter achieved a very impressive 68%, while its operating income hit another all-time high of 29%.","As I\u2019ve commented frequently in the past, we will look for ways to continue to leverage this franchise.  Our recently announced acquisition targeting Origio in IVF does just that.  With this acquisition, we will be number one in the global position in IVF, a market that is truly global in nature.  I might add without getting too much into the details of how it will operate within Cooper, turning idle cash yielding 0.4% of interest into a return on invested capital well north of 10% is a great way to maximize our return on invested capital and related shareholder return.  Like anything else, sometimes acquisitions become a show-me story.  At any rate, we are excited by the possibilities of the Origio strategic fit to our global CooperSurgical business to leverage our use of free cash flow and to maximize our global tax structures.","Guidance, we refresh our guidance even with the headwinds caused by foreign exchange, including the impact of our second quarter top and bottom line of foreign exchange, we are not changing our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance.  Not only do the fundamentals of our business remain strong, but we have essentially completed most of our hiring and now expect SG&A to remain relatively flat in the third quarter and the fourth quarter.  In other words, we'll start leveraging our selling and marketing investments of the past two years.","And so I know, a lot of you might have questions of how big was foreign exchange headwinds -- how big was it?  Let's say, it was big.  In addition to a $0.11 year-to-date impact on earnings per share, including $0.04 from the first quarter, there is a $0.19 impact at the current rates in the third quarter and a $0.14 impact in the fourth quarter once again at the current rates.  Recall the euro was at its highest point in our fiscal third quarter last year when it averaged $1.43.  It's now off of those exchange rates 13%.  For the year that -- then, we've built in $0.44 of headwinds into our 2011 comps into our guidance.","Our GAAP guidance has been adjusted for refinancing, but not for the potential impact of a successful Origio tender offer.  We are, however, more comfortable with increasing the lower end of our guidance for revenue.  We have taken the top end of our -- I'm sorry, we\u2019ve taken our top end of CVI guidance down $5 million and the top end of CooperSurgical up the same amount, reflecting the strength of CooperSurgical's year-to-date results.","The top end lowering at CVI reflects the weakness due to foreign exchange.  We remain optimistic that some of our new CVI launches, Proclear 1 Day Multifocal, single-use silicone hydrogel lenses and Biofinity Toric into Japan, and the relaunch of Avaira Toric will sustain constant currency revenue growth in the second half of 2012, allowing us to continue to gain share on a trailing 12-month basis.","We are continuing with our successful strategy.  We believe it is solid, and it has delivered results.  CooperSurgical is putting up outstanding results and is leveraging its infrastructure.  This franchise was built with the solid understanding of value of critical mass in a women's healthcare market targeting the OB\/GYN.","We follow the professionals wherever they go, office, surgi center, hospital or IVF centers.  Although the call points are different for each, the leverage is considerable.  CooperSurgical's second quarter 2012 gross profit was 68%, its operating margins 29%.  And due to minimal CapEx requirements, CooperSurgical is a significant contributor to our free cash flow.  We are dedicated to the strategy and will continue to tuck in -- to do tuck-in acquisitions to leverage the CooperSurgical infrastructure.","At CooperVision, the strategy is more complex and it is much more global in nature.  In the $7 billion soft contact lens industry, because of the uniqueness of our manufacturing platform and product portfolio, we are the only participant that promote silicone hydrogel and non- silicone hydrogel lenses that is the Proclear family.","We emphasize branded and non-branded products.  Note, private-label, you may recall, does not mean lowering the price.  In fact, we actively promote and specialize in custom lenses with a high gross profit of course.  We support all modalities that eye care professional prescribes, one-day, two-week and monthly lenses and we support all types of lenses, spheres, torics and multifocals.  With close to 30% share in the high-growth specialty lens categories, torics and multifocals, it is acknowledged by eye care professionals that we're pretty good at specialty contact lenses.","Few would challenge why the success of Biofinity Toric for astigmatism.  Put a great design together with a great material and great things can happen.  We have seen similar success for the same reason with Biofinity Multifocal which shipped to the market in the middle of last year.  On the capacity front, with the exception of Avaira Toric, we are ahead of plan to deliver considerably more product where we had previously been supply constrained.  The Biofinity family, Proclear one-day, our one-day torics are all ramping up nicely.","On pricing, we, like the rest of the soft contact lens industry, have a trade-up strategy.  Our new wearers and existing wearers are targeted for silicone hydrogel lenses, the Proclear family and the one-day or single-use lenses.  Each creates more revenue per wear.  A one-day modality for example results in a 4x to 6x more revenue per wear.  While this strategy sacrifices the gross profit margin i.e. percent, it generally generates three to five times more profit per wear.  Of course, the strategy competes head on with the lens care space since we are shifting the wearers' resources from lens care to contact lenses only.","Competing for lens care dollars is more of a [front] system of our competitors.  In my opinion, we continue to be the most focused company in the industry lacking many of the distractions that some of our competitors are now going through.  I might add, Biofinity, Avaira and Proclear, with them in our portfolio, we have a lot to talk about with eye care professionals around the globe.","As we look down the road over the next several years, we expect to continue improving operating margins and delivering above-average shareholder returns.  We expect to continue to deliver double-digit earnings per share growth while investing in geographic expansion and new product developments.","In today's market, we have a solid product portfolio to leverage in all modalities, multiple materials and all types, and we retain our expertise to emphasize customizing lenses for the 10% to 20% of those wearers requiring other than standard lens sizes and\/or designs.  We have a lot of work to do before we can come anywhere close to having exploited our number one contact lens family Biofinity.","This is particularly true when it comes to geographic expansion and fully developing Biofinity family of torics and multifocals around the world.  The same applies to Avaira where the Avaira Sphere has been anxiously awaiting the relaunch of Avaira Toric.  The combination will put us in a much better position to exploit the US two-week space owned by J&J and to also exploit our private label strategy more aggressively with this family.","While we already have pretty respectable gross profit and operating margins, from a cost perspective, we have considerable upside yet to be fully developed.  Upsides include the elimination of silicone hydrogel royalty in September 2014 in the United States and in March 2016 throughout the rest of the world.  The reduction of our manufacturing costs, among other things, improving molding cycle times, increasing capacity utilization and improving yields in general is also one of our key goals.","Also, given the considerable amount of free cash flow we generate, we will continue to look for tuck-in acquisitions and geographic expansion opportunities in our two businesses that exceed our hurdle rates.  The markets for both women's healthcare and soft contact lenses are so much less developed outside the US.  We generate a considerable amount of cash offshore due in part to our level of manufacturing outside the US.  As such, we will continue to aggressively invest in global expansion opportunities.","With over 95% of the people on the planet outside of the US, we believe we will find opportunities to invest in other countries for decades to come, thereby retaining our low effective tax rate indefinitely.  Finally, as was the case in the first quarter when the stock was suppressed, we even demonstrated we are at times even willing to buy in some of our own stock, although we did not have any purchases this past quarter.","In summary, before I turn it over to Greg, second quarter 2012 moved us down the path to another successful fiscal year in 2012.  We've put up solid market share gains, grew revenue, improved our gross profit and operating margins versus the prior year, delivered solid free cash flow and even restructured and extended our investment grade debt.  Biofinity and Proclear 1 Day are sponsoring solid market share gains even before we roll out Biofinity Toric in Japan, single-use silicones later this year, and the Proclear 1 Day multifocal.  Additionally, we now are re-launching Avaira Toric to hit the US two-week market head-on.","While I didn't comment on it when we -- didn't comment on it, we are starting to see results with our investment in sales and marketing, R&D, mainly D, and geographic expansion.  In spite of an economy that remains sluggish, we remain as an industry recession resistant and believe, consistent with past 30 years, our industry will remain so in the future.","Consistent with our recently announced IVF tender offer for Origio, we expect to continue to complete tuck-in acquisitions to support our women's healthcare franchise.  Finally, lest I forget to remind you, our number one asset is our dedicated employees.  They continue to deliver results even in poor economic times.  To them, once again, a big thank you.","With that I'll turn it over to Greg.","Greg Matz","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone.  Let me just quickly highlight that our Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP numbers are the same.","Bob has given you a pretty thorough view of our revenue picture, so let me start with gross margins.  In Q2, the consolidated gross margins were 64% compared with 62% for GAAP and non-GAAP in Q2 last year.  CooperSurgical had a gross margin of 68%, which compares to Q2 '11 of 65%.  This improvement was mainly due to manufacturing efficiencies and favorable product mix, especially in the surgical space.  As Bob mentioned, products like closure systems and uterine manipulators, to name a couple, continue to do well as they also have better than average gross margins.","Looking at CooperVision, CooperVision reported gross margin just over 63% versus 61.5% in Q2 last year.  As you can see, we had a strong gross margin quarter for this business.  The increase was attributable to many different components like the completion of our Norfolk closure effective last year, which contributed about 130 basis points to CooperVision's gross margin.  In addition, we had favorable product mix with silicone hydrogel sales now representing 36% of revenue, up 29% from last year and 32% on a constant currency basis.","Excuse me.  During the last call, we had a cautious outlook on CooperVision's gross margin due to numerous items which the team was in the early stages of working through.  Our gross margin came in better than planned due to a couple of key items, a host of smaller items which I won't go into, but which seem to all go in the right direction.","We had mentioned the startup of our first Biofinity line in Puerto Rico and the startup costs came in less than expected.  We also had a strong product mix, including continued growth of Biofinity, as well as lower cost for single use silicone than was planned for in Q2.","Going forward, we still have some challenges.  We continue to make progress on the cost side of the Avaira product line, but we do see increased costs overall related to the changes in the process we made as we worked through the recall and improved the product.  As we mentioned last time, the introduction of a single-use silicone lens also will negatively impact gross margins as we will be producing the product for the entire quarter in Q3 versus a partial quarter in Q2.  It's typical to see inefficiency type variance in the early periods for product rollout.  We also continue to look at the currency impact, especially on the revenue line, with the specific impact on gross margins.","All this being said, we are optimistic based on the gross margin progress we've made over the last couple of years, as well as the first half of this year.  We are expecting to see our gross margin for the year being in the range of 63.5% to 64%, with Q4 being a little better than Q3.  As we've discussed in prior years, we do see negative manufacturing variances come through in Q3 related to Q1 inefficiency, including the impact of the large number of holidays, our annual plant shutdown and other types of activities.  Such variances are capitalized and rolled to the P&L five months later as reflective of our inventory turns.","Now, looking at operating expenses, for SG&A, in Q2, SG&A expenses increased by 8% from Q2 last year to $137 million and were 40% of revenue versus 39% in Q2 last year.  This is generally attributable to added investment we have been discussing over the last year, which has resulted in increased sales and marketing expenses for things like free lenses, commissions, new hires associated with generating higher revenue, and expenses for new product launches like Biofinity Multifocal and Proclear 1 Day Multifocal, which was launched in this quarter Q3.","We have seen increased selling investment at both CooperVision as well as CooperSurgical.  Last year, we highlighted that we'd be investing.  The investment really did not start to ramp up until March\/April timeframe, which when you look at the first half of 2012 compared to prior year, it leads to some higher expense growth rates due to the run rate effect of the earlier investments.  To help highlight this impact, SG&A only increased 4% sequentially.","On the R&D front, we have talked about investing in our business and R&D.  It is one of those areas where we continue to make investments.  In Q2, R&D increased by 25% year over year to $13 million, or up about $2.6 million, and was 3.8% of revenue, up from 3.2% of revenue in Q2 \u201911 and 3.5% sequentially.  This increase is mainly attributable to additional staffing in both businesses, as well as a variety on spending on new product development and clinicals.  We would expect that R&D will continue to grow faster than sales for the remainder of the year.","Looking at the total operating expenses, which were 45% of revenue for Q2 and grew at about 10%, overall we believe we will start to see some more leveraging in the second half and we would expect operating expenses to finish the year in the range of 43% to 44% of revenue.","Depreciation and amortization, in Q2, depreciation was $21.5 million, up $2.7 million or 14% year over year, and amortization was $5.3 million, up $0.5 million or 11% year-over-year, for a total of about $26.8 million.  As we discussed in the last call, the amortization expense increased year-over-year to reflect the increased amortization of intangibles on the several deals we completed last year.","Moving to operating margins, for Q2, consolidated operating income and margin were $65.4 million or 19% of revenue versus $60.3 million or 18.5% of revenue in Q2 \u201911.  This represents a 9% increase in operating income over Q2 \u201911.","Interest expense, our interest expense was $3.1 million and was $1.2 million or 28% lower than Q2 last year.  This reflects reduced borrowings and lower interest rates resulting from the refinancing in Q1 \u201911 and the redemption of senior notes completed at the beginning of Q2 \u201911.","As Bob mentioned earlier, we just amended our senior unsecured credit facility.  You can read the details in our 8-K filed on May 31st.  We took advantage of our S&P credit upgrade to investment grade to strengthen our capital structure.  The amended facility is slightly larger, offers better pricing and maturity has been extended to May 31, 2017.","From an accounting perspective, we'll be writing off about $1.4 million in unamortized fees in Q3.  Excluding these fees, we now expect interest expense to be $11.5 million to $12 million for the year.  While I'm on our capital structure, in June 4, we announced that we had tendered an offer to acquire all of the issued shares and warrants of Origio, a leading global in vitro fertilization medical device company for an enterprise value of approximately $189 million, including $151 million in equity plus approximately $38 million of net debt.","As Bob mentioned, we are excited to strengthen our position in the IVF business.  We anticipate we'll close this deal in Q3 this year.  This deal provides an excellent opportunity to expand our women's healthcare franchise while using our significant offshore cash.  If we were to repatriate the cash, this would create a heavy tax burden, so this deal is very opportunistic.  For more details on this tender offer, see our 8-K filed on June 4.","Effective tax rate in Q2, the effective tax rate was 12.4% versus Q2 '11, GAAP of 11%, non-GAAP at 12.8%.  As we've discussed before, the effective tax rate continues to be below the US statutory rate as a majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rate.  The year-over-year GAAP tax rate increase is mainly due to the Q2 '11 charge of $16.5 million, for the loss on a repurchase of the senior notes, which included a write-off of about $4.4 million of unamortized issuance costs and redemption premium of $12.1 million.","From a model perspective, a number of you were using a tax rate of approximately 11% versus the 12.4% we incurred in Q2.  This would impact pure EPS by roughly $0.02.  We are holding our effective tax rate guidance at the 10% to 12%.  Just an FYI, we do experience quarterly fluctuations and the second quarter tends to be our highest quarterly rate.","Stock option comp for your models, Q2 is 4.7 million.  EPS, as Bob mentioned, Q2 EPS was $1.12 versus $0.73 and $1.02 on a GAAP -- I'm sorry, $1.12 versus $0.73 and $1.02 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, respectively.  We were impacted by currencies, especially with the euro softening by approximately 6%, and our year-over-year impact due to currency was about $0.07.  We also had some restructuring activity in Australia for CooperVision and Summit Doppler for medical for about $900,000 or $0.02.","In Q2, we had an additional $1.2 million or $0.02 impact in what we consider operational costs directly related to the Avaira recall, which were split $400,000 as a reduction of revenue for customer concessions and $800,000 to operating expenses, for things like reviewing and reloading fitting sets to ensure there were no lenses impacted by the recall still in the fitting sets.  We did not repurchase any stock during the quarter, as Bob had mentioned earlier.","Liquidity, in Q2, we had cash provided by operations of $80.6 million, capital expenditures of $23.1 million, insurance recovery of $3.2 million, which resulted in $60.7 million of free cash flow.  Total debt decreased within the quarter by $91 million to $319.3 million.  Debt as a percent of capitalization is now 14%, down from 17.3% in Q1 and down from 23% in Q2 '11.  This leaves us with approximately $697 million of total credit available at April 30.","Inventories increased by $13.3 million from last quarter with 6.9 months on hand up from 6.1 months on hand in Q2 '11.  Avaira Toric makes up a large portion of this increase, as well as our one-day products like Proclear 1 Day and our newly-launched Proclear 1 Day Multifocal.","Looking at accounts receivable, our AR continues to be closely monitored with DSOs at 53 days, down from 54 days last year.  Our current DSOs in Europe, I thought was noteworthy, have actually improved over the prior year, but we continue to carefully watch our European DSOs in light of all the activity in Europe these days.","With that let me turn it over to Kim for the Q&A session.","Kim Duncan","Operator, we are ready to take some calls -- questions, sorry.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions).","And your first question today comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Thank you.  Good afternoon.  Can you hear me guys?","Bob Weiss","We can hear you good.","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay, good.  Hey, Bob, just one question I guess in multi parts, what qualifies as one question, but on the revenue side we've been hearing from a lot of our consumer companies whether that\u2019s contact lenses or dental or what have you, that April looked somewhat slow, you're talking about the same thing.  Is that all that's in the comments you made about April being slow and May picking back up?  Was there anything specific to your business or the way your products are bought?  And how sustainable then do you think the May pick up is?  That's the first part.","And then Avaira, I think, you had a very tough comp this quarter.  If I remember, last year Avaira did extremely well in the fiscal Q1.  Last quarter it sounds like Avaira was up year-over-year even after the recall.  This quarter my guess is, it's down year-over-year, but could you give us any color there?  And then why was Proclear down on a constant currency basis in the quarter?  Just trying to understand that a little bit better.  Thanks.","Bob Weiss","All right.  You got your money\u2019s worth there, Jeff.  The softness on the market in April, you\u2019re right, we went through February and March feeling pretty good about things, actually started off pretty good in April, and then it just slowed.  Typically you would expect strong finish towards the end of a quarter, but it just didn't happen, it flat-lined.  The good news is when we did get into May, it normalized.  We had a very respectable May and kind of felt good on a year-to-date basis.","And I might point out, when you look at the fourth quarter -- first quarter numbers in CLI data, our last page of the release, it was a very robust quarter for both the industry and for Cooper, 6% and 12%.  So we\u2019ve had a sustained market growth, probably not, was -- so was April, a little bit of a correction, maybe.  But no hard -- nothing hard on that.  But the feedback you\u2019ve got seemed to be universal.  There was a lot of softness for whatever reason towards -- throughout the April month, if you will.","As far as Avaira year-over-year, your memory is excellent.  A year ago, we were of course launching Avaira Toric, and so the Avaira product family was doing fine.  This year, it doesn\u2019t really have any of the benefits of a launch.  Getting Avaira Toric back on the market did not influence our top line, it in fact took a lot of energy.  Once we got the approval to relaunch Avaira Toric, that meant a lot of time and energy went into putting together fitting sets, which we have to do with a toric lens, entails a lot of energy upfront because it's an RX product and thousands and thousands of fitting sets have to be eventually put together refreshed and put back out into the marketplace over time.  So the comp is that Avaira year over year did not grow, unlike the first quarter, it declined.","Proclear family was down.  It was down as much as anything because we're pretty aggressively doing the trading up of silicone hydrogel.  Of course, a lot of Proclear is in the monthly category and Biofinity continues to rule.  So, that's a factor.  I would say that the Proclear 1 Day, which is really the catalyst of our growth within Proclear right now, is -- continues to do very well, it was up 13% worldwide.  And let me just check, on a constant currency, I think it was up 15% in constant currency.","So we're happy with that.  When we look at our portfolio, you have the one day and that's going to be Proclear 1 Day, you have the two-week, and that's now going to be the Avaira family and you have Biofinity in the monthly.  So it would not be unusual for, even the Proclear family, they get caught up in a market that is shifting out of hydrogels and in aggregate into silicone hydrogels.","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kim Gailun with JPMorgan.","Kim Gailun \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi there.  Thanks for taking the question.  Can you hear me okay?","Bob Weiss","I can hear you fine.","Kim Gailun \u2013 JPMorgan","Great.  So, first question is on currency.  You talked through the impact in the quarter and then what your expectations are for the back half of the year, but hoping you could just talk a little bit more on that piece.  By my math it looks like you guys are implying about a 70% drop-through from that revenue line down to EPS line from currency.  So, hoping you could talk through that, why that's so high and maybe bring the yen in there too.  And then, why at this point in the year didn't you look to kind of know that EPS guidance range?","Bob Weiss","Good questions.  Let me first try and then I'll ask, Greg, if you want to add anything to it.  On currency, that model in the past we've always kind of said, look, if currency drops or increases 1% worldwide against the dollar, that means basically around $0.04 a year on a worldwide basis, assuming everything moves in parity.  What didn't happen at all by far is parity.  And the euro, if you think of our model, if you want to build a better model, you would think of about almost 30% of our revenue comes through in European currencies x the pound.","And so when that moves against us as much as it now is, 13% year over year, then there's a huge hit there, unless it's offset by the pound going the same way.  In this case the pound didn't go the same way, and also keep in mind that what goes on with the pound happens on a six-month lag basis.  So, quite frankly, the pound was very strong in the third quarter a year ago, that came in and it hit the first quarter.  So when I talked about a $0.04 foreign exchange hit in the first quarter, it didn't show up on the revenue line; that entire $0.04 showed up in cost of goods.","Then you moved to the second quarter and now we have the impact really of no meaningful benefit of the pound, but a meaningful hit of the euro, and since we're so weighted there, you'll end up with a funky, if you will, ratio of bottom line to top line.  But if we did that calculation in the first quarter, it would be even more quirky, because there would've been no foreign exchange on the revenue line, it would have all showed up on cost of goods.","When you think of the model, if you try to develop a global model, the key things you really have to remember is we have about 30% of our revenue generated in euros.  We have about 20% of it generated in yen, which is kind of a [yarn], but it's going to be slight negative in the back half of this year and that actually was a minimizer, it went the other way for us, minimizing the euro in the first quarter.  And then think about half of our costs is pound related, our cost of goods, and you know our gross margins are basically -- you could pretty much model how the world is moving if you think of pounds, euros and yen against the dollar, and you can get pretty close to the bottom line by doing that.","Greg, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.","Greg Matz","Nothing, Bob.  I think you nailed it.  Basically with the way our structure is, and Kim, you picked up on it too, that about 30% or so is in the OpEx side and the rest of it did flow down to the bottom in our current calculations.  And the fact that with the way how stable the pound has been has basically left us very little impact in the first three quarters really our expectation of on the production side.","Bob Weiss","Next --","Kim Gailun \u2013 JPMorgan","My follow-up was just on the guidance range and kind of the temptation to hold the width of the guidance range.","Bob Weiss","Yeah, the guidance range, and that's a good question, we actually debated, do you narrow it or don't you narrow it.  And I think given where things are in the marketplace given the uncertainty of currencies, granted our guidance is basically assuming constant currency where we are today.  So, we don't attempt to say it's going to go up or down from this point, it is where it is today.  But there\u2019s a lot of volatility associated with what's going on in the market right now, and that's why we left it broad.","Next question?","Operator Your next question is from the line of Matthew O'Brien with William Blair.","Matthew O\u2019Brien \u2013 William Blair","Good evening.  Thanks for taking the question.  And I apologize for the background noise.  Just wanted to follow up a little bit on Kim's question in terms of the currency impact on guidance.  I think you said that it should be another $0.30 of impact in -- for the second half of the year that was not contemplated in guidance following Q1.  So, put another way, would your guidance have increased by $0.30 excluding the impact of currency or would the bottom end of the range likely have increased excluding the impact of currency?","Bob Weiss","Directionally, you're right that we're hurdling $0.33 in the back six months, and already have hurdled $0.11.  So we would have been upping guidance were it not for foreign exchange considerably, and we would have narrowed the range were it not for currency also.","Matthew O\u2019Brien \u2013 William Blair","Okay, great.  Thank you.","Bob Weiss","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Thank you for taking my question.  Two things.  One can you comment on the WellPoint acquisitions of 1-800 Contacts?  And two, how much have you incorporated in your revenue guidance from your recent acquisition?  And I\u2019m going to add a third one in there, what is the restructuring of your credit facility do to this EPS calculation?  Thank you.","Bob Weiss","Okay.  On the second one, let me do that one first, there is nothing in our guidance for the acquisition.  In other words, we don't anticipate that acquisition, it\u2019s not a deal until the tender is effective and that we know we got to 90% of the shares tendered, that we will know a lot more by the 22nd June is the current initial date anyway.","On WellPoint, the best answer I can give you is we\u2019re scratching our head a little on the process.  I think we\u2019re trying to better understand their entire motivation and plan going forward.  But it came out -- came from left field relative to most of the people in the industry.  I think I'm starting to understand it a little, but not enough to want to comment very much on it.","As far as I'm concerned, from our perspective, we\u2019re not going to react one way or the other.  It\u2019s just a shift of who owns and ties in with 1-800.  The third one, on the impact of the refinancing, of course I think Greg mentioned the $1.4 million write-off that we will take, which is $0.02 compared to our non-GAAP guidance.  We\u2019ve now given you guidance for GAAP and non-GAAP, the difference is $0.02, which is what we are writing-off.  The benefits of that basically are -- and I'm defer to you maybe Greg on what, about 700,000 or 800,000, maybe pick-up on interest?","Greg Matz","Yeah, we look at maybe it's roughly a penny over a 12 month period net in the first 12 months and -- or in the first six month to the year, roughly a penny.  And other than that, it's really minimal -- it's kind of a minimal impact to the bottom line.  It was really down for other reasons, again, increasing the limit, having a better pricing grid, and the opportunity to use that in the future, and it extends the range out for another, what, 18 months.","Bob Weiss","Sixteen months.  And by the way, so what you have is, a penny going one way in the $0.02 going the other, so net of $0.01 GAAP hit.","Next question?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James.","Larry Keusch \u2013 Raymond James","Hi, good afternoon.  Just want to touch on expenses if I could.  Obviously, the operating expenses, as Bob you pointed out, and the investments, have been elevated over the last several quarters, and just wanted to explore two things as we think about it in the second of the year.  First, I want to make sure that I understand when you're talking about the expenses in SG&A flattening out, are you talking about absolute dollars or are we talking about as a percent of sales?  And as part of that, are you really just coming to the end of the planned spending period or is there some element in there just given the uncertainty in the global markets that you're going to hold back on perhaps some discretionary items that you had in front of you such as China?  And the other part of the expense question is just how should we think about expenses now associated with Avaira Toric as we move forward to the second half of the year?","Bob Weiss","Yeah, it's more that we will leverage, meaning our operating ratios will improve, as opposed to [flat] dollars, because our revenue does typically pick up the last six months of the year by definition.","Did we slow up operating costs going forward or were we done spending?  We've invested heavily over the last two years in expansion of feet on the street, in expansion of what we're doing in R&D.  So I would say most of the reaction going forward is we arrived operationally, we\u2019ve put the investment in.  There is a little bit that is a reaction to uncertainty in the economy.  So, I don't want to say none of it has to do with that.  Some of it does.  So we are tightening our belt somewhat.","China, on that, we are, I would say, spending this year less than we had hoped to, and that's a function of just prudent timing, that we wanted to make sure we had the right people onboard.  And I believe we had an announcement yesterday in the press or the trade press on the fact that we've now filled the key positions in Asia-Pac and in China, which certainly will facilitate our way forward, meaning the country manager of China just recently came aboard in May and we made that announcement to the trade press.","As far as the impact of Avaira going forward, yes, we will be investing behind the Avaira relaunch, the Avaira Toric relaunch, certainly with fitting sets, which are put out there, and then they are amortized over a three-year period going forward.  But that is a herculean effort when it comes to a toric rolled out on a global basis.  So there's a lot of work and it will take a long time to get to the endpoint.  We will be doing an Avaira Toric rollout not for weeks, not for months, but literally around the world beyond, well beyond one or two years.  It's a big investment with a lot of energy.","Larry Keusch \u2013 Raymond James","Okay.  Thank you.","Bob Weiss","Okay.  Next question?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby \u2013 Cleveland Research Company","Hi.  Thanks for taking my call.  My one question was really just on products.  I was wondering if you could give an update on the one-day silicone hydrogel you're working on, kind of where that stands and the progress you're making?","And then, Bob, your comments just now on the Avaira Toric rollout, given that it will take a while, does that mean we're not going to see probably a meaningful impact to revenue from the Avaira Toric?  I'm just kind of wondering on how you expect the Avaira Toric revenue to kind of come into the company.","Bob Weiss","No, I think I'm just putting it into context, a lot of rollouts.  Very few rollouts go global all at once.  As a matter of fact, I am not aware of any really in the contact lens space, particularly on the toric where you have a complex number of SKUs.  So, nothing unusual about that; it takes just high energy effort.  We're still a long way from rolling out Biofinity Toric and we started last June, but I would say nowhere close.  We haven\u2019t even gotten to China -- Japan rather with the product yet.","As far as the single use silicone, it's -- of course, we\u2019re still of the mindset, and the more that happens in the marketplace, the more compelling is the case.  Single-use silicone right now is a niche product and will stay a niche product as long as everyone has a cost structure that precludes it from being a mainstream product.  It\u2019s priced out of most peoples' capability of buying it whether it\u2019s the two other ones that are in the market in Europe, now that CIBA's launching it in some target markets in Europe.  But we are, as much as anything, rolling this product out as a learning curve in getting it right and to make sure we are in with the evolution of this.  How far and how long it will take?  I think we are talking many mega years -- mega is a poor term -- three, four, five years before single-use silicone hydrogel lenses have a chance of becoming a mainstream.","And now, yes, people like B&L actually taking things in a different direction, which is to say challenging the model of why do you need a silicone hydrogel at all.  And we don't care who wins that argument, silicone hydrogel or hydrogels.  We still like the Proclear material and we\u2019re pretty versatile in terms of the way we respond to the market.","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hey, guys.  Thanks for taking the question.  On FX, I\u2019m trying to understand the top line FX hit to each quarter in Q3 and Q4, because by my math, the second half guidance reported is about 2% to 8% and by my math, FX is about a 4% hit each quarter, which has implied constant currency guidance of 6% to 12% for the second half.  So, can you give us the FX top line hit to the third quarter and fourth quarter?","And secondly, the $0.19 to $0.14 you talked about hit from FX, that's not since the Q1 call.  I think that\u2019s for full-year '12.  Can you just confirm that?  I was just a little bit confused on that.","And then just lastly, I guess another hot topic, is the CIBA royalty.  And can you disclose if you've had any conversations with CIBA about buying out the royalty and maybe from your perspective the pros and cons of buying it out?  Thanks.","Bob Weiss","I'll deal with the latter two of those first.  The $0.19 and the $0.14 is basically a comparison this year to last year, so exchange rates where they are today against last -- assuming exchange rates stay the same.  And the -- so, yes, it's not relative to anything in the first quarter, it's relative to year-over-year comps.","The CIBA royalty, are we in discussions, we certainly wouldn't go down that path in terms of any discussions, if there were any, would be on a confidential basis and we wouldn't really discuss a month publicly.  So, the only signal we have given time and time again is, on the royalty, assume we pay it out through the end of the patent period and nothing more, nothing else.  If there were discussions to be had on a buyout, it takes a willing buyer and a willing seller and a number that made sense, that would be totally hypothetical, and your what-if is no different than my what if would be on something like that.  So I wouldn't encourage a lot of conjecture in that area because it's certainly beyond anyone's control in this area.","As far as top line impact of foreign exchange, Greg, do you have those numbers?","Greg Matz","Yeah.  From a Q3 perspective, we would look to get about $14 million impact, in Q4 about almost $12 million impact.","Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thanks, guys.","Bob Weiss","Okay.  Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citi","Hi, good afternoon.  I just wanted to -- I wanted to clarify one of the earlier questions on the single-use lens and timing.  I think that previously you've talked about your new single-use lens being in the market by the end of fiscal '12.  It sounds like that's no longer the case.","And secondly, can you just give us an update on where you stand with the FDA on your US distribution facility, and whether or not there's any indication of the FDA going to the UK facility?  Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Okay.  On the silicone single-use silicone hydrogel, if I somehow implied there is a change in signal, there isn't.  We are still intent on launching it out, we haven't identified where, by the end of fiscal year.","As far as the FDA and West Henrietta, we are, I would say we're making progress with them and we would expect by the end of this month to still be on target for attempting to move the ball forward of removal of the warning letter.  So we made good progress with them.  The FDA has not given any indication to us that they're coming into the UK in any planned manner.  We still expect it\u2019ll arrive someday, but nothing new to report on FDA activity in the UK.","Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citi","Okay.

Welcome to the fourth quarter and full year 2017 conference call. This was an exciting year and we finished with record revenues, earnings per share and free cash flow. I'm proud of the team and the everything we've accomplished and believe were set for strong fiscal 2018. ","For the quarter we reported $552 million in consolidated revenue up 8% year-over-year, non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.65, up 16% and free cash flow was very strong $167 million. CooperVision posted fourth quarter revenues of $439 million up 7% as reported up 5% pro forma. Daily silicone hydrogel lenses drove growth up 37% in constant currency. CooperSurgical posted revenues of $123 million, up 15% as reported, up 7% pro forma. Fertility drove growth up 28% or up 7% pro forma. ","Moving to the details for CooperVision, this was a solid quarter given tough comps and some hurricane disruptions. By Geography the Americas grew 2%, EMEA grew 5% and Asia-Pacific grew 10% all pro forma. The Americas saw solid growth in August, followed by weakness in September and October. There was some negative impacts from the hurricanes during the time, which we estimate roughly at $2 million or 1%. Regardless our total share set in the Americas continued to be better than the revenue growth indicating we're taking [a lion's] share.","Regarding EMEA and Asia-Pac, both have solid quarters especially considering the different comps and continue seeing share in both regions on diversified geographic basis, which bodes well for continued growth. ","Overall revenues continued driven by our silicone hydrogel lenses led by Clariti and MyDay in the daily space and Biofinity in the monthly space. Our tiered approach within the daily silicone hydrogel space continues prove successful, we are expanding our offerings geographically and have recently started exceeding the U.S. market with MyDay Toric setting sets with the full launch to come soon. MyDay Toric has been received incredibly well internationally due to a very [customable] design and we expect a similar response in the U.S. Our Clariti one-day products continued to perform extremely well as the only silicone hydrogel family with the sphere, Toric, and a multifocal offering.","Moving to other products, our Biofinity and Avaira family of lenses combined to grow 7% pro forma. Biofinity continued to perform very well with diversified growth around the world, Avaira declined slightly as our focus remained on transitioning wearers to our upgraded Avaira Vitality lens which we anticipate completing by the end of this fiscal year. We did experience some Avaira disruption associated with the hurricane in Puerto Rico, but our team did a phenomenal job responding to that challenge and the impact with minimal. ","Turning to product categories, we remain the global leader in Torics which grew 7% pro forma driven by Clariti and Biofinity along with the rollout of MyDay Toric in Europe. We continue to believe, the Toric market will grow faster than the overall market and we will share in that growth given our strong portfolio in the addition of MyDay Toric in the U.S. Multifocals grew 4% pro forma with strength coming from Clariti and Biofinity.","Turning to the global contact lens market, for calendar Q3 we grew 7% with the market also up 7%. This included growing faster than the market EMEA up 6% versus the market up 4% and Asia-Pacific up 15% versus the market up 9%. The Americas grew 4% with the market up 7%. By modality CooperVision grew single use lenses 15% versus market up 13% and finally CDI is not single use lenses grew 3%, while the market grew 1%. ","Overall, Q3 was good quarter for CooperVision and the market. Although, the market was against easy comps. In particular, at the top for the America more if it was especially EPS was down 3% last year third quarter. CooperVision had more difficult 3% comp. ","On a trailing 12-month basis, we took share throughout the world growing 8% versus the market up 5%. Going forward, we are still targeting 46% market growth driven by continuing shift to improve technology such as a wider use of silicone hydrogel lenses, the continuing trade-up to dailies and specialty lenses, geographic expansion and the expansion of the Avaira base. And given our strength in these areas, along with the broad private label offering, we expect to continue growing faster than the market. ","Regarding other CooperVision activity, we completed the acquisition of Paragon Vision Sciences on December 1st for approximately $80 million. Paragon has a specialty lens business with a particular focus on ortho-k contact lenses. This acquisition allows us -- follows our recent acquisition of Procornea, another specialty company that we acquired in August. In combination with our MiSight product, with the management of Myopia we have developed a nice specialty lens platform to ensure we remain well connected with opinion leaders and a technology leader in the space. ","Moving to CooperSurgical, we reported a strong quarter, with Q4 revenues of $123 million up 15% driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we were 7% with Fertility leading the way up 28% or 12% pro forma. It was nice seeing the strength of Infertility as the integration disruptions are starting to get behind us. As I mentioned before, we are global leader in medical devices and genetic testing within the fertility space which is a global market with strong long-term growth dynamics. Our office and surgical business grew 2% for the quarter with the strength and [indices] our disposals hipster scope [ph] offset by weakness in other product lines. ","Regarding our CooperSurgical activity, we recently completed the acquisition of PARAGARD IUD from Teva, was closed on November 1, for approximately $1.1 billion. PARAGARD is the only IUD on the U.S. market that is hormone free long lasting and irreversible. The fact it's hormone free is especially important. As you may have heard there was a major story released yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine showing women using birth control pills and IUDs that release hormones face a higher risk of breast cancer than women who have never used hormonal contraception. This study was completed over 10-year period following 1.8 million women. Using PARAGARD -- given PARAGARD is the only non-hormonal IUD option in the U.S., and CooperSurgical has the resources and experience to ensure millions of women across country are aware of this important distinction. I'm very excited about the growth potential here. ","I will now get into the financial details, but as you can tell, under I am very bullish about PARAGARD as a product and as a strategic fit within CooperSurgical. ","And finally, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for their hard work and dedication. We continue to post record results and this wouldn't possible without them. I'd like to especially thank employees in Puerto Rico whose dedication and perseverance through the hurricane Maria was something special. ","And with that I'll turn it over to Al. ","Al White","Thank you, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Bob covered revenues so let me focus on the rest of the financials and guidance. ","For the quarter consolidated gross margins were 65.9%, up nicely from 64.3% last year. CooperVision's gross margin was 67.7% up from 64.8% last year driven primarily by currency and product mix gains. CooperSurgical's gross margin was 59.6% down from 62.5% last year driven by lower genomic pricing and certain inventory write-offs and charges on legacy products. ","Also within CooperSurgical we recently purchased an existing manufacturing facility in Costa Rica to consolidate a significant portion of our global manufacturing. We made a lot of progress upgrading the facility and hiring key employees and plan to begin production of the Wallace Transfer Catheter in this near future. This should provide a very nice opportunity to reduce costs and improve margins in the coming years. ","Moving to expenses, consolidated operating expenses grew 7% in the quarter slightly less than revenue. Expense growth was driven by investments throughout the company including additions to the sales force and distribution. We continue to enhance our sales force by selectively hiring around the world, while also continuing to upgrade our infrastructure including distribution. ","Moving to operating income, we grew 17.2% with operating margins improving to 27.2% from 25.1% last year. Both businesses report strong operating margin improvement with CooperVision growing 14.7% to 31.1% driven by gross margin improvement. Well, CooperSurgical improved 15.4% to 22.4% driven by operating expense leverage. Below operating income, we reported 7.9 million of interest expense, a 1.5 million FX loss and an effective tax rate of 8.1%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.65 with roughly 49.7 million average shares outstanding. ","We posted 167 million of free cash flow comprised of roughly 199 million of operating cash flow, I\u2019ll step by 32 million of CapEx. Total debt decline roughly 41 million to 1.173 billion supported by cash flow generation and an increase in cash balances offset by our acquisition of Procornea in August and 25 million of stock buybacks in October. ","Regarding full year fiscal 2017 results, consolidated revenues were 2.139 billion, up 9% or 7% pro forma. CooperVision revenues were 1.674 billion, up 6% or 7% pro forma and CooperSurgical\u2019s revenues were 464.9 million, up 19% or 4% pro forma. Non-GAAP EPS was $9.70, up 15% and free cash flow was very strong at 466 million. ","Before moving to guidance, let me quickly reminder that we announce our November 1st, a new $1.425 billion 5-year senior unsecured term loan, which matures November 1, 2022. The facility was used to fund the PARAGARD acquisition and reduce our revolver borrowing allowing greater flexibility for generate corporate purposes including the recent funding of the Paragon acquisition.","Moving to fiscal 2018, we\u2019re guiding the consolidated revenues of 2.48 billion to 2.53 billion, which is comprised of 1.83 billion to 1.87 billion at CooperVision or roughly 9% to 11% as reported growth 6% to 8% pro forma growth. And 650 million to 665 million at CooperSurgical or roughly 40% to 43% as reported growth 2% to 4% pro forma growth. CooperSurgical revenue guidance assumes roughly $170 million of PARAGARD, which is slightly lower than originally expected with a negative impact coming entirely in fiscal Q1 due to higher than expected channel inventory. ","We\u2019re now providing detailed quarterly guidance, but the help model this. We expect Q1 revenues for consolidated CooperSurgical to be around 150 million with PARAGARD being roughly 34 million of that. This 34 million would be a year-over-year decline of roughly 25%. This unusual activity is related a price increase which resulted in significantly higher channel inventory in September, but that also unexpectedly in the month of October, the month before we closed the acquisition. ","Subsequent to Q1, we expect PARAGARD to do roughly $135 million to $138 million during Q2 to Q4 which equates to upper single digit growth driven by the price increase and underlying unit growth. Note, we have not included any potential upside from the new study Bob mentioned in the New England Journal of Medicine. ","We still expect to meet or exceed our targeted EPS accretion of $0.70 to $0.75 for PARAGARD for the full year and including PARAGARD on a consolidated basis, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $11.35 to $11.65 up 17% to 20% based on 49.8 million shares outstanding. ","Moving to details within the P&L. We expect fiscal 2018 gross margins to improve to around 68%. Operating margins are expected to improve to around 28% and this includes a negative $3 million impact from the reintroduction of the 2.3% medical device excise tax beginning in January. This tax only impacts our domestic CooperSurgical business excluding Paragard, which is treated as pharmaceutical product. ","Interest expense is expected to be around $68 million, which includes the additional debt from the PARAGARD and Paragon acquisitions and the assumption of a 25-basis point rate increase this month. ","Regarding taxes, there is obviously a lot of activity with several bills pending at the House and Senate so let me add a caveat that my commentary is based on unfinished tax legislation that could change materially. Given our fiscal year end is in October, many of the proposed tax reform provisions will not be effective for us until fiscal 2019, so we're assuming an effective tax rate of 11% for our fiscal 2018 guidance. ","Having said that, the proposed tax reform does include a few provisions that would impact us in fiscal '18, with the most material being the mandatory repatriation of previously deferred earnings. That being said, we would exclude these types of one-time P&L charges from our non-GAAP EPS to allow clear comparability of year-over-year results. ","Repeating my disclaimer that there is still a lot of moving parts, we currently see risk to our effective tax rate in fiscal 2019 and beyond to the mid-teens from items such as the minimum tax on foreign income. ","Lastly on guidance, excluding any impact from unknown tax matters, we expect free cash flow to be similar to this year but with CapEx around $175 million. The higher CapEx is mostly due to carryover from fiscal 2017 due to lower than expected spending in Q4 as our manufacturing team dealt with the hurricane in Puerto Rico. ","With that, let me conclude by saying, we remain focused on expanding our businesses and gaining global market share while delivering consistent solid financial results. This quarter and this year were another step in that direction and we look forward to reporting results as we work through fiscal 2018. ","And with that I'll hand it back to the operator for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joanne Wuensch ","I have to go back to taxes, sorry. Could you please walk us through how the impact of the potential lower tax rate for the corporate level would impact you? I think we have all over the years taken a look at your 8%, 9%, 10% type of corporate tax rate and don\u2019t fully completely understand how that stays at that level. But walk through taxes just a little bit more please?","Al White","Yes. So, couple of comments on that. If we look at, first of all, if we look at this coming fiscal year, fiscal \u201918 that we\u2019re in right now most of the tax reform again won\u2019t impact. So, if we look at fiscal 2019 and beyond that\u2019s what you start look at and say okay, what is the impact of the full tax provision changes and that\u2019s where we\u2019re talking about somewhere in the mid-teens. So, let\u2019s say \u201915 just so we are working up a number. ","If we take a look at where we have been in the past and you had PARAGARD, which has fairly significant U.S. income associated with it, obviously higher U.S. taxes associated with that, that loses up towards the 11% this year. And then the other tax changes move us up to the 15% keeping in mind that under that scenario PARAGARD is actually a positive. Because the positive tax rate is a positive for PARAGARD and our CooperSurgical business. So that\u2019s kind of the flow, I mean as you can imagine as you know there is a lot that goes into that. But at this point in time based on the measures that are out there, that\u2019s where we see taxes coming up. ","Joanne Wuensch ","Okay. And as my follow-up question, you have acquired require Procornea and Paragon. Could you please give us a little bit of an idea of the revenue contribution from those two acquisitions for next year and what the strategy is with those products? Thank you. ","Al White","Yes. So that\u2019s part of our specialty lens business that we\u2019re building up and it\u2019s turning out to be very nice. If you combined those two businesses or around 30 million in revenues and if you roll those with my sight, it\u2019s a very nice specialty lens business that is at least upper single-digit if not double-digit growing business. So, we\u2019re pretty excited about that, it\u2019s relatively small part of the business right now. But growing nicely, it can be very important in the coming years with myopia management becoming more important. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Q - Larry Biegelsen ","One on revenue and the Americas and then just one on FX and guidance. Just starting with the Americas, I think even if you adjust for whether the Americas was a little bit soft relative to the market and in calendar Q3. So, Bob any color what\u2019s going on in the Americas and how much you think MyDay re-launching that, can help in the U.S.? ","And then just on the guidance. We estimate there is about $0.60 of FX benefit to EPS in fiscal 2018. Is that directionally accurate and why is that falling to the bottom-line? Thanks for taking the questions guys.","Bob Weiss","Yes. Larry, on the first one on the Americas looking soft. Yes, the answer to the question is the MyDay Toric coming out in the early part of 2018 is certainly going to be a plus for us. When we talk about comps, of course, the overall market was pretty strong due to easy comps including the Americas. So, 7% compared to the prior year, which was down 3% for us. Our prior year was a plus 3%. So, we went from 3% to 4% up a slight uptake. So, comp is a big part of it and then of course, we had during the period, we both had some implications of the hurricane and weather. And as I mentioned, we think overall that\u2019s about 2 million although a good chunk of that 2 million probably rolled more into the October timeframe.","Al White","And on currency, when we reported earnings in September. We expected in currency in fiscal \u201818 to be around $0.60 positive Larry. As we got closer to this quarter, we\u2019ve actually holding in there as you indicated when we just run the rates though, the positive impact from currency in fiscal \u201918, we have a $0.38. So, it came back a decent amount. Now that includes a \u20ac1.17, \u00a51.13, \u00a31.34. So, although from September to today, we lost a good $0.20, a little bit more than $0.20, we still given guidance obviously for a low-double-digit even excluding PARAGARD.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird. Your line is now open. ","Jeff Johnson ","So yes, one maybe following up on Larry\u2019s question on the U.S. market. I think, a lot of us heard that maybe October wasn\u2019t a real strong close to the quarter for you guys in the U.S. Just wondering, I know you don\u2019t give monthly updates very often. But just what have you seen in the U.S. market both [help] of the market and maybe in your own business since Bob I think you referenced the weaker September and October, we were definitely hearing about that through some of your distributor sources in October itself. Just how is November and early part of December trending? ","Bob Weiss","So obviously, we\u2019ve looked at November, when we dealt our overall guidance that Al referenced it. So, we\u2019re feeling good about of where we are, where we\u2019re going. We also felt good about on eye even though, the market from the point of view of what we sold into the market was a little lighter. Then was the, on eye activity we felt based on what we saw on eye activity we were still gaining market share. So, whether or not you compare it to the 7% that the overall market give, which of course is kind of above the normal or the average growth of the market over a multi-year period. ","So, if we look at the market as growing 4 to 6 midpoints 5, the Americas should grow 4 to 6 probably midpoint 5 on average, the 7 is a little on the high side. We continue to gain market share, we have been growing north of 1.5 times the market. I still think the best way to look at the market is on a trailing 12-month basis or the market overall for the Americas was 4%, we were 6%. So, on average, we are kind of moving down the path, we planned on and of course, we\u2019re excited about the MyDay Toric coming in the market. ","Jeff Johnson ","Understood. And then I\u2019ll maybe just one tax rate follow-up question, 11% tax rate in the guidance for this fiscal year going to 15% in fiscal \u201919. Is that just U.S. tax rate reform driven or is there any kind of DPT UK tax rate change in there as well?","Al White","U.S. tax reform. ","Jeff Johnson ","Okay. Anything you can say on the UK investigation at this point?","Al White","Nothing at this point, no. We\u2019ll update you guys as soon as, as we have something that's firm to update you with.","Bob Weiss","Probably the only thing I would add to that there is a going forward rate impact it may end up onetime events. But going forward, of course that gets built into the way the mid-teens plays out. So, to the extent your rates offshore go up, they don't duplicate U.S. rate increase. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is now open. ","Jon Block","Great thanks good afternoon, guys. I'll ask both upfront. First just the single use growth of 8% in the fiscal quarter was single digits for the first time since I believe fiscal 2Q of '15. And then there is a lot going on with adverse weather and actually tough comp. But adding more color there Bob, that you can comment on. ","And then just second to shift your sales reps, and maybe if you can tell us where do you are with that initiative? How the returns been to date and Al is this initiative continuing into fiscal '18 with the given guidance. Thanks guys. ","Bob Weiss","So, we've done good job of expanding our sales force so we'll continue to build on that. And we are seeing good results out of that. I think overall, the 8% growth is still being north of 1.5 times the market is indicative of that. And of course, we continue to do that expansion not only in the U.S. but worldwide, and of course that will now ripple into more aggressive expansion on the women's healthcare side. ","The 8% single use market growth across in the quarter once again one quarter does not a make a trend make. We had tougher comps up and down the line. So that's factor and then of course will be rolling out the MyDay Toric into really the biggest Toric market in the world. And in the sweet spot of that market, which is at OneDay which is driving the whole market. ","When you think about the whole market being up for the quarter, 15% and other being up 3% or more importantly for the year, the market gained up 12% in single using as and everything else is flat. We are the driver of the market growth in the all other bucket, and we continue to gain share in the single use buckets. So, a good profile and of course the catalyst to that is clarity in MyDay the silicon hydrogel OneDay products we have. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale, Guggenheim. Your line is now open. ","Chris Pasquale","Thanks. one clarification of course for Al and one for Bob. Al first, can you give us the currency impact in 4Q both the top and bottom lines. And then Bob, just looking at the underlying growth rates in your three major competitors. This was the first quarter in some time that all three were performing at pretty high level. And it certainly seems like the trend is towards a tougher competitive environment than Coopers had to deal with in several years. Can you just comment on how you are thinking about that and the potential for maybe the margin of outperformance that you've been accustomed to for some time could contract?","Bob Weiss","I'll jump on the latter question first and I will come back on the other. As far as looking at the competitors looking at the overall market. if the overall market does move up to the 7 plus arena, I'm not going to totally complain about that as long as we are growing. Basically, we\u2019ve guided our midpoint 7% and we expect to continue to gain market share. There is, as I pointed out some easy comps the fact that, our competitors grew over the prior year when the prior year for example was only 1%, this year was 7%. We frequently follow the -- with many of the analysts used two years backing. So, if I look at two years backing 7 this year, 1 last year midpoint 8 overall the market has been growing 5 on a trailing 12 months that\u2019s more indicative. So, there is a little bit of anomalous in the 7, but if the 7 stays because momentum going forward, we think, we\u2019ll do well with that continue to gain market share.","Al White","And then currency quickly Q4 was basically net expectations, if you will, when we gave our guidance. The top-line impact was around $6 million and the positive EPS impact was around $0.18.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Anthony Petrone ","Just two questions on my and one would be on pricing and maybe specifically on [stand] of discounting in the quarter. Where is that trending as you head into fiscal \u201918. ","And then maybe just to give an update on where CooperVision is indexed in silicone hydrogel dailies versus the market. How long in that product cycle had to go before you reached sort of market level rates in that category? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Sure. On discounting and pricing, of course the industry's been a master at trading up, trading up and trading up. And to overlay on that, we as an industry, there was a fair amount of price increases the last 12 months. On the flip side, there has been a lot of not so much discounting, but rebating. A lot of that is focused in on trying to get you to convert to one day. The strategy is working well as we can see from the growth as a one day being the drivers of the overall markets for the last four years in a row now and that will continue into the future.","So, the fact that there are discounts to incentivize or rebates to incentivize to transition from a two-week space into the one-day space, which if there were oasis two-week, non-compliant going to oasis one-day that\u2019s 800% trade up, there is a lot of room for rebating and incentives to get you to make the switch. ","Today trade up to one-day is still 400% to 600% step up in revenue at the manufacturing level. So, we trade up all day, even if we had to give rebates all day. And that, we now hit the flip point where, there is more revenue generated by one day and then there is revenue generated by non-one day. So, this last quarter $1.5 billion in revenue in single use and only 975 million in non-single use we are now past the 50% market.","How is Cooper doing, we continue to be the driver of the one day, particularly within the phase of the silicone hydrogels so for example last 12 months were up 50% year-over-year, whereas the overall market is up 28% year-over-year for silicon hydrogel OneDay lenses. And of course, you\u2019ve seen our overall numbers, market was up 13% single use and we were up 15% single use for the quarter. So, we think there\u2019s a lot of legs left in it and the roll out of MyDay Toric will only further enhance that market share gains as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Andrew Brackmann","Hi guys this is actually Andrew Brackmann on for Brian today. Al, I have got a question for you. On the Q3 cost you said that you guys are going to spend about $0.11 worth of EPS on investments. Can you give us a little status update of those and whether those in magnitude that you expected in the quarter? Thanks.","Al White","Yes, that would be in kind of the magnitude that we were expecting and to be clear to follow up on what Bob said we will continue those investments and we talked about that a little bit in the script through fiscal \u201818. So, when we look at the guidance that we give in respect to infrastructure investment, sales force expansion, we are doing what we said that we would do for several quarters and we will be doing that incremental investing if you will in the business through fiscal \u201818.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Hsu with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","John Hsu","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick one on multifocals, it looks like growth has been a little bit choppy this year. Can you talk that up to competitive factors or what\u2019s going on in the multifocal space?","Bob Weiss","Yes, that\u2019s sort to say we had the target on our back. We were kind of the leading multifocals for many years that really date it back to the turn of the century when Alcon owned the market and then we came out with great multifocals and became the largest player in it. Now everyone has claimed a little catch up there so J&J and Alcon have respectable multifocals. So that\u2019s the way it is we are still growing of course. It is a high growth area. We still have market share that is in around 30% market share worldwide in a growth market. ","But the long and the short of it is, others have played a little catch up in the market, it is still a small part of the market so when you look at the overall market, multifocals are 8% we are at 10% of our revenue in multifocals and the bigger action point is the Torics where the overall market is around 22% and we\u2019re about one-third of that market. So Torics is a much bigger fish if you will and there we have a lot of good things going on. And that\u2019s a lot more the barriers of entry in a broad Toric category are a lot tougher as there are so many more SKUs in the Toric area compared to multifocals.","John Hsu","Okay, great. And then just one follow up housekeeping. Al, I think you gave the FX on the top-line and EPS. What was the impact on gross margins? ","Al White","We don\u2019t get to that level of detail on adjusting everything with respect to FX.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. ","Robbie Marcus","Great, thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask on CooperSurgical. Pro forma guidance 2% to 4% kind of the low trend for what you've been doing in 2017. So maybe you can talk through the impact of what's happening versus an acceleration next year?","Al White","Sure. If you look at the 2% to 4% guidance, what's kind a going on there is split of the two. We finished the year at 4% pro forma growth with a strong 7 to finish. And the guidance on that part of the business if you will is roughly 3% to 5% so more of the same. And then with respect to PARAGARD it's one that's bringing down the consolidated pro forma growth because that we're looking at kind a somewhere around at 1% pro forma growth because of the impact at Q1 that we mentioned. ","Robbie Marcus","Okay. Maybe a follow up, you've been getting outside of market has accelerated in 2017 in Asia-Pac and you've had pretty phenomenal growth there in the past two years in Vision. Can you maybe talk through some of the trends there and how you see that continuing?","Bob Weiss","Sure. We are underindexed in Asia-Pac so if I look at market share we're about 20% in the U.S., 31% approaching number one in Europe, but only 19% in the Asia-Pac area. So, we have a long way to go, part of that was we were later to the game in some regions, but we've had may good headway in Japan which has been a fairly flat market over the last 10 years, but we've been gaining and gaining share with our OneDay portfolio of products which includes MyDay making good progress there, which will continue as well as some of the headway we made in other regions of Asia-Pac be it Korea be it China where our franchise is developing very nice in China. ","But one of the other things that is starting to come into a selling [ph] in Asia-Pac that's started in the U.S. is our specialty lens both Torics and multifocals are early in the game and we have a good portfolio. And as I mentioned, we're essentially number one in the specialty lens space, so we'll continue to ride that way with a very broad product line. So, looking forward, I expect to see pretty good growth in Asia-Pac at the market, and continue to gain market share moving to a more respectful level of overall market share with our portfolio. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. ","Matthew O'Brien ","Thanks so much for taking the questions. Two quick ones, first of all, on the Americas side again a little bit soft, there is some questions there. I'm curious if there is anything in the channel specifically, we know there has been some rebating from one of your bigger competitors to the big box chain. So, I'm wondering if there is any headwinds you're facing in a certain segment of the channel whereas elsewhere you're doing even better than your competitors. And if any of those pressures you may or may not be seeing that ease in the near term and then I have follow-up.","Bob Weiss","Yes. I don\u2019t think, we\u2019re, we have any challenges or undue challenges with the different channels. So particularly when it comes to -- I mentioned the on-eye activity is good. We did have tougher comps than the overall marketplace. We\u2019re coming out with the new product MyDay Toric which will fit the need of that premium silicone hydrogel one-day market, which is a big evolving market. Private label is a big part of our strategy that has a key role not only in Europe, not only in Asia-Pac, but also in the Americas. So, I would say, we have a lot going forward. LensFerry which is facilitating our independent eye care professionals delivering to the home. So, we have a lot of tools and a lot of products and I don\u2019t see a sting [ph] inhibited in any particular area.","Matthew O'Brien ","Okay. And then as a follow-up Bob can you touch on a little bit there. But just MyDay with Toric lens. Can you just provide a little bit more color as far as what kind of benefits you saw in Europe as you launched that, because I know most eye care professionals like to see both [sphere] and the Toric together before there are more broadly recommend products. So just any kind of color you can provide there will be helpful? Thank you.","Bob Weiss","Yes. You\u2019re correct about that. Anytime, you have a sphere only compared to someone else sphere and Toric, you get the halo effect of having the combo. And in the case of MyDay very similar to the excitement over just how well, Biofinity has done for the last 10 years now. And Biofinity 10 years later, it\u2019s a [indiscernible] product, a lot of that add to, with having a great sphere, a super Toric and then a good multifocals. So, we have a lot going for us in terms of MyDay being more analogous to some of the features of the Biofinity if you will.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Matthew Mishan ","I guess my first question given the success you\u2019ve seen in Clariti and your competitors have been rounding out the premium end of the space. Are you expecting to see the competition in that mass market silicone hydrogel over the next couple of years and just still that barrier entry on manufacturing? And then I have a follow-up after that. ","Bob Weiss","Yes. I think, if they had made substantial progress in reducing costs, you would eventually see some entr\u00e9e into the mass market. Right now, they\u2019re putting a lot behind basically not taking up oxygen and all the features that silicone hydrogel that apply to the non-one-day product. And they\u2019re really riding the wave of but voice [ph] in the case J&J and daily MOIST in the case of Alcon. So, they have two big products. So, one of their dilemma is gee if you come into the market, are you competing with yourself or you\u2019re putting someone in play that is hydrogel, they\u2019re kind of between rock and a hard one spot. ","We have nothing to lose because we have two great products, premium and low cost. We are the only one with that cost structure that can price a silicone hydrogel comparable to a MOIST and a daily Clariti product and a complete product range. If they were going to come in to the market, would start with a fear if they got the cost down and then they would have to then piggyback on that eventually multifocal and a Toric to get comparable to Clariti. So, I still see Clariti has a long runway in front of it to ride.","Matthew Mishan ","Okay. And then on operating margins I think previously previous PARAGARD at least you had an operating margin target of 28 plus I think by 2021 and you are kind of there already. Do you have any thoughts on the long-term targets on the operating margin side?","Al White","I think we are working with all that in advance. You are correct that we -- my 28% operating target for 2021, we arrived three years early because our target is for next year. So, stay tuned as we dust off our thinking what our new operating target should be. So, if were to tell you on the phone I [indiscernible] five people around me.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Willoughby","Good evening everyone. Two questions for you. First Bob, I was wondering if you could provide us an update on, in the fourth quarter -- in past quarters you talked about what your daily disposable silicone hydrogel lenses grew in total versus your frequent replacement silicone hydrogel lenses and I believe you provided that in your prepared remarks? ","And then secondly Bob, could you just give us your opinion on the state of subscription offerings, I guess globally but also in the US as there\u2019s been some M&A as it relates to that and I know you guys have your LensFerry products. So just wondering update on that? Thanks so much.","Bob Weiss","First of all, I think I mentioned on my remarks 37% for the growth of silicone hydrogel one day.","Steve Willoughby","Okay sorry I just missed that.","Bob Weiss","It\u2019s okay. State of subscription offering, of course we have LensFerry, you have companies out there Hubble and different things. We have been kind of leading the way with home delivery outside the US for many, many, many years. So highly experienced with that model and of course it\u2019s an enhancer for the eye care professional. So, it\u2019s not a bad model. ","From our perspective important to that model is having a couple of things. One is private labels, those that want to embark on their own design and model. Number two is having the broadest product portfolio of spheres, Torics and multifocals still makes it more attractive that you could do more things with it. ","I understand that companies and I will pick on Hubble for the moment like Hubble will continue to have a very narrow generic offering importing products from Taiwan so that\u2019s only get so far at the end of the day eye care professionals, trying to tell eye care professional you all have to convert to writing script for generic here from Taiwan will only get you so far in terms of developing the model. You're going to need the breadth of products for a reasons doctors prescribed silicon hydrogel. There are recent doctors prescribe Toric, there are reasons they prescribe multifocals. And there are a lot more complicated to fit than just a generic model that is tempting to have the patient influence the eye care professional on what to prescribe. That's a tough model. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. ","Steven Lichtman","Thank you. Hi guys. Bob, I was wondering if you could give us your latest thoughts on the North America market, in the post-UPP world? As you look back now over the past several quarters with UPP gone, any update you can give us on what impact positive or negative if at all its removal has had on the market?","Bob Weiss","I never was much of a UPP guy day one and I still never got enamored by along the way. It was a method of marketing and like those on and there are other methods of marketing that have been used for 30 and 40 years. Clearly rebates have their role, but try it you like it is a big part of the game. So UPP was kind of the pass through and out of that pain in the neck event but we'll be on it. ","Steven Lichtman","Okay. And then, Al, the lower pricing in genetic testing that you mentioned, can you talk a little bit more about what that was and how we should think about that going forward?","Al White","Sure, we've experienced that more recently within genetic testing within the IVS space. And there are some competitors in that space, who are getting very aggressive with price interestingly companies who are losing significant amounts of money. And I guess as long as people are willing to give them money and their strategy is just to do as many tests as can be, we could continue to experience some pressure there. But we'll stay by our strategy of running a good profitable business and putting money in R&D and developing improved test and so forth. So, we'll see how that plays out, I think that we could face that a little bit more as we move through fiscal '18.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird. Your line is now open. ","Jeff Johnson","Thank you, guys. Hey, just one follow up question. Al, you had mentioned that the incremental investments in the distribution center and maybe some above and beyond sales force investments things like that were $0.11 to the fiscal fourth quarter. How does that continue into 2018? I know you said those will continue, but if FX is a $0.38 tailwind, what are those investments offsetting. And then if PARAGARD is $0.70. Are there any other pluses and minuses we should be thinking about in the quarter or for the year, I'm sorry. ","Al White","Sure, I'll give a little color on that. Because the guidance that we're giving here for fiscal '18 is clearly quite a bit stronger than what we indicated it would be back on our September call, meaning we're hurdling a good $0.20, $0.25 of FX, we're also hurdling the medical device tax that we talked about which is about $3 million. So, the numbers look pretty good. ","Now having said we are investing within sales and marketing distribution from other areas in the business we're going to continue to do that even though currency and so forth has moved against us. We have not got back on those investments. So, we're able to put up this guidance because of fundamental strength in the business itself be it operating margins and leveraging OpEx in some parts of the business, leveraging our improvements within cost of goods, things look pretty good kind of throughout the P&L. ","So, I will get you two specific and how much we\u2019re going to spend each quarter. I guess, I probably just say that we\u2019re investing in the business, we\u2019re excited about it. We\u2019re excited about growth. We\u2019re excited about taking market share. There is a number of areas within CooperVision, they\u2019re going really well that we want to continued invest in PARAGARD looks like there is a lot of upside in that. So, we\u2019re pretty excited about that, we\u2019re going to hire people there and invest in sales and marketing in that part of the business. So, it\u2019s fair to say feeling pretty good and not stopping investing in the business to continue to drive top-line growth. ","Operator","Thank you. And I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. So, I\u2019d like to return the call to Mr. Bob Weiss for any closing remarks. ","Bob Weiss","Well, I want to thank you for joining us today and I hopefully you\u2019re excited about where we land it and more importantly where we\u2019re going. There is nothing, I\u2019ll look for earnings per share growth next year of upper teen is exciting. Its look very real, we talk about that. We look obviously thrilled about some of the news that has been up here and Paragon or on hormonal [indiscernible] the last couple of days makes it even more exciting. We look forward to updating you on the next conference call, which will be our first quarter earnings for fiscal year 2018 and I think that\u2019s on the 8th of March and we look forward to set as report at that point. Thank you, operator, please conclude the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day. "],"6030":["The Cooper Companies, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Kim Duncan, Vice President. Ma'am, you may begin.","Kim Duncan","Good afternoon, and welcome to The Cooper Companies fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings conference call. I'm Kim Duncan, Vice President of Investor Relations; and giving prepared remarks on today's call are Bob Weiss, Chief Executive Officer; and Al White, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Strategy Officer.","Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including all revenue and earnings per share guidance and other statements regarding anticipated results of operations, market or regulatory conditions and integration of any acquisitions or their failure to achieve anticipated benefits.","Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and are subject to risks and uncertainties.

These are publicly available and on request from the company's Investor Relations department.","Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me comment on the agenda for the call.

We will keep the formal presentation to roughly 30 minutes, and then open the call for questions. We expect the call to last approximately one hour. We request that anyone asking questions please limit yourself to one question. Should you have any additional questions, please call our investor line at 925-460-3663 or email ir@cooperco.com. This call is being webcast and a copy of the earnings release is available through the Investor Relations section of The Cooper Companies website.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob for his opening remarks.","Bob Weiss","Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the fourth quarter and full year 2016 conference call.","Let me start by saying, I'm very proud of our accomplishments this quarter including record revenue in free cash flow. We also delivered a very strong fiscal year gaining share and the $7.2 billion contact lens industry continuing our portion to the one day silicone hydrogel space expanding Biofinity franchise and posting strong growth in our CooperSurgical business. We entered -- we enter fiscal 2017 with strong momentum and remain confident. We will gain -- we will see market share gains in both of our business for the foreseeable future.","Let me highlight three key points for the quarter. First, I'm pleased to report another strong quarter with revenues over $500 million. This includes provisional reporting revenues over $400 million in CooperSurgical, reporting revenues over $100 million. This resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.28 and free cash flow of $158 million. Second CooperVision posted strong results in all key areas of its business resulting in 10% as reported and 11% constant currency revenue growth. This includes one day silicone hydrogel lenses growing 53% and two week and monthly silicone hydrogel lenses growing a combined 14%, both in constant currency. Third, CooperSurgical had another strong quarter posting revenue growth of 20% or 6% pro forma. Fertility was the highlight posting growth of 74% or 8% pro forma.","Moving into details; CooperVision reported fourth quarter revenues of $412 million, up 10% as reported and 11% in constant currency. This is the fastest CooperVision has grown in 11 quarters. The Americas grew 8% in constant currency with strength in multiple categories including Biofinity and 1-day silicone hydrogel lenses. Biofinity continues to be our work horse and we began our launch of Biofinity Energys in mid-August to strong reviews.","Our enhanced Clariti lens is also performing well and MyDay had another very strong quarter. EMEA posted a very strong quarter up 12% in constant currency. Growth was driven by Biofinity and our 1-day silicone hydrogel franchise. Asia-Pacific also had a very strong quarter, up 13% in constant currency. Growth was strong throughout the region driven by Biofinity and our 1-day silicone hydrogel franchise. Within Japan, our MyDay, Sphere, and Toric launch is progressing well, and while it's still early, we continue to believe MyDay can be a very successful premium offering in that market.","Turning to product categories, Toric's grew healthy 14% and multi-focal's 10%, both in constant currency. We remain global leader in specialty lenses and our success with Biofinity and Clariti and both of these categories should continue to drive growth for many years to come. Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses, these products grew 21% in constant currency and now represents 62% of our sales. We expect this strong growth to continue given our product portfolio which includes Biofinity, Vitality, our new launched two-week product, and our diverse 1-day offering. And remember, the biggest driver in the contact lens market is the 1-day growth and we strongly believe we have the best product offering in the space as the only company selling premium in mass market silicone hydrogel lenses including a portfolio of Sphere, Toric and multi-focal lens.","We also investing in sales and marketing to support our strong product portfolio forecasting new hires, that was challenging, especially when it's -- when you're evaluating opportunities around the world. But we believe CooperVision can add numerous sales reps and get a very nice return given our strong product platform or capacity in our growth opportunities that we see. We believe this initiative henceforth -- we begin this initiative in our fourth quarter and expect to continue through fiscal 2017, and possibly into 2008. For competitive reasons, I won't get into many details but suffice to say, we carefully evaluate all hiring and expect to realize a solid return from this activity.","Now let me comment on our overall contact lens market, and remember, this information is on the last page of our earnings release. For calendar Q3 2016, we continued taking share and growing 6% with the market up 1%. Geographically, CooperVision grew 3% in the Americas while the market was down 3%. In the EMEA we were up 8% and the market was up 7% percent. In Asia Pacific, we grew 9% with the market up 3%. On a modality basis, single use lenses continue driving growth with CooperVision up 12% and the market up 8%. For non-single use lenses we grew 3% while the market declined 4%. As you can see, our growth remains diverse and strong.","On a trailing 12-month basis, CooperVision grew 8% percent while the market grew 3%. Although the market remains choppy and hard to read at times, we continue to believe it will strengthen and grow 4% to 6% over the next five years driven by continuing shift to daily geographic expansion and an expansion of the where base. We expect continue to continue taking market share led by our strong portfolio of market-leading product.","Moving to CooperSurgical we reported fourth quarter revenues use of $107 million, up 30% year-over-year driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 6%. Fertility led the way, up 74% or 8% percent pro forma. Within Fertility, we had growth throughout the business and continue to believe our market leading product portfolio which includes medical devices, genetic testing, and capital equipment is the broadest portfolio in the space and should continue to drive growth for more many years to come. Within our office and surgical category, growth was 5%. We're continuing to execute on several product launches including our disposable hipster scope [ph] endlessly, and we continue to the see success in this area.","Regarding other activity, we announced on November 6 that we acquired a wallet portfolio from Smiths Medical for approximately $168 million. This is a great strategic fit and with our existing global IVF portfolio as it brings the gold standard of embryo transfer catheters along with several other premier products. Finally, CooperSurgical -- on CooperSurgical, we're busy integrating recent acquisitions but also executing on several initiatives which has significantly strengthened the business. These include transitioning to a global sales model, adding sales rep in under penetrated areas, launching products into new markets and increasing our focus on high growth areas such as IBF genetic tests. We have made a lot of progress in these areas over the past year, I expect to continue, eat or to even have more progress as we go forward.","Now before I turn it over to Al, let me comment on a couple of other items. We another -- another strong year of revenue growth in 2017 including CooperVision growing 6% to 8% in constant currency and CooperSurgical growing 6% to 8% pro forma. We also remained bullish on our future and our updating our long-term objectives for operating margin of 28% and free cash flow generation of over $2 billion by 2021. In conclusion, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication.","And now I'll turn it over now to Al to cover the financial results.","Albert White","Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. Bob did an excellent job covering revenues so I'll focus on the rest of our Q4 financial performance along with guidance. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis and a whole reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is included in today's earnings release.","For the quarter gross margins were slightly over 64% with both, CooperVision and CooperSurgical up year-over-year. CooperVision improved roughly 50 basis points to 64.8% driven by factors such as currency and product mix while CooperSurgical grew roughly 30 basis points to 62.5% driven by cost reduction efforts. Operating expenses grew 11.7% in the quarter driven heavily by CooperSurgical's acquisition related activity. Within operating expenses sales and marketing grew 14% as both CooperVision and CooperSurgical executed on sales and marketing expansion plans to capitalize on strong product portfolios. Outside of sales and marketing, we drove leverage through general cost controls. Operating margins were 25.1%, up nicely from 24% last year driven by gross margin improvement and operating expense leverage.","Moving to interest expense, we reported $5.3 million which was lower than our guidance as we had a true-up of roughly $1.5 million. This true-up was associated with an over allocation of commitment fees in Q2 and Q3 related to the refinancing of our credit facilities completed in Q2 of this year. What should have happened is Q2 interest expense should have been lower by $600,000 and Q3 should have been lower by $900,000. Our effective tax rate was 10.3% and the resulting non-GAAP EPS was $2.28 with roughly $49.3 million average shares outstanding. Total debt decreased this quarter by $110 million to roughly $1.33 billion driven by strong free cash flow of $158 million comprised of $193 million of operating cash flow and $35 million of CapEx.","Regarding full year fiscal 2016 results, consolidated revenues were $1.967 billion, up 9.4% or 7.3% pro forma. CooperVision revenues were at $1.577 billion, up 6% or 7.5% in constant currency; and CooperSurgical's revenues were $390 million, up 26% or 6.3% pro forma. Non-GAAP EPS was $8.44, up 13%. Lastly, free cash flow was $357 million, so all in, a very strong year.","Moving to fiscal 2017 guidance; let me start by commenting on currency which has moved significantly against this over the past month or so. For 2017, were estimating a negative year-over-year currency impact of revenues of approximately $57 million, and negative $0.10 to EPS. Incorporating this into our outlook, we expect fiscal 2017 consolidated revenues of $2.09 billion to $2.13 billion. This is comprised of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion at CooperVision but equates to roughly 6% to 8% constant currency growth and $470 million to $480 million at CooperSurgical which equates to roughly 6% to 8% pro forma growth. We expect gross margins to improve to around 64.5% and operating margin to improve to 25%.","Interest expense is expected to be around $28 million which includes the additional debt from the Wallace acquisition along with an assumption of 125 basis point rate increase. The effective tax rate is expected to be around 10%, this may be higher than many of you were expecting but it's based on our current forecast which include fewer discrete items and is thus more of a true run rate of our current operations.","Non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2017 is expected to be in the range of $9 to $9.30 based on 49.4 million outstanding. To provide color on this, the higher year-over-year tax rate will negatively impact earnings by roughly $0.20 and FX will negatively impact earnings by $0.10. We also anticipate continuing to invest in sales and marketing above and beyond our normal levels and this will likely be in excess of $10 million or $0.20 cents in fiscal 2017.","Having said that we do have several positive such as accretion from our CSI acquisitions, plus ideal equipment and inventory charges, savings from manufacturing improvements and the royalty roll-up and these will help drive earnings growth. Regarding Q1 we anticipated revenues of $494 million to $508 million. This is comprised of $383 million to $393 million at CooperVision or roughly 7% to 10% constant currency growth; and $111 million to $115 million at CooperSurgical which equates to roughly 3% to 7% pro forma growth. For Q1 non-GAAP EPS we expected $1.78 to a $1.88 and note this assumes a 10% tax rate as compared to last year 3.9%.","And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jon Block of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Jon Block","Okay, great. Thanks guys, and good afternoon. And maybe the first question, we're still working through some numbers, didn't really surprise us all too much on the fiscal '17 guide. You went through a lot of numbers, so lows on 1Q, is that just a function of -- you do have the pound benefit for fiscal '17 but again, it really takes effect come January. So you only have that for a slight stub [ph] of 1Q that could be causing an approximately to $0.20 discount -- sorry, $0.20 disconnect where you guided 1Q versus Q3, that's a specific number. And then Bob, maybe just to take a step back, just some market commentary; be down 3% U.S. is very surprising, we get your number up 3% per year release. J&J I think was up 5% in change U.S. So how could two-thirds of the market be up a weighted 5% and we see negative 3% in the market data? Thanks.","Albert White","Yes, I'll answer the first one and then I'll let Bob get into the market data. Yes, I agree with you. I mean when you look at the pound move, most of that starts for us in January, so we get it for one month in the first quarter. So when you look at the incremental sales and marketing investments, and you look at the higher tax rate which is somewhere around $0.13 for Q1 combined with only getting the pound benefit really the month of January, I think that's probably where -- that probably comprises certainly the vast majority of the delta.","Bob Weiss","Yes, as far as the market, I think we've all scratched our head a little about kind of the results being reported by us and the -- and the various market players compared to some of the data we see and industry data. And probably the best way to think about it is that a year ago the Americans showed 11% growth and the entire market showed 8% growth worldwide, driven very heavily by the Americas. This year that kind of flipped to a negative of 3% for the Americas, and only 1% for worldwide. So you really have to look at five quarters or you know, better yet even, two rolling years because of what happened a year ago was -- all the activities by J&J as they rolled out new products, there were things going on with UPP, so channel sales -- so you end up with probably a D-link between the way data comes into CLI and the public company -- there is variances there too an including some of the activity associated with that. So when I think of the market, I kind of say, all right, just put the two together, last year's 11%, this year's negative 3%, that's 8% divide by two it, it looks more like 4% to me and in the interim, we had a fourth quarter 4%, a second quarter 4% and then a flat first quarter last year. So last year, my way of thinking last year ripples into the first quarter so that 11% third quarter showed up has a neutral first quarter. Long and short of it is it's probably that's a look at it as five the average of five quarters if you're going to make much sense out of. ","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Larry Biegelsen","Hey, guy, thanks for taking the questions. Hey Bob, I am sure to get out after this call, so I may as well ask about it, just any thoughts on corporate tax reform and how Cooper's view on this and how you think it could impact you guys. And then one other question just on the quarter itself the 11% obviously quite a strong, was there anything one time in the quarter, selling days, stocking etc. you know help to this quarter, thanks for taking the questions guys. ","Bob Weiss","Well, I will do the second one first, which is the there's nothing unusual about the 11% we're obviously rolling out there are some new products. We had a slightly easier cop from year ago, particularly relative to the Europe Theater was going through consolidation last year with the soft one but by and large solid -- solid quarter as far as tax reform. Well, tax reform common sense talk about or ever. And I give you two theories on our you know, I just walk in on one thing that's being thrown around out here, is a 35% going to 15% sites to say that would not be bad for most anyone. It will serve as a neutralizer two degree on however it shakes out the rest of the world, there too many different debates going on out there. There is the fact that any meaningful change would require voters are 60% of that Senate to go along with it and that could be are tough for only come what a lot of compromise, so I think it would be way premature to know if it is a net plus or net minus but most people wouldn't complain about a huge reduction in the corporate tax rate. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes the line of Matt Mishan of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Matt Mishan","Hey, good after noon, thank you for taking questions. Could you go a little bit further into the investment you guys are making in SG&A and really around the cadence and even break out what the differences between the gross SG&A from the investment and but growth in SG&A from the acquisitions that you're making, so we can get a better sense for, you know, how to model this?","Bob Weiss","So the investment we're making in SG&A is Alpha marketing. We're leveraging the rest of the infrastructure. And in the area sales and marketing that is both on the vision side, heavily feet on the street we're under index compared to our competitors and as I indicated I'm not to start quoting numbers of that, in terms of number of salesforce we're adding. So I would say we are also are rolling out many new products, some of the more conceptually new like manages. So there will be a fair amount of energy also supporting those new products. In putting the two together, we will while we're giving you guidance at 6% to 8% topline growth for both surgical and vision. We will be say growing off our sales and marketing at a rate faster. Primarily in the area of both feet on the street and to a lesser extent, the marketing support beyond that.","Beyond that we're not -- like I said we're not going to really get into how under index we are compared to our competitors and I would say it's many cases there will be not across the board, if you have a vacancy or you're under index in a geographic area, and I've always used an example of a city like Las Vegas, and said you know if you didn't have a sales person in Las Vegas it's a pretty big town, maybe I'd have a salesperson there if you have a lot of products to talk about. So in some cases is adding junior people to support senior people, and other places that will be having feet on the street where you're currently making telephone calls, and kind of piggybacking on that. ","Albert White","Then one quick comment on that, when you look at that breakdown between vision and surgical probably easiest way to think about it from a sales and marketing perspective as a sales and marketing each business is going to grow somewhat similar to what the revenues are. And they're as reported revenue, so if you look at that and CooperSurgical patients obviously it's quite higher percentage growth basis in Vision due to the acquisitions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from line of Matthew O'Brien of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Matthew O'Brien","Good afternoon, thanks for taking the question. Just -- on the daily side, the performance in the quarter was slight acceleration of what we saw last quarter. Can you talk a little bit about where that came from -- be it MyDay, be it Clariti, you know, maybe MyDay in Japan. And then on top of that, just -- the two-year stack on the non-daily side, it appears to have decelerated, can you just talk a little bit about what's going on there, you've seen some severe impact. Thank you.","Bob Weiss","Yes, the -- on the daily side, there was some acceleration having said that, we cannot target it for basically some approaching 50% for the year, slight acceleration from the prior year, just the way we thought about it coming into this year. So it's kind of moving along those lines in the way it's moving -- it's obviously the more mature market is EMEA where these products started out both MyDay and Clariti. The least mature is Japan, and the Americas; so we're very early in this cycle in those two areas and rapidly expanding the offering even in Europe. So it's geographically across all -- all feeders and very much, we've now kind of did the redo of the -- first Clariti, that was out there and that's performing real well; so we're now expanding our attention into more than our own accounts. Initially we had to take care of our accounts that we had given the first generation if you will, products too. So a long way to go and we're very early in the cycle and obviously moving off of a larger base as we go forward.","As far as the deceleration in the planned replacement area, the non 1-day; really that market if I -- if we look at it from a 2.5-year, 3-year perspective is in around breakeven with the growth all being driven by the 1-day, that's -- and pretty consistent over the last four years and we don't see that changing, actually it's been consistent a lot -- driver longer than four years but more so outside the U.S. and more recently inside the U.S. So don't see any changes there. There is activity in the planned replacement market, things like Biofinity obviously are still putting up terrific numbers, so there is room to grow and particularly, as we think about the geographic expansion, some of what goes in into China and into some of those theaters, maybe a little less weighted initially in the 1-day morality although that you can't make that statement about every country. So a lot of opportunities, even in the planned replacement arena and we're obviously continuing to grow that while the market may be not growing it if you will.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joanne Wuensch","Hi, good evening. Can you hear me OK?","Bob Weiss","I can hear you fine.","Joanne Wuensch","Wonderful. Two questions; the first one, is the new SG&A rate for 2017 -- should we think of that as the go-forward rate or do we think of that as a period of investment and then it should ease off? And then the second question, just talk about the tax issue, we're getting questions from investors regarding buying plan and what it means? You may or may not mean for Cooper, which manufacturer is it a fair bet outside of the United States generates, it's fair but if its revenue outside the United States? And I was curious if you have looked into that yet? Thank you.","Albert White","SG&A, is it short-term or long-term, the sales and marketing; we plan on continuing to invest throughout 2017 and as I indicated in my commentary, to the extent it will open the 2018 where we're getting the top line growth we want. We will continue that modality. What the driver there is, if you have a lot of products to talk about and you have the capacity, then you should try selling the products and leverage the capacity. We know we have excess capacity and why not use it. So to the extent we're getting our payback which will include diminishing the ideal charges that we're incurring on cost of goods as a byproduct, we're going to do it and we obviously have an agenda of gaining market share and we've certainly done a good job with that last seven years and if I look at it over the last 12 months, it's been greater than 2% that we've grow in the market. We can't make much out of this quarter's numbers because we grew six on the market one, and I grew one, I'm not going to say we're growing six times the market obviously we are growing up in and around that 2X.","Relative to the rest of operating costs, distribution, G&A, and even to a lesser extent R&D, we expect to get leverage out of those around the world. So it isn't to so that operating cost in total will keep going up as a percentage of revenue. As far as the Ryan plan, I'm not going to get too detailed into it because there are too many soft spots and too many assumptions you would have to make but I guess, I'd point one thing out which I think is very important. When we look at people think we're very oriented towards outside the U.S., the way we think. But the fact of the matter is our head count around the world is pretty balanced, U.S. and the rest of the world both after have to -- and asked to headcount. And that is after you count Porto Rico where will we make a billion lenses in Puerto Rico. That is the position of the United States and its part of U.S. So when we kind of think about this, every day that we're hearing about -- we -- the U.S. against the rest of the world, we the U.S. 5% compared to 95%. Of those outside the U.S. it as imbalanced in Cooper's model as some may think it is.","Long answer to short of it is, I'm not -- I'm not going to overreact to any series that gets thrown around out there, and I'll react to legislation -- there hasn't and meaningful legislation since I think 1986. There has been a few things along the way that have come and gone but it would be very premature to over analyze it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Willoughby","Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I guess first, Al, if we look back a month ago, as it relates to FX, what would you be thinking in terms of the impact from FX to the total company for 2017 at that point versus the $0.10 headwinds you're expecting now?","Albert White","Yes, well Steve, tough to say it right because it depends what day you choose, when Trump was elected, so to speak, I mean that's when currency rates really started moving. So if you go back to that date or prior to that day, you know, we -- we at one point in time would have been $0.30, $0.40 positive, we went ahead and win their bat [ph], we probably ended up with them -- I don't know what the exact number are but it that wouldn't surprise me -- $0.50 cent swing from what it was to what it is today, maybe even a little bit more than that.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. And then just a follow-up, you know, with the roughly 50% of 1-day silicone hydrogel growth this year, do you have any expectations for what that looks like next year?","Bob Weiss","Well, as I indicated, it's off of a larger base, so I wouldn't expect the 50% to be sustainable but I think in terms of whole dollars, that certainly should be some we would expect. We have so much opportunity and we have the capacity that all I'll say is, we'll put up solid numbers throughout 2017. But I'm not going to say it's any one -- any one particularly in percentage, let's put it that way.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Lawrence Keusch","Thanks. Good afternoon guys, couple of questions here. Just -- Al, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the FX assumptions that you are using for 2017 on the major currencies?","Albert White","Sure. It's pretty much today's rates, I mean they are obviously bouncing around a lot but you hear about 1.06 -- again at 1.14 pound at 1.26, and -- I mean that's kind of similar to where they are today right, and then other currencies around the world would be pretty similar to that.","Lawrence Keusch","Okay, perfect. And then, two other ones quickly here. I know you mentioned the outlook for free cash flow generation in totality through 2021 but how are you thinking about free cash flow generation this year? And may be rapid to that CapEx? And then I guess the last thing is to struggling a little bit with the first quarter and out wide so well, I understand the tax rate -- obviously, there is a tough comparison but can you talk a little bit about perhaps a gating for the past spending of this incremental for sales and marketing and is it weighted towards the first quarter or is it sort of more readable through the year?","Albert White","Yes, I'll hit cash and I'll let Bob go through it on the marketing side. For this year, we're probably going to be $400 million, should be north of $400 million of free cash, currencies certain as little bit right now but it should be somewhere in that $400 million range. CapEx, we'll see how that plays out, it looks like it's going to be somewhere around $150 million for the year. So if you work out those numbers, $400 million and $150 million, that's probably not a bad way to look at this year at this point in time.","Bob Weiss","Yes, and I think as far as the gating of the investment spend, and is it a drag on the first quarter, yet, it is a drag -- partly because of the fact that our first quarter is always the lightest on revenue basis -- from a revenue point of view which has always been the case and we started -- a lot of our investment started ramping in the fourth quarter or so, it's rolling into the first quarter; obviously it's part of the infrastructure already and we'll be somewhat of a drag. Some of our investments, if you will, that started in the first -- in the fourth quarter and worked its way through that first quarter will start yielding if you will as the year progresses and we start expecting a return from some of that towards the back half of the year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew [ph] of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for taking the question. Al I just wanted to go back just through '17 guidance and just -- you know, it looks like it's extremely conservative, at least from what I can tell right this second. I think is the first time you've -- you've embedded an interest rate increase in the numbers and 100 -- you know, it's a 125 bips, so I was just wondering, you know, is that around -- is that impacting around $0.18? And then, you know, I'm just trying to get a better feel for FX, SG&A and the higher tax rate -- and what's driving the higher tax rate for the year?","Albert White","Yes, a couple of comments. I mean if you look at their debt levels, $1.3 billion, acquired Wallace, obviously -- so a $100 million, another $150 million plus on that and it's pretty straightforward to do the math on the increase. We assume 1-Day 25 basis point rate increase happening with the fed moving here in the month of December, so we're kind of fully bacon [ph] that in for the year if you will. We could -- we're probably a little conservative on it, interest expense where we're at based on the amount of cash flow we're generating so forth and where we'll come out on that pricing grid but we'll see how that plays out.","When you look at the tax rate itself, we've been running on a -- on a look-through basis if you will, somewhere around that 10%, we had a number of discrete items that have come through, we've had acquisition related activity and so forth that it allowed some write-offs and so forth that have pushed the tax rate down. Could it come in lower than 10%? It could, but I would tell you right now based on what we have today, we're looking at somewhere around that 10% with Q1, Q2, Q4, probably be somewhat similar and as usual Q3 be a little bit lighter, but not as dramatic as what you see in prior years where you would see a quarter that was 3% or 4% quarter as an example.","Bob Weiss","So I think one way of looking at that is our fourth quarter effective tax rate is 10.3%, that is excluding any discrete items. So that's kind of what the business runs, ex-discrete items we've had year after year but do not anticipate going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you, good afternoon guys. Bob I wanted to start with you just on the sales force, so if I think about your sales force, I think it's about half to maybe 55% the size of your two larger competitors and your market share is kind of in that -- in that same range and so on the face of it seems like your sales force isn't overly undersized I guess. And then I think about your private label business, it's somewhere around 25% or 30% of revenue and I'd assume that's a lower touch business, so just wanted to understand why is the big focus on salesforce additions at this point? And what's really driving that? And then maybe, Al for you a follow-up question, you know, I think I agree your EPS guidance looks maybe like there is some levers of conservatism in there but 6% to 8% CBI growth in a fairly choppy market and maybe in a med-tech market, that's a little uncertain right now, it doesn't feel overly conservative to me, so maybe if you can address your thoughts on the 6% to 8% CBI growth for us '17 that would be helpful as well. Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Yes, Jeff on the size of our sales force compared to our competitors, I think if we can compare our 23% market share to Alcon's which is just dead above our -- it's suffice to say that the size their sales force compared to ours is nowhere comparable, and J&J if we're going to do allocations against market share there with their 40% market share or there in or about to our 23%, that would barely line-up. I think more importantly is -- it really is about -- if you have the products and we have the product portfolio and you have the capacity, something we have not had in the past, at least relative to clarity, my day and to a lesser extent even Biofinity, so if you have your -- the capacity you want, why wouldn't you test the water and see how good your products are? Why wouldn't you go after your competitor's accounts more aggressively? And we can't do it if we're under index on feet-on-the-street. So it's -- it's one thing if you are trying to growing methodically and you're confined with how much you can grow, it's another thing if you don't have those limitations which I'll call capacity.","Albert White","Yes, and I'll comment a little bit on that growth rate as such. I mean if you look at CooperVision last year, they grew 7.5% in constant currency, 11% in Q4. So obviously a lot of momentum there. You look at the Q1 guidance, it's 7% to 10% and expecting that momentum to continue, and Jeff, I think where you're going with this to your point is if you look at 6% to 8% percent for the year and you know that Q1 and you would be talking about implied guidance if you will, so Q2 to Q4 for CooperVision in the upper sixes which would decelerating in the face of some decent investment. So I think that's a very fair question. I would tell you -- I think that giving a 6% to 8% range in today's world is prudent and a good way to look at the business but I don't think anybody would be very happy, let me put it you that way, if we were growing in the 6% to 7% range.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the Anthony [ph] of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Maybe just one question on the sales investments and then one just on the competitive landscape to follow-up there. Just in terms of feet-on-the-street, I'm just wondering how much of the investment is focused on optometrists, that channel as opposed to other retail channels. And I guess the core of that is that we're under the impression that it's still the majority of sales for Cooper comes from optometrists. So just wondering if you're doubling down in that channel or expanding in other retail channels and then in terms of the competitive landscape that would just be great to get an update -- sort of where Alcon sits at this point, it looks like they are still in a position of giving up some share and similarly, Bausch and Lomb and J&J. Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Sure. You know our focus in terms of feet-on-the-street and whether it's independent ODs or ODs that are at the retail level is the OD wherever they are, and a lot of our super is very open as part of its strategy being -- could be branded, Biofinity or it could be private-label. So we're indifferent to what it's called but what we have learned in the past just because you send a bunch of your product whether it's private label or branded to a large retailer, if you don't work it, it's not going to work itself. You have to go to VOD whether they are under all of the retailer or not. So that has contrasted to maybe an online or some other mechanisms, we don't waste our time with that, if you don't write the prescription, you don't have our attention, and that will continue.","Relative to the competitive landscape, yes, our competitors continue to be in various stages of disarray, Alcon, we know what that CEO and Chairman of Novartis basically said, they are restructuring that organization, there is disruption there, they have a tired product-line, BNL likewise is in a very disruptive environment, not to say the least, and, you know, J&J has done a pretty good job of marketing one product, Oasis, by any other name is Oasis. So it's all over, 1-day, 1-week, 2-week, 1-month called VITA [ph]. So of the three competitors, I would say J&J kind of has in fact together better than the other two but having said that they are obviously presenting some opportunities in their approach. Are they in UPP one day and then there are out of UPP the next day.","UPP wholesale across all of their products and then they cased the entire thing come up with a different plan. So we we've been a pretty steady state in the way we're approaching the market. We have the product portfolio and we kind of feel good about our competitors.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Brian Weinstein","Thanks for taking the question. First one on margins, how you guys have targeted to improvement in MyDay by the end of the year and talked about clarity, getting north of corporate margins? Can you just comment kind of where the margins are on those products? And them Bob, for you, you had talked previously about 50% of the $10 billion market to be in the 1-day modality of that about somewhere between 20% and 77% to be in silicone hydrogel. In fact, maybe with middle of that made sense. With more experience now, how these products are rolling out, do you have more confidence that over the next few years that you're going to be churning more above that 50% of the market towards at 77%? Where do you think that that could be now by 2020? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Yes, I think we're rapidly approaching the 50% mark for 1-days and within 1-day silicone hydrogel is continuing to make solid progress growing 20%-ish in that market. And therefore it's now -- I think over 20% of the -- close to 25% of the 1-day market. So I do believe the 1-days will be more than 50% of the -- let's say that target $10 billion down the road, 2021, and who knows foreign exchange keeps coming a long kind of putting a dent in some of that so assuming the dollar stabilizes, you know that -- we're directionally headed towards that $10 billion. 1-day will be greater than 50% and there is no doubt that silicone hydrogel 1-day will be much greater than 20% of that 1-day market. And will it be similar to the planned replacement where it's close to 80% -- 79%, 80% or a lot less. I think there are some reasons that it won't -- well, beyond the 50% barrier short-term because there is so much activity in the non-silicone hydrogel mass market space that that will be somewhat barrier.","To answer your question about our cost coming down, MyDay is making good progress. We believe it's in the 30s now and we would expect that by 2018 sometime it will be homing in on that 50% target for 1-day gross margin, and Clariti because of its model approach to manufacturing and cost, will not be a drag and it's not a drag today on our gross margins. So the mix you see, it's holding its own within that mix and is a -- it's not a headwind on gross margin percentages.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Steven Lichtman","Thank you. Hi guys, just a couple of P&L follow-ups. First in terms of the investment in sales and marketing; should we be thinking about that as solely sales force higher investments or is there any discrete marketing investments that are embedded in there? And then secondly, Al, on the ideal equipment charges, the enhanced charges we've seen owing to the efficiencies, how should we be thinking about those rolling of in 2017?","Bob Weiss","So on the sales and marketing, it's more than just feet-on-the-street, albeit the concentration and the focus is more so feet-on-the-street. But with the new products, with Energys, with conversion of -- from Aviara to Vitality, with the new Toric, you know, our new MyDay Toric, all that activity, there is certainly is and particularly upfront as you come out with the new products, some energy on the marketing side. Some of that will tell off and some of it will continue as we roll it our around the world. So nothing, so I would say nothing eminent where it's certainly in a -- non-investment mode over the next one to two years. The roll-off of ideal equipment is somewhat a function of the success of the growth of our various areas, whether it's Vitality, whether it's MyDay, whether it's Clariti, the growth in those products will form the basis of consuming some of that ideal equipment over the next one to two years. We indicated partly because of the continuing successes in cutting cost and getting better yields and getting better throughput. We're now talking about lines with north of 80 million unit production that two years ago we didn't have on the drawing board by way of a thought.","So those kind of profound changes means we'll be able to continue to ramp up and continue to be ahead of the curve in terms of the demand side for quite a while in some of those areas, Clariti and MyDay. Al, I don't know what other -- how you want to\u2026","Albert White","Maybe just a quickly, that was exactly right, we quantify that just a little bit, we had talked last year about kind of $0.10 a quarter above and beyond for ideal equipment and some inventory charges. And we had that Q2, Q3, Q4 -- I would say that we're continuing to have that right now. Those ideal charges are mostly linked to daily side. So the growth the you're seeing is just absolutely fantastic for us, so continuing growth like that puts those lines to use and the ideal equipment goes down. So the expansion and the focus on sales and marketing to drive topline growth and driving single-use, the -- one of the nice benefit to that is it's going to put equipment to work, we obviously don't need to buy new equipment what helps free cash flow and we remove ideal equipment charges and put that into production. So I would say that we're still kind of looking at that $10 a quarter here to start the year but then depending upon our success, that will move down and hopefully move to zero by the end of this year but more likely we'll see those charges even move into 2018 a little bit.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bob Weiss for closing remarks.","Bob Weiss","Well, I want to thank you for joining our call today and wish everyone the happiest of holidays coming up.

Weiss","Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon and evening to everyone. Another solid quarter with a good start to the new year, top line growth of 16%, 11% in organic constant currency. Capital earnings per share was $1.50, up 34%, which includes $14 million of business interruption. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.23, up $0.11 or 10%, and our free cash flow was $19.2 million for the quarter and that brings our trailing 12-month free cash flow to $226 million.","Some highlights and key events. During the quarter, we successfully amended our CIBA, Alcon royalty agreement, giving updated guidance, factoring in investments and some foreign exchange, or the yen if you will, through December 21, 2012. We also successfully concluded our business interruption insurance process, receiving another $14 million in payments.","While the stock market sputtered to begin the New Year, we affected the repurchase of 450,000 of our own shares using $44 million of cash.","Our Origio acquisition got off to a good start, with revenues of $20 million or 24% growth. Our silicone hydrogel family, including the recent relaunch of our 2-week Avaira Toric, is humming up 38% in constant currency and now accounts for 40% of our CVI revenue.","Our balance sheet, even after the $44 million buyback, remains strong with debt to cap of 15%.","On sales, our silicone hydrogel family continues to drive results. During Q1, our silicone hydrogel family contributed -- continued to drive our top line and bottom line results. Silicone hydrogel revenues were $120 million. Our silicone hydrogel family grew 38% in constant currency. The family now encompasses 40% of CVI revenues.","The rollout of Biofinity Toric into Japan and the expected halo effect on the Biofinity Sphere, overall, Biofinity in Japan more than tripled. The relaunch of Avaira Toric is having the expected halo effect on the Avaira family of 2-weeks silicone hydrogel lenses. Overall, Avaira is up over 50% in constant currency worldwide.","We continued our confirmatory rollout of our single-use silicone still small [ph]. We believe several years down the road, as cost come down and prices to the consumer get lowered, that silicone hydrogel in the 1 Day modality will become more than what it is today which is a niche. In fact, as you will notice from our revised guidance on free cash flow, we have reduced forecasted free cash flow, reflecting our accelerated plans in this arena. We have now moved from confirmatory phase and are taking steps to accommodate a global rollout already in multiple continents. I might add that capital expenditures in 2013, 2014 is not expected to lower our 5-year objective of $1.3 billion in free cash flow.","Geographically, foreign exchange headwinds continue affecting our CooperVision results, impacting the top line by 2% in the quarter. Excluding foreign exchange, CooperVision constant currency growth was 14%. Last year, it was the euro. This year, it's the yen. With over $200 million in revenues in Japan, this is obviously having an impact not only on revenues, but also on our gross profit percent and operating margin percent. Even with this nuisance, our results are solid.","Regionally, we have put up solid constant currency growth in all accounts. America is up 18%; EMEA, up 7% constant currency; Asia Pac, 17%; and overall, as I indicated, 14%. Our growth drivers are, in the Americas, trading up to Biofinity, including the halo effect of Biofinity Multifocal, with the entire family doing well. Also, well off of a small base Proclear 1 Day and the Avaira Toric and family are significant contributors.","EMEA right now, currency is neutral. Driving our 7% growth in the region is the entire Biofinity family and Proclear 1 Days, while single-use silicone is still only a small contributor.","Asia Pac, while foreign exchange took its toll on a GAAP revenue basis, which was up 10%, our constant currency growth in revenue was up 17%. Drivers here: the Biofinity family, especially with the halo effect of Biofinity Toric; the Proclear 1 Day; as well as single-use torics.","Looking at the soft contact lens market. In the fourth quarter of 2012, it was up 5% in constant currency, while CooperVision was up 10%. For the calendar year, the soft contact lens market now, $7.3 billion worldwide was up 5% also on constant currency. CooperVision was up 11% on the strength of Biofinity and the 1 Day -- Proclear 1 Day product.","For the calendar quarter, market growth was sponsored by the 1 Day market, multifocals and torics. While CLI or Contact Lens Institute has now stopped reporting the growth of silicone hydrogel material, most likely the trade-up material remains solid growth material.","CooperVision was up 38% in constant currency in the first quarter of '13. And at CooperVision, silicone hydrogel now represents 40% of our revenue. The soft contact lens market continues to be a trade-up market. This includes 2 premium products: silicone hydrogel lenses, torics and multifocals. A trade-up of silicone hydrogel is in the 20% to 40% range. And importantly, a trade-up to the 1 Day disposable expands patient revenue by 400% to 600%. Even more importantly, the 1 Day wear generates 300% to 500% more profit.","Also, it's important to understand that torics and multifocals have a long way to go in capturing the market opportunities, especially outside the United States. Geographically, the strength of the Americas, up 5%; and Asia Pac, up 6%. During the final quarter of 2012 carried a weak EMEA, which was only up 2%. Overall, the market was up 5% for the quarter, at the midpoint of our 4% to 6% expectations.","CooperSurgical, our women's health care franchise turned in $78 million in revenue on the strength of more than $20 million of revenue contributed by Origio. CooperSurgical was up 37%. We were very pleased with the Origio revenue of 20%, up $20 million, which was up 24% over the comparable prior period. I might add, if we were to have owned the Origio business at the beginning of the prior year, our constant currency growth at Cooper would have been 12% while our women's health care growth would have grown at 7%.","Aside from IVF or fertility, if you will, which now accounts for 30% of CooperSurgical revenue, our surgical procedures continue to perform near double-digit growth. Overall, CooperSurgical now accounts for 20% of Cooper, with a solid gross margin and operating margins and very little CapEx requirements that translates to outstanding cash flow. While we have a fair amount of work to do in further leveraging our most recent acquisition, we will continue to focus on other things to buy that either fit the GYN office setting, IVF or surgical procedures.","Looking at guidance. We updated our guidance in late December following the amendment to our CIBA, Alcon royalty agreement. While the exact change has not been disclosed for contractual and competitive reasons, our revised guidance reflected several factors: the revised royalty; certain investment decisions; and the impact to foreign exchange, most notably the yen through December 20. The yen, which was at JPY 84 on December 20, has continued to soften and is now at JPY 93 to the dollar. With an excess $200 million in sales in Japan, this 1% further drop is a considerable headwind, impacting revenue, gross profit percentages, as well as operating margins.","Our new guidance reflects the strength and progress of our product portfolio, market share gains, favorable impact of our buyback of 460,000 shares of stocks and the favorable Q1 results. We are pleased to take up the bottom of our revenue and EPS ranges in spite of foreign exchange challenges we, like many other global companies, are currently experiencing.","On strategy, we are continuing with our successful strategy, which I've frequently articulated in the past. We believe it is solid, and it has delivered results. CooperSurgical is putting up outstanding results and is leveraging its infrastructure. This franchise was built with a solid understanding of the value of critical mass in a women's health care market, targeting the OB\/GYNs. We follow the professional wherever they go, office, surgi center hospital or IVF centers. Although the call points are different for each, the leverage is considerable.","CooperSurgical's Q1 '13 gross profit was 64%. Operating margins were 19%. And due to minimal CapEx requirements, CooperSurgical was a significant contributor to free cash flow. We are dedicated to the strategy, and we'll continue tuck-in acquisitions, as well as acquisitions outside the U.S. to leverage the CooperSurgical structure and products.","At CooperVision, the strategy is much more complicated, reflecting the fact that it's global in nature also. In the $7.3 billion soft contact lens industry, because of the uniqueness of our manufacturing platform and product portfolio, we are the only participant that can aggressively promote silicone hydrogel and non-silicone hydrogel, that is the Proclear family. We can emphasize branded and non-branded products. Note, private label does not mean lower operating margins.","We actively promote and specialize in custom lenses, with a high gross profit percent, of course. We support all modalities that the eye care professional promotes, 1 Day, 2 week, as well as monthly lenses. And we support all types of lenses, spheres, torics and multifocals, with close to 30% share on the high-growth specialty lens categories, torics and multifocal. It is acknowledged by eye care professionals that we are pretty good at specialty contact lenses.","Few would challenge why the success at Biofinity Toric for stigmatism. Put a great design together with a great material and great things can happen. We have seen similar successes for the same reason that Biofinity Multifocal would shift to market in the middle of calendar year 2011.","On the capacity front, with the exception of Avaira Toric, we are ahead of plan to deliver considerable more product where we have been previously supply constrained, The Biofinity family, Proclear 1 Day, our 1 Day Torics, are all in good capacity shape. Our newest challenge will be to ramp up 1 Day silicone hydrogel as yet a niche market.","On pricing, we, like the rest of the soft contact lens industry, have a trade-up strategy. Our new wearers and existing wearers are targeted for silicone hydrogel lenses, the Proclear family and the 1 Day and single-use lenses. Each creates more revenue per wear. A 1 Day modality, for example, results in 4x to 6x more revenue per wear. While this strategy sacrifices the gross margin percent, it generally creates 3x to 5x more profit per wear. Of course, this strategy competes head-on with the lens care space since we are shifting the wear resources from lens care contact lenses only. Competing for lens care dollars is more of a problem for some of our competitors. In my opinion, we continue to be the most focused company in the industry, lacking many of the distractions that some of our competitors are now going through. I might add, with Biofinity, Avaira and Proclear, we have a lot of talk about with eye care professionals all around the world.","As we look down the road over the next several years, we expect to continue improving operating margins and delivering above-average shareholder returns. We expect to continue to average double-digit earnings per share growth while investing in geographic expansion and new product developments. In today's market, we have a solid product portfolio to leverage in all modalities, multiple materials, all lens types, and we retain our expertise to emphasize customizing the lenses for the 10% to 20% of those lens wearers requiring other than the standard lens sizes and\/or designs.","We have a lot of work to do before we come anywhere close to having exploited our #1 contact lens family, Biofinity. This is particularly true when it comes to geographic expansion and fully developing the Biofinity family of torics and multifocals around world. The same applies to Avaira, where the Avaira Sphere has anxiously awaited the relaunch of Avaira Toric. The combination will put us in a much better position to exploit the U.S. 2-week space owned by Johnson & Johnson and to also exploit our private label strategy more aggressively with this family.","While we already have pretty respectable gross and operating margins from a cost perspective, we have considerable upside yet to be fully developed. Upside includes the complete elimination of the silicone hydrogel royalty, with the expiration of patents in September 2004 -- 2014, rather, in the United States and March 2016 in the rest of the world. The reduction of our manufacturing cost by, among other things, improving mode molding cycle time, increasing capacity utilization and improving yields in general. Each of these are key goals to us.","Also, given the considerable amount of free cash flow we generate, we will continue to look for tuck-in acquisitions and geographic expansion opportunities, like Origio, in our 2 businesses. The key requirements, however, is that they must exceed our minimum investment hurdle rates. They must achieve over time a hurdle rate that exceeds 10%.","Additionally, the markets for our women's health care and soft contact lenses are much less developed outside the United States.","We generate a considerable amount of cash flow offshore due in part to our level of manufacturing outside the United States. As such, we will continue to aggressively invest in global expansion opportunity. With over 95% of the people on the planet outside United States, we believe we will find opportunities to invest in other countries for decades to come, thereby, retaining our low effective tax rate indefinitely.","Finally, we again demonstrated we are opportunistically willing to go into the market and buy our stock at certain times.","In summary, before I turn it over to Greg, let me say how pleased I am with our ongoing progress. We continue to outperform the marketplace, growing 1.5x to 2x or 2x X, a respectable market growth. Our top line growth in the skittish global economy remains solid, and I am very pleased at our double-digit organic constant currency growth during this last quarter.","Our family of products, Biofinity, Avaira, 1 Day single-use silicone hydrogel, Proclear 1 Day, as well as now our IVF family, where we are #1 in the world, all offer promising growth going forward. We continue to execute well and continue to invest in geographic expansion in the new product pipeline. And yes, R&D spending increased 20% over the prior quarter of last year.","While we are still early in our expansion programs in each of the BRIC countries and there are challenging -- challenges in each of them, I am very pleased with the progress we have made to date. Our women's health care franchise has become more global with the Origio acquisition. We remain keenly focused on delivering the improving results, mindful of our desire to invest and leverage prudently, thereby, delivering respectable total shareholder return.","Lastly, as always, a reminder that at Cooper, our #1 asset is our employees. To them, a big thank you for consistently delivering great results.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Greg.","Gregory W. Matz","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Bob has given you a pretty thorough review of the market and our revenue picture. Let me start with gross margins.","Looking at gross margins in Q1, the consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 63.3% compared with 64.5% for GAAP and non-GAAP in Q1 last year. As compared to the prior year, which was our highest gross margin quarter in 2012, we did see some headwinds due to the impact of the yen on our revenue and the related direct impact on gross margins. In addition, Avaira successfully relaunching and as we've discussed in prior quarters, Avaira does have a lower than the company average gross margin. Finally, we also saw a mix impact due to Origio, which we acquired in July 2012.","Despite these headwinds, we continue to run favorable margins well above 60% due to strong products like Biofinity, increased manufacturing efficiencies and, as of January 1, a reduced CIBA royalty. We believe our full year gross margin will be in a range of 64% to 65%.","CooperVision on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis reported a gross margin of 63.1% versus 64% for GAAP and non-GAAP in Q1 last year. As I just mentioned, CooperVision's gross margin was negatively impacted by the weakening of the yen, as well as the success of Avaira as it relaunches into the market. We remain excited about Avaira as it opens up the 2-weeks silicone market, especially in the U.S., which we were not addressing effectively last year at this time.","Similar to Q4, CooperSurgical had a gross margin of 64.1%, which compares to Q1 '12 of 67.2%. Excluding Origio, gross margin would have been 66.5%.","Now looking at operating expenses. SG&A in Q1 on a GAAP basis, SG&A expenses increased by 14% from Q1 last year to $150.7 million and were 40% of revenue similar to the prior year. Excluding Origio, SG&A would have grown 7% and would have been 39% of revenue.","In the base business, we continue to see some spending on marketing sales headcount, numerous marketing projects and product launches around world, including ongoing geographic expansion efforts, as well as expenses to relaunch additional Avaira Toric fitting sets.","Now touching on the medical device excise tax. The rules have recently been finalized. Whereas in Q4, we assumed this cost should be in cost to goods sold. We have now determined that the majority of the tax will be in SG&A, with a very de minimis amount in cost to goods sold for imported intercompany sales to finished goods. As you know, this tax only impacts CSI. In the quarter, we had $230,000 hit SG&A.","Now looking at R&D. In Q1, R&D increased by approximately 20% year-over-year to $13.7 million or up about $2.2 million, of which Origio makes up 50% of the increase. R&D was 3.6% of revenue, up from 3.5% in Q1 '12 and the same as the prior quarter. The non-Origio spending increase is mainly attributable to spending on new product development in clinicals. As we've discussed in the prior quarter, would expect that R&D, excluding Origio, will continue to grow slightly faster than sales during the fiscal year.","Now looking at depreciation and amortization. In Q1, depreciation was $24.1 million, up $3.9 million or 19% year-over-year. And amortization was $7.4 million, up $1.8 million or 33% year-over-year, for a total of $31.5 million. Origio amortization for the quarter was approximately $2 million.","Moving to operating margins. For Q1, consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $68.8 million or 18.1% of revenue versus $61.7 million or 18.9% of revenue in Q1 '12. This represents an 11% increase in operating income over Q1 '12. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the Origio acquisition-related cost of approximately $600,000, operating income and margin were $69.4 million or 18.3% of revenue versus the 18.9% in the prior year. This reduction in operating margin is attributable to the year-over-year decrease in gross margins I mentioned earlier, partially offset by improvements in SG&A.","Interest expense was $2.6 million for the quarter, down 30% year-over-year. We expect to finish the year with interest expense in the $10 million to $11 million range.","Included in the line item gain on insurance proceeds is $14.1 million of insurance proceeds for business interruption related to the October 28, 2011, incident we've discussed before in which a pipe ruptured in our fire suppression sprinkler system, causing water and fire retardant foam damage to one of our manufacturing buildings in the U.K. We have completed the business interruption claims process and are now not expecting any additional payments.","Looking at the effective tax rate. In Q1, the GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate was 7.5% and 9.2%, respectively, versus Q1 '12 GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate of 7%. In the prior year, our rate was favorably impacted by a settlement with the IRS, which resulted in the release of certain reserves.","In the current quarter, we had a favorable impact due to the R&D tax credit being retroactively enacted, as well as favorable impacts in the business interruption gain and the CIBA royalty settlement. As we've discussed before, the ETR continues to be below the U.S. statutory rate as the majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower taxes.","For the full year, the GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 7.5% to 9.5%, and the non-GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be in the range of 10% to 11%. I will mention on a quarterly basis, this rate does fluctuate and our Q2 rate tends to be higher than the average rate for the year.","Those following stock option comp, Q1 was $9.4 million. EPS, as Bob mentioned, our earnings per share for Q1 on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis was $1.50 and $1.23, respectively, versus $1.12 on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis Q1 '12. Earnings per share was up 34% and 10% on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, respectively, versus the prior year.","Briefly touching on the share buyback program. As of the end of the first quarter, we had purchased an additional 460,000 shares of the company's common stock for $44.4 million at an average price of $96.34 per share. There is still $184.5 million available under this program. We estimate that this will have a $0.04 to $0.05 impact on our full year non-GAAP EPS.","I wanted to touch on FX. FX impact, during Q1, we saw dramatic fluctuations in key currencies. The impact on Q1 was relatively small and around the negative $0.03 year-over-year. However, given the move in the yen and the recent moves in the euro and the pound, the impact for Q2 through Q4, assuming today's rates, will be estimated negatively $24 million on revenue. Although we have offsets from our overseas operations and eventually from lower cost pound-based inventory, this will amount to approximately a $0.22 impact on EPS. As indicated in our guidance, we plan to hurdle this but it's definitely a headwind.","Looking at balance sheet and liquidity. In Q1, we had cash provided by operations of $47.6 million, capital expenditures of $29.3 million, insurance recovery of about $600,000 and excluding Origio acquisition-related cost of $300,000 resulted in a $19.2 million of free cash flow.","Total debt increased within the quarter by $34.3 million to $408 million due to a $44.4 million of share repurchases. Debt as a percent of total capitalization is now 15%. This leaves us with approximately $624 million of total credit available at January 31.","Inventories increased by $5.2 million to $325.4 million from last quarter. For the quarter, we're seeing months on hand at 7 months, down from months on hand of 7.1 months last year and up from 6.7 months last quarter. Accounts receivable continues to be closely monitored, with DSOs at 58 days, down from 59 days last year.","With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session.","Kim Duncan","Operator, we're ready to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Greg, I guess, wanted to touch first on margins or, I guess, my one question, touch on margins here. I was hoping you could quantify, I guess, first in the quarter, what may be some of the Avaira relaunch cost, what that impact was on a dollar basis? I think you broke that out last quarter, so if you could break that out again this last quarter. And then as I look at your gross margin guidance for the year, it goes up 50 basis points, but you're taking the med device tax out of there, moving that into SG&A. And obviously, with the renegotiation on the royalty, it seems to me like you're kind of core gross margin now expectations are maybe 50 to 100 basis points lighter than they had been. Is that accurate? And I didn't hear an operating margin guidance for the year.","Gregory W. Matz","Okay, Jeff. Yes, thanks. First up on Avaira, we had about $2.4 million worth of relaunch cost, but that was in OpEx, SG&A and not in the gross margin. The gross margin hit was really around the fact that the average gross margin for Avaira is less than our average for the company in gross margin, so that's where you get the gross margin impact. Again, the yen was a big impact also. You were talking about, let's see, the gross margin percent for the year. Just going back to, let me just -- drew a blank, hit on the -- let me come back to that, Jeff. On the operating margin, the guideline is going to be 21% to 22% for an operating margin.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Yes, the question had been on gross margin. I think prior to today, you were guiding 63.5% to 64.5%. That's now 64% to 65%. So you brought that up 50 basis points, but you've also moved medical device tax out of there, which was probably going to be about 30 basis points. So net guidance hasn't really changed yet with the renegotiated royalty. It felt like there should be maybe 100 basis points upside to your prior guidance. So why is the core gross margin outlook coming down? And I'm assuming it must be yen is the main explanation.","Robert S. Weiss","Jeff, let me just kind of jump on one thing. We're -- you may detect that we're a little evasive in the area of putting too fine of a pencil on all of the components of gross margin, and we're not going to leave ourselves into a mode where we're going to be specific on the royalty as a default. So there's a package there. The yen -- it includes the yen. It's having a profound impact on the total package, as well as the weighting of Avaira, as well as in the total scheme of things. Obviously, Origio has some impact on the overall mix also. But relative to giving a lot of fine details other than what the range is going to be, we're probably going to steer clear of a good amount of that. And that's really competitive, as well as contract that we're steering clear.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Greg or Bob, I wanted to touch on the revised free cash flow guidance. And I know, Bob, in your prepared comments, you referenced the fact that you are accelerating the move forward with these single-use silicone hydrogel lens. So if you could just tell us exactly what you're planning there and how you're thinking about CapEx now for the year because I assume that's really the differential in the free cash flow guidance.","Robert S. Weiss","Yes, I'll say, we had in our prior guidance, I think we're in the neighborhood of $120 million to $150 million estimate of CapEx. We're now moving more into the mode of the $200 million to $250 million range of CapEx, and that includes a lot of things to do with silicone hydrogel, in general, as well as the bring forward of our plans on single-use facilities -- single-use silicone hydrogel facilities, as well as equipment, obviously. That is nothing more than saying we're really happy with the progress and how the product has been in the market, particularly in Europe where we started, that we're bringing forward those plans to aggressively move into that market, recognizing that probably in the 2- to 3-year time horizon, it's going to turn out of -- move from a niche market into something more than that. And quite frankly, we'll be there to not only participate, but to support that trend. So it's a pretty big number. It is what I would view as a lot of 2-year upfront spending, meaning there's a fair amount of equipment involved in getting to that point where you can have a robust product line. And then it tails off fairly rapidly after that 2-year period, and that's why I indicated we expect by the end of 5 years to have our cash back. We're not coming off of that $1.3 billion targeted free cash flow number.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And Bob, would you just be willing to talk a little bit about where you're targeting these launch sites and your target about coming into the U.S? And what's the FDA pathway look like there?","Robert S. Weiss","Well, we're expecting a fairly routine path within the next 2 years into the U.S. We're expecting from the point of view of facility expansion, that's mainly going to be at our 2 primarily facilities in Puerto Rico and the U.K., both. And now we will -- the market has taken hold a lot more outside the U.S. At the end of the day, it really is today a Japanese market, it is not the a U.S. market. Quite frankly, J&J has done minimal in the U.S. market with TruEye and they really -- their focus has really been much more outside the U.S., particularly in Japan. And so we see it that way initially. So they're in the sense of urgency to the U.S. market is still, I think, muted as far as how fast you have to get there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple here. Legal costs and SG&A related to the CIBA agreement, anything onetime? Also, Bob, Americas was 8% growth in CooperVision in Q1 versus 3% last quarter and 11% in the third quarter. Can you talk about the large acceleration this quarter?","Robert S. Weiss","Okay, yes. Legal costs have tailed off considerably from the fourth quarter where, of course, there was a large amount of activity. So I would say, really was on those matters, fully sub-$1 million being spent. It's not the -- if you will, the catalyst of any of the OpEx ratios per se. Relative to the Americas, Americas is considerably more robust if you look at it from the point of view of the calendar -- I'm sorry, the fiscal quarter, mindful of the fact that we have easier comps this year over last year in the Americas because of some of what we talked about in the fourth quarter regarding the pipeline fill in the fourth quarter of 2011. So the comps are somewhat easier. And therefore, when you look at the calendar quarter, it doesn't show it, meaning, the calendar quarter for CooperVision was 5% in the United States and 7% in the Americas, and then it jumps way up in the fiscal quarter to where you see the 18% for the Americas growth. So that explains really the year-over-year comp on a fiscal quarter basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","It's Joanne Wuensch. The decision to accelerate the 1 Day lens, what was the thought process behind that?","Robert S. Weiss","I guess, twofold: one is reactionary, meaning we know our competitors have announced large capital projects, 2 of them have, one in Ireland and one in Georgia. And so maybe a little speculative on what they're working on, but we have a pretty good idea what we think they're working on. Two is the product is -- we're pleased with the results of the product and good to go. And you can assume that, that means we're also pleased with our learning curve thus far in making the product. So directionally, we're happy with where we're going from a cost of goods point of view, not that where we need to get, but clearly have made some pretty good progress and enough progress to take the next step.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And can you comment on Avaira? I mean, you've had 2 or 3 quarters here of a relaunch, where you are in the process and where uptake is?","Robert S. Weiss","What was your second question?","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And where uptake is? I mean, in theory, the Toric Avaira should be pulling through the Sphere Avaira. I'm curious if that's actually playing out.","Robert S. Weiss","Yes, the Avaira, in my comments, I mentioned that there is a halo effect at Avaira Toric. It's nicely pulling the Sphere and that the family of products. I didn't get into breaking out the Toric versus the Sphere. But suffice it to say, the Toric couldn't do it alone, but the family of products was north of 50% growth year-over-year -- for the quarter. So we're happy with that. And really, there is still a capacity limitation, that there will be for essentially most of this year -- calendar year that deals with Avaira Toric and, therefore, there's some limitations that we want to make sure we don't get too far or get ahead of ourselves on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kim Gailun with JPMorgan.","Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So 2 questions. I think the first is on the top line. Just curious on the strong revenue performance. Was there any meaningful inventory shift in the channel in the quarter or any stocking, I guess, for any of the new products that you launched?","Robert S. Weiss","Answer, no.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","My question is on the share repurchase. I know that some quarters you're buying shares, some quarters you aren't. Are you expecting to be buying shares in each of the quarters over the rest of the year?","Robert S. Weiss","I was careful to use the words that our strategy is opportunistic, and we don't define if and when on purpose, obviously. But as much as anything, it's not preprogrammed where we have to go out and do something one way or the other. It's opportunistic.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Cooley with Stephens.","Christopher C. Cooley - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Bob or Greg, I was hoping you maybe help us think about just your overall growth. You're clearly taking share in the marketplace, but you're also benefiting from the trade-up to silicone hydrogel and greater growth in dailies, a cycle a number of your peers have already gone through on the trade-up to silicone hydrogel. Help us think about pricing and mix versus volume when we think about your growth guidance for the full year for CVI?","Robert S. Weiss","You're correct, Chris, that some of what's going on is we're still lagging the market in total in the trade-up of silicone hydrogel and clearly in the area of the trade-up to 1 Day. We're basically 1\/2 indexed of the marketplace there or well a little north of that but not much. So we have a long way to go on 1 Day. And while we're doing stellar on the silicone hydrogel family and it's something we continue to expect to greatly grow faster than the marketplace, part of that is trade-up but, quite frankly, part of it is taking new fits from competitors. So it's a healthy combination. I would say, it's well-balanced relative to when you look at the components, how much further do you have with 1 Day, the fact that you already are a share leader in the 2 high-growth ends of the market relative to type of lenses, torics, multifocals. And we certainly are exhibiting high growth in multifocal, albeit it's a smaller category. There's a lot of moving parts. But I think when you look at the product data we give you relative to how we measure up on every front, we're doing pretty darn good on every region, every type of lens, every modality. And there aren't -- I don't think there are too many holes in it relative -- that means, relatively speaking, we should be able to do pretty well for the indefinite future. Our products are still fresh in my opinion. Proclear 1 Day is early in its cycle. Biofinity, while it's been at it 4, 5 years now, is not indicating any slowness and still has a lot of leveraging or halo effect, if you will, around the world. And so I don't quite frankly -- from a mix point-of-view, we're still headed the right way from a trading up point-of-view, we're headed the right way, and from a taking new fits perspective, we're in good shape also.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Bob, I just wanted to follow up on that stocking question, and I have just another question on competition. Specifically, last quarter, you said that there was some distributor destocking related to Sandy. So I'm wondering, did distributors restock in the quarter or do they keep at levels of last quarter? And then secondly, the question about fiscal versus calendar in the United States. You essentially grew 5%. Market grew 5%. And you said it's due to comps. But can you address that same thing in the U.S. really to competition? Are you seeing any changes there?","Robert S. Weiss","Well, relative to Sandy, I don't want -- I don\u2019t think I ever played the importance of Sandy in the contact lens arena. Actually, it was slightly bigger in our women's health care than it was in our contact lens business. It was a minimal event relative to contact lens, that's why, because we ship out of Rochester and the products pretty much got out there. Relative to the stocking, I'll kind of answer that in multiple ways. Number one, we recall that in the second quarter of last year, there was kind of an anomalous result that took place where the market kind of went south on us in April following whatever happened in March. So there clearly was some things going on with our competitors in that cycle, certainly not going on with our competitors in our cycle, which was really in October of 2011, where we thought we had done a good job of managing our distributors in the first, second and third quarter of 2011, but they still had a full year incentive. And because of that, they bought a lot in October of 2011, which negatively impact the comps in the first quarter of 2012. And as a result of that, our comps in the U.S., from a fiscal year point of view, are easier in the U.S. in the first quarter this year compared to the U.S. a year ago. That has nothing to do with our competitors. But suffice it to say, we're keenly aware that there are things our competitors occasionally do that impact it. We didn't see anything unusual following calendar year end, meaning there was nothing about January and February that leads us to believe there was anything strange going on. We're keenly aware that there is some ripple effect at the retail and between, if you will, the split of 1800 and Wal-Mart. Certain things happening within retail that pretty much are not, as far as I'm aware, germane to the -- at the manufacturers level.","Gregory W. Matz","Amit, this is Greg. I would just throw in too that if you look at Q1 over Q1 year-over-year, the U.S. distributor days on hand inventory was about the same.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kim Gailun with JPMorgan.","Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm just back in. I had a follow-up on the gross margin and the line of questioning from Jeff earlier. So I think some more clarification with the updated guidance would be helpful. You obviously have the Medtech tax moving out of the gross margin guide. But is it fair to think about -- so essentially, you are kind of taking down your gross margins guidance. And is it fair to think about essentially the benefit that you got, roughly speaking, from the lower CIBA royalty being about offset by currency, just sort of in terms of round numbers? Or are there other factors at play we should be thinking about, like mix?","Robert S. Weiss","So overall, we took our -- from -- the last time we gave guidance, which was in early December, we gave gross margin guidance of 63.5% to 64.5%, and we've now taken that up 50 basis points to 64% to 65%. And there's no doubt, the positive -- on the positive side is royalty, on the negative side is the yen and foreign exchange. Because if you take a model of the yen, you could -- I gave you that. Basically, it's a $200 million franchise there. You could do certain what ifs and kind of get some idea what that might -- that range may look like. So those 2 kind of blend. Beyond that, there is certain mix components. I've talked about us pushing harder in 1 Day silicone hydrogel. That would be a negative. The Avaira relaunch and Avaira doing well north of $50 million is obviously a more negative. And Origio, quite frankly, which has lower gross margins, doing very robustly, north of $20 million is arguably a mix negative. So there's a fair amount of -- when you get into all the granular pieces, a fair amount of moving parts, I would acknowledge, but I also said we're not going to give you a real lot of clarity because we want to protect the real question everyone has, which is, so exactly, what was the change in the royalty?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien with William Blair.","Kaila Krum","This is Kaila in for Matt. We were just wondering exactly where you guys are in the life cycle of Biofinity? I know you mentioned it really hasn't seen any slowdown. But what sort of comfort do we have that these above market growth rates are sustainable going forward?","Robert S. Weiss","Well, we're -- there are obviously no guarantees when does it start leveling off a little. But having said that, we have really not been in the market all that long with Biofinity Multifocal, which is, if you will, the third leg of the halo effect. We have just really got to Japan with a real more robust launch beginning this fiscal year. So suffice it to say, we're still early with the Biofinity Toric launch in Japan, and it certainly hasn't annualized. There is a lot of growth of torics and multifocals outside the U.S., and we obviously have a great product in the right modality in that front. So we're pretty optimistic that there are a lot of legs left to it. And I might add that the Sphere is very close to 30% growth in and of itself. So there is nothing wrong with even what one might say is the most mature of the 3 between the Sphere, the Toric and the Multifocal doing pretty well, which, to me, is an indicator that there is a fair amount of legs left in this family.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A two-fold question for Bob and Greg on the yen. Can you review your hedging plans for the yen later this year, if there's any plans to put in different hedges related to the weakness and how long those would be put out and then whether or not the current weakness in the yen is affecting the launch plans for Biofinity Toric in Japan? And then one follow-up.","Robert S. Weiss","From a hedging point of view, we don't -- we did hedging for 2 or 3 years. On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is a disaster, I would call it a 1. On a scale of understandability, where 1 was totally non-comprehensible, I'd call it a 1. It was something we chose to move away from and stay away from, so it is not our intent to crystal ball where currencies are going. You can't hedge after the fact. So that's history already that the yen is where it is, and I know a lot of people have very strong views on where it's going to go next. But if everyone really knew, they could make a lot of money, I suppose, on where it's going to go next. So I don't subscribe to that. Relative -- so the answer on hedging is, no we don't hedge. We do have kind of a global balance over time. But there is no doubt, when currencies move on their own, that we can win one way -- we can win sometimes and we can lose sometimes. And in this case, we're on the wrong end as is the marketplace. Your second question, you want to repeat that?","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just if the currency weakness there is impacting at all the Biofinity Toric launch plans in Japan. You mentioned that's earlier this year that, that occurred. I'm just wondering how that all plays out there.","Robert S. Weiss","No, locally, it's not really impacting anything. We put up 17% growth numbers in constant currency, 10% in actual in that entire region. So I would say, no, there is no -- nothing is changing because of that dynamic.","Operator","At this time, there are no additional questions in queue. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Robert Weiss, CEO, for closing remarks.","Robert S. Weiss","Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us. Hopefully, you're as excited about our top line growth, our market share growth as I am, and the fact that we're pleasantly moving forward with the silicone 1 Day project, which I find real exciting.","Keep in mind what I said about the market trading up as this market continues to grow towards the 1 Day modality, that's a 4x to 6x trade-up, which is going to be good for sustained growth, in my opinion, for the marketplace. And while gross margins may come under pressure because of that, clearly, I like the idea making 300% to 500% more profit on a contact lens wearer. So I would take that all day, all year, all decade, and we're pretty excited about that.","So with that, I look forward to talking to you and updating you on where we are in June. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"6032":["The Cooper Companies, Inc.

Welcome to the second quarter 2017 conference call. This was a strong quarter and we continue to feel confident about the remainder of this year and into the future for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical having a lot of momentum.","On a consolidated basis, we reported $522 million in revenue on a non-GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.50. CooperVision posted another strong quarter in all key areas with 4% as reported or 7% constant currency revenue growth.","Daily silicone hydrogel lenses grew 43%, while Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 12% both in constant currency. CooperSurgical posted revenue growth of 23% or 3% pro forma. Fertility posted growth of 52% or 5% pro forma.","Moving to the details, CooperVision posted second quarter revenues of $408 million, up 7% in constant currency. By geography, the Americas grew 4%, EMEA grew 10%, and Asia-Pacific grew 9%, all in constant currency.","CooperVision\u2019s growth continues to be driven by a diverse portfolio of Clariti and MyDay in the daily space, Biofinity in the monthly space, and Avaira in the two-week space. Regarding daily lenses, our broad offering of silicone hydrogel lenses continues to drive growth. The daily market is critical to our strategy of gaining share and we remained focused on driving success in this space.","Our Clariti portfolio of spheres, torics, and multifocals leads the way as the mass-market offering. We continue to see very nice growth in all three regions. Our MyDay spheres and torics are also doing very well in the premium space as we continue to rollout MyDay toric in Japan and various parts of Europe.","Biofinity, we continued seeing success around the world with strong growth in all regions. We also continued making progress rolling out our expanded offerings which include Biofinity Energys and Biofinity Toric XR. These are products are available in a number of different markets and we\u2019ll continue rolling them out over time.","Within the two-week space, we successfully transitioned wearers to Avaira Vitality from our legacy Avaira product. This is for both spheres and torics. Vitality is a nice upgrade and our customers are receiving this change well. We expect this transition to occur through the remainder of the year and into next.","Turning to our product -- to product categories, torics grew a solid 12% and multifocals grew 4% both in constant currency. We are the global leader in these areas of lenses with a highly diversified product offering including both silicone hydrogel and traditional hydrogel lenses within the daily, two-week, and monthly modalities.","Looking at just silicone hydrogel lenses, these products are 18% in constant currency and now represent 66% of total CooperVision sales. These products are the drivers of our growth and we believe they are -- they have a bright and long future.","Our product portfolio is the broadest in this space and I believe offers the best options. This includes being the only offering premium and mass-market daily silicone hydrogel lenses including spheres, torics, and multifocal lenses.","Turning to the overall contact lens market, in calendar Q1, we took share growing two times the market or 10% against the market growth of 5%. Breaking it down geographically, we grew 8% in the Americas while the market grew 3%. We grew 10% in EMEA, while the market grew 7%. And we grew 16% in Asia-Pacific, with the market up 7%.","On a modality basis, single-use lenses continued driving growth, with CooperVision up 17% and the market up 13%. For non-single use lenses, we grew 7%, with the market down 1%. For the trailing 12-month period, CooperVision grew 9% while the market grew 4%, so another strong year where we more than doubled the market.","Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% market growth driven by the continuing shift to improve technologies such as a wider suite of silicone hydrogel lenses, the continuing trade-up of daily and specialty lenses such as torics and multifocals, geographic expansion and the expansion of Avaira base particularly outside the United States. And given our strength in these areas, along with the broad private label offering, we continue to grow faster than the market.","Moving to CooperSurgical, we reported second quarter revenues of $114 million, up 23% driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 3% with the fertility leading the way up 52% or 5% pro forma.","Within fertility, we experienced some disruption this quarter from aggressively consolidating distributors associated with past acquisitions. Having said that, we started seeing some upside from recent sales and marketing activity, so getting this activity transferred in-house is the right move.","Overall, within IVF, we\u2019re continuing to execute on our growth strategy as a global leader in medical devices and genetic testing within the fertility space. Our fertility growth is driven by diversified portfolio of medical device products, capital equipment, and lab services, and we believe our portfolio is the broadest in this space.","Our office and surgical products business grew 1% for the quarter, similar to our IVF business we expect growth in Q3 and Q4 to improve based on our momentum with new product rollouts led by EndoSee, our disposable hysteroscope and new business that we've recently won.","Finally on CooperSurgical, we are making a lot of progress integrating acquisitions, including having completed a significant portion of our distributor consolidations. We broadly -- we probably have roughly another 12 months of integration activity in other parts of the business, but things are moving along well. Given this progress, we expect improve topline growth for CooperSurgical beginning in the third quarter. Overall, I remain very excited about the future of CooperSurgical and we believe we are on the right path.","With that, I want to express our appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication. They truly drive the success of our business. And now I will turn it over to Al.","Al White","Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Bob covered revenues, so let me focus on the rest of the financials and guidance.","For the quarter, consolidated gross margins were very strong at 66%, up from 63.2% last year. CooperVision's gross margins were 67.1%, up from 62.8% last year, driven by the weakening of the pound due to Brexit last summer, product mix shift gains led by Biofinity, and manufacturing efficiency improvements.","Regarding the pound, remember our inventory turns every six months, so this was the first quarter we experience the full quarter impact of Brexit. On product mix the message remains the same. The shift to silicone hydrogel lenses especially Biofinity and now Avaira Vitality is having a positive impact on our overall gross margins.","Lastly, our manufacturing efficiencies, we've been seeing improvements within our manufacturing environment for some time and this quarter really illustrated that. We have discussed this activity in prior quarters including the negative impact from items such as inefficiencies with idle equipment and inventory write-offs, which have been negatively impacting us roughly $0.10 per quarter above normal. This quarter showed a marked improvement with a negative impact of roughly $0.05, so this is a discussion topic we can now put behind us as we move back to normal operations.","CooperSurgical's gross margins were 61.7%, down from 64.8% last year due to our genetic testing acquisitions, which carry lower gross margins. Having said that, we\u2019ve now annualize those acquisitions and we've been integrating them within our business so we expect stable to improving gross margins on a year-over-year basis moving forward.","Consolidated operating expenses grew 8.8% in the quarter, slightly above our reported revenue growth of 8%. This was driven by investments such as additional sales personnel, along with expenses layered in from acquisition.","There's not much to highlight here, but it\u2019s important to remind everyone we are continuing to invest in infrastructure in both of our businesses to support continued long-term growth. We have made nice progress on the sales and marketing side, along with some key hires in other support areas so we are in fairly good shape, but we will continue to invest as we see opportunities.","Operating income growth was very strong up 18.9% driven by our gross margin improvements. Operating margins were 26.8% up from 24.3% last year.","Moving to items below operating income, we reported $7.7 million of interest expense and our effective tax rate was 6.6%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.50 with roughly 49.5 million average shares outstanding. Regarding shares outstanding, we repurchased 150,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of roughly $190 -- $197 per share, which totaled $29.5 million. We believe share buybacks are an effective way to maximize long-term shareholder value and we will continue executing on them in an opportunistic manner.","Moving to the balance sheet, total debt decreased $38 million in the quarter to approximately $1.39 billion. This pay down was primarily driven by operational cash flow generation offset by share buybacks.","Moving to free cash flow, we had a strong quarter posting $103 million of free cash comprise of roughly $132 million of operating cash flow offset by $29 million of CapEx.","Regarding guidance, we are raising fiscal 2017 consolidated revenue to $2.11 billion to $2.135 billion. This includes raising and tightening CooperVision's revenue guidance to $1.645 billion to $1.665 billion or roughly 7% to 8% constant currency growth, while lowering and tightening CooperSurgical's revenue to $465 million to $470 million, which equates to roughly 4.5% to 5.5% pro forma growth.","For CooperVision we expect growth to be driven by a diverse portfolio of products led by Biofinity, Avaira, Clariti and MyDay. Regarding CooperSurgical a significant portion of the integration activity which negatively impacted revenues is behind us and we expect improved growth in the second half of the year.","Operating margins are now expected to be around 25.5% for the year, supported by slightly stronger gross margins. Interest expenses to be slightly higher at around $31 million, which assumes an additional 25 basis point rate hike this month. And the full year effective tax rate is forecasted to be around 8%. This rate is lower than prior guidance primarily due to the new accounting for employee stock-based compensation which we adopted in Q1.","Although, we forecast the positive impact to be much less in Q3 and Q4 due to the vesting schedules for the majority of our equity grants, the impact in the first half of the year is driving our full year tax rate lower by roughly 150 basis points.","Regarding FX, we've seen an overall favorable move in currencies since we last reported earnings. We are now forecasting a roughly neutral impact to EPS for this year versus last quarter's full year forecast of a negative $0.16.","Regarding revenues, we are forecasting a negative impact of roughly $46 million for the full year, down from last quarter's full year forecasted impact of a negative $61 million. Incorporating all this information, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2017 to $9.50 to $9.65 assuming 49.4 million shares outstanding.","One final comment for modeling purposes, we expect Q3 EPS to be slightly lower than Q4 due to lower sequential gross margin at CooperVision. This Q3 reduction is fairly common for CVI as inventory turns every six months and production levels in December and January decline due to our annual manufacturing shutdowns to upgrade and retool our plants, which results in a slightly higher average cost per unit due to lower overhead absorption. This should be somewhat offset by our Q3 effective tax rate, which is normally lower than in Q4.","Lastly, we continue focusing on delivering consistent annual performance. We are forecasting over $400 million in free cash flow this year and north of $2 billion of cumulative free cash flow over the next five years, while targeting consistent improvement in operating margins to reach 28% or higher in 2021.","And with that, I will hand it back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Nice quarter. I was wondering if I could ask first on market, I guess, it will be a two-part question. One, Bob, just looking at the independent industry data, looks like the market has picked up a couple points here the last couple quarters, just any commentary you can make there on what you're seeing out there?","And then also when we look at the Clariti and MyDay rebates that you guys offer, it looks like they did go up on May 1st by decent amount with a healthy market and as you guys continue to do well, what's the rationale there and then maybe how do we think about the impact that could have on the topline as those rebate dollars maybe impact here over the next couple quarters? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Thank you, Jeff. The point on the market that 5% that\u2019s perhaps a little bit more normalized than we've had over the last couple years, it\u2019s been a little uneven started way back in September 2015 when J&J kind of went off UPP and did a lot of things with their product line that led to some pipeline so as they ruled out the new OASYS one-day modality. So ever since then, it's been a little uneven. But on the trail trailing 12-month basis, 4% -- a solid 4% and clearly the most recent quarter at 5% with solid results in Asia and in Europe.","As far as Clariti, you're right, there's been some pricing changes that have occurred in the industry and not only has there been changes, but there's been the -- for the most part post UPP era, ex-Energys, our one new product, a novel product and what you're seeing in the industry not only in Cooper is we're really working hard to get new fits, everyone is doing it. We believe Clariti is well-positioned by way of rebates to convince more and more people to go to the Energys changing from one product to the other.","We are clearly winning the battle with Clariti on trading up from hydrogels to silicone hydrogels. We are winning the battle of new fits very well. We need to work a little harder on converting others in the mass-market and some of our competitors have created an environment that makes that opportunity more ripe right now and we are seizing the moment. Obviously, Clariti has done very nicely and MyDay has done very nicely, up 43% for the quarter. So we are putting up good numbers, but we want to do better yet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Matthew O'Brien","Yeah. Thanks so much. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the gross margin side, Al, you mentioned three different buckets that impacted the CVI number in the quarter. Can you just breakdown a little bit where some of that improvement came from especially on the durability side, from manufacturing and mix? And then if I understand things right, I think, you are saying that the inventory impact \u2013 I think you had said, $0.30 for the year, is kind of behind you at this point, so that should be more of a tailwind on the bottomline for the full year, is that the right interpretation?","Al White","Yeah. So two pieces on that, the kind of $0.30 we were talking about which was $0.10 going down towards zero was, let\u2019s call it $0.10 going down to $0.05 and maybe it's $0.03 or $0.02 next quarter something like that going down to $0.01 or whatever and then kind of disappearing, so definitely made a nice step in the right direction here in that, that positive move kind of impact even in the Q2 gross margins.","If you look at it, it's to some degree kind of half-and-half there, it's a little bit more than half is driven by the product mix and those efficiency improvements we are talking about and then a little bit less than half is coming from currency. When you look at this sustainability, it is there, I mean, there are some things that are moving around in terms of our production and so forth and currency as it flows through, the pound moves and so forth, but this was a pretty strong legitimate quarter and kind of shows what the business can do when it is sitting on mostly all cylinders.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joanne Wuensch","Two questions, really, one is, at the end of last year you started more aggressively hiring and building at your sales force. Can you give us a little bit idea of where you are in terms of new sales people, but also what geographies they are going into? And this relates to my second question, which is your EME and your Asia-Pacific sales growth was really quite strong? Is there anything in particular that's helping you out there? Thank you.","Bob Weiss","So our hiring is global and it\u2019s split in both divisions, so both Surgical and Vision. The emphasis in Vision is likewise global. So you are seeing expansions in the geographic areas. Importantly, we wanted a lot of attention in the U.S. market where we are immensely under index, and so we made good progress there.","I won't cite exact numbers, but I will say that year-over-year, our sales force expansion feet on the street and in-house combination is up 16% in Vision, 15% overall. So balance between the two units and good solid growth, I think, you are seeing some of the results of that in pretty strong U.S. and Americas performance, basically were the driver of the market growth in the Americas right now. We are up 8% over the last 12 months. While the market is up 2% translated we are it. So I think the feet on the street, the product portfolio we have is working very nicely. Since we are doing it in Asia-Pac and in Europe, you are likewise seeing solid numbers there also.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Larry Biegelsen","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. One on revenue, one on margins, so, Al, I think the implied second half topline growth is 6% to 7%, correct me if I'm wrong. But the question is, why would revenue growth slow in the second half, I think, it was about 8% in the first half?","And then on the margins, Al, two parts here, how much more room is left here on, currency, idle equipment mix? And the second part of the margin question is, I think, you did 27% this quarter. Your goal I think is 28% in fiscal 2021, I believe. So you are almost there. Do you -- are you -- when you are going to be in a position to update the new -- the long-term margin goals? Sorry for the long question.","Al White","Yeah. So a couple of comments, the 28% goal, we update those annually, so we\u2019ll update that when we finish the fiscal year. The only thing I would say to that is we did updated to some degree if you were -- will by being clear that it was 28% or higher. We are clearly on a trajectory to be north of 28% and feel comfortable with that but we do that once year. So we will do that again here in the couple quarters.","On the margin upside question, we are going to have gross margins a little bit north of 64.5% this year, so on a consolidated basis pretty strong. We got -- we certainly have margin upside in CooperSurgical now that we reset to lift that higher. On a full year basis we are going to have margin upside in CooperVision also all else being equal, that will be driven by kind of the same thing, excluding currency, which will have some upside in currency as we move through this year.","But assuming currency holds steady. The manufacturing efficiencies that we have in place, cost reduction programs, product mix shift, which is a positive with items like we talked about of Avaira to Avaira Vitality, the conversion from traditional daily hydrogel to Clariti, all those are kind of positive. So I won\u2019t put any specific numbers out there. But we do have margin upside here in the coming years from both businesses.","When you look at revenue speaking, I think, you are speaking mainly of CooperVision, yeah, and we are kind of running in that 8% constant currency in the first half of the year, guiding to 7% to 8%, obviously, took the bottom of that way and pull the bottom end up up to 7% to 8%. We do have a challenging comp in Q4.","You will remember from last year or so. I think we feel good about revenues. We are obviously put up a very strong Q1. We put up a strong Q2 against the tough comp. We feel good about the back half of the year, but it\u2019s prudent to remain in that 7% to 8% range and not get more aggressive.","Bob Weiss","Larry, the only I would add to Al\u2019s comments is when you think of the 28%, you're comparing it to the second quarter. Keep in mind that, historically we will have a lighter operating margin in the first quarter and that -- as a result of that year-to-date our operating margin is more like 24.8%, 25%. But having said that, Al is correct that there is a lot of tailwinds and we will refresh along the way.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks. Maybe a couple of product questions and then just a general share within contact lenses, in terms of Biofinity Energys and the Toric XR, I am just wondering is there any supply constraints that are still out there or are you completely meeting market demand at this point? And then for Avaira Vitality, I am just wondering, with the conversion tailwind for that product looks like? And then, Bob, just an update on shares with Cooper, J&J, Bausch & Lomb and Alcon that would be helpful? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Yeah. The supply constraint, as far as Biofinity, which is growing solidly, the combination of Biofinity and Avaira is up 12% with Biofinity being at the higher end and Avaira as it goes through the conversion lower end of those numbers of that number.","Energys is still early in the rollout around the world, so it just -- it made its entr\u00e9e into the U.S. initially and it's gone into Europe now, but has a ways to go in that conversion and rollout, it\u2019s not so much may be production capability as it is the mechanics of rolling out a product around the world.","As far as Biofinity Toric XR that is kind of a meet order. We do not stock that product. So while we have reasonable capacity to support the orders that come in, it\u2019s -- both of those products are performing extremely well in the U.S. and we believe that's a good indicator of how that will translate around the world as we go deeper.","As far as the conversion of Avaira to Vitality, its gone well I would say in the U.S. More than half the revenue now is coming in from Vitality, so it made some good progress and but still have the other half to go and that\u2019s the sphere, the sphere part is the easy part, torics are lot more complicated. So look for both of those to rollout as I indicated throughout this year and into next year and will be pretty much done as we get through next year with the conversion.","As far as market share numbers, the J&J number included what they reported some of lens care that they picked up in the acquisition that they made of -- from Abbott. So factoring in their number was a little less than the aggregate that they reported. But the share gainers with the market growing 5% and Cooper growing 2x the market pretty much assume that Alcon is not gaining share and there is not a data those buy that. They don't talk about it at Novartis in terms of their frustration with Alcon overall. And so it's still a company that just recently is, I think, this morning the CEO indicated they are evaluating what they are going to do with Alcon in the middle of that.","J&J is holding its own clearly with its numbers and then B&L continues to loss. So pretty much we are closing the gap on number two which is Alcon to have a little ways to go but we would hope over the next couple years we will catch up with them and pass them.","Anthony Petrone","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Larry Keusch","Thanks. Good afternoon. Bob, I wanted to just touch on the multifocal and perhaps my numbers right, I think, you guys were up 6% constant currency in the first half. Can you give us some sense of sort of what you think that category is growing and sort of your results relative to market?","Bob Weiss","Yes. Sure. The category is growing nicely. There are a lot of new products coming in from all us as well as all our competitors and so that category has been growing basically double-digit, probably, about 12% to 14% worldwide over the last several years, turn down a little maybe the last quarter, but still close to double-digit. We put up lesser numbers, as you indicated, 6%, I think, the important thing to remember with us is, we had some pretty tough comps, if you are looking at the numbers we had a year ago. It was like 13%. So a solid prior year comp that we were hurdling if you will in this last quarter.","Overall, the market is now 8% of the world market, so it continues to grow faster than the spherical market and almost -- and basically offers a small base it\u2019s growing faster than the toric market, but still the toric market is three quarters of the specialty market. So toric market is about 22% of the share of the contact lens market, multifocal is about 8%, all up 30% in specialty lenses where we\u2019re number one and we think we have the right product portfolio.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Block of Stifel. Your line is open.","Jon Block","Great. Thanks. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. I have got two, I will ask both upfront, maybe just first, follow up on the reps and maybe you can talk about the investment this year. Is that take you to where you want to be, Bob. In other word, can you give us a little bit more color on the return you are seeing or does the high in spend continue into fiscal \u201918? And then, Al, just sort of two part on the gross margin, CVI was of our expectations, am I correct in thinking the stepped up level is sustainable in two region and sort of on the other side for CSI, I thought previously the trough was thought to be fiscal 2Q, but is it correct now start thinking that trough is fiscal 3Q? Thanks, guys.","Bob Weiss","So, on the return the rep, other than to say that, we are still early in the game given how many people we have hired, but so far so good. We are so index -- under index against our two largest competitors that we will keep -- we will continue to hire what makes sense in the right area. So it\u2019s geographic specific and we are monitoring it and we are at the point now where a lot of these reps start becoming quite productive.","But feet on the street in coverage where we were not covering a lot of accounts, obviously the feet on the street gives us the horsepower to get into more and more locations where our competitors show up and we don't and there is quite a few of those. So we're not done yet. I would say we will continue to grow our sales and marketing faster than our revenue at least for the balance of this year and we will see about next year.","Al White","Yeah. On the margins that coming on both, I mean, our CooperVision gross margins, they are sustainable subject to our normal variability if you will by quarter. So as I mentioned in Q3, we have the plant shutdowns what\u2019s drives up our cost per unit back in the kind of December, January. You see that in the third quarter. So it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see CooperVision\u2019s gross margin as an example come back toward 65% in Q3.","Q4 again should be a pretty good quarter, the pounds move back a little bit back up towards $1.30 that starts to flow through our P&L. We also -- we are probably 66% or something like that in Q4, wouldn't surprise me.","But the core basis there of sustainability through the mix shift and manufacturing efficiencies is indeed there. There was nothing to highlight out of this quarter saying, hey, this was unique at one time that that was not the case is very strong gross margin quarter.","If we look at CooperSurgical the trough is here and was here, I should say, in Q2. So we accelerated some integration activity there. We pull forward some distributor consolidation and so forth into this quarter. We got more aggressive on that based on some of the stuff we are seeing out there, some positive momentum that we are seeing.","So I think what you will get now is, yeah, we took a hit in Q2 for CooperSurgical. That's okay. It was done for integration related reasons and for long-term strategy. You'll see the gross margin come back in Q3. You'll see the sales -- the pro forma revenue growth come back in Q3 and that will continue going forward now. So that was more one-time in nature if you will have accelerated integration activity.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Mishan of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Matthew Mishan","Hey. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. I got two for you. The first is on the difference between sort of the -- your fiscal year, which would be February through April where you did 4% growth in the Americas for CVI? And then the COI data which said you had did 8% for the calendar year, which would be January through March and I'm just curious did things dramatically tail off, did you start off the year like very strong in January and then see it tail off through April? And then, I guess, what are the trends so far like past that in May?","Al White","Yeah. The -- it is not unusual. We get into this kind of a discussion a lot to have 300 basis points or 400 basis points swing when you add a month and delete a month for whatever reason, having to do with either the prior year or the current year. So I think that\u2019s the one reason we always shy a little from making much of an assessment on it and look at trailing 12 months when it comes to particularly the CLI data as a good indicator or a good secondary indicator.","So, I don't think I read anything into the comparison which I understand what you do in the fiscal and the calendar quarters. As far as, how May did. May is built into our guidance and beyond that we won't get into the specifics of May other than it left us if you will bullish about where we are headed for the year as indicated by the step up in guidance.","Matthew Mishan","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Hanover of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Hanover","Thanks for taking my question. Al, I just want to start off with you real quick, just piecing the onion back a little bit on the lower tax rate. It looks like it was a $0.10 difference versus where the street was expecting the 10% and the guidance you gave, so is that all just stock-based comp? And then, my second question is in terms of any color you can provide on consumer purchasing power trends and how this might compare to foot traffic through the ECP offices or retail chain? Thank you.","Al White","Yeah. I will take that tax one first and let Bob answer the second one. Yeah, for the second quarter about 200 basis points was the stock op, so excluding that we would have been about 8.5% versus 6.5%. And if we look at the full year Q3 usually a little bit lighter kind of always is a little bit lighter for couple different reasons and then Q4 moves back up, I would expect that to be somewhere again this year. But as you know from other companies that stock-based comp has been a nice positive for us.","Bob Weiss","And can you repeat your other question?","Andrew Hanover","Kim Duncan","Operator can we get Andrew Hanover back?","Operator","Mr. Hanover, if you could queue back up please. Your line is open sir.","Andrew Hanover","Can you all hear me?","Bob Weiss","Yes.","Andrew Hanover","Okay. Bob I just wanted to understand a little bit of just consumer purchasing power trends versus foot traffic and what you all are seeing?","Bob Weiss","Okay. Yeah. The consumer purchasing trend is yet remained solid. Of course the biggest driver in the marketplace continues to be the trading up, in other words taking the existing consumer base and moving it from the two-week modality into the primarily the one-day modality, but to lesser extent into the monthly modality. But consumer purchasing is -- has been reasonably -- its fine if you will.","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research. Your question please.","Steve Willoughby","Hi. Good evening, guys. Two things for you, first, Al, just wondering you guys bought back some stock this quarter, just want to make sure or clarify what assumed in your guidance as relates to future share repurchases and what is your appetite given the strong free cash flow here for future share repurchases still this year? And then, secondly, Bob, maybe just wondering, if you could comment on your thoughts regarding the importance of distributors in the industry as it relates to independent ODs and what given independent ODs are such a strong market for you guys?","Al White","Yeah. Stock buybacks there is nothing included right now in terms of our guidance. I guess I won't comment on what we will do and when we will do or how much we will do. But as you know we are believers in stock buybacks to return value to long-term shareholders, so we will continue to evaluate, certainly it\u2019s an opportunity and especially as you just highlighted we have some strong free cash flow coming in front of us.","Bob Weiss","So, from the point of view of distributors and their role in the equation, the independent distributors, there obviously has been debate by some over the years on their role and how much one would pay for that role that debate continues, some competitors taking more aggressive stance than others.","Clearly there is a service they render, they render service by virtue the fact that most eye care, independent eye care professionals are ordering from all manufacturers and in so doing rather than having all these packages arrive every day from all these manufacturers there is a lot of opportunity to consolidate and there's an efficiency factor that the independent spring bring to the equation. And that debate is existed forever and I'm sure will continue to be debated forevermore by all the various interested parties.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman of Oppenheimer. Your question please.","Steven Lichtman","Thank you. Hi guys. Bob two questions, first, just want to follow-up on your comment earlier on pricing changes in the industry post UPP, what are the types of changes that you're seeing? And then secondly in Surgical after being active last year less so this year, which certainly make sense, given integration needs, should we look you guys to be acquisitive again in Surgical ahead with most of the integration activity behind you guys? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Hey. First of all, first on the UPP or post-UPP era for the most part, there were some price changes made by some of our -- by the industry, not only some of our competitors, but price changes made in the post-UPP era. There also was more activity if you will in rebates, so when you look at the price increases, obviously, yes, they were and they were fairly robust by the standards of norm what normally has been the case in the last 15year, 20 years in the industry. They -- anytime there was price changes that obviously create some opportunity by various players, including yours truly.","So we have been reactionary in some areas to what's going on in the industry. We happen to be have the only product that remains under UPP which is Energys, which is a novel product and we think so the purpose of UPP is well served by our product like that, a new products where there's a lot of cheer time and you are trying to incentivize a doctor to make a switch on the customer that maybe -- customer with current product they have.","But overall the pricing in the industry is favorable and rebates are favorable and rebates are very much geared to the world to try like it. I want to incentivize you for new fit. I want to incentivize you to move someone from product A to product B and then from there you follow onto what hopefully is an annuity stream with less aggressive rebates for the new fit.","Relative to surgical, it made seven or eight acquisitions over the last year and a half or close to two years now. Will we make any more? We obviously generate a lot of cash. We obviously are interested in continued geographic reach and tuck-in and we will do -- where deals make sense we will continue to do them.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Weiss for any closing remarks. Sir?","Bob Weiss","Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We are aware it\u2019s near the school -- the end of the school year, so people have some priorities frequently this time a year dealing with graduating students, getting kids out of class, so we appreciate that everyone took time. Hopefully you are pleased with the results as we are and are outlook and we look forward to updating you again in the end of August, I guess, August 31st is our next quarterly call and we look forward to it.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kim Duncan. Please proceed.","Kim Duncan - Vice President, Investor Relations","Good afternoon, and welcome to The Cooper Companies' first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. I'm Kim Duncan, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Bob Weiss, Chief Executive Officer; Greg Matz, Chief Financial Officer; and Al White, Chief Strategy Officer.","Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including all revenue and earnings per share guidance and other statements regarding anticipated results of operations, market or regulatory conditions, and integration of any acquisitions or their failure to achieve anticipated benefits.

Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the first quarter conference call. We're off to a good start this year and there's plenty to talk about.","Let me start by highlighting three key points for the call. First, Sauflon integration is going extremely well. We've made significant progress and we're either on or ahead of schedule across the board. You can see this reflected in our operating expenses, where synergies are evident. I'll provide more detail during the call as there are still a number of integration items in process, but I remain confident, we'll complete the vast majority of integration work by the end of the fiscal year.","Second, CooperVision posted 7% pro forma revenue growth for contact lenses in our first fiscal quarter. Compared to the total contact lens market for the first calendar quarter, CooperVision grew twice as fast as the market and gained share in every region of the world.","Third, we're putting up solid results as our business fundamentals are strong. You can see that clearly in our market share gains along with our margins which led to a very strong earnings per share. Even with currency forecasted to negatively impact our second quarter through fourth quarter revenue by an additional $40 million or $0.43 per share, we're increasing the lower end of our earnings per share guidance to reflect that strength. Overall, the quarter's performance continues to support our long range plan, which includes achieving operating margins over 26% in 2018.","Although currency remains a significant headwind, I believe we have a fairly straightforward path to achieving our margin goal by staying focused and executing on our existing business as we did this quarter.","Now, let me get into some of the details for the quarter. On a consolidated basis, the first quarter revenues grew 10% year-over-year to $445 million. We posted non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.75 and recorded free cash flow of $28 million. CooperVision posted revenues of $369 million, up 13% year-over-year, and this included a fairly decent negative currency impact led by the euro.","Since our last earnings call, our Q1 revenues were negatively impacted by currency by roughly $4 million. Regardless, our strong product portfolio performed well and we posted solid results. On a pro forma basis, our contact lens business grew 7% and CooperVision overall grew 6% when including solutions. As a reminder, when I refer to pro forma, I mean adjusting for currency and including Sauflon in both quarters.","Overall, our silicone hydrogel family drove top line growth with $195 million in revenues. Our silicone hydrogel family is very deep with our monthly Biofinity family leading the way posting 14% constant currency growth in Q1. Our two-week Avaira family of silicone hydrogel products grew 9% in constant currency.","It's important to note we're still under indexed against the market in the two-week and monthly silicone space. Silicones represent roughly 73% of that market and we're at 64%, so we should continue growing our two-week and monthly silicones nicely for many years. Regarding Sauflon's 1 day lenses, clariti had a very strong quarter up 24% pro forma and MyDay was up 62% in constant currency. As a reminder, with the acquisition of Sauflon, we're now the only company offering a two-tiered approach to the daily silicone hydrogel market with clariti positioned as our mass market offering and MyDay as our premium offering.","We continue to believe there is a great opportunity to split the daily silicone market with a premium and mass market lens. We also believe we have the premier portfolio to become the market leader in the coming years. In addition to being the only company offering a two-tier strategy, our mass market portfolio includes a sphere, toric and multifocal, which no one else has.","Regarding clariti in the U.S., we're off to a great start distributing fitting sets with a significant number going out in January and February, and many more to come as we progress through the year. To add a little color to the U.S. clariti story, it's important to note clariti is the largest and fastest product rollout in CooperVision's history. The only challenge we're experiencing is that demand is stronger than we anticipated. We're working hard to address this by maintaining a strong focus on minimizing backorders.","While also working to meet the significant number of requests for fitting sets, an important point to mention is that manufacturing is going extremely well, and we'll work through this very quickly. I will admit, it's nice to say our biggest challenge is too much demand.","Regarding MyDay, we continue to make progress in Europe and we'll be releasing lenses to key opinion leaders in the U.S. this month. We also maintain a target for the U.S. launch later this year. Going forward, we expect to continue rolling out MyDay as a premier \u2013 premium lens and we're optimistic we'll see faster margin expansion than we were expecting prior to the Sauflon acquisition.","We're also keenly focused on receiving regulatory approval in Japan which is in process. Regarding timing on that, we still anticipate a Japan launch in fiscal 2016, with clariti to follow thereafter. Combining clariti and MyDay, we still expect around $175 million of sales for the fiscal year with clariti being about 75% of that. Note, this is slightly better than previously indicated as a weaker euro is hurting reported sales.","Our specialty business remained strong with toric growing 9% pro forma and multifocals growing 23% pro forma. We continue to lead the global market in these specialized categories and we're taking market share.","Regarding Proclear, sales were up 3%. This was a pretty solid quarter for Proclear, as it shows there is still growth in the non-silicone space. On a regional basis, we were especially strong in the Americas, up 11% pro forma. This was led by a strong quarter for Biofinity. Going forward, we anticipate the U.S. growth will remain strong as we rollout clariti or as it continues to progress.","Europe posted another solid quarter, up 4% pro forma. My hat's off to the team for posting solid results, while completing significant integration activity. At times, we get so excited about clariti, we don't offer sufficient congratulations to the folks working extremely long hours on integrating the business, while selling product. So, again, congrats to our European team.","On a fiscal quarter basis, Asia-Pac was softer than usual, up 1% pro forma. Having said that, the comp for Q1 of last year was 17% growth in Asia-Pac, so it did well holding its own, if you will.","To provide more details on Sauflon integration activity, as I've mentioned, we're making a lot of progress. You'll notice a non-GAAP adjustment this quarter associated with the integration, which includes equipment write-offs tied to adjusting our manufacturing platforms. We also incurred a number of one-time charges within operating expenses associated with integrating the sales force and other commercial areas.","At this point, I believe you'll see similar charges in Q2 as we finalize decisions around our one-day manufacturing, while we also \u2013 while also completing additional integration activities within operating expenses. I believe you'll also see additional one-time charges in Q3 and Q4, but I'm confident the vast majority of this work will be completed by the end of the fiscal year.","Finally, on Sauflon, it's important to note, this acquisition was a major step forward on a number of fronts, and this includes R&D. On this slide, I'm happy to say, the head of Sauflon's manufacturing has assumed the position of the Head of R&D for CooperVision. This is a great move, and I'm confident it will yield positive results in the coming years as we incorporate Sauflon's know-how \u2013 knowledge around material formulation into our existing and future product lines. And remember, Sauflon's manufacturing lines cost roughly one-third the price of ours. They receive lines in half the time it takes us, and their lines have better flexibility around shifting production from one product to another.","A large reason for this is the material formulation which provides the ability to produce silicone lenses without alcohol. This is a major step forward, and as we integrate this new manufacturing platform and formulation expertise, it will allow us to add manufacturing lines in a much more cost-effective manner. This will reduce future CapEx, thus improving free cash flow, allowing \u2013 along with yielding a lower cost per unit which we anticipate seeing in the P&L beginning in mid-fiscal year 2016.","To conclude on integration activity, nothing has changed with respect to my belief around the future. Our team continues to do a great job integrating the business, and that includes ramping up production. Everything remains on or ahead of plan.","Now, let me comment on the overall contact lens market. As a reminder, this data is listed on the last page of our earnings release. For 2014, we are not including Sauflon in our results, but we will do so in 2015. Had we included Sauflon in 2014, our performance against the market would look even stronger, but even so we're solidly taking market share.","Overall, the market rebounded slightly from Q3, up 4%. CooperVision grew twice that, up 8%. And again, this is without Sauflon. Regionally, market grew 5% in the Americas, with CooperVision posting growth of 7%, and EMEA, the market grew 5% and we grew 7%, while in Asia-Pac, the market grew 1% and we were up a strong 11%.","I couldn't be happier to say we grew twice the overall market and faster in every region of the world. Also, if we look at the markets on a modality basis, that's \u2013 the single-use market continue to drive growth of 5%, while we grew 10%. Non-single use lenses grew 2% and we grew 7%.","In general, when I look at the market, it's running a little softer than the 5% to 6% I'd expect, but there are a few interesting dynamics right now, including UPP, or Unilateral Pricing Policy, which are having an impact on the U.S. market. At the end of the day though, I'll be surprised if we don't return to a market growing in around 6% for this calendar year.","We're seeing pricing from the manufacturing perspective being fairly stable, if not up slightly, and we're seeing growth in the single-use market which will continue to drive overall market growth. The additional capacity coming online for daily silicone hydrogels will also drive stronger market growth. Overall, the takeaway is that we have a fairly healthy market and I believe you'll continue seeing us taking share especially with the addition of clariti portfolio.","Moving to CooperSurgical, revenues were flat in constant currency, but gross margins improved a point to 64% as we continue executing on our strategy to rationalize certain low-margin capital equipment sales. With respect to our fertility business, we grew 1% in constant currency which was the result of a solid disposable sales offset by a reduction in capital equipment sales. Going forward, I expect we'll continue to see lower revenue growth in fertility until we annualize the removal of certain low-margin capital equipment sales, which should begin in fiscal Q3.","Meanwhile, our office and surgical procedures business was flat as it continues to deal with the pains of a challenging OB\/Gyn environment in the United States. On the plus side, our strategy to focus on improving gross margins while staying focused on operating expenses resulted in stand-alone non-GAAP operating margins increasing a point to 23%.","Now, let me touch on guidance. Our fiscal 2015 guidance remains the same for revenues on a pro forma basis. We're still expecting CooperVision to grow in the 8% to 11% range for the year and more strength in Q3, Q4 as clariti becomes more readily available in the United States. For CooperSurgical, the story remains the same as we continue to forecast 3% to 7% constant currency revenue growth for the year, with more strength in Q3 and Q4. In total, the results \u2013 this results in a 7% to 10% pro forma growth for the year.","For earnings per share, we're increasing the bottom end of the range to reflect fundamental strength in the business. And remember, this is in the face of additional currency headwinds which are negatively impacting us by roughly an additional $0.43 in Q2 through Q4 from where we last provided guidance in December. I'll let Greg get into the specific details behind the P&L and currency in a few minutes.","Lastly on the financials, improving free cash flow while investing in the business remains extremely important to us. We're remaining \u2013 we're maintaining our guidance of having both free cash flow and CapEx over $200 million this fiscal year. Having said that, I continue to believe we'll see lower CapEx in fiscal 2016 while operating cash flow continues to grow. So I anticipate very strong free cash flow in 2016 and subsequent years.","Regarding strategy, we're continuing with our successful strategy which I frequently articulated in the past. This includes investing in our business to take market share by expanding geographically, aggressively rolling out products such as clariti and investing in emerging markets such as China.","We do this while remaining keenly focused on delivering solid earnings per share growth. And finally, we'll buy back shares if it makes sense as we did in Q1 repurchasing 100,000 shares at an average price of approximately $160. We believe we can accomplish all our objectives by reducing debt and increasing profits, which supports our investment grade debt rating.","In summary, before I turn it over to Greg, let me say how happy I am with our business. We're making significant progress integrating Sauflon and this year is looking good. We're also positioning ourselves for strong fiscal 2016. Our profit margins are solid and our free cash flow generation is strong and I remain bullish on the future.","With that, let me express my appreciation to our employees, our number one asset. Their hard work and dedication to creating value is the backbone of this \u2013 of our success.","And now, I'll turn it over to Greg to cover our financial results.","Gregory W. Matz - Vice President, Chief Financial & Risk Officer","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Bob shared with you a pretty thorough review of the market and our revenue picture, so let me start with gross margins. Looking at gross margins, in Q1, the consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 62.1% and 64.2%, respectively, compared with 64.9% for GAAP and non-GAAP for the prior year. The primary difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is related to equipment rationalization due to the Sauflon acquisition.","When comparing non-GAAP gross margins for this quarter to Q1 2014, we experienced a significant negative impact to revenues from FX, combined with higher pound-based inventory turnings through the P&L. In addition to the FX headwind, the inclusion of Sauflon in this year's first quarter reduced gross margins as that business operates at a lower margin due to their high percentage of daily sales. These headwinds were partially offset by product mix led by Biofinity, as well as some other favorable manufacturing period expenses.","With respect to gross margins for this quarter, they did come in higher than we had anticipated. There were several reasons for this, including better product mix from higher Biofinity sales in the U.S. and lower daily sales in Japan, along with lower manufacturing period expenses.","As a reminder, Biofinity margins run solidly north of 70%, while our daily sales in Japan are around 50%. For the remainder of the year, we expect gross margins around 63%, such that the year will be just north of 63%.","CooperVision, on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, reported gross margin of 61.7% and 64.2%, respectively, versus 65.4% for GAAP and non-GAAP in Q1 last year. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is largely related to equipment rationalization from the Sauflon acquisition. The drop in non-GAAP gross margin, as I mentioned earlier was due to FX and Sauflon, partially offset by product mix led by Biofinity as well as a lower favorable manufacturing period expenses. CooperSurgical had a GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin of 63.8% and 64%, respectively, which compares to Q1 2014 of 63.1%.","As Bob mentioned, gross margins improved as we've reduced low margin capital equipment sales within our fertility business. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP relates to approximately $200,000 worth of severance costs. Now looking at operating expenses, on a GAAP basis, SG&A expenses increased by approximately 10% from the prior year to approximately $173.5 million, and were 39% of revenue same as the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A increased approximately 6% to $167.2 million.","The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP was $6.3 million due largely to integration and restructuring cost related to the Sauflon acquisition. SG&A on a non-GAAP basis decreased 1% sequentially led by synergies from Sauflon.","Now looking at R&D; in Q1, R&D on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis was approximately $16 million, R&D was 3.6% of revenue, down from 3.9% in Q1 2014.","Depreciation and amortization; Q1 depreciation was $29.3 million, up $5.4 million and amortization was $13.6 million, up approximately $6.1 million.","Moving to operating margins, for Q1 consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $73.1 million and 16.4% of revenue versus $81.6 million and 20.2% of revenue in Q1 last year. This drop is primarily due to the Sauflon acquisition and the related integration costs.","Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $102.6 million and 23% of revenue versus $89.1 million and 22% of revenue for the prior year. This represents a 15% increase in operating income over the prior year.","In Q1, CooperVision had a GAAP operating income and margin of $73.2 million and 19.8% of revenue versus the prior year Q1 of $84.1 million and 25.8%. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income and margin were $98.4 million and 26.6% of revenue versus $88.4 million and 27.1% of revenue in the prior year, up 11% year-over-year.","CSI had GAAP operating income and margin of $13.2 million and 17.4% of revenue versus the prior year $14.2 million and 18% of revenue. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $17.5 million and 23.1% of revenue versus Q1 2014 of $17.4 million operating income and 22.1% of revenue.","Now looking at interest expense; interest expense was $3.9 million for the quarter, up $2.3 million year-over-year, primarily due to the acquisition of Sauflon. Interest expense is expected to be higher in the coming quarters as higher interest rates on our bank pricing grid became effective in Q1. We're still forecasting interest expense for the year around $18 million.","Looking at the effective tax rate, in Q1, the GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate was 8.5% and 10.8% respectively versus Q1 2014 GAAP effective tax rate of 9.1% and non-GAAP effective tax rate of 10.2%. As we've mentioned before, the effective tax rate continues to be below the U.S. statutory rate as the majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates.","With respect to Sauflon, we continue to make progress in incorporating them into our global trade arrangement.","Looking at earnings per share, our Q1 earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was $1.25 and $1.75, respectively, versus $1.47 and $1.58 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS grew approximately 11% year-over-year.","During Q1, we repurchased 100,000 shares at an average share value just below $160 per share for a total cost of just under $16 million. This leaves approximately $170 million available for future share repurchases under the current approved plan.","Regarding foreign exchange, we're using rates as of March 5. For our main currencies, we're using $1.11 for the euro, \u00a5120 for the yen and $1.53 for the pound. The net impact year-over-year for Q1 was an unfavorable impact of $0.41. In our Q4 earnings call, we discussed this year-over-year EPS deterioration, which is primarily related to the yen, euro and euro tracking currencies. But in addition, a majority of the other currencies have also weakened against the dollar. Based on the differences in rates from our Q4 earnings call and March 5, we expect to see an additional negative $0.43 impact to EPS in Q2 through Q4 2015 split roughly evenly over the three remaining quarters.","Looking at the balance sheet and liquidity, in Q1, we had cash provided by operations of $79.8 million, capital expenditures of $65 million, and excluding acquisition-related cost of $13.3 million, resulting in $28.1 million of free cash flow.","Total debt increased within the quarter by $13 million to $1.395 billion. Inventories increased approximately $8.6 million to $390.1 million from last quarter, largely due to an increase in daily lenses.","For the quarter, we're seeing months on hand at 6.9 months, 7.3 months on hand excluding inventory and equipment rationalization charges, which is up from a month on hand of 7.2 months last year and up from 6.6 months on hand last quarter. Days sales outstanding is at 57 days, which is up from 53 days from the prior quarter last year.","Now turning to guidance; Bob had mentioned guidance. In order to provide just a little more color for your models, I will share some additional specifics on our non-GAAP guidance. But before getting into the details, remember the significant impact of currency I discussed earlier, not only has currency impacted revenues and earnings per share, but it obviously also affected the rest of the P&L including margin percentages.","The revenue range for the company is $1.858 billion to $1.91 billion or 7% to 10% pro forma growth. CooperVision's revenue range is $1.535 billion to $1.574 billion or 8% to 11% pro forma growth. CSI's revenue range is $323 million to $336 million or 3% to 7% constant currency growth. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be just north of 63% for the year.","OpEx is expected to be around 40%. Operating margin is expected to be around 23%. Interest expense, as I mentioned earlier, is expected to be around $18 million. Our effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 9% to 11%, and this includes transitioning Sauflon into our global trade arrangement.","Our share count is expected to be roughly 49.5 million shares for the year, which is lower than our initial guidance, primarily due to updating our models after our Q1 equity grants and share repurchases. Our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $7.40 to $7.70 or 22% to 26% growth on a pro forma basis.","Finally, we expect capital expenditures and free cash flow for the year to be north of $200 million.","With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session.","Kim Duncan - Vice President, Investor Relations","Operator, we're ready to open up the call for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Mr. Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good evening, guys. Can you hear me okay?","Gregory W. Matz - Vice President, Chief Financial & Risk Officer","Yes, Jeff. We can.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Hey, Bob, just wondering on the Sauflon capacity side. I guess a couple different questions there, I'll roll into one, but I think at your Analyst Day back a few months ago, you \u2013 or more than a few months ago, but you talked about a $420 million capacity split, primarily Budapest, but also some in the UK.","Can you remind me how many lines that $420 million was spread over and then how do we think about maybe the incremental lines that'll be coming on over the next 6 months to 12 months? And sorry \u2013 other part to that, if you're going to be converting any of the other Sauflon lines, maybe two clariti lines away from other kind of Sauflon manufacturing? Thank you.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. What we have done to keep it focused and simple is, we're basically just running one-day through Hungary. So, it's north of a $400 million run rate with lines that I want to say are 9 or 10 lines. One of the important things about the lines is their \u2013 the timeline to get new ones added and we continue on that path, and of course, as I indicated, there are lower cost and in fact even much lower cost now with the euro and everything going down.","So, that's the one silver lining of foreign exchange if you're spending a fair amount of money on CapEx. It's even lower cost at this juncture. But right now, our driving factor is much more the distribution channels from that point forward. In other words, we can ramp up pretty robustly in Budapest and then our continued expansion. All the other products from Sauflon pretty much shifted into the UK operation, the monthlies. So, the focus there is on \u2013 in Hungary, on low-cost production, and that's going well. That is not our primary concern right now.","Our primary concern is the middle piece, which is getting the fitting sets put together, catching up with the demand. And as I indicated, there's some start\/stop that we've got fitting sets out there. They were so well received that we suddenly had to play catch-up, replenishing them, and slowing the demand that they created, and that's created a miniature bottleneck that \u2013 when we're talking about a bottleneck, we're talking about weeks as opposed to months or anything like that.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So, if I understand correctly, it's not that you're having manufacturing capacity constraints even with the strong demand. It's more just getting those lenses out to the end user.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's correct.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale of JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Chris T. Pasquale - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. I want to start with the surprising bottom line strength this quarter. So, Greg, on the 4Q call, you said that you thought both 1Q and 2Q would be down year-over-year, and I think you even called out 1Q as being the bigger challenge from an earnings perspective. So, what changed in the last half of the quarter relative to where you thought you would be?","Gregory W. Matz - Vice President, Chief Financial & Risk Officer","I think if you look at where we'd be, just probably one-third of it was in gross margins, and two-thirds of it was in OpEx. So, on the gross margin front, I think as I mentioned earlier in my comments, there were probably several areas that contributed to the favorable margins. There was nothing that was really out of the ordinary driving margins, but as I mentioned, the high U.S. sales with no FX impact, especially with the higher mix of Biofinity, versus sales in Japan, which would have had a higher mix of dailies and lower margins, as well as the revenue hit you get from the \u2013 where the yen is at.","In addition, there were lower manufacturing period expenses. We don't think this is necessarily a trend, and so that's why we kind of guided on the gross margin front to around 63% for the next three quarters and a little north of 63% for the year. I think on the OpEx front, the teams did a good job and good expense management. At the same time, I think, we appreciate some of the synergies that we've gotten from the Sauflon acquisition. Some of those are coming to fruition. And so, overall, it was just a very good quarter.","Chris T. Pasquale - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then I just want to understand the moving pieces here with guidance. So, $0.21 beat this quarter relative to consensus, but now you're saying FX $0.43 greater headwinds for the year, so that's a $0.22 negative net. And you're raising the guidance by $0.05 at the midpoint. So, is the right way to think about this that you see $0.27 of additional operating leverage over the final three quarters of the year, or is your math different?","Gregory W. Matz - Vice President, Chief Financial & Risk Officer","I think, that's...","Kim Duncan - Vice President, Investor Relations","That makes sense. Operator? Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks, guys, for taking the questions. Hopefully, you can hear me okay. I wanted to ask about the top line growth. So the pro forma sales growth for CooperVision is still 8% to 11%. You did about 6% this quarter. Can you talk about just kind of the cadence of sales and also EPS growth through 2015, back to (35:48) sales growth, do you expect the pro forma sales growth to improve in the second quarter from Q1? And I actually just have one very brief follow-up.","Gregory W. Matz - Vice President, Chief Financial & Risk Officer","Yeah. I think from a phasing point of view, the second quarter is similar to the first quarter in terms of year-over-year challenge. You may remember a year ago, we had the \u2013 let's call it the Asia event or the Japanese event with VAT tax and a whole bunch of revenue coming into the second quarter not only for us, but on a calendar year basis for the industry.","So that's a tough comp that we expect all other things forgetting about foreign exchange as a factor. And then obviously the foreign exchange comp will go down towards the back-end. We hope anyway that presumes stabilization, if you will.","Our comps are easier in the back half for a variety of reasons. One is just the prior year comparison. In other words, some of the VAT tax in Japan came out of the third quarter. So there's somewhat of an easier comp there. In the fourth quarter, we had a number of events we talked about at year-end regarding distribution channels and as well as the recasting of the U.S. Sauflon launch as we migrated distribution from Hicksville into our West Henrietta facility. So, those comps are easier in the back half. And in addition, we have the \u2013 of course, the ramp-up and roll-out of the new products. So, we would expect a much more robust back-end growth in the first half.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Excellent. Bob, just to make sure I heard you correctly. The second quarter pro forma growth will look similar to first quarter about 6%, is that what you said? And then just lastly, clariti fitting sets, when do you expect to be distributing new fitting sets in the U.S., then I'll drop? Thanks.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. The 6% is not a bad \u2013 plus or minus, is not a bad gauge in the second quarter. Fitting sets is one I mentioned \u2013 it's more like weeks as opposed of months. So the fitting set timeline, if you will, is we stopped shipping fitting sets a couple weeks ago while we played catch-up, being responsive to those people that already had their fitting sets. We will remove that bottleneck of the fitting sets within weeks.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the...","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And therefore, it is not a limit \u2013 a rate limiter as we get into \u2013 really into the third quarter.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thanks for taking my questions, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. Please proceed.","Anthony C. Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Thanks and congrats on another good quarter. Maybe, Bob, a little bit on your comments on the marketplace. A little bit of a slowdown in growth broadly, and you mentioned UPP pricing. So, can you specifically give us a little bit more color on where that practice is just industry-wide? In other words, how deeply is it implemented across the U.S.? What has been the feedback from optometrists, and maybe what has the feedback been from larger retailers?","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it's pretty predictable. The independent eye care professional loves it. The retailers, they're very vocal about that. And as far as where the practice is right now, of course, J&J was the most aggressive going well beyond new products, whereas the other competitors have pretty much been selective with new products.","There is a lot of energy on all fronts that can be imagined going on in that arena, that who knows where it will shake out. I personally think that there are other options to address our loyalty and everyone's loyalty to the eye care professional who's the one that spends all the time, fitting the patient. And that's a little bit what's the undercurrent there. But just stay tuned. I'm more wishy-washy on where it goes, but I respect the individual parties weighing in on it.","Anthony C. Petrone - Jefferies LLC","And just to clarify, Cooper's position is still that they have not joined in on the new pricing structure.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We adopted clariti or the Sauflon position on clariti and continue that, and that's what we have done thus far.","Anthony C. Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Helpful. And then the last one from me is just for Greg. Maybe just an update on the extent of the CIBA royalty, what is still being paid overseas, the timing on when that rolls off and maybe what you think the benefit could be come 2016? Thanks again.","Gregory W. Matz - Vice President, Chief Financial & Risk Officer","Yeah. That's a topic that we just don't cover. Again, we have contractual obligations in and privacy on that, so we have not gone into that level of detail. Sorry about that.","Kim Duncan - Vice President, Investor Relations","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Jon Block of Stifel. Please proceed.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks and good evening, guys. I might just be asking an earlier question in different way, and then I have one incremental. But just on the guidance, I think the FX was actually $0.47 relative to the last time you guided. In other words, I think you said $0.43 for the balance of the year, 2Q, 3Q, 4Q, and $0.04 in 1Q. Well, you took out the midpoint by $0.05. So, I get roughly a $0.50 raise on call it operations, but, Bob, constant currency revenue growth really didn't change, and it didn't sound like you're running well ahead on synergy. So, can you just talk to where the $0.50 came from? Is it operations, or it seems like is it more synergies, and if so, where are you overall with synergies? Thanks. And then I got a follow-up.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. The synergies is a big factor of it. As Greg indicated, some of it was expense management. Some of it was the gross margin and the favorable mix, with a stronger U.S. showing, which, of course, was more immunized from foreign exchange. In fact, it has the benefit of lower landed cost. So, that was a part of a factor on the gross margin. But having Biofinity perform well with very high gross margin certainly helped gross margin, operating margin from top to bottom, if you will, a little less on the top line, but a lot on the gross margin and OI line. Synergy, clearly some of the early easy decisions, if you will, in terms of bigger dollars in the integration are contributors. So, yes, we are running favorable on synergy relative to this year and getting to where we wanted to get, and that's a factor. As we've indicated, the buyback of 100,000 shares and less of an overhang, our shares is a factor.","You are a little right in the sense that in the quarter, we had some modest increment of earnings hurdling foreign exchange. I think, it was more like $0.01 than it was $0.05, however. And I'll let Greg maybe comment on that.","Gregory W. Matz - Vice President, Chief Financial & Risk Officer","Yeah. Absolutely. So, we were \u2013 we had said $0.40, we had about a $0.41 impact in the first quarter.","Jon D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Okay. Got it. And then just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned I believe MyDay revenues up 62% constant currency, big number but off of a small base. And I'm guessing the absolute was probably around, I don't know, $7 million or so. What are you seeing in Europe with MyDay and are you running into any situation where clariti is actually cannibalizing MyDay with people trading down? Thanks, guys.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think, we have a pretty good spread between the two; and of course that's spread over time, as we really solidify the two-tier system, will even get further apart. But by and large, those two products were competing in the marketplace prior to the Sauflon acquisition and really all the way through the end of 2014 for the most part, and found their niches, both in private label \u2013 in a private label sense and otherwise. There already was some element of economic ARP spread between the two. And, of course, we want to make it a lot clearer that as MyDay ramps up and is really going after the premium part of the portfolio, which is the bulk of the dollars today, but longer term will not be the bulk of the dollars as clariti goes after MOIST in the mass market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research. Please proceed.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good evening, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I actually have a couple of them, if you don't mind, circling back on some earlier questions. First, and I'll just kind of rattle off the questions and let you guys have them, I guess, first, Bob, I'm just curious as to how important or the importance of UPP is to Sauflon in your mind? I heard your comments earlier. I do know, there's been a class action lawsuit filed within the past day or two regarding UPP. And so I was just wondering how important it is to Sauflon and its growth. That's the first one.","Then secondly, on the clariti rollout, I'm trying to figure out what's going on in terms of why you're halting the fitting sets. Is it more that you \u2013 is it a manufacturing capacity issue, or is it something going on with the distribution of lenses that is causing the bottlenecks?","And then I guess the final thing is just for Greg. Greg, I heard your response to some earlier questions, but with the revenue guidance coming down, but still expecting operating margins around 23%, I'm not \u2013 I don't understand how the EPS guidance is what it is. I would think that given the revenue coming down, operating margins would have needed to go up for the full year to maintain the guidance like you have? Thanks, guys.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Well, I'll start with the first couple and maybe add a little to the third one. The class action on UPP, how important is it to clariti? Of course, our view is that there are other ways to support the eye care professional than UPP, but we are going to respect the fact that that decision had already been made at the time we acquired it, and we're not going to renege on that, if you will.","And of course, we also stay on the fence and have not committed, one way or the other, where we're going with future rollout of new products. Having said that, if it went away tomorrow, I wouldn't care as an industry because I firmly believe we will take care of the eye care professional, the individual that fits the prescription, the Rx. And UPP is not necessarily the total answer to that requirement, if you will.","Relative to the fitting set bottleneck, if you will, it is only \u2013 why did we stop issuing fitting sets? We stopped issuing fitting sets because demand had already \u2013 out of the existing fitting sets, already exceeded our ability to try to do two things at once. Continue to build fitting sets and ship them and to sell product and be responsive to existing fitting sets. So, of course, you're going to take care of your existing customers first that have that. And part of it is \u2013 it's as simple as the lenses are being produced, but the pipeline is still being improved.","For example, some lenses were on a ship, as opposed to in the air. So, you had part of the inventory in transit. And that's just the matter of getting there. There was plenty being produced in Hungary, but staging it and getting it from Hungary to West Henrietta where they put the fitting sets together for distribution is the bottleneck.","That's a short term problem, the lenses arriving as we speak, they then have to get put into fitting sets. But importantly, we were going to give first priority to existing fitting sets where doctors are actually prescribing them on patients. So, that's why it's a short term problem and it was not a problem with the manufacturing side, but what was going on in the middle.","Relative to the third one, why has revenue come down in GAAP, not constant currency? Of course, constant currency stayed the same, but revenue came down, recognizing foreign exchange. Some of that coverage was the mix we talked about, with Biofinity, so a better Biofinity profile.","And some of it has to do with things that \u2013 the accelerated synergy from the Sauflon integration that started showing up sooner than we would have thought when we were sitting here in mid \u2013 in early December giving previous guidance which was one-day or the day of the CMA approval in the UK. So we were one day into it or a few minutes into it actually, and now we're a lot more educated on what we can get done and by when. And that had favorable implications on operating cost, for example. So, we can get to the same operating income, if you will, on less revenue because there are less operating costs. Greg?","Gregory W. Matz - Vice President, Chief Financial & Risk Officer","Yeah. And I think, Steve, yeah, you're bang right. I know where you're coming from. And as we gave kind of around 23%, you look at it, we're still around 23%. We're probably a little north of where the original guidance was, but it's still rounding in that same ballpark. So, yeah, the margins have actually \u2013 have inched up a bit, and that's where you get that extra kind of add-on to what Bob had said.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Unless there's outstanding. So, some of it is on the top \u2013 bottom line also.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Got you. Thanks, guys.","Gregory W. Matz - Vice President, Chief Financial & Risk Officer","Yeah, that's a good point.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay.","Operator","Your next call question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch. Please proceed. BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Can you hear me okay?","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We can.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Terrific. Thanks. And nice quarter. Particularly, your gross margin number. I'm curious if you did 64.2% in the first quarter and your guidance for the full year was just north of 63%. What is happening over the next three quarters that would drive that down?","Gregory W. Matz - Vice President, Chief Financial & Risk Officer","Well, Joanne, I mean, we're still expecting major headwinds in the FX. So, on revenue, as you saw, going out until next three quarters, still \u2013 currency still being an issue. So, that hasn't changed. Also, the fact of the matter is that as we are successful with clariti and we add more 1 day, we're going to see \u2013 again, we'll continue to see the pressure on \u2013 the headwind on gross margin. So, we feel very comfortable with the 63% range at this point. I think that it's the right number going forward.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The first quarter did not get the full brunt of the headwind from currency. That kind of \u2013 clearly, the first half of the quarter was already in the bag when we gave guidance previously. And so, your headwind continued to grow and actually accelerated, I think, as we got into even the post first quarter timing. So February has not been kind to the euro.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then my follow-up question, your SG&A which we've been really focused on as a leverage point for you have come down quite a bit year-over-year. How much more is that \u2013 or how much more room is there to move that metric down?","Gregory W. Matz - Vice President, Chief Financial & Risk Officer","I would say, we're still north of 40$, and I don't think north of 40% reflects strong leveraging and still reflects a lot of investment around the world in area of geographic expansion and whatnot. So I don't call 2015 a high leverage scenario, in other words, we still see that the way forward to 2018 is going to be more about leverage of operating cost and less about improvement of gross margin while I would say it will be substantial cost reductions in manufacturing. Meaning the cost will be coming down, the mix will be offsetting a lot \u2013 some of the mix factor.","But mix will outplay cost reductions on cost of goods and gross margin. And then we will get leverage out of operating cost part of which is the operating cost in a one-day modality are less than the operating cost in your monthly and your two-week modality.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Terrific. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Matt Mishan of KeyBanc. Please proceed.","Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you and thank you for taking my questions. You've had Sauflon for a couple months now and you've been talking a lot about the synergies. Have you given a total number and are you ready to give a total number for what the synergies could be for Sauflon?","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it's kind of lumped in to the guidance we've given which, of course, has been gobbled up by foreign exchange. And I think when Greg gives his earnings per \u2013 translates the earnings per share guidance to what it would be were it not for foreign exchange, which is basically 22% to 26%, it's best to think of that increment and then some as being contributed by Sauflon synergy. In other words, we were running low-double digits, and now were running basically 22% to 26% were it not for foreign exchange gobbling up some of that.","Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then I believe you also mentioned that, at least for MyDay, you think you get faster margin expansion than you expected going forward, and I was just curious why that was.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm sorry. Say that again?","Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I think you mentioned when you were talking about the ramp in MyDay that you expected faster margin expansion than you thought you'd get.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Part of that is a reflection of the fact that number one we're taking a little bit more time to roll out MyDay, meaning we've taken the time to upgrade some of the manufacturing platform. An example of that might be part of the platform has been upgraded to have automated inspection instead of manual inspection.","So, a whole bunch of direct labor comes off the line, sending margins higher. Part of that is the luxury of having a little bit of time. The other thing is we indicated that the pricing strategy of MyDay will be basically more of a premium. So the fact that we will have more of a premium pricing than the mass market pricing or some place in the middle is the second contributor, higher ARPs.","Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman of Oppenheimer. Please, proceed.","Steve M. Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Hi, guys. I guess, just two questions. First, as we think about the launch of MyDay later this year in the U.S., can you talk a little bit about how it's being positioned versus other premium si-hy dailies in Europe and thus what your positioning will be here in the U.S. Anything on the messaging around that lens would be helpful.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it's going to be positioned obviously out at the mass market sector, meaning a premium to that. We have not necessarily indicated exactly what we're coming out relative to the pricing versus Total 1 and TruEye which would be your two premium priced products. Whether or not it's above or below TruEye, we have not indicated at this point in time.","Relative to the separatism, of course, since we've not launched in the U.S., it's kind of a blank piece of paper. The description of MyDay, we believe MyDay versus TruEye and Total 1 measures up very well. And particularly has issues of not only the price point factor that may come into play but also certain things to do with handling ability and whatnot. So there's certain features that MyDay had that when we get into detailed marketing literature we will play out.","Steve M. Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then just \u2013 Greg, just on a follow-up on gross margin, you mentioned lower period expenses in F 1Q. Are you anticipating those expenses to bump higher looking forward? Does that play a part in gross margin maybe coming down a bit from F 1Q levels beyond obviously the FX and daily, that mix that you talked about?","Gregory W. Matz - Vice President, Chief Financial & Risk Officer","Yeah. I think, it's some of the period expenses. They were a little lower than we normally run, but that being said, they do fluctuate. So they were lower than we expected. We have seen quarters where they kind of more lined up and were higher than we expected. And so we just felt they were probably running at a lower rate than is reasonable through the remainder of the year.","Steve M. Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Got it. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Please proceed.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for fitting me in. Just two questions, obviously a lot of talk about Biofinity and the strength in the quarter and the positive benefit that that has on gross margin and mix. Just trying to figure out what was perhaps behind Biofinity doing as well it was. So I'm sort of curious geographically, where you were perhaps seeing that strength. And you also obviously had some distributor reductions in the fourth quarter and just was curious if you're seeing some improved buying.","And then the second question was, Bob, you've made some comments about feeling like the market would improve and move up towards 6% in 2015. And obviously I understand the benefits of some of these higher price lenses, but from a demand perspective, are you expecting much change in volume, or is it really all, again, mix towards higher-price lenses?","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, a little of all of those. So, I would say the continuation of the success of silicone hydrogel moving into the one-day space is a strong plus, meaning, Total 1 is doing well. I believe clariti will do well, and when MyDay gets to the U.S. market, I believe it will do well. So, that will push up clearly ARPs per ware, if you will. The shift continues from the two-week sector where, of course, J&J's sweet spot is into the one-month, which is still growing, and the daily. So, that shift is a continuation plus.","I think what's muddied up the growth as much as anything is clearly UPP and some of the tactics that have gone on, and it's hard to kind of work through what that all means. But some retailers, for example, have withdrawn somewhat, contracted somewhat. And how it shakes out or how it long it takes to shake out may take a little while, but I do think there's been kind of a distortion caused by UPP in the marketplace that will flush out in the near term, meaning over the next three months to six months.","Relative to Biofinity, I think Biofinity just has good karma. We have continued to round out the parameters, if you will, and a lot of it is geographic expansion. So, it's got a good name. It's well-respected, and it's doing well going globally as a factor. But I think it also is getting some windfall from a maybe more rapid shift out of two weeks coming into the growth of the monthly sector as well as into the one-day. It's picking up its fair share of the monthly sector.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions in the queue. We will now turn the call back over to Mr. Bob Weiss for closing remarks.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Well, I want to thank everyone for participating. We're obviously excited about where we are relative to the quarter. I have a \u2013 I had a recommendation I will not share with you on how to fix the dollar. Everyone would laugh too much. So, I won't give you the recommendation, but someday in private, I may share with some of you.","But we have a long way to go to figure out where currencies \u2013 when they're going to stabilize, but I certainly hope they do. That's our, by far, number one pain in the neck right now, although I also respect the fact everything goes in cycle.","So, kind of with that complaint as a parting comment, I look forward to updating you on the great progress we're making and the great roll-outs of our products on our call on June 4, the end of our second quarter.","That'll be it. Operator?","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we greatly appreciate your patience and participation in today's conference call. You may now disconnect. And everyone, have a great day."],"6040":["The Cooper Companies Inc.

Ma'am, you may begin.","Kim Duncan","Good afternoon and welcome to The Cooper Companies second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. During today's call, we will discuss the results included in the earnings release, along with updated guidance and then use the remaining time for Q&A. Our presenters on today's call are Al White, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Andrews, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.","Before I begin, I'd like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements, including all revenue and earnings per share guidance and other statements regarding anticipated results of operations, market or regulatory conditions and integration of any acquisitions or their failure to achieve anticipated benefits.","Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Welcome to our second quarter 2019 conference call. This was another solid quarter where we met the high expectations we set for ourselves as our momentum continued in both CooperVision and CooperSurgical.","For the quarter, we reported $654.3 million in consolidated revenue, up 4% year-over-year or up 7% pro forma. CooperVision posted revenues of $484.2 million, up 4% as reported or up 8% pro forma. CooperSurgical posted revenues of $170.1 million, up 4% as reported or 6% pro forma.","Non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.94. These strong results were driven by our market-leading products and strong operational execution and we expect this success to continue.","For CooperVision, growth was seen throughout the world with the Americas up 5%; EMEA, 8%; and Asia-Pac, 14%, all pro forma. All three regions were led by our daily silicone hydrogel lenses, MyDay and clariti, which grew 34% pro forma. We also saw strength from Biofinity, especially Biofinity Energys, and with torics and multifocals being especially strong in EMEA and Asia-Pac.","Our silicone hydrogel FRP or two-week and monthly lenses, Biofinity and Avaira, continued taking share growing 6%, while torics grew 7%, and multifocals grew 6%, all pro forma.","Our specialty lens business which includes scleral lenses, ortho-k products and MiSight also posted strong pro forma growth of 35%. This part of our business is now on a run rate of roughly $55 million, and it's becoming a greater focus as we're increasing promotional activity and educational efforts to support our ongoing global rollout.","Regarding MiSight, in particular, we'll be releasing a strong five-year clinical data tomorrow at the Annual BCLA conference, and I'm sure our myopia management presentations will be jam-packed. We're now selling MiSight in many parts of the world, including several European countries, Canada and a few Asia-Pac countries. And we're increasing our investment activity as demand for this product has really started accelerating.","Regarding the U.S. market, I'm not going to go into any detail other than to say we're working with the FDA, and we'll provide updates at the appropriate time. Overall, the specialty lens business is a very exciting area given its growth potential, but also for the halo effect we expect we'll see in our other products.","Moving back to the quarter, we're continuing to invest in support of independent practitioners and key accounts. These investments are centered around customized product offerings and infrastructure upgrades such as enhancing our distribution and packaging capabilities, along with upgrading our internal support functions.","This includes opening and expanding multiple distribution facilities, expanding manufacturing locations, upgrading IT systems, improving customer service and increasing the use of automation. These are critical efforts for our long-term success as it's important we build a proper infrastructure to support the many years of growth in front of us.","Regarding key accounts, our efforts and investments with these large relationships continue to support CooperVision's growth, but are also helping our partners to grow their overall contact lens businesses with a focus on retaining customers. These efforts include a heightened focus on in-store sales, education, advertising, and important sales hires.","These sophisticated buyers appreciate this focused activity, which targets increasing their overall optometry sales by helping ensure outlets cross-sell contact lenses and glasses or to reduce contact lens dropout rates, fit the best lenses for each situation and get supported as they expand geographically.","Now, before finishing on CooperVision, let me highlight a few items on the global soft contact lens market, along with addressing some important points on why dailies are driving the market's growth and why that should continue for many years.","On a trailing 12-month basis, the market grew 7% to $8.6 billion with the primary growth driver being dailies growing 12%, and within that category, daily silicones growing 32%. The market is well on its way to its third consecutive year of growing over 5%, driven by several factors, including the shift to silicone hydrogel dailies, the increasing incidence of myopia, geographic expansion, and growth in torics and multifocals.","To expand on dailies, remember that only around 25% of wearers are in dailies, which means there's a lot of trade-up opportunity, and that's happening naturally as optometrists continue educating patients on the health benefits and convenience of these lenses.","When you consider this trade-up in the context that dailies generate two to three times more revenue per patient than FRP wearers for the manufacturer, it's a powerful trend. Additionally, a wearer trading up from a hydrogel daily to a silicone hydrogel daily generates a roughly 20% premium, and current market statistics support a powerful trend here also with only 39% of dailies sales being in silicones.","To put that in context, 82% of FRP sales are in silicones, and we believe these percentages will ultimately be similar as pricing comes in line, which we're seeing with offerings such as clariti.","So clearly, a lot of reasons to be optimistic about the future of the contact lens market. And when you add the fact that CooperVision's market share within dailies is only 18% compared to roughly 31% within the FRP space, you could see why we're very bullish on our future given our strong daily silicone hydrogel portfolio, which currently holds a 27% market share and is growing nicely. The key for us is to continue executing to keep the momentum we have in our recent results, and the strong New Fit Data clearly indicates we're on the right track.","Moving to CooperSurgical, we reported revenues of $170.1 million, up 6% pro forma. Our office and surgical business grew 7% pro forma with stronger-than-expected results from PARAGARD, which grew 11%. This means over the last five quarters, PARAGARD has grown 11%, 9%, 20%, 10%, and now 11%, so not too shabby.","As many of you know, PARAGARD is the only non-hormonal IUD in the U.S. market. And since purchasing the product roughly 18 months ago, we've essentially relaunched it by building on a new salesforce, offering physician training and implementing a broad marketing plan, which has included television ads, print material, and social media.","With the U.S. IUD market now slightly over $1 billion in annual revenues and PARAGARD being only around 17% market share, we believe there exists significant opportunity for future growth, and we'll be investing accordingly.","Outside of PARAGARD, our office and surgical business grew 3%, and fertility grew 5%, both pro forma. Office and surgical had a solid quarter with strong growth in several product lines such as uterine manipulators and surgical retractors, although a decline in OEM and EndoSee sales offset some of these gains.","Regarding EndoSee, customers reduced their inventory levels in anticipation of the next-generation product, which is being launched next month. The pre-commercialization feedback, which includes clinical cases, has been very positive, including noticeable excitement from physicians at the ACA conference earlier this month. So, we're confident we'll see a rebound in EndoSee as a new version hits the market.","Regarding fertility, our performance was led by double-digit growth in our consumables portfolio, which includes products like IVF media. We continue to see a lot of strength in this part of our portfolio and expect it to continue. This strength was offset by our genomics business, which had its last tough year-over-year.","Overall, we continue to believe the global fertility market has fantastic long-term potential, and we are dedicated to remaining a market leader. With that, we're continuing to invest in our infrastructure, including hiring additional sales reps and building out our educational offerings such as the recent opening of six new Centers of Excellence located around the world, which are now busy training fertility specialists.","Outside of the commercial part of CooperSurgical, I'm happy to announce we're ramping up production in our new Costa Rica manufacturing facility. Production is still relatively light, but we're in the process of relocating additional lines, along with breaking ground and tripling the size of the building to create a state-of-the-art location which will include the most technologically advanced fertility manufacturing operation in the world.","We accelerated activity into this past quarter to get this project completed quicker and that's creating some disruption, which Brian will discuss, but we want to get this activity completed over the next year as its key to our long-term success.","Now, before concluding, I want to briefly mention our recent activity around corporate responsibility. I'm proud to say that CooperVision's Costa Rica manufacturing facility was recently awarded the prestigious LEED Silver certification for its environmentally conscious design and operation, and that our Rochester, New York operations are now fully powered by 100% renewable electricity.","We're advancing our corporate responsibility efforts around the world, including increasing our focus on the environment, improving local support for the communities in which we operate, and supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals. And we're having success.","Our employees are the driver of these efforts, and I'd like to conclude by thanking them for their hard work and dedication which makes this all possible.","And I'll now turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Andrews","Thank you, Al and good afternoon everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results.","Al covered revenues, so I'll focus on the rest of the financials and guidance. Consolidated gross margins for the quarter were 67.3%, down from 68.3% last year, driven by the negative impact of currency.","CooperVision's gross margins were 66.5%, down from 67.5% last year due to currency. Excluding currency, operational positives, such as product mix, were offset by higher rebates and certain higher internal handling costs which we've discussed before.","CooperSurgical's gross margin declined to 69.6%, down from 70.5% as the benefits from higher PARAGARD sales were more than offset by operational inefficiencies and challenges associated with the transfer of production to our new Costa Rica manufacturing facility.","Consolidated operating expenses grew 4.6% in the quarter, driven by increased investing in global sales and marketing in both CooperVision and CooperSurgical. Of note was an item we discussed last quarter, which was a significant increase in CooperSurgical sales and marketing expenses associated with promotional activities, especially television advertising around PARAGARD. Outside of this, expenses were kept fairly in line with revenue growth.","Operating margins declined to 27.1% versus 28.5% last year primarily due to currency. Below operating income, we reported an $18.5 million of interest expense and an effective tax rate of 7.5%. The tax rate was positively impacted by excess tax benefits received from the exercising of stock options and favorable internal restructuring activities.","Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $2.94, with roughly 50 million average shares outstanding. Free cash flow was $162.1 million comprised of $214.8 million of operating cash flow, offset by $52.7 million of CapEx. Net debt decreased by $164 million to $1.825 billion and our adjusted leverage ratio declined to slightly under two times.","Moving to guidance, we're updating our revenue outlook to incorporate Q2 results and the negative impact from currency. On a consolidated basis, fiscal 2019 revenue guidance is now $2.633 billion to $2.667 billion. This includes increasing the midpoint of CooperVision's pro forma growth by moving a range up to 7% to 8% pro forma or $1.964 billion to $1.985 billion, reflecting what we believe will be continuing momentum even against tough comps in the back half of the year. The midpoint of CooperSurgical's revenue guidance is also being increased to 4% to 6% pro forma or $669 million to $682 million.","Outside of revenues, we expect consolidated gross margins to improve slightly year-over-year with CooperVision expected to post similar year-over-year margins in Q3, but then a year-over-year improvement in Q4 driven mainly by currency.","With respect to CooperSurgical, we expect the inefficiencies associated with the transfer of production to Costa Rica to remain for the remainder of the year, but still expect gross margins in Q3 and Q4 to be similar to last year with sales mix and other manufacturing efficiencies offsetting the impact.","Consolidated operating margins are expected to be up slightly for the full year. Interest expense is forecasted to be around $69 million as we're expecting strong free cash flow in the back half of the year and no additional rate hikes by the Fed.","For taxes, we're expecting a full year effective tax rate of around 8.5%, which reflects the lower Q2 we just reported and expectations for slightly lower rates in the back half of the year.","Incorporating all of this, we're increasing our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance range to $12.15 to $12.35 which reflects the positive impact of tax and interest, offset by currency. On a constant currency basis, this would be a year-over-year earnings growth of 11% to 13%.","To add a little more color on our guidance. Currency has recently moved against us, and we're forecasting a negative year-over-year impact of $66 million on revenue and $0.62 on EPS.","Since last quarter's earnings guidance, currency is $11 million worse on revenues and $0.15 worse on earnings. These assumptions are based on current rates, including the euro at $1.11, the pound at $1.26 and the yen at JPY110.","Note that we're forecasting some core operating profitability improvements associated with the constant currency increase in our revenues, but we'll be reinvesting this back into the business with a focus on MiSight and PARAGARD. Regarding quarterly gating, we expect Q4 EPS to be higher than Q3, driven by the currency impact to those respective quarters.","And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Lawrence Keusch","Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Al, I guess two questions, just to start with. So, if my math is right, you need about 6.5% CVI growth in the second half to get you to the midpoint of the guidance, and that may actually not be taking into account some of the changes you just made. I did that math before you did that. But I guess the point is you do have tougher comps, so what gives you the confidence that you can actually grow up in that 6.5%, 7% range to get you to the guidance?","Albert White","Yes. Larry, good question. We do have confidence in that. I mean we have pretty good momentum in the business. We obviously have started this quarter off already, so taking our expectations for this quarter and putting that also into our assumptions around the guidance.","So I think when you look at good start to the second half of this year here, good momentum in the business, a lot of the trends that are -- that have been driving our business, and our market share gains are continuing around the daily silicone hydrogel side, especially.","When you look at those factors, our expectations that we actually think the Americas is going to get a little stronger in the back half of the year as we've now annualized some of that rebate activity. When you roll that altogether, that gives us some confidence that we'll be able to put up some pretty good results in Q3 and Q4.","Lawrence Keusch","Okay. And then just quickly switching gears to cash flow. So, it's about $185 million at the first half. I think you are looking for free cash flow that could potentially approach $500 million. So, again, I want to just check in on sort of your thoughts around the annual free cash flow generation. And to the extent that it does need to again accelerate in the second half of the year, what drives that?","Albert White","Yes. I think we will have pretty strong free cash flow in the back half of the year. If you look at our free cash flow typically by quarter throughout the year, you'll see a lot of strength in the back half of the year. So, that's very common for us. As our revenues ramp-up and profits come up then cash flow really comes into the business. So, I anticipate that will happen again.","Whether we to get to $500 million or similar to last year, that'll depend largely on CapEx. We're doing a lot of buildout right now, especially associated with new daily lines. So, it'll depend when the check goes out the door for that.","But I would say if we just run our business as we have historically, you'll see strong free cash flow in Q3 and Q4 and some pretty -- by default right now, some pretty significant pay-down in debt. ","Lawrence Keusch","Okay, perfect. Thanks guys.","Albert White","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. One on tax, one on growth in CVI next year, just a little color commentary. So, just on the tax rate, Al or Brian, why has the tax rate been so much lower than expected in 2019? How much of that is the stock-based comp versus the restructuring that you mentioned, Brian? And how do we think about the tax rate beyond 2019?","And I'll just ask my follow-up now. Al, you're guiding to 7% to 8% CVI growth in fiscal 2019, and obviously, you have some new competition coming into the silicone hydrogel daily disposable market next year. How should we think about Cooper being able to maintain above-market growth? How confident are you, you can continue to take share? And what gives you that confidence? Thanks for taking the questions guys.","Brian Andrews","Hi Larry, its Brian here. Yes, so on the tax side, our internal expectations for Q2 were around 12.5%. Now, we ended at 7.5% for the quarter. So, that 5%, I'd say, around two-thirds of that was related to stock-based comps, so stock options and so forth. About a third of that was internal tax restructuring. So, we talked about that a little bit last quarter. There were a few different components that lowered our tax rate down to 2.5% or so.","One of those being the internal tax planning and supply chain planning that we did towards the end of last year that really was going to have only an impact on this fiscal year. So, we underestimated some of that impact, and so we actually are getting a bit more of a benefit than we anticipated from that restructuring and so that was about a third and then the rest was options.","Albert White","And Brian, beyond 2019, how do we -- should we still think about 14%, is that still a good number?","Brian Andrews","Yes, that's still a good number. I mean right now, there's a lot of pressure upwards on that effective tax rate. But I think until we get to the end of the year when we provide new guidance, we're sticking with the 14%.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Okay. And Al, on the second question?","Albert White","Yes. You're right, a little competition coming here soon on the daily silicone hydrogel side. Frankly, at the end of the day, I think what you're going to end up seeing because of that is Alcon launches it, depending upon how they launch, what their strategies are and so forth with PRECISION 1, they'll trade up some of their DACP wearers. And that's probably $800 million, $900 million in sales.","So, as I was talking earlier, that's a 20% trade-up or somewhere in that kind of range is how we look at it. I'm sure it's the same for them, maybe higher depending upon their price points and so forth.","So, I think that what you're going to see is them doing a little bit better. That's going to help the overall market do better. And I feel pretty decent that you're going to see market growth next year of 5%, 6% again, somewhere in that kind of range, maybe even a touch higher.","With respect to us in that market, we'll continue to do with we're doing. Selling into key accounts and being successful, selling into independent practitioners around the world, being successful, all focused on our daily silicone hydrogel business where we have true strength right now, where we're taking a lot of market share.","So, continuing to do that and winning some market share out there and continuing to grow those type of big accounts is what's going to push us. At the end of the day, I feel pretty confident about that. I mean the trends that are in place and the factors that are driving our growth should continue even if there's a little bit of competitive strength that comes in.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is now open","Anthony Petrone","Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just going back to CVI, a couple questions there. Just the dailies print in the quarter was a little bit better than we were expecting, and that's based obviously -- has been stable for quite some time. But we're hearing that eventually, there could be a new product entering that space, specifically in the value category. So, maybe just an update on dailies, a little bit more color on the combination of MyDay and clariti and what you're seeing on the competitive front.","Albert White","Yes, I'll tell you, one thing that I'm happy about -- definitely happy about and keeps me excited is the New Fit Data. I talked about that in the past. It's not always necessarily the best data when you talk about GfK, and it's not covering everyone.","But we've had a long history and good trend information that we pick up from New Fit Data and it's very positive in our favor right now. So, we are definitely winning new wearers that are coming into the marketplace, and that focuses heaviest on the dailies side.","So, as long as we continue to stay in front of the competition, right, driving our cost down, getting our products out into the marketplace, making them available, keeping the broadest portfolio of clariti, the sphere or toric or multifocal, making sure that those lenses are available to everybody and working around our customized offerings that I talked about, the customized labeling and branding and doing store names and so forth -- store brands and so forth, I think we're going to continue to do well. So, I'd anticipate very strong continued growth in our daily silicone hydrogel franchise.","Anthony Petrone","Maybe just a quick follow-up would be on MiSight. You're heading to BCLA tomorrow. Just wondering if we should expect any data or presentations on MiSight. And maybe looking deeper into the calendar, what is the updated expectation for potentially entering with that product at some point? Thanks.","Albert White","Yes, I have to tell you, I am really excited about MiSight. The interest in that product has been growing around the world. I mean we sell it now. We're almost $1 million -- we're almost did $1 million this past quarter in MiSight, and it's growing dramatically.","I guess, if anything, you can kind of look at it as a little bit of a plus-minus. I mean we're pulling in quite a few dollars, quite a few expenses into this year to promote that product through advertising and educational purposes. And we're probably going to spend a decent amount more next year as we get out there.","So you're going to see five-year data presented at BCLA. It's fantastic data. It shows that, that product is successful. We are clearly a market leader when it comes to myopia management, and we need to stay in that position. So, I'm pretty excited about MiSight. I think there's a lot of future potential on that.","And I'd also say it's not only that myopia management side, but it's also the halo effect that we get from that. We are going to be the premier company out there when it comes to myopia management, and I think that'll help us on some of our other products. So, really excited to roll that out, figure out how to best commercialize that product and capitalize on it.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi good afternoon, this is JP on for Matt. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to touch first on just -- I think you mentioned in the gross margin commentary, the higher rebate activity. So, I'd love to get your view on maybe what's driving that competitively, and is that something that we should think about as kind of here to stay for the rest of this year?","Albert White","Yes, with respect to the rebate activity, that's the U.S. market is really what we're talking about. And that came to life a few years ago. It's -- fortunately, it seems to have settled out here, and if anything, we're starting to see -- looks like some price come back into the market. We had some price increases, and we've had rebates flatten out, and we're actually analyzing rebates right now. So, we'll see if it's here to stay or how that'll play out.","I mean at the end of day, rebates have been around for a long time. It's just a matter of; they were increased pretty significantly, especially associated with dailies. So, we'll see how that plays out. But I would say for now at least, a little bit of optimism there in terms of rebate activity leveling off and maybe pricing starting to move up.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that's helpful. And then just if I could, one on PARAGARD. I mean you guys have been making some investments there on the DTC side that you alluded to earlier, and 11% growth is great. And so do you ramp up further investing on that side to continue that or I mean how do you measure success? And where do you want to -- how much do you want to spend to keep growing that faster, if you can?","Albert White","Yes. I mean to me, mostly success ends up being defined by our revenues, how successful are we doing. And your next question is, okay, how much is it costing us to get those revenues, and is the return sufficient to do that? Clearly, when it comes to the salespeople, when it comes to the print advertising, the social media, all that kind of stuff, no question, that's a no-brainer.","When it comes to TV advertising, we have seen some success from that. The question right now that we're really looking at is what's the return on that? So, yes, we are getting improved unit sales associated with all of that activity, including the TV advertising, but is the TV advertising, which is fairly expensive, generating a sufficient return?","So, we ran ads for quite a while. We've kind of taken a pause on that as we evaluate how things are going. You can see in the numbers things are going well. The team there is just doing a fantastic job. I was just in Trumbull, I couldn't be happier with the success we have there. We are going to continue to invest there in a multitude of different areas.","So, I would say, hey, at the end of the day, you're going to see investments continue. I don't know how much TV advertising you'll see, but if it makes sense, we're going to continue to do it. And we're optimistic we can continue to put up some pretty good growth numbers in PARAGARD.","Unidentified Analyst","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joanne Wuensch","Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?","Brian Andrews","Yes.","Albert White","Hey Joanne.","Joanne Wuensch","Hey, how are you doing? I want to focus a little bit on the key accounts. That's been an area of investment this past; let's call it, six to 12 months. Can you give us an update on how that is going, and how you're measuring it, and how we should think -- if your commentary to the previous question was to get a fair amount of investments still in PARAGARD, does this level of investment in these accounts remain also?","Albert White","Yes, so I mean no question, key accounts are a very important part of our business. And when you look at several of the key accounts, which are outside of the U.S., we do have unquestionably a heightened focus there. The strategy, again, revolves around a partnership. We want to be partners with these guys, we want to help them grow their overall contact lens business, and we want to help them retain our customers.","So, our focus is saying, hey, how can we help you do that? We have some market-leading products that we can do customized solutions for you, again, be it putting your name on there or some sort of labeling, shipping, packaging, and so forth. How can we help you grow your overall contact lens business and retain your customer base?","And we want to do that in conjunction with them in the long-term. So, we'd like to enter into longer term contracts and have that partnership be successful. We've had success doing that. Our intent right now is to continue to invest in that, whether that's incremental dollars supporting them or salespeople or so forth.","A lot of the investments we have right now were initial investments, setting up some of the teams and so forth, so we'll start to leverage some of that activity. But you're going to continue to see a decent amount of investment dollars going into key accounts as we think that'll be a driver -- a continuing driver of our market share gains.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you. And then my second question is how should we think about gross margins going forward? Clearly, a little pressure in the next couple of quarters from foreign exchange, but when that sort of rolls off, should we be in an expansion mode once again? Thanks.","Brian Andrews","Yes. So, -- hi Joanne, its Brian here. So, we -- during my script, I mentioned that gross margins were going to be slightly up year-over-year. We still have some of those pressures on margins with rebates, and freight and secondary handling, and some obsolescence that I talked about in the past.","Certainly, our expectations, we haven't -- we're not ready to give guidance for next year, but I have my expectations that they would improve year-over-year next year as well. But I think as we get to next year, I think some of the things like freight and secondary handling start to subside a little bit, hopefully, rebates level off a little bit. So, I think gross margins should improve.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you and have a great evening.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Block","Great. Thanks guys. Good afternoon. First one, Brian, for you, and sorry if I missed this, but maybe just a quick reconciliation on the EPS guidance. So, it looks like the midpoint comes up by $0.25. FX, I believe, you said was an incremental negative $0.15 relative to last quarter. And tax seems like an incremental $0.35 tailwind, I believe, relative to last quarter. So, is that fair, call it, those two items are net plus 20, with ops maybe plus 5? If you could just comment on that.","Albert White","Yes, I mean you're directionally there. I mean you're right on the FX. It was a $0.15 detriment. If you go from, let's say, around 11% to 8.5%, that 2.5% is around $0.33. I think you mentioned $0.35. So, we've got around $0.33. And then there's an interest expense benefit going down to $69 million, which is about $0.07.","Now, I mentioned in my script -- in my prepared remarks that we were going to be reinvesting some of the operational positives back into the business, including in myopia management and PARAGARD. So that $0.25 is really tax, FX and interest. ","Jonathan Block","Sure. Perfect. Thanks for that. And then just to shift gears, sort of bigger picture, can you comment on maybe what percent of your corporate accounts are offering -- call it, all your main sight high modalities or lenses.","In other words, sort of Biofinity, MyDay and clariti. So, what percent are offering the main lenses there? And then what's the opportunity to expand that over the next 12-plus months? Thanks.","Albert White","Yes, good question. Yes, the majority of them are offering our products right now. Now they might be offering some of them as store brands or they might be offering some of them as branded products, and the same key accounts, so to speak, could be offering both underneath their portfolio of products.","So, I think from that perspective, we have good relationships with most everyone around the world. Where are a lot of the opportunity still exists is that we're more successful with some of these products with the key accounts such as Biofinity.","So, we have a lot of success there. We don't have as much success with some of the daily silicone hydrogel products, where a lot of those key accounts still sell a lot of traditional hydrogel daily lenses.","That shift is moving to silicone hydrogel daily lenses, and that's obvious be a positive for us. So, as that shift is happening, that's where we're talking to a lot of these guys saying, hey, you know us. You like us. We do a lot of business together in the FRP space. Let's increase the business that we do on a daily silicone hydrogel space because, guys we know what we're doing. And we can bring all the same benefits and value that we bring to you in the FRP space to you on the daily silicone hydrogel space.","Jonathan Block","Perfect, got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Cooley with Stephens. Your line is now open.","Chris Cooley","Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Just from me at this point, maybe, Al, you could touch on PARAGARD. And I'm curious, do you think that you're taking share from the hormonal aspect of the category? Or when you look at the growth cadence that you've been able to put up over the last four quarters, is the category starting to expand? Really just trying to get at how you see this overall category over the next two to three years. And I've got one quick follow-up after that.","Albert White","Yes, it's a good question, Chris. The category is expanding, so we're doing well. That's for sure. And a lot of that is just, as you know, getting out there and talking about the product and reminding people. I mean we've basically relaunched it to remind people, hey, there's a great product out there. There's a non-hormonal option out there that you may not be aware of.","And we're growing and arguably growing a little bit faster from a unit perspective, at least, than the overall IUD market is. But I'm happy to say that if you look at the U.S. IUD market itself, it's growing. So, are we taking a little bit of share? Maybe. But at the end of day, the entire market is growing, and that's the good thing.","Chris Cooley","Super. And then maybe just bouncing over then to CVI real quick. When you think about just structurally the portfolio for dailies, are we correct in assuming that you should be able to achieve a higher end-market share than what you've seen in FRPs just we think about breadth of product, the unique positioning there, maybe the timing of these product launches?","And then within that, could you maybe contrast for us new fit growth on dailies between key accounts and maybe like traditional channel? I'm just trying to see if you're being more leverage in that regard. Thanks so much.","Albert White","Yes. The second one is a little tough to get kind of that granular of data. I would say we're doing very well in the kind of independent practitioner market, if you will, and we're also doing really well in the key account market, but hard to get too much detail on that.","When I look at some of these numbers, though, we have 18% market share in the dailies and 31% market share in FRPs. What's interesting is we have 27% market share in dailies silicones. So, that 18%, in my mind, clearly goes towards the 27%. Now, the 27% is also growing nicely. We were a little late to the game. The 27% is growing nicely and quite a bit faster than market also.","So, ultimately, do we get to the 31% that we have in FRPs? Or do we get ahead of that? I mean I personally happen to think we get ahead of that. The 31% is growing also. But I'll tell you what, it's one hell of a long-term growth story if that 18% we have right now goes up to 31% or so.","I mean that is pretty significant market share gains and very strong growth for, I don't know, that's probably 10 years' worth of incredibly strong growth to get pretty excited about. So, yes, I mean you could tell, I'm remaining pretty bullish on that.","Chris Cooley","Super. Thanks so much.","Albert White","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good afternoon guys. Can you hear me okay?","Albert White","Yes, hey Jeff.","Jeff Johnson","Hey Al. So, MiSight, I haven't had asked the question before on MiSight, but I've been surprised over maybe the last few months to six months or so how much interest seems to be blowing up even here in the U.S. on myopia control and how many docs I'm talking to who are really excited for products in that category.","So, I guess a couple questions. You guys are moving that out of the ECP channel. You're going into some retail accounts in Europe, whether that's boots, I'm hearing one in Spain as well. It seems like you're just making the process very easy, very efficient for these docs.","So, one, how do you think that's going to help with the adoption in the near-term? How big could that product be in the near-term? And then in the U.S., do you have to go through a full, like multiyear clinical trial? Can you use European, number one? Or it's kind of a bifocal lens. Is there really going to be a high bar to just get that approved sooner rather than later in the U.S.?","Albert White","Yes, I'll tell you, in the U.S., that's one where, as I kind of said in the script, right, I've just held off saying. So, right now, we're talking to the FDA, and we'll update on that as we get some more information. I mean no surprise. I agree with you and your commentary on that. But let's see how some of those discussions play out. And as soon as we can, we'll update people on that.","But I will echo your comments because I've kind of been surprised also about how much demand there's been around MiSight. I mean we've been holding some of these myopia management conferences, and we'll do more at BCLA. And it's like, it's standing room only.","I mean people can't even get into the presentations. Like, we're doing presentations and then having to go do separate presentations. And we're doing our own CooperVision presentations, and they're just jam-packed. So the interest in myopia management is just absolutely fantastic, and we're seeing the adoption rates shoot up.","Now, there is that issue. I mean we're probably pulling forward, I don't know, I mean it could be $3 million, $4 million in expenses into this year as we look at the educational side and the promotional side of the market because we need market statistics and so forth also. And we're talking about that not only in the U.S. as we prep, but worldwide.","So, we're doing a lot of work on that right now. I mean we have the best product in a marketplace, in my opinion. And that's clear. I mean we have strong four-year clinical data. We're going to be coming out with great five-year clinical data. We're the only ones out there. So we just need to work with the some of these guys and figure out, hey, what's the best way to sell this lens?","Because keep in mind, you're talking about starting with kids as young as eight years old. So, it's not only fitting the child, it's also talking to their parents and the education of the parents. I mean we want to educate the optometrists and work with them to ensure they have the latest clinical information. We want to ensure the parents are knowledgeable. You want to do the fitting.","While you have -- one of the reasons you see a lot of the big retailers -- so a lot of -- any optometrist excited by the product is because you're talking about something that's a game changer. I mean it's like revolutionary, so to speak. I mean there's an amazing number of people who are myopic and that percentage of people with myopia continues to increase.","And if we can get in there and really change that and reduce the progression of myopia, I mean, not only is that just absolutely fantastic. You have to add on top of that, that's a child coming back into the optometrist much more frequently, which they like, obviously. They're seeing the parents; they're seeing the family members and so forth. They're tied in closer.","You have a child who's going to be in contact lenses for a much longer period of time, and this isn't just contact lenses. They can also sell glasses to the kids and other people. And so there's a whole kind of industry, if you will, that's just starting to percolate right now around myopia management. So, it's pretty exciting.","But I will agree with you, Jeff, and kind of echo that. I've been even surprised over the last three, six months how much interest there is in this product right now and in myopia management in general.","Jeff Johnson","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just last question. Just China tariffs, anything to talk about with the latest round here of increases? And just remind me, can you source everything out of Costa Rica or the U.K. that might be needed in China?","And is the move of the CSI manufacturing to Costa Rica, is that just a long-term cost play? Is it a long-term risk mitigation? Or is there anything China tariff-related there? Because I think you do have some China exposure through the fertility business, if I remember right.","Albert White","Yes, I'll comment and then let Brian jump in. The CooperSurgical move that is not China-related. We actually started out a little while ago. So, that's more bring everything under one roof, cost contain it, manufacturing, efficiency improvements. Because we had a number of facilities around the world through some of the acquisitions that we've done. So, that was not China-related. It may be a China benefit, ultimately, but not China-related.","Within CooperVision, I think if you see something that's more permanent in terms of these tariffs, maybe we'll take a look at shifting some of our manufacturing. I mean we do have fairly significant manufacturing in Costa Rica, in Budapest, in the U.K.","Obviously, Puerto Rico, U.S., that's another big location. But we could shift manufacturing if need be, if you will. So, we'll see how some of that plays out. I don't know if you want to add something?","Brian Andrews","Yes. I'll just add to the financial aspects of it. This year, we're projecting somewhere in the neighborhood of $2 million to $2.5 million worth of impact from the China tariffs between CooperVision and CooperSurgical. Next year, we would estimate it to be somewhere between $4 million and $5 million.","So it's -- CooperSurgical has very small sales into China. We've got a little bit of manufacturing there that's contributes to it. And then like Al said, our U.S.-made products, including Puerto Rico, for CooperVision results in some tariffs. So, -- but in the grand scheme of things, it's very small.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Matthew Mishan","Great and thank you for taking the questions. Hey Al, I know we're not consumer analysts, but it just seems like we're more broadly hearing mixed things around the U.S. consumer lately. And I would say your Americas number is good, but it's probably more modest than we would expect it given where the daily penetration is in the U.S. Are you seeing any change in consumer behavior?","And then also, just can you remind us, it's been a long time since there's been any kind of slowdown at all. When the consumer did get weaker previously in the past, how did that end up translating to contact lens per se?","Albert White","Yes, I think one of the problems -- the biggest problem with the U.S. market has been the rebate activity. When rebates really shot up by all of us, you had people buying a year's supply of lenses in order to get those big rebates. And a year's supply of lenses could be 15 months' or 16 months' worth of actual wearing, right, because people don't necessarily wear their lenses every single day. So, you had a lot of lenses kind of move into the market, move on people's shelves and so forth. So, I think that's part of it.","The other thing about the U.S. market is you don't get really wear growth. I mean -- and I'm talking about the number of people in contact lenses. So, we are seeing wearer growth around the world. There is -- there are new wearers coming into contact lenses, and that's fantastic. But that's not part of the U.S. market.","So, I kind of agree with you. Like, I've been a little disappointed in the U.S. market growth or the Americas, hoping it would have been a little bit stronger. I think personally, CooperVision will do a little bit better in the back half of the year, so I feel good about that. But I think the U.S. market may end up at the end of the day being more of a 4% or 5% kind of grower than what you're going to see Asia-Pac and some regions that are stronger.","If you look historically, if you kind of go back a little bit, you talk about recessions and market softness, I mean, the market's been growing north of 5% for a while, but if you go back to like -- I mean 2008 -- I've pulled some stats, as a matter fact, so I happen to have them handy.","2008, the contact lens market grew 6%, and then we move kind of into the recession. In 2009, the market overall grew 3%. And then in 2010, it bounced back up to 6%. So we're pretty recessionary-resistant. A lot of that is because of the trade-up and so forth you see, but it's also tied to the fact that there's global growth. So we're seeing wearers come into the market around the world.","Outside of the U.S., you're seeing good growth in torics and multifocals as people are \"fit\" more correctly. The conversion to dailies and daily silicone hydrogel helps and so forth. So, we're pretty recession-resistant. And I mean even if you look at 2009, again, it's a pretty bad market back then. The contact lens market grew 3%, and we grew 5%.","Matthew Mishan","Okay, awesome. And then have you factored in any benefit or pull-forward into this fourth quarter from the Japanese VAT tax that's scheduled to come in, in October?","Albert White","That's a really good question. The answer to that is no, we have not included any pull-forward on that. We talked about that right now and whether we should because we had that happen a few years ago, and we did see a decent buy in.","So, I would certainly say if that tax does indeed happen, I think we'd probably get a pull in, and I think it'd probably strengthen our numbers in Q4. History would indicate, right, that, that goes the other way in Q1.","So, I think at the end of the day, we'll comment on that at the end of August. But if all holds true, it wouldn't surprise me if we took up our Q4 numbers associated with that, but then also kind of indicate that, hey, Q1 might be a little bit softer because of that.","Matthew Mishan","All right. Thanks Al.","Albert White","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks. Al, you rattled off a strong PARAGARD results, and there's now been a number of quarters where you've seen that. Are you ready at this point to change how you're thinking about the sustainable growth there?","And I know it sounded like you were maybe thinking about pulling back on some of the promotional spend. So, what do you think the steady state growth for that franchise looks like at this point?","Albert White","Yes, I mean I'm probably a little thickheaded on that one, but the teams pounded me enough times here the growth's been strong enough. But it's better than what I thought it was going to be. And we're pulling back a little bit, as I said, in some TV advertising as we evaluate the cost benefit of that.","But I do think that -- to kind of comfortably look at PARAGARD as a mid-single-digit grower with certainly the potential, as we've seen, to move to the upper single-digits. That's probably a decent way to look at it right now based on where the market's going and our investment activity.","So, yes, we'll continue to invest in that, and we'll continue to drive it. I mean we're seeing actual units increase, and the team behind that is just doing a fantastic job.","Chris Pasquale","And then SG&A spend came in light of what we were expecting. You guys, on the last call, had highlighted pull-forward in the spending that you thought would occur this quarter. Did that end up taking place? Or is that still to come?","Albert White","No, no, no, that did take place. That took place. I'll tell you why. You look at the P&L, like, you go through it this quarter, I mean if you're -- you just love it. I love -- I think that CooperVision, I mean -- guys just killed it, man.","Like, I mean, you're talking about spending a bunch on sales and marketing, going out there, hiring salespeople, promotional activity, marketing activity, and leveraging your customer service, and your distribution, G&A, and so forth.","And surgical had -- clearly had more investments, especially around sales and marketing with PARAGARD. But no, the -- it's just frankly a really, really nice job by the team in terms of controlling expenses. And the expenses that we do have, putting them in the right places, such as sales and marketing, to drive long-term sustainable revenue growth.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Robbie Marcus","Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe one on FX for Brian and more of a strategic one for Al. First, on FX, can you run through what it was on gross margin and EPS in the quarter, what you're thinking on gross margin for the balance of the year?","Brian Andrews","Sure. We don't typically get into gross margins, but as you know, the pound and the HUF, they flow through cost of goods in a six-month lag. So, for this year, the remainder of this year, we're seeing a reduction in cost of goods from improvements year-over-year in the pound and HUF.","On the revenue side, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it was about $26 million negative. So, it was a small -- there was a small benefit from cost of goods, but for the remainder of the year, you're going to see sort of a small benefit in cost of goods and about 37% of that $66 million kind of hitting between Q3 and Q4, with a bigger impact in Q3.","Robbie Marcus","Got it. And Al, we have competition potentially coming later this year in the mass-market daily. I know this has been a topic of discussion for a very long time. What's your latest thinking in terms of -- I've heard you say in the past people have it wrong. It could actually be a big benefit for the industry as everybody targets these users and brings them up the curve in terms of mix and product. What's your latest thinking in how it relates to you here with your competitors coming with these products?","Albert White","Yes, I think at the end of the day, this is one of those situations where a lot of the trends are lifting the water level, so to speak, lifting all boats. So, as some of the competitors come with new products, I think that will improve our numbers. I would expect them to post better results.","History would indicate that they'll have their own issues about expanding capacity and being capacity constrained, and need to get new lines on and so forth. But I would expect it'll improve our numbers.","Again, I would say history indicates and current trends and Fit Data and so forth indicates we'll continue to do fine. And you'll see the market actually tick up a little bit and you'll see our growth rates continue to be strong.","So, my current thinking still holds there that a new product or a couple of new products hitting the market should help the overall market growth rate, but not be at the detriment of some of the other players.","Robbie Marcus","Appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Willoughby","Hi, good evening. Just a couple of quick questions for you at this point. First, Brian, you mentioned you're expecting $69 million in interest expenses here. What was that number previously?","Brian Andrews","That's 73-ish -- around $73 million.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. And I just -- Al, I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on where you guys stand on a couple of items, some of the investment spending you're doing as it relates to kind of distribution centers.","In the past, you've talked about some inventory and equipment write-offs. Just was wondering if we're through those. And how much longer this kind of distribution center buildout goes -- continues from here.","Albert White","Yes, I mean -- yes, we talked about that in Q4. I remember that's when it kind of first hit, and we were talking about how it'd run through this year and it has. I mean -- so we had in Q1 -- I think Brian mentioned -- he's shaking his head. Yes, a little bit. We did have it in Q2 with some kind of heightened secondary handling costs and so forth. But I would say we're on pace, if not, probably a little bit ahead of pace on the distribution side in terms of implementing some of the technology we're putting in place.","So, we are feeling -- we felt a little bit of that pressure in Q1, a little bit again in Q2. Probably, it will moderate in Q3, moderate a little bit more in Q4. I don't know if we get leverage next year on a lot of that activity or not, but it would at least be neutral to this year and my guess it'd probably be a little positive.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. And then if you don't mind, just one other quick follow-up. The PARAGARD marketing you guys did, the TV ads you did in the first quarter and in the second quarter, have you quantified what that amount was that you were spending? And if so, could you remind me what that was maybe in 2Q? Just to give us an idea of that going away in 3Q and 4Q.","Albert White","Yes, there was a lot of spending there, I mean, associated with the TV ads and also print ads on People Magazine and so forth and social media. A lot of different areas. But when you look at some of the expense that we accelerated into this quarter, especially associated with the TV advertising in a full quarter, that ended up being somewhere around $6 million. So, you will see some -- and that's just that piece. There was a decent amount on top of that of other activity. You'll see some of that kind of in Q3 and Q4.","The business is performing well. I mean we're getting some improved, true operational profitability. So, we're going to take some of that and push that back into PARAGARD in Q4 to continue the promotional activity and try to have a good Q4 and be positive going into next year.","So, I feel good about that. I mean were able, right now, to be able to take guidance up a decent amount because of some the other activity in taxes. So, it's probably, if nothing else, allowing us to take a few of these operational upside dollars and invest them back in, into; one, I talked about, right, which is MiSight. We definitely want to put dollars there; and then the other one is stay on top of PARAGARD as we move through the year.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. Thanks so much.","Albert White","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Al White for any closing remarks.","Albert White","All right. Great. Well, great. Well, thank you, everyone. Appreciate everyone's interest, obviously. Another good solid quarter for us, and we're anticipating a good back half of the year.","So, I don't have anything else to add at this point. Look forward to seeing a lot of you out on the road.

Welcome to the second quarter 2016 conference call. Let me start by highlighting three key areas. First, I'm pleased to report strong financial results for our fiscal second quarter. On a consolidated basis, we reported $484 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.05. Second, CooperVision posted 9% revenue growth on both a constant currency and as-reported basis and strong results in all key areas of the business. Single use silicone hydrogel lenses grew 52% while two week and monthly silicone hydrogel lenses grew a combined 14% both in constant currency. Third, CooperSurgical had another strong quarter posting revenue growth of 23% and pro forma growth of 6%. We also closed several strategic acquisitions since our last earnings calls.","Moving on to the details, CooperVision reported second quarter revenues of $391 million, up 9%. This was our strongest quarter, growth quarter since 2014 and really shows the strength of our product portfolio. Regarding revenue by geography, the Americas grew 9% in constant currency showing a nice rebound from last quarter.","Strength was seen in multiple categories led by silicone hydrogel products. Our enhanced Clariti lens has been extremely well received and MyDay had another strong quarter. Our toric and multifocals also posted strong growth driven by the Biofinity family. EMEA had another strong quarter and sales grew 5% in constant currency. Growth was driven by our family of silicone hydrogel products Biofinity, Clariti, MyDay and Avaira.","We also launched Avaira, Vitality in EMEA during the quarter and it is being well received. Avaira Vitality is our new two week silicone hydrogel lens which is an enhanced replacement for the original Avaira lens. It was developed using improved manufacturing processes resulting in a higher quality product at a lower cost per unit. We expect to launch this lens in the US later this year subject to FDA approval.","Asia Pacific had a very strong quarter, up 18% in constant currency. Growth was strong throughout the region and Biofinity and ProClear 1 day stood out in Japan. Also within Japan we began our MyDay launch during the quarter and we're seeing early signs that MyDay to be a very successful premium offering in that market.","Turning to our product categories, toric and multifocals grew at a healthy 15% year-over-year in constant currency. We saw very nice rebound in the US which bolstered our strength throughout the rest of world. We remain the global leader in specialty lenses.","Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses, these products grew 20% in constant currency and now represent 60% of our total sales. Within the two week and monthly space Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 14% in constant currency. We remain under-indexed in the two week and monthly silicone hydrogel space at 74% of sales versus the market at 79%. So we anticipate a very nice growth for many years to come.","Regarding our silicone hydrogel one day lenses Clariti and MyDay, they combined to grow 52% in constant currency. We remain very optimistic about these products and are committed to our growth strategy which includes a two-tier approach with Clariti positioned as the mass market offering and MyDay as a premium offering. Remember, the biggest driver in the contact lens market is the one day growth and we strongly believe we have the best product offering in the space as the only company with premium and mass-market lenses including a full portfolio of one day silicone hydrogel sphere, toric and multifocal lenses.","Before finishing with market data let me make a quick comment on integration matters. We continue to finalize our Sauflon integration activities and we're very close to being done. You will note, CooperVision had a have very small non-GAAP adjustment this quarter or smaller non-GAAP adjustment this quarter of roughly $9 million excluding amortization. We forecast similar charges in Q3 and Q4, mostly within cost of goods, but we should end this fiscal year.","Now let me comment on the overall contact lens market and remember this information is on the last page of earnings release. For calendar Q1, we continue taking shares growing 9% with the market up 3%. Geographically, CooperVision grew 9% in the Americas, while the market was flat. In Asia Pacific, CooperVision grew 14% with the market up 5% and in EMEA we grew 6% in line with the market. On a modality basis, single use lenses continued driving growth and with CVI up 14% and the market up 9%. For non-single use lenses we grew 6% while the market declined 1%. We also see - as you can see, our growth remains diverse and strong.","On the trailing 12 month basis CooperVision grew 8% and the market grew 5%. Going forward I expect the market to continue growing 4% to 6% over the next five years and most likely closer to 6%. The drivers will continue to be the shift to dailies', geographic expansion and an expansion of the wearer base. We expect to continue taking market share led by our strong silicone hydrogel portfolio.","Moving to CooperSurgical, we reported second quarter revenues of $93 million, up 23% year-over-year or up 6% pro forma. Our fertility products led the way up 60% or 8% pro forma and our office and surgical products grew 5%. We continued executing on several initiatives which are driving success including transitioning to a geographic sales model, adding sales representatives in underpenetrated areas and increasing our focus on high-growth areas such as IVF and genetic testing. These moves are clearly gaining traction as we saw growth throughout our business in Q2. Going forward I believe we'll continue to see solid growth as business keeps moving into a more aggressive and efficient business model.","Regarding acquisitions, we completed several over the past few months, so let me touch on those and the strategic rationale. At the beginning of April, we added Genesis Genetics, a genetic testing lab company focused on pre-implantation genetic screening and diagnosis using - used during the IVF process. This is a nice addition to our existing genetic testing platform.","At the beginning of May we added complementary IVF capital equipment products through the acquisition of K-Systems a small acquisition with roughly $7 million in revenue per year. And finally we added the assets of Recombine last week. Recombine is a genetic testing company specializing in carrier screening which is a great fit within our IVF and genetic testing franchise as it adds the number one carrier screening test sold to the IVF clinics. As you see - as you can see, we are very focused on combining a full service provider within the IVF global market and we truly believe this strategy will yield success for many years to come. These deals are all incorporated into our updated guidance.","With that let me touch on our guidance details. We are raising our fiscal 2016 revenue guidance for CooperVision to 5.5% to 7% constant currency growth. Our CooperSurgical revenue guidance is also raised to 6% to 8% pro forma growth or up 24% to 27% on an as-reported basis. We're also raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to $8.20 to $8.50.","In conclusion, I am very pleased with our results and remain optimistic about the underlying fundamentals of our business. I believe we're well positioned to deliver solid results for the remainder of the fiscal year and beyond. With that let me express my appreciation to our employees, our number one asset. Their hard work and dedication to creating value is the backbone of our success.","And now I'll turn it over to Greg to cover the financial results.","Greg Matz","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. I will provide an overall summary of our performance including a review of the market and our revenue picture. I am going to focus primarily on our non-GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAAP numbers please refer to our earnings release.","Looking at gross margins, in Q2 the non-GAAP gross margin was 63.2% compared to 63.4% in the prior year. Although CooperVision had positives from currency and strong Biofinity sales, it\u2019s margin was lower than expected. The primary items driving this were a negative margin impact from stronger Asia Pac sales where we have higher one day sales and charges associated with idle equipment and legacy hydrogel inventory.","Regarding these last two items, let me cover them separately. We have made a lot of progress improving our manufacturing operations including some very recent successes. For competitive reasons I won't get into specifics, but our production per line has increased materially resulting in lower cost per unit and a lesser need for future CapEx. This has resulted in idling some equipment which hurt us in Q2 and will also negatively impact Q3 and Q4. We anticipate this being a short-term negative as we will grow into this production over time.","The other item is our legacy hydrogel inventory where we wrote off more than we planned as our silicone hydrogel sales were very strong and we're forecasting that to continue. This hurts us in Q2 and we expect it will negatively impact Q3 and Q4. To be clear, we're not excluding these items from earnings, so they are negatively impacting our non-GAAP earnings per share.","CooperVision on a non-GAAP basis reported gross margin of 62.8% versus 63.3% in Q2 of last year. The factors which impacted margin were the items I just mentioned. CooperSurgical had non-GAAP gross margin of 64.8% which compares to Q2 '15 of 63.5%. Strength in the OB\/GYN and IVF product families drove this quarter's margin.","SG&A, on a non-GAAP basis, SG&A increased approximately 6% to $171.6 million or 35% of revenue, down from approximately 37% of revenue the prior year. Primary driver behind this leverage was strong SG&A controls.","Now looking at R&D, in Q2, R&D on a non-GAAP basis was $16.6 million or 3.4% of revenue, flat in dollars and down from 3.8% of revenue in the prior year. We are seeing investment in CSI offset by synergies from the Sauflon acquisition in CVI.","Now, moving to operating margins. For Q2, consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $89.8 million and 18.6% of revenue versus $71 million and 16.3% of revenue in Q2 last year. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $117.6 million and 24.3% of revenue versus $96.7 million and 22.2% of revenue for the prior year. Primary difference in operating margin year-over-year is the operating expense leverage.","In Q2, CooperVision\u2019s non-GAAP operating income and margin were $102.4 million and 26.2% of revenue versus $88.8 million and 24.7% of revenue in the prior year. CooperSurgical's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $26.6 million and 28.8% of revenue versus Q2 15 of $18.8 million of operating income and 25% of revenue.","Moving on to depreciation and amortization, in Q2, depreciation was $33.7 million, up $1.5 million year-over-year. Amortization was $14.3 million, up $2 million, reflecting our recent acquisition activity. Interest expense was $7.6 million for the quarter, up $2.9 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher debt and interest rates associated with acquisitions.","Looking at the effective tax rate, in Q2, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 9.4% versus a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 8.4% in Q2 15. Earnings per share, our Q2 earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was $1.52 and $2.05 respectively versus $1.23 and $1.72 for GAAP and non-GAAP in the prior year. Non-GAAP earnings per share on a pro forma basis, which adjusts for currency and acquisitions, grew approximately 13% in the quarter.","Now, looking at FX, net currency impact on earnings per share year-over-year for Q2 was a favorable $0.10.","Moving onto the balance sheet. In Q2, we had cash provided by operations of $97.8 million, plus capital expenditures of $41.1 million, resulting in $56.7 million of free cash flow. Excluding integration costs of $9 million, adjusted free cash flow was $65.7 million. Total debt increased within the quarter by $64.1 million to $1,441.4 million, primarily due to higher average cash balances and acquisitions, partially offset by operational cash flow.","Inventories increased from last quarter, approximately $2.7 million to $433.6 million. This is entirely driven by CSI acquisitions. In CooperVision, we saw inventories decline as growth in silicon daily inventory to support our product launches was offset by a reduction in our hydrogel inventory. For the quarter, we\u2019re seeing months on hand at seven months. Days sales outstanding is at 54 days, which is down three days from the prior quarter and two days from last year.","Now, turning to guidance. For our main currencies, we are using 1.10 for the euro, 1.12 for the yen and 1.46 for the pound. The consolidated revenue range is being raised to $1.929 billion to $1.960 billion or approximately 5.5% to 7% pro forma growth. CooperVision\u2019s revenue range is being raised to $1.545 billion to $1.567 billion or roughly 5.5% to 7% constant currency growth. CooperSurgical's revenue range is being raised to $384 million to $393 million or roughly 6% to 8% pro forma growth. Note that roughly half of the increase in guidance is from currency, while the other half is primarily from acquisitions.","We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be around 63% for the year. This is a reduction from the previous guidance of around 64% as it incorporates the CooperVision items I mentioned earlier, along with lower gross margins from CooperSurgical associated with recent acquisitions. Having said that, we still expect improving Q3 and Q4 gross margins of around 64% each quarter.","OpEx is expected to be around 39%. Operating margins, still expecting to be around 24%. Interest expense is expected to be around $28 million. Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 8%. Our expected share count will be around 49.1 million shares and our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $0.20 higher on the top and bottom of our range to $8.20 to $8.50, which equates to a pro forma earnings per share of 10% to 14% growth.","From our last guidance, currency is roughly a $0.40 positive and we have actually improved our operational performance by roughly $0.10, but we are expecting the idle legacy inventory write-offs to negatively impact this by roughly $0.30. CapEx is expected to be around $200 million as we finish paying for equipment we have ordered over the prior year and thus adjusted free cash flow is still expected to be around $300 million.","With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session.","Kim Duncan","Operator, we're ready to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Matthew O'Brien","Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just one for Bob and then one for Greg. On the increase in CVI, I guess the question is to Bob, increase to CVI\u2019s outlook for the year. Can you just give us a sense for how much of that is coming from improved manufacturing of MyDay, especially launching into Japan or just disruptions in the market that you're seeing? And then how much are you incorporating the J&J launch as far as somewhat of a headwind into your fiscal Q4? And then for Greg, this is typically a really strong free cash flow quarter for you guys, you\u2019re just sticking with the $300 million outlook for the year, so can you just help us reconcile the little bit of a softness that we saw here in Q2 versus that outlook for the year?","Bob Weiss","Yes. The foreign exchange, as Greg indicated, is a big driver of the topline overall improvement. In terms of the constant currency growth, you are correct, there is a modest - in the guidance, there is a modest deceleration compared to what we had previously forecasted to anticipate if you will some impact of the J&J rollout. Beyond that, it\u2019s pretty much in the same range at the 5.5% to 7%. So modest at both. MyDay impact in Japan is, once again, we just rolled that product out in March of this year, so fairly minimal impact in terms of the overall any update on the guidance if you will. And of course we already knew about MyDay in Japan in our previous March guidance.","Greg Matz","Yes. Matt, on the free cash flow, nothing really jumps out. The number isn\u2019t that far off of the prior year and we did have a much stronger Q1. So as you look at kind of halfway through the year, we\u2019re actually probably ahead of where we were last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeff Johnson","Sorry about that, guys. Can you hear me, okay?","Bob Weiss","We can.","Jeff Johnson","All right, great. So Bob, let me ask you one question and then I have a modelling question for Greg as well. But the question for you, just on the Biofinity and Avaira business, obviously that bounced back very nicely this quarter. I think you said 14% constant currency in the quarter year-over-year. 7% last quarter, so kind of averaging right around double digits, is that how we should think about that business going forward? Obviously, you\u2019ve got the launch coming from J&J that was referenced in the prior question. You also have Ultra kind of gaining some traction it sounds like. So just how do you think about that Biofinity and Avaira bucket over the next couple of years?","Bob Weiss","Yes. I think taking the two quarters, the 7 and 13 being in around low double-digit is the right way to think about it.","Jeff Johnson","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And Greg, a question for you. I think at the very end, you just said $0.20 is the EPS impact of the inventory write-off and that is included in your non-GAAP EPS guidance, is that correct?","Greg Matz","Yes.","Jeff Johnson","Okay. So for next year, we should be thinking about adding just kind of building off a base of $0.30 higher, assuming you\u2019re not going to have those kind of write-offs next year. Would that be the fair way to take kind of this year\u2019s EPS, add $0.30 back and build that off as our base assumption going into next year?","Greg Matz","Yes, Jeff, it's probably a little early to get into next year's guidance, which we would come out later in the year and discuss.","Bob Weiss","And keep in mind, Jeff that it\u2019s a balance between - some of that is write-off as Greg indicated, some of it is idle equipment as we grow into it. So we\u2019re growing, given the substantial growth of our one-day modality and our unit growth, we\u2019re anticipating that we\u2019ll start consuming more and more of that as each quarter goes by. But that $30 million overall is both write-off as well as idle.","Greg Matz","Yes. And Jeff, just to build on that a little bit, I think without giving guidance, I think we feel comfortable that we would see gross margins improve year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch","Hi, can you hear me, okay?","Bob Weiss","We can.","Joanne Wuensch","Wonderful. I think what a couple of people are trying to get at and I know in speaking with investors, the big concern right now is the J&J monthly launch starting at the end of June, beginning of July, how do you think about that product launch and how do we get comfortable that we're not going to see a similar hiccup to what happened last fall?","Bob Weiss","Well, without knowing exactly what J&J is up to, well, in hindsight, we know what they did is they filled the pipeline a lot and then we sought their negative US results in the most recent quarter. So no one is saying they can't do that again. Having said that, this is a product coming in to the monthly modality. It\u2019s basically coming in with only a fear not at all in multifocal. So it\u2019s not a family of products going against a family of products. And that is a big distinction as contrasted to the pipeline dragging everything in under one umbrella as they did their whole family of products and going after a Sphere. In that case, it was always one day going against total one primarily in that space, but it consumed - it took all the year out of the practitioners office if you will, or filled up all the space and there clearly is no guarantee they wouldn't try sliding the market again.","As far as the way we think about it longer term, Biofinity is a very established product, wherein we continue to expand the offerings under that umbrella. It's a very global product and it\u2019s one where, it\u2019s fit in the monthly and we also have a very splashed vitality coming out in the two-week, which is the sweet spot of the market in terms of the number of wares. There are more wares in the two-week part of the market than there are in the monthly.","Quite frankly, as some of you know, I always tend to do that, it's a good strategy for J&J if they are intent on treating up and basically migrating the non-compliant ware base they have in the two-week space into a complaint monthly modality that would be a good trade up in modalities, because they are non-compliant where is one who is basically only using 24 lenses a year compared to a monthly using 24 and conversely they are getting the price point of a two-week wear, and that\u2019s pretty big part of that two-week modality. So we think we will continue to see that market growth monthly and we will get our fair share of Biofinity. In the meantime, we will be more active down the road in the two-week space, and we are basically neutralized for the most part.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Willoughby","Hey, great, can you hear me okay?","Bob Weiss","We can, Steve.","Steve Willoughby","Okay, Bob. Just regarding the charge or the idle equipment and inventory write-off that you guys took in the quarter, couple of questions regarding that. I guess first the idle equipment, is that - the idle equipment charge relate to newly purchased equipment that you don\u2019t need quite yet or is that existing equipment that you\u2019re idling for some reason?","Bob Weiss","Yes, so to qualify as idle, it\u2019s basically been put in production and then is taken out of production. So I will answer the question with a little color. It could be very new equipment that was put in production, example our facility in Hungary where they got real good at making it and all of a sudden, we parked the equipment because some many - so much product was coming off of the other line. So as yields go up and costs are coming down, that\u2019s good news. The bad news is, if you put equipment that you are using and you idle it, it becomes a direct period charge as opposed to moving through with the inventory.","Steve Willoughby","This is sort of what happened with Avaira and then Gen II lines a number of years ago?","Bob Weiss","Absolutely.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. And --.","Bob Weiss","So what happened is our manufacturing people got very good at what they were doing. We always knew that if we - that they would deliver. We just didn\u2019t know how well they would deliver. So delivering a lot more units per dollar spent on capital, that\u2019s the good news, but it also turned short-term into the bad news. As I think Greg indicated, we will grow out of that fairly quickly when you look at the rapid unit growth in many of these areas where we have become very efficient, and that includes MyDay, that includes Biofinity, that includes Avaira, that includes Vitality and that includes Clariti in the bucket. All of those products became - the costs are going down through efficiencies and yields by our manufacturing people.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lawrence Keusch with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is actually John in for Lawry, good afternoon. I just had a quick question, I guess, what\u2019s the right way to calibrate expectations from MyDay in Japan? You obviously just launched in the quarter, but maybe shorter term and then maybe a little bit longer term in 2016 and 2017?","Bob Weiss","Well, you can see some of the numbers we\u2019re putting up in the region, and Japan has certainly been stellar within that region also. Right now, we have a good portfolio of three products with MyDay being the third one in, but Biofinity is doing very well, ProClear 1 day is doing very well, as well now MyDay. We will be - we are only a month and a half into the launch if you will through the end of April and very pleased with the progress we are making. It\u2019s the biggest market by far in terms of the 1 day modality over any place in the world, and therefore, MyDay is a very good fit in a very good market, and we think that the combination of MyDay as a silicon hydrogel and ProClear 1 day as a hydrogel will be - is a good entr\u00e9e into that market.","Also in the phase, Japan has been historically pretty lethargic the last I want to say 7, 8 years, it\u2019s showing a little bit more life than it has, and the only reason it\u2019s been lethargic is because it grew so rapidly in the prior decade compared to this decade. It got ahead of itself on the 1 day modality became the first to adopt that because they were very anti-lens care regimens and wanted the lenses to be boiled and therefore everyone migrated into the 1 day modality rather than boiling lenses every day. So I will just say that, we are pretty excited about MyDay there. It\u2019s going to take some work. It\u2019s only a sphere thus far, so there will be other plans relative to how to leverage the MyDay experience.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Mishan with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Matt Mishan","Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. Bob, first on CooperVision, I just want to better understand the sequential improvement in growth this quarter versus the previous several quarters, is it your sense of the impact of the Johnson & Johnson launch has now fully waned or is there something that you have been doing to improve your results and to improve share? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of whether or not this is Johnson & Johnson or this is you guys doing something?","Bob Weiss","So I think it\u2019s a combination. I think the air that left the room is now back in the room of the eye care professional, he has room for products and so it\u2019s more normalized in that sense, and that\u2019s obvious from the weak numbers that J&J put up domestically and now Alcon put up numbers worldwide. We relative to our products I think I will make a point in saying that our numbers that we put up is not a function of any pricing or anything to do with channel fill. So it\u2019s a good quarter. The inventory on hand at distributors and the pipeline is very normalized, in fact it\u2019s a little less than it was at the beginning of the period. So it\u2019s a reflection of pretty solid numbers around the world.","Operator","Our next question comes the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Brian Weinstein","Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. It\u2019s a little bit of a longer question. But can you talk about what you expect longer term in terms of the split between Clariti and MyDay, and kind of what you think your share longer term is there? And then how do you think about manufacturing - manufacturer pricing levels in the daily silicon hydrogel market longer term? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","So I think the split between Clariti and MyDay, it\u2019s easier to relate in the US. The US is going to be primarily where Clariti is after the mass market and MyDay is after the premium market. I would have normally said - think of that as like a three - 75% mass market, 25% premium market. And I think that\u2019s the US portion of the model. I think when you get into certain regions in the world, example Japan, where only MyDay is playing then - so if you\u2019re factoring that into the overall global results, you will end up what MyDay outgrowing because it\u2019s coming off of a lower base and it\u2019s just getting into Japan at least for the foreseeable future outgrowing as a percent getting more of its share of the bucket. So instead of saying 75-25, MyDay may move up that spectrum and get a higher portion in the interim. When Clariti is available throughout Asia-Pac and around the world that may come back more into the mass market premium split. But for now, one point is we are not capacity constraint on either of these products. We will continue in the case of MyDay expanding the portfolio offering. So that will help. Right now, with Sphere competing with Clariti, which has a Sphere, a multifocal and a toric and that will weigh more towards the Clariti piece.","Relative to margins, we will continue to focus in from a pricing point of view being keenly aware of that two tiered market, the premium market, which we will call the players there as in the US clearly Total1, Oasis and MyDay and TruEye is the other one that\u2019s kind of there in that space, but Oasis will consume more and more of TruEye. And in the mass market then Clariti remains the only game in town relative to a silicon hydrogel in the 1 day mass market. So then it\u2019s a function of watching the migration of hydrogels into the silicon hydrogel space in that mass market arena.","Cost of goods, gross margins, we expect - as we have indicated in the past to have our 1 day silicon hydrogel franchise and most notably Clariti, not a drag on our overall gross margin. For the next several years anyway, MyDay is ramping up the learning curve moving very nicely and I would say, the indicator of some of the idling and the indicator of us having enough MyDay capacity is just how well that\u2019s ramping up as it ramps up cost of goods come down to the yields and efficiencies. So we are very pleased with that and we expect more than - currently more than 50% out of MyDay as we get down the road a couple of years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","David Roman","Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. I was hoping you could just touch on in a little bit more detail, firstly the strength in Asia-Pacific, I think last quarter you had kind of said that your ramping capacity in Japan, that wouldn\u2019t be a significant contributor to much later part of the year and into the next fiscal year. But any other regions driving within Asia-Pac that you could call out? And then secondly, on the 6% to 8% pro forma guidance for CSI, that is quite a bit above where those end-markets I think are growing, so maybe you could just speak to the sustainability of that on a go-forward basis.","Bob Weiss","So relative to Asia-Pac, I would emphasize that the numbers you see are very little to do with MyDay. It\u2019s very early in the game, so it didn\u2019t - so the strength you\u2019re seeing there is just how well some of the geographic expansion is going, how well Japan is going ex-MyDay and then the MyDay launch. But it is not the driver of that 18%, which - and MyDay was only launched mid-March, so really it\u2019s only got a month and a half in Japan in that period, in the quarter.","Relative to what to expect in that region, we certainly expect continued robust numbers out of Asia-Pac for the foreseeable future. Number one, we are under-indexed; number two, we are delivering a lot of these new products, Clariti coming into more and more of Asia-Pac and of course MyDay, which we talked about. So we are pretty optimistic that we will see continued strength in that market.","Relative to surgical and 6% to 8%, a lot of that growth is a reflection of, number one, the emphasis on really selling the product and the global realignment with the selling effort. We have some obviously even some good products in the surgical side that are driving organic growth there. The acquisitions we made are the expectation there, clearly is double-digit in many of those acquisitions. So we expect to drive a lot of the genetic testing and surround the IVF process so that we are the key player that the IVF centers are engaging with and we're pretty optimistic about that and obviously the last two quarters have indicated, it\u2019s a pretty successful strategy. Going forward, the 6 to 8 reflects some of the more recent acquisitions having more organic topline growth potential than our historic legacy products within CooperSurgical.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Larry Biegelsen","Hey, Greg based on the guidance, is the second half implied CooperVision guidance, the midpoint about 5% and should we think about Q3 and Q4 as similar growth or would you expect Q4 to potentially be lower because the J&J launch in July? And Greg can you just tell us what the FX assumption is, it looks like you're assuming about for the year zero impact on EPS is that math right, what is it on sales and is there some conservatism in your FX assumptions right now, thanks for taking the questions guys.","Greg Matz","Larry, I think on the - for CVI, the midpoint kind of growth for Q3\/Q4 would be about 6.1%; I think is if you do the math. If you look at - from a seasonality, we\u2019re not giving quarterly seasonality but I think you can look at path seasonality for CooperVision, it generally is fairly consistent. On the FX front, yeah, I think you got that right, when you look at FX, we basically for the year see about no impact on the earnings per share. On the revenue front, again you're looking at about right around $30 million, revenue reduction. Now on the rates, are we being conservative? Well, if you look at today's rates, I think you could say we\u2019re being conservative; we did use the rates for euro of 1.10, the pound at 1.46 and the yen at 1.12. And we started setting those rates a couple of days ago, the yen was at 1 point - was at 111.3. So the yen is kind of - has basically strengthened the last couple of days but those are the rates that the model is based on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, this is Andrew in from Mike, thanks for taking the question. I have two questions, the first being product specific and the second regarding the market. So can you talk about, Bob, the slight design changes to the Clariti lens and what you're seeing in a way of market adoption with this design versus before the change?","Bob Weiss","Sure, you want to ask the second?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, I could ask the second. The second is around UPP, so the US market growth in the quarter was probably the lowest in a while I believe and I was just wondering whether or not this is a result of some pricing war that\u2019s going on within the market and just your general thoughts around UPP and how you think that might benefit you moving forward? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Sure, product relative to the enhancements that we made to Clariti, I think you\u2019ve seen the overall silicon hydrogel sale one-day numbers were 52% growth. So suffice it to say the enhancement as well as of course we had some activity in the fourth quarter regarding our integration process in Europe that caused some bumps then, but suffice it to say we\u2019re running on all cylinders now with Clariti in the marketplace and the enhancement has certainly been beneficial in that process. As far as UPP and the market, 3% growth in the market is much as anything is probably much more influenced by the J&J cycle that they put the market through with a strong market two quarters ago. And that followed by basically a void in the US in this quarter.","So we are not for that would be more normalized. The trailing four quarters is a much better gauge that is approaching 5% worldwide. Relative to the US and UPP and whether or not there is any pricing post UPP or a decline in pricing, I would say that certainly I know that some vendors may have or retailers may have altered J&J prices but by and large the market has continued to drive itself the way it has in the past, pricing is not really a factor it's all about trading up and shelf space and first fits and it remains that way. The focus on getting a new fit in the marketplace or where you have a new product, trying to get a conversion onto your products. There is a fair amount stickiness to most of these products, so I would say the real driver of your product doing well is the new fit arena is a big contributor. Pricing to me this market has traded up for 30 years and it continues to do a phenomenal job. And over that 30 years there has been but maybe one or two price skirmishes. UPP was a fairly shallow attempt at a marketing strategy that was obviously beneficial to the independent compared to the retailers whether or not it was worth anything can be continued to be debated, there is obviously a lot of emotion on both sides of the table on that in the marketplace. But if UPP went away tomorrow, it would not be the end of the world, if it stays where it is, it's okay also. So I don't see it as a material catalyst one way or the other in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks and good afternoon, maybe one for Bob on Japan and then one for Greg on margins. On Japan, can you maybe give us a recap of the size of the daily market in Japan and maybe where Cooper share is today and how MyDay can benefit that going forward? And then for Greg, just a quick one of margins, I believe the Ciba royalty does role off internationally toward the end of this year, I just want to confirm if that is the case and what you expect the margin benefit from that will be? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Yes, the overall market in Japan is around $1.2 billion at the current exchange rate, would have been a lot bigger than that but obviously the yen kept sliding against the dollar for a number of years. Of that $1.2 billion basically two thirds, over 60% is in the one-day modality. And our share in that market is still very under-indexed in that market, so our overall market share worldwide this most recent quarter 23% worldwide, we are well in the mid-teens at best in Japan in that space.","Greg Matz","Anthony, this is Greg, so on the Ciba royalty it did role off within the quarter, we are not really providing any kind of color on the rate itself. Again, we talked about that over the last couple of years that we have obligations in not disclosing that rate and so from that perspective we probably can't share that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Jon Block","Maybe first one Bob, just CBI was strong and one of the better results since 2014 but to be fair, if you go back then we were sort of hit after that with a series of quarters were there was inventory drawdown that went against the company. So, I just want to make sure and ask if you would sort of your level of confidence that this sell-in if you would in this particular quarter totaled the sellout and demand.","Bob Weiss","Yes, I think I mentioned a comment a while ago that relative to the quality of *was pricing or any pricing influencing or was pipeline influencing the answer is no, in fact our pipeline, the inventory on hand was slightly better than at the beginning of the period in both cases kind of where we wanted. So, the drawdown, the inventory drawdown or the pipeline is where we wanted.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer and Company. Your line is now open.","Steven Lichtman","Thank you. Hi guys, most of my questions have been answered, one follow-up on CSI. Bob, do you anticipate continuing to add to the portfolio through tuck-in M&A or you feeling that the portfolio is where you wanted to be at this point?","Bob Weiss","Well, we won\u2019t obviously get into a lot of color on what's in the pipeline but suffice it to say we are focused in on rounding out the portfolio in front of the IVF centers, it is a boutique area where there are little things out there to continue to buy up and so don't be surprised if we don\u2019t continue to have some acquisitions on a go-forward basis.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session; I'd like to turn the call back to Bob Weiss for closing remarks.","Bob Weiss","Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us, hopefully everyone is excited about our quarterly results as we are pleased about them. Not only are we pleased where we\u2019ve been but very optimistic about where we\u2019re going as I think you would see from the guidance that Greg talked to. Yes, we have some short-term challenges with idle capacity, it\u2019s a silver lining problem because it means that to some degree our capital requirements go on a go-forward basis will be somewhat less certainly than they have been in the past. So we look forward to updating you on our continued progress on our next quarterly call which is September 1 I believe.

Good afternoon, good evening everyone. After a successful 2011 we started 2012 out strong. Our Biofinity and Proclear momentum continued for the first quarter of 2012 we put up solid top line growth plus 11% also in constant currency. We delivered $326 million in revenue, our gross profit margin achieved 65% with the strong top line, solid margins, lower interest expense non-GAAP earnings per share was up 32% to $1.12, 35% on a GAAP basis.","The soft contact lens market rebounded in calendar year fourth quarter to 5% growth to provision at 7%. Key takeaways from today\u2019s call we again put up great results with strong revenue growth, good margins, favorable impact from lowering interest expense with solid bottom line. Biofinity global rollout continues with Biofinity Sphere in Japan and Biofinity Multifocal in the United States and Europe. This work horse sealed 40% constant currency growth in our silicone hydrogel family Biofinity and Avaira.","During the quarter, given the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow $200 million on an annualized basis we announced the share repurchase program of up to $150 million. We in fact executed on part of the plan buying 666,000 shares for $46 million in a transaction that was $0.01 accretive for the quarter and will be $0.05 accretive for the fiscal year. While we continue to put up solid results and free cash flow we continue to invest. Our sales force expansion, marketing and R&D expenses are up in the 17% to 18% range.","For competitive reasons, we won\u2019t give the exact numbers, but our sales force expansion is 22% in the past 15 months and overall 36% in the past two and a quarter year. During the same two and a quarter year period our G&A headcount is up only 11% so we are leveraging what we need to leverage. There were no callouts GAAP numbers equal non-GAAP numbers for the quarter.","Nothing major with the FDA on Avaira Toric, we have ongoing dialogue with them and still hoping to relaunch our Avaira Toric beyond April of this year. We made the decision to launch a single use single silicon hydrogel this year and will be began manufacturing shortly. For competitive reasons I won\u2019t provide any more at this time.","Our silicon hydrogel family is driving our growth. During the first quarter the family achieved $87 million in revenues that equates to 40% constant currency increase versus the prior year. Silicon hydrogel is now 32% of our CDI revenues. We continue to feel positive about future of our silicon hydrogel sales driven by multiple factors this includes success of Biofinity Multifocal launch and $150 million silicon hydrogel multifocal market and the launch of Biofinity Sphere in Japan\u2019s $400 million silicon hydrogel market.","While we are early in both the successes are obvious. We continue to manufacture the Avaira Toric product and are hoping for the April relaunch as I indicated. Once this happens we will be lot more aggressive with our Avaira family in the two week space, which is dominated by J&J. But back to Biofinity the shear strength of this family of monthly silicon hydrogel Spheres, Torics and Multifocal remains a source of pride. Biofinity has a long way to go before fully exploiting here on a global basis that\u2019s in terms of years. It is and remains prior calling card of our expanding CooperVision sales force.","Geographically, foreign exchange movements have netted out during the most recent quarter while CooperVision revenue, for CooperVision Inc revenue growth was 10% actual and 10% constant currency. Regionally we had solid results in constant currency with Americas up 11%, Europe up 7%, Asia Pac up 13% and overall once again constant currency 10%.","Our growth drivers were in the Americas trading up to silicon hydrogel including the success of Biofinity Multifocal, as well as solid performance in the 1 Day category by Proclear 1 Day Sphere. In Europe, essential the same thing trading up to silicon hydrogel including Biofinity Multifocal as well as Proclear 1 Day Sphere. And in Asia Pac success reflects the growth of silicon hydrogel primarily or particularly the Biofinity Sphere in Japan as we as the Proclear 1 Day Sphere throughout the region.","The soft contact lens market was up 5% while CooperVision was up 7% during the most recent quarter. This brings the full calendar year in at 4% for the market while Cooper on the strength of silicon hydrogel and Proclear 1 Day grew 7%, 1.5 times to the market.","For the calendar year the market growth was in silicon hydrogel 1 Day or in silicon hydrogel 1 Day or single use lenses as well as specialty lenses, Torics and Multifocal. Remember in more established regions of the world the market is a trade up market. We trade you up to silicon hydrogel, which is roughly 20% to 40% trade up and trading you up into 1 Days, which at the manufacturer level is roughly 4 to 6 times the amount of average revenue per wear at the manufacturer level.","Worldwide Torics and Multifocal lenses continue to grow solidly. These are much less penetrated typically outside of the U.S. geographically each region had a respectable year with the Americas and Asia delivering 4% growth while Europe rounded up to 5%.","CooperSurgical our women\u2019s healthcare franchise had another greater quarter with $57 million in revenue it was up 15%, 9% excluding acquisitions. Drivers continue to be surgical procedures, hospital and same day surgery where revenue was up 24% and now accounts for 40% of CooperSurgical.","Devices used by the gynecologist during laparoscopic procedures such as closure systems retractors; injectors, uterine manipulator and related trade are driving the growth in this area. Importantly, these are high margin items and CooperSurgical\u2019s overall gross margin percent during the quarter was a very impressive 67%, while its operating income hit 27%. To say we are pleased and proud of our CooperSurgical franchise would be an understatement. We will continue to look for the ways to leverage franchise both in the United States as well through geographic expansion.","Importantly CooperSurgical is an integral part of our global tax structure it allows us the luxury of continuing to report and pay at a low effective tax rate. Without it we disrupt our global tax balance, which to us in keeping with our objective to maximize total shareholder returns or PSR is strategic. Simply put any money that goes to the government is not available for reinvestment or to pay dividends.","We generated, we are generally sticking to our guidance range except for the increase in earnings per share guidance. As Greg will get into further, we delivered strong results in Q1 with a favorable tax settlement outcome offsetting some negative cost associated with the Avaira recall. These costs impacted sales and operating expenses. Strong bottom line results in Q1 and the accretive effect of our stock buyback are contributing to the overall improvement in our earnings per share guidance.","Our guidance to soon stable foreign exchange rates, the ongoing investment in sales force, R&D and geographic expansion. We also anticipate some drag on our gross and operating margins as we accelerate investments in China and other developing countries and launch single use silicon hydrogel and re-launch Avaira Toric later in the fiscal year.","On strategy we are continuing with our successful strategy. We believe it is solid and it has delivered results. CooperSurgical is putting up outstanding results and its leveraging its infrastructure. This franchise was built on a solid understanding of the value of critical mass and in women\u2019s healthcare market targeting the OB\/GYN. We follow the profession wherever they go office, surgery center, hospital or IVS Centers. Although the call points are different for each the leverage is considerable.","CooperSurgical\u2019s Q1 \u201912 gross margin was 67%, our operating margin 27% and due to minimal CapEx CooperSurgical is a significant contributor to free cash flow. We are dedicated to this strategy and we will continue talking acquisitions to leverage the CooperSurgical infrastructure.","At CooperVision the strategy is more complex and it\u2019s much more global in nature. And the $6.9 billion soft contact lens industry because of the uniqueness of our manufacturing platforms and product portfolio, we are the only participant that promotes both silicon hydrogel and non-silicon hydrogel that is the Proclear family. We emphasize branded and non-branded products. But private label does not mean lower gross margin or low price.","Actively we promote both special, actively we promote and specialize in custom lenses it\u2019s a high gross profit of course. We support all modalities that the eye care profession prescribes 1 Day, two week and monthly lenses and we support all types of lenses Spheres, Torics and Multifocals. We are close to 30% in high growth specialty lens categories Torics and Multifocals. It is acknowledged by the eye care professional that we are pretty good at specialty contact lenses.","Few would challenge why the success of Biofinity Toric for astigmatism. Put a great design together with a great material and great things can happen. We've seen early successes for the same reason with Biofinity Multifocal, which hit the market in the middle of last year.","On the capacity front, with the exception of Avaira Toric, we are ahead of plan to deliver considerably more products, where we have previously been supply constrained. The Biofinity family, Proclear 1 Day, our 1 Day Torics are all ramping up nicely. On pricing, we like the rest of the soft contact lens industry have a trade of strategy. Our new wears and existing wears are targeted for silicone hydrogel and Proclear family and the 1 Day or single use lenses each creates more revenue per patient.","The 1 Day modality, for example, results in four to six times more revenue per wearer. While this strategy sacrifices the gross margin percent. It generally creates three to five times more profit per wearer. Of course, this strategy competes head on with the lens care space, since we are shifting wearers' resources from lens care to contact lenses only. Competing for lens care dollars is more of a problem for some of our competitors.","In my opinion we needed to be the most focused company in the industry lacking many of the distractions that all of our competitors are now going through. I might add with Biofinity, Avaira and Proclear, we have a lot to talk about with our eye care professionals around the globe.","As we look down the road the next several years we expect to continue improving operating margins and delivering above average TSRs. We expect to continue to deliver double digit earnings per share growth while investing in geographic expansion, sales force expansion and new product development. In today\u2019s market, we have a solid product portfolio to leverage in all modalities multiple materials, all lens types and we retain our expertise to emphasize custom lens for the 10% to 20% of lens wearers, who require other than standard lenses and a more unique sizes and designs.","We have a lot of work to do before we come close to having exploited our number one contact lens family Biofinity. This is particularly true when it comes to geographic expansion and fully developing its family of Torics and Multifocals around the world. The same applies to Avaira where Avaira Sphere thanks for your waiting the re-launch of Avaira Toric. The combination will put us in much better position to exploit the U.S. two week space owned by J&J and to also exploit our private label strategy more aggressively with this family.","While we are already pretty respectable when it comes to gross margins and operating income margins from a cost perspective, we have considerable upside yet to be fully developed. Upsides include the elimination of silicon hydrogel royalty in September 2012 I\u2019m sorry 2014 in the U.S. and March 2016 in the rest of the world. The reduction of our manufacturing costs by getting alcohol and our silicon hydrogel production, improving molding cycle times, increasing capacity utilization and improving yields in general.","Given the considerable amount of free cash flow we generate we will continue to look for tuck in acquisitions in geographic expansion opportunities. In our two businesses that exceed our hurdle rates. Given the fact that the markets for women\u2019s healthcare and soft contact lenses are so much less developed outside U.S. and we generate a considerable amount of cash outside the U.S. due in part to our level manufacturing outside the U.S. We will continue to aggressive invest in global expansion opportunities. With over 95% of the people on the planet outside of the United States we believe we will find opportunities to invest, there for decades to come thereby retaining our lower effective tax rate and definitely. And as was the case in the past quarter where the stock was suppressed we even demonstrated we are willing to buy in some of our own stock at times.","In summary, before I turn it over to Greg the first quarter 2012 got us off on the right foot. We are having another in a string successful fiscal years in 2012. We again deliver the solid top line gross profit percent, operating income percent, earnings per share, free cash flow and even a stock buyback to enhance total shareholder returns. Our silicon hydrogel family even in the middle of a recall continues to perform delivering 40% constant currency growth above already respectable prior year comparisons.","While we accomplished a lot we have a long way to go before we fully exploit our silicon hydrogel family and our excellent 1 Day Proclear 1 Day. Japan\u2019s silicon hydrogel market breaks geographical expansion a large rapidly growing silicon hydrogel multifocal market, a royalty expiration starting in 2014 a very leverage able CooperSurgical with ongoing tuck in opportunities and many, many more global opportunity signaled we have many opportunities to grow our opening business and maximize TSR. Whether the soft contact lens market accelerate 6% to 8% range or pumps along at 4% to 5% we clearly see the opportunity.","Finally, I remind you our people are our number one asset. They have continued to deliver as a quality of life company. We remain focused on keeping our employees and their family healthy and productive. To them once again I say thank you for all that they\u2019ve done and continue to do with that I will turn it over to Greg.","Greg Matz","Okay, thanks Bob and good afternoon everyone. Bob has given you a pretty thorough view of our revenue picture so let me start with gross margin. But before I go there I want to provide some color on the Avaira recall expenses in Q1. By the end of Q4 we had accrued for about $20million of recall cost.","In Q1 we had an additional $2.9 million and what we consider operational cost directly related to the recall, which were split about roughly equally between revenue for things like customer concessions and operating expenses for things like reviewing all Avaira Sphere fitting sets. To ensure that there were no lenses impacted by the recall in the fitting set.","At this point we believe the majority of the costs are behind us but we expect we could have some small charges paid over time and so we have Avaira Toric back in the market. Now looking at gross margins, in Q1, the consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins for 64.5% compared with 60.2% and 60.9% respectively for Q1 last year.","CooperSurgical had a GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit margin of 67%, which compares to Q1 \u201911 64%, this improvement was mainly due to manufacturing efficiencies and favorable product mix especially in our surgical space. Products like closure systems and uterine manipulators to name a couple have done well and they also have better than average gross margins.","CooperVision reported a GAAP gross margin of 64% versus 59.5% in Q1 last year. On a non-GAAP basis gross margin was again 64% versus 60% in Q1 last year. As you can see we had a strong gross margin quarter. The increase was attributable to many different components like the completion of our Norfolk closure effective last year, which contributed over one percentage point or roughly about 120 basis points to 130 basis points to our gross margin. In addition, we had favorable product mix with silicon hydrogel sales now representing 32% of revenue up 39% from last year, up 40% on a constant currency basis.","We also had lower idle costs and favorable manufacturing variances carrying forward into Q1 from last year reflective of our inventory terms. All this being said and looking at the reminder of the year, we believe that our gross margins will be lower than Q1 due to several factors starting with the increased (Inaudible) cost related to modification of some of our production processes related to the recall. In addition, the anticipated relaunch of Avaira Toric startup cost with the new Biofinity line in Puerto Rico coming up in early Q3 and the introduction of a single use silicon lens will also impact gross margins.","We see these latter events as possible for our business in the long-term and as typical it will be drag on margins for manufacturing efficiency type variances in the earlier period. Two, further build on the single use silicon lens our experience is that new material or derivatives of material always plays a steep cost curve as we start production. High volume lines or products that utilize high volume lines are the most susceptible. Our first single use silicon hydrogel is no exception and we expect to be in a situation of higher cost in the short-term as we ramp up production. For these reasons we are staying with our previous gross margin guidance of 62.5% to 63% range for the year.","Now looking at operating expenses, SG&A in Q1 on a GAAP basis SG&A expenses increased by 16% from Q1 last year to $131.7 million and were 40% of revenue versus 39% in Q1 last year. This is generally attributable to the added investment we\u2019ve been discussing over the last year, which has resulted in increased sales and marketing expenses for commissions, new hires associated with generating higher revenue and expenses for new product launches.","We have seen increased selling investment both CooperVision as well as CooperSurgical. Last year we highlighted that we would be investing that investment really did not ramp up until the March April timeframe, which when you look year-over-year leads to some higher expense growth rate. So with our growth rate and SG&A and R&D we will see a run rate impact on spending.","On the R&D front, we have talked about investing in our business and R&D is one of those areas where we continue to make investment. In Q1 on a GAAP basis R&D increased by 17% year-over-year to $11.4 million and it was 3.5% of revenue, up slightly from 3.3% in Q1 \u201911. This increase is mainly attributable to adding staffing in both businesses.","Moving to operating margins, just a reminder we adjusted Q1 2011 for the $6.1 million gain on settlement for pre existing relationship related to the IME acquisition we originally recorded it in Q1 \u201911 and reverse in Q3 \u201911. If your models are based on non-GAAP there should be no change but if you are using GAAP be aware of the change from last year\u2019s Q1 financial statements. And if you need more information on that you can refer to Form 10-K and Note 14 of our financial statements for 2011.","On a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis for Q1 consolidated operating income and margin were $61.7 million or 19% of revenue versus $48.7 million or 17% of revenue in Q1 \u201911 on a GAAP basis and then in Q1 \u201911 on a non-GAAP basis operating income was $50.8 million or 17% of revenue. This represents 27% and a 21% increase in operating income over Q1 \u201911 GAAP and non-GAAP respectively.","Couple of points for your models if you are looking below operating income you will see another income we had roughly 700k of income approximately 200k related to an FX gain compared to a 700k loss last year. And the reminders related to a gain on sale for an investment, which we picked up this part with the IME acquisition last year.","Interest expense that was $3.7 million was $3.3 million or 47% lower than Q1 last year. This reflects reduced borrowings and lower interest rates resulting from refinancing and the redemption of the senior debt beginning in Q2 \u201911. Included in Q1 was additional interest expense associated with repurchasing shares and some non-recurring operational discrete items we expect interest expense in the $12 million to $14 million range for the year.","Move on to effective tax rate on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in Q1 the effective tax rate was 7% versus Q1 \u201911 GAAP of 4.4%, non-GAAP of 6.7%. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past the effective tax rate continues to be below the U.S. statutory rate as majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. This also continues the trend of income earned in foreign jurisdictions increasing as a percent of the total as compared to income earned in the U.S. In addition, we are seeing some foreign jurisdictions dropping their rates.","The Q1 effective tax rate was lower than our 10% to 12% annual guidance mainly due to a settlement with the IRS, which resulted in the release of certain reserves and the cash ban of approximately $50,000. It would not be appropriate to gain any specific details to settlement that we now believe that an effective tax rate in the lower part of our full year guidance, which was 10% to 12%.","Depreciation and amortization, in Q1 depreciation was $20.2 million up 11% year-over-year and amortization was $5.6 million up 18% year-over-year for a total of $25.8 million. I know we have not generally talked about amortization expense but amortization expense increased to reflect the increase in amortization of intangibles on several deals we completed last year. For those interested in the stock comp number Q1 stock comp was $7.3 million.","Earnings per share as Bob mentioned in Q1 earnings per share was $1.12 on a GAAP basis and non-GAAP basis versus $0.83 and $0.85 respectively in Q1 \u201911. Favorably impacting our current quarterly EPS is our share repurchases program and our settlement of the IRS tax case. As previously discussed in prior earnings call, the Internal Revenue Service issued a note of deficiency to the company on April 1, 2011.","It disserted that the company was subject to additional taxes for 2005 under the anti-deferral provisions of Subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code. In January, we solved the matter and agreed to a net efficiency of $50,000 as mentioned above. Due to the settlement of the tax case we will release certain reserves, which were largely offset by the additional and bearer recall cost I mentioned a few minutes ago.","On December 15, 2011 we announced that the company\u2019s Board of Directors had authorized a share repurchase program of up to $150 million. As of the end of the quarter the company purchased approximately 663,000 shares of the company\u2019s common stock for $46.1 million at an average purchase price of $69.60 per share. This had if you round up about a $0.01 impact in the quarter and we expect the impact of the year to be above $0.05.","Now looking at the balance sheet and liquidity in Q1 we had cash provided by operations of $41.6 million, capital expenditures of $20 million, insurance recovery of $1.6 million, which resulted in a $23.2 million of free cash flow. The two major items impacting free cash flow from our perspective was the one-time $10 million payment for the Rembrandt settlement we talked about at Q4 \u201911 and an increase in inventory in the quarter of about $19 million.","Avaira Toric makes up about 40% of that inventory increase as we rebuild our stock in anticipation of a re-launch in the future. Insurance settlement relates to an October 28 incident in which a pipe broke in our fire suppression sprinkler system causing water and fire damaging in part of one of our manufacturing buildings in the UK. This incident did not have an impact on customers.","Total debt increase by $29.9 million to $410 million. Debt as a percentage of capitalization is now 17.5% up from 16.4% in Q4 and down from 26% in Q1 \u201911 this leaves us with approximately $600 million of total credit available. AR continues to be closely monitored with DSO at 59 days down from 61 days last year.","With that let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session.","Kim Duncan","Operator, we are ready to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) and your first question today comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Morgan Keegan.","Larry Keusch \u2013 Morgan Keegan","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for all the detail. Just if I\u2019m looking at the numbers correctly growth in your single use lenses in the fourth quarter was about 8% and then the market grew 11%. Someone or if you could just talk a little bit again about your strategy there and what you can do to accelerate the growth there to have these market rates if not greater.","Bob Weiss","Yeah, Larry well we it\u2019s that we are a little wider in the fourth quarter when you look at it from a first fiscal quarter basis we were up 10%, 14% all up 10% constant currency. So I think a lot of it is we continue to do well with our Proclear 1 Day, we are as I indicated credit coming out with the silicon hydrogel 1 Day not that I think that the it\u2019s moved much beyond the little niche.","But I think that\u2019s fact is just joining and being a participant with the crowd so to speak. I still think that Proclear 1 Day will be the driver of our global business and reasonably hold its tone out in the marketplace not only in Japan where it\u2019s done well but also in the U.S. where, you see J&J is putting a lot their energy to develop that market. We are of course going to (Inaudible) of their work and as they expand that market right now. It doesn\u2019t take too many wearers to move the needle quite a bit from a dollar point of view in that market and U.S. comes around 10% or 11% a couple of years to 17%, 18% now. So they are clearly helping that. Next question?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Thanks good evening guys. Bob, I just wanted to ask a question on the gross margin guidance at 62.5% the low end of your guidance for the year. It looks like you are implying kind of flat to maybe even down a little bit over the past three quarters of the year related to last year, which just I hear what you are saying on some of the expenses. But if you could flush that out or flush that out a little bit it just sounds a little bit hard to believe at this point. And then Greg just a very quick question on the reversal and the tax rate what your comments meant to me there was about a $2.5 million reversal in the tax rate in the quarter. Thanks.","Bob Weiss","I will comment first and I will let Greg amplify both gross margin and then his part on the taxes. You are right we came in with a very solid gross margin to provision was 64%, compared to a year ago 59.5% that shows better the value of Norfolk, which is ongoing of course, the value, one of the real catalyst of our gross margin is mix in fact that literally our growth is being sponsored by Biofinity we suppose is the high gross margin.","So importantly as we get back into the two week market more robustly that doesn\u2019t have the same theme if you will as Biofinity it\u2019s not going to have the margin. But I think the startup cost associated with getting into the relaunching Avaira Toric as well as startup cost of answering the 1 Day silicon hydrogel market, which from the get go is not going to be much of a gross margin to talk about at all. And as I think Greg alluded enough to the fact that you do start off a very steep curve in terms of high cost and then you work it down over a period of literally years.","That\u2019s the fact he did mention that we are now going to go through a startup phase or Biofinity in Puerto Rica so we have basically given the size of that product have decided to bite the bullet and go through a startup. It\u2019s at a remote location compared to where all our other Biofinity is made, so there will be a cost on that. Those costs will be directly impacting the next three quarters. So I think what I will let Greg ask or clarify anything else and then respond on the tax side.","Greg Matz","Well Bob, I think you\u2019ve got the gross margin I think that makes sense on the tax side we don\u2019t get to lie the detail I think you can really back into it based on the comments we mentioned earlier about Avaira and an offset between a likely offset between Avaira and the tax impact.","Kim Duncan","Operator, next question.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby \u2013 Cleveland Research","Hi thanks for taking the question. Bob I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color regarding the FDA and the FDA going through your various facilities. And the letter you received last quarter, just kind of any other color you can provide us regarding your discussions with the FDA.","Bob Weiss","Probably can\u2019t give you too much more than I said that we are going through a process with the FDA responding to your questions. No, well it\u2019s tough to say there is not reply we are cooperating with them we are getting through their questions and at this juncture we still expect to re-launch Avaira Toric in April. But of course that is totally depended on whether or not the FDA has any further questions.","On the warning letter we are responding to the observations made by the FDA making good progress there. I think they are waiting on us to say we are complete with all the corrections, which is going to take several more months and at that point in time they will come back in and re-inspect. So that is down the road several more months. Relative to the FDA showing up in the UK plant you may recall they came into our plant in Puerto Rico there were no observations.","They came into our plant in Scottsville no observations and they have not been in our plant recently in or since the recall anyway in the UK. They have made no indication that they have eminent plans they will show up when they want to show up, it is to our expectation that they will show up eventually. So when it happens it happens. Beyond that we are marching forward with Avaira Sphere and anxiously waiting to get Avaira Toric back out on the market. Next question?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Cooley with Stephens.","Chris Cooley \u2013 Stephens","Thank you and good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Hope you guys done a great job with CooperSurgical and consistently delivering good growth and margin expansion when you look at that franchise now is this, the new normal for profitability. And when do we start to see some, I guess some further development there on a little more global basis meaning how long could you provide that would be helpful? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Yes Chris, we are very pleased with where we are with CooperSurgical. You know I think I would point out that if we aggressively go globally the margins that we are accustomed to seeing in the U.S. 67% gross margin, the 27% operating margin that we\u2019ve now gotten to we will put some pressure on that that will be an investment. And I think obviously with the product portfolio we now have more like 600 products many of which have potential outside the U.S.","It is worth exploiting that we initiated activity last year I would say where we are in Europe is slow going mixed results, clearly not a wild factor at this juncture. But it is early in that cycle. I think one of the ways that we would against the ball with CooperSurgical with the acquisitions that are outside the U.S. and I would hope that over the several years we at least at that ball by having some of those to continue to leverage where we are with the franchise. Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Brien.","Matthew O\u2019Brien \u2013 William Blair","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just one quick clarification if I might you talked about this $0.05 of accretion from the share repurchase in the quarter is that assuming that you don\u2019t do any further repurchases or the other $100,000 million essentially is not used?","Greg Matz","Yes Matt, you are right that assumes it\u2019s where we are at this point.","Matthew O\u2019Brien \u2013 William Blair","Okay and then my primary question I\u2019m a little bit more concerned about it if. When you talked about, a little bit about Biofinity in seeing multiyear kind of rollout or opportunity that you see in front of you can you just provide a bit more color on why you think that\u2019s the case, is it a function of you know you still haven\u2019t even got to all of your customers with the product and that your sales force expansion is that the new market opportunity that you see there. I mean why is this a multiyear process in terms of delivering a lot of growth from that specific family of products?","Bob Weiss","Well number one I would say we are early even in the United States, which is our most mature market. Early by that I mean the total of the totality as a family we are when we came out with Biofinity Sphere it did good, when we brought out the Toric the Sphere did even better as a halo effect and when you come out with the Multifocal there is the compounding halo effect.","So they feed on each other as a family of products in front of practitioner he says I\u2019m very comfortable with the material, you know how it works my Sphere they love it there and now I want to migrate. So Biofinity Multifocal of course we just launched it in mid last year and June of last year they have a long way to go. When I talk about, we are far from exploiting it around the world. I mean geographically, I mean when I talk about the brick expansion it is a good vehicle to get into some countries where perhaps we will be more challenged if we didn\u2019t have a product like that, that is rapidly showing its presence in the silicon hydrogel space, which of course is the strong space.","All that takes work, you are right about expansion as a sales force putting in place more feet on the street it\u2019s one of the limitations we have. And I guess I would just say world is a pretty big place it takes a while to get there. Japan for example $400 million market we have, I would say we have only just began, we\u2019ve been in that market since June of last year also we are yet to introduce the Toric, which will probably be later this calendar year in that market and we are in further away from introducing the Multifocal in that market. So it takes time in some cases there is registration processes you have to go through also. Next question?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just a two part question in the guidance. First, CooperVision grew 9% ex-IMA ex-FX in the quarter. But the guidance is still I think 4% to 8% the market actually accelerated from 3% to 5%, so why not take the low end of the guidance today. But is it just conservatism early in the year is it something you are seeing. And then secondly on CooperSurgical the high end of the current guidance assumes basically that sales are flat sequentially. Is that a trend that you would expect for the reminder of the year? Thanks.","Greg Matz","Thank you, Larry. I think they are valid questions we debated guidance quite frankly one of the things that causes a little pause was that foreign exchange started moving against this, it\u2019s the last. It\u2019s volatile it changes like about every day depending on which way grief blows on in given morning. So as we were setting here with paper and pencil it was one of those days where currencies were moving more stronger against this so we were a little cautious as we roll that into in fact into top line and bottom line.","On surgical I think we are probably a little conservative but having said that the franchise at 9% actually it\u2019s 9% organically is they are good numbers they are not what we would deem as franchise would normally continue and sustain at 9%. So we are a little bit more cautious than assuming the first quarter\u2019s strength of that organic growth.","Bob Weiss","Next question?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Kim Gailun with JP Morgan.","Kim Gailun \u2013 JP Morgan","Great. Hey, thanks guys. So a question on margins you talked a lot in the prepared comments about margin expansion in most of the highlights that you gave related to that expansion (Inaudible) at diverse margin line from what I heard. So I guess but I\u2019m curious here you talk about is how you think about SG&A, SG&A numbers over the next few years. I guess the backdrop of you\u2019ve added 22% to your sales force you are spending happily on free land worth of new product launches. So when do we start to bring some of that leverage through the SG&A line.","Bob Weiss","You will see some leverage first on the G&A distribution areas where we are as I indicated that only grew really 11% while everything else were growing substantially above that. We are investing heavily meaning we grew top line 11% we grew our line items for sales and marketing as well as R&D more like 17% to 18%.","We are investing now we continue to expect to invest over the next couple of years particularly tied in with geographic expansion, which plays into pushing operating cost if you will and the best areas by investing in the operating cost and investing in the structure. And an example to that would be we talked about China in the past then spend much time on China today. But China would be one we are still in check on going down our path of investing upwards to a drain of 40 basis points to 50 basis points on our operating margin this year. And that is still part of our expectation in a area like that.","Now when do you start getting the payback really the payback is going to happen post 2012 post 2013 and that has become somewhat a question of if we think we are getting our money\u2019s worth by investing and expanding we might enter more countries. We haven\u2019t really spend much time talking about aggressive investing in Brazil, aggressive investing or any investing in India, aggressive investing in countries such as Russia. So there are opportunities we saw there some of them are kind of not comfortable yet getting there.","But I would hope two years from now we are talking about some of those countries more aggressively. I\u2019m not so hung up on we think a natural migration of our operating margin is going to be where we are to the mid 20s and we can get there with a little bit of operating expense leverage and the natural fall out of gross margin, because of royalty expiration and what we can do in cost of goods sold.","The first point is improve your operating margins weighting on cost of goods, continue to invest where it makes sense and seeing just how good the product is. The underlying assumption I\u2019ve got three products in each modality 1 Day with Proclear family two week with Avaira and monthly with Biofinity and would be a shame to be short sighted not to have enough money to get the most out of this product so hopefully that help you. Next question?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Market.","Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Market","Thank you very much for taking my question. Two part question of your silicon hydrogel revenue what percentage of it is in United States and what percentage of it is outside United States. And when the (Inaudible) royalty starts to roll off of that 8% gain, which we are talking about, which will help you get to those mid 20% operating margin. Are you going to let it all go through or can we expect some reinvestment?","Bob Weiss","Well I will take the second one first you can expect some reinvestment we will take some of it to the bottom line but I would expect in the neighborhood of half of it will be reinvested. And keep in mind that happens over a period of time it doesn\u2019t just, not a quiz though we will have some opportunity to plan that out. As far as silicon hydrogel\u2019s the majority of our revenue actually the better half is outside the U.S. but it\u2019s closer to 50-50 at this juncture. And therefore my opinion you know that 33% of revenue in the soft contact lens market is in the U.S. two-thirds it should be two to one. Well there are a lot of translators and a lot of leverage potential yet with silicon hydrogel outside the U.S. Next question?","Operator","Your final question today is from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citi","Hi quick question on Europe and just a clarification on guidance on Europe just the last quarter you talked about it\u2019s a softening market. But it looks like it bounced back you just talk about the sustainability of what you are seeing in Europe. And just second on the guidance clarification so you took the midpoint up $0.13 did I hear it right $0.05 from the share repurchase and that will leave about $0.08 from the lower end of the tax rate or is there anything else that\u2019s driving the earnings revision upward.","Bob Weiss","Europe first, Europe is I call it a daily event but as far as it\u2019s been okay for the contact lens industry. It was a little softness you see in the fourth quarter compared to how it did last year for example the contact lens industry in the fourth calendar quarter was that 5% the overall market was stronger than that last year. Actually I guess it wasn\u2019t held on 5 to 5 but it was not bad for us in the first quarter.","So it\u2019s not as we are busting the woods prior two years where it was clearly strongest of the three regions but it\u2019s holding its own. On guidance the best way to think of the $0.13 add is the accretion of, by the acting $0.05 related to the midpoint and the other $0.07 is non-detector or two offsetting items. The tax going one way and then there was some recall related to consensus going the other way those washed out.","Meaning we flushed through the P&L certain recall and that impacted the revenue line somewhat and operating cost somewhat. The pickup of the $0.07 really the strength of the first quarter, so we came out $0.07 stronger than the quarter we retained that in the guidance numbers you have going forward.","We didn\u2019t keep the momentum of that $0.07 pickup in each quarter because we are investing and we talked about all the start up costs that will happen as we rollout, relaunch Avaira Toric and rollout SUS or single user silicon hydrogel, if you will and then have start up cost with the manufacturing of Biofinity in Puerto Rico. Any other questions?","Operator","You do have a follow-up question from the line of Jeff Johnson.","Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Thanks guys just two quick one here. So Bob, we danced around kind of gross margin and SG&A here. But it\u2019s just operating margin are you still assuming there maybe 100 to a little north of 100 basis points for the year. And then did I hear you correctly if you are moving some Biofinity manufacturing to Puerto Rico some of that is even going to outside of the main Juana Diaz facility or we just knew why would you be doing that outside of that facility.","Bob Weiss","Let me come back on that one first the \u2013 we are not moving anything from UK where we make Biofinity to Puerto Rico we are expanding in Puerto Rico where they are starting up Biofinity production inside the plant. It\u2019s in the same stall or some new location. Relative to gross margin and SG&A the expectation is we will be able to improve operating margin this year in that range of 50 basis points to 100 basis points, at the low end is the function of how impressive. We are with expansion in primarily China and at the high end assume that we get a little bit more out of leverage so it\u2019s in the 50 basis points to 100 basis points improvement this year. Operator?","Operator","You do have a follow-up question from the line of Larry Biegelsen.","Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hey, thanks for taking the follow-up question. Can you give us a little bit of comfort around some of the startup cost here? The new single daily use silicon hydrogel and Avaira Toric in the Biofinity line and I guess maybe on the single use of silicon hydrogel lens and have you made this lens. I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand you know the risk here that there could be significant startup cost here versus modest startup cost the reminder of the year.","Bob Weiss","On the silicon hydrogel there are going to be cost it\u2019s not going to be a high gross margin to get. And it\u2019s I would say the technology we are using to make it is a somewhat a known commodity. So that will be somewhat controlled in that sense and we are not trying to go aggressively into the market in fact I should have been clear if I wasn\u2019t that it is a limited launch we are talking about it\u2019s not going to be a global launch.","I didn\u2019t get into where and for to keep the competition guessing we are not going to say where, but the risk of startup cost being well beyond what we expect I think is steadily limited and controlled. Some of those other startup costs there is no doubt I think Greg when he gave his guidance on gross margin 62.5 I think to 63 kind of tells us we are what we expect will happen as we flush that into the P&L over the last three quarters if you will.","Operator","I\u2019m sorry go ahead.","Kim Duncan","Sorry, we are at the top of the hour we would like to conclude.","Operator","Go ahead and make your closing remarks then.","Bob Weiss","Well with that I thank everyone for joining us in today\u2019s call. Hopefully, you are pleased as we were with the results of the quarter and the progress we are making towards exploiting our family of products around the world, both gaining market share as well as successes in women\u2019s healthcare. So with that we look forward to talking to you in June.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for your participation in today\u2019s program.

Welcome to our fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. This was a year of record revenues, earnings per share and free cash flow. I am proud of our team for everything we accomplished and believe we are extremely well positioned with our growth strategies firmly intact and momentum on our side as we enter fiscal 2019.","The fourth quarter was a continuation of what we've been discussing regarding capitalizing on current market conditions through incremental sales and marketing investments to win new fits within CooperVision and driving strong performance of PARAGARD within CooperSurgical.","Overall, our strategic investments are paying off and I am happy with our revenue growth rates and momentum. Having said that, gross margins at CooperVision did come in below our expectations this quarter and at a high level, there were two reasons.","The first relates to our desire to maintain extremely high customer service shipping levels in the face of our distribution, our significant distribution center upgrade activity. The redundancies we've added to accomplish this have resulted in higher costs, but I strongly believe the importance of maintaining premium customer service is more important than the negative short-term impact.","Second, the rapid growth in our daily silicone hydrogels franchise resulted in incremental charges against legacy hydrogel products due to things like product discontinuation, and lower production volumes. Brian will cover this in more detail, but these items reduced EPS this quarter by $0.14.","Regarding revenues, we remain focused on driving success by capitalizing on our strong product portfolio and accelerating investments within both businesses. This activity helps support a very strong fourth quarter with consolidated revenues of $652 million, up 16% year-over-year.","Within this, CooperVision reported quarterly revenue of $481 million, up 9% or 10% pro forma with a noticeable uptick in our daily silicone hydrogel lenses showing pro forma growth of 50% driven by accelerating growth in both Clariti and MyDay. CooperSurgical reported record revenue of $171 million, up 40% or up 5% pro forma led by PARAGARD growing a healthy 20%.","Moving to the details. CooperVision posted very strong revenue growth in all three regions with the Americas up 8%, EMEA up 9% and Asia-Pac up a strong healthy 19% all pro forma. The Americas strength was driven by Clariti and MyDay, with MyDay in particular gaining significant traction following the launch of the Toric a few quarters ago. EMEA also saw accelerating sales for Clariti and MyDay along with solid results from Biofinity and Avaira Vitality. Asia-Pac continued posting strong results driven by jumping Clariti along with strength in MyDay and Biofinity.","Growth in Asia-Pac remain highly diversified from a geographic and product portfolio perspective and we are seeing strong returns on our investment activity in that region. In other products and categories, Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 7%, with strikes seen in a number of markets around the world. Torics grew 11% and Multifocals grew 7%, all pro forma.","Turning to the broader soft contact lens market, which has now reached $8.5 billion in revenues on a trailing 12-month basis, we're continuing to see strong growth led by the shift to daily silicone hydrogel lenses, broader product offerings and geographic expansion.","Daily lenses continue to drive the majority of the growth, and now accounting for roughly $4.4 billion or 52% of the market. And within dailies, silicone hydrogel lenses are 30% of total daily revenues and continue to be the primary growth driver growing 35%. With respect to New Fit Data, CooperVision continue to see significant strength, especially with respect to daily silicones, so our momentum remained strong.","Before moving to CooperSurgical, I want to spend a couple minutes on daily silicone hydrogel lenses, our key account strategy and our efforts around customized product offerings. Regarding daily silicone hydrogel lenses, growing this part of our business is extremely important and will remain so for many years.","The shift to daily silicones from a reusable lenses generates roughly 2x to 3x more revenue and a 20% plus trade up from daily hydrogels. This is great for the industry and I'd expect all contact lens manufacturers to share in this multi-year trade-up move as a rising tide should lift all boats. What's unique to Cooper though is our current market share within dailies is only 17%.","This compares to the roughly 30% market share we retain in the reusable lens space and it shows if we can get our fair share of new daily fits, we should see many years of strong growth. And obviously I believe we can do that with our current product portfolio and investment strategies and the New Fit Data supports that.","Regarding key accounts, which includes global retailers, regional chains and large buying groups have had the opportunity to spend time with the executives from several of these accounts recently and I'm extremely impressed with their strategic thinking and their desire to grow the contact lens category.","We're going to continue supporting and even strengthen our support of these partnerships and I strongly believe these relationships will continue providing a win-win scenario with CooperVision and our partners both experiencing long-term sustainable growth. As part of this effort, we did further accelerate our investments in key accounts during Q4, expanding our sales and support teams while increasing related promotional and advertising activity.","Lastly, regarding our customized product offerings or continuing to invest heavily to improve our distribution labeling and packaging capabilities. This includes several new distribution centers, including ones in Spain and the UK, which just went live, expanding existing distribution centers in several locations and completing numerous projects to increase automation in our facilities.","We're completing all this activity while ensuring we maintain premier shipping levels to our existing customers so as not to disrupt our current sales momentum. We're also fiercely loyal to our independent practitioners, supporting them in many ways, including our unique digital marketing and support platforms such as Eye Care Prime, and our subscription model LensFerry.","In summary, this activity is all focused on supporting our partners and shifting wearers to CooperVision faster, remembering that a key part of this strategy is we operate in an annuity business where the upfront cost of winning new patients more than pays for itself in the long run, given how long wearers stay in their lenses.","Moving to CooperSurgical, we reported record quarterly revenue of $171 million, up 40% or 5% pro forma. Within our office and surgical products business, revenues grew 12%, pro forma led by PARAGARD, up 20%.","PARAGARD was very strong in this quarter, although some of that was due to channel inventory expansion is optimism about future demand is growing. It's tough to quantify the inventory impact, but I do believe these inventory levels will hold steady if not expand as we continue promoting the product.","Regarding sales activity, we continue to invest heavily through higher advertising and targeted promotional work and we added another 10 sales reps this quarter, increasing our total rep count to 70 with 50 being direct and 20 being internal. We remain confident this product offers a high margin, multi-year growth opportunity, and as such, we're continuing to invest in.","Outside of PARAGARD, our other office and surgical products grew solid 7% with continuing strength seen in several products, including our Endosee Hysteroscope and our next-generation uterine manipulator, which both grew solid double-digits.","Fertility was weaker-than-expected, down 6% pro forma, led by channel inventory contraction associated with consolidating distributors from our LifeGlobal integration along with product re-registrations tied to our new manufacturing facility in Costa Rica, which is now producing product. We believe the vast majority of the distributor consolidation in re-registration activity is behind us and that we enter fiscal 2019 in a good position.","Also within Fertility, our genomics business declined again this quarter, but the restructuring activity is finally behind us and the business is now highly focused on IVF clinics with a roughly $40 million annual run rate, which should now be stable to trending higher. The important takeaway on Fertility in my opinion is our business is healthy and we exit this year expecting mid-to-upper single-digit growth in fiscal 2019.","Speaking of fiscal 2019, Brian will cover guidance in detail, but on revenues, we're guiding CooperVision to 6% to 8% growth and CooperSurgical to 3% to 6% growth, both pro forma. I believe the contact lens industry will continue to be strong, growing in the 5% to 6% range and we should certainly take market share. Frankly, I believe we'll be 7% plus, but it's prudent this early in the year to guide to 6% to 8%.","In conclusion, I want to highlight that I'm really excited about our market positions for both CooperVision and CooperSurgical. We've entered fiscal 2019 from a position of strength and I believe our focus on growing revenues, while investing in infrastructure puts us in an excellent position to deliver a strong long-term shareholder returns for many years to come.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Andrews","Thank you, Al. Good afternoon everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis. So please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Al covered revenues, so I'll focus on the rest of the P&L and guidance.","For the quarter, consolidated gross margins improved year-over-year to 66.5%, up from 65.9% last year. Within that CooperVision's gross margin declined 360 basis points to 64.1% from 67.7%, with the primary driver being currency, which was a 210 basis point drag.","The remaining 150 basis points was split primarily between two items. First, internal freight and secondary handling costs were higher than normal as we incurred significant costs associated with redundancies we implemented in order to maintain premium service levels while adding, expanding and upgrading our distribution centers.","The second item was higher than expected inventory and equipment write-offs associated with older products as the shift to daily silicone hydrogel lenses is accelerating. As our legacy hydrogels decline, we'll continue to assess the speed of that recovery of that activity and the impact on a manufacturing and inventory levels for legacy products. We expect costs in both of these areas to be higher than normal through fiscal 2019 before we start seeing leverage.","Having said that, we expect to hurdle a significant portion of these costs, as you will note in our guidance, which meets our prior commentary of low double-digit, constant currency operating income growth.","CooperSurgical's gross margin improved significantly to 73.1%, up from 59.6% with the addition of PARAGARD along with improvements in product mix as some of our higher margin medical devices products are now becoming large enough to have a positive impact on our overall gross margins.","Regarding expenses, consolidated operating expenses increased 19.2%, driven by the acquisition of PARAGARD, along with significant investments in selling and marketing in both businesses and distribution within CooperVision.","R&D was up 18.7%, reflecting new product development work including activity around myopia management. Consolidated operating income grew 13.9% in the quarter with operating margins at 26.7%.","Below operating income, we reported $20.3 million of interest expense and a $1.7 million FX loss due to negative currency moves against our intercompany loans. Our effective tax rate was 6.1%, which was lower than expected primarily due to excess tax benefits from the exercising of stock options.","Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $2.87 with roughly $49.9 million average shares outstanding. Within this, FX was $0.31 negative year-over-year, which was $0.02 worse than we had forecasted last quarter in our guidance.","One other item I want to mention is a positive event, but one which we excluded from our non-GAAP earnings this quarter as it was a culmination of prior period activity. This was the realization of $14.2 million in tax credits we received related to the development of MyDay in Puerto Rico.","Based on the minimal tax benefit to us, we began selling the credits and received roughly $8 million in Q4 with additional proceeds coming this fiscal year. We realized the full gain of $14.2 million in our P&L this quarter and other income, but excluded it from our non-GAAP EPS.","Moving to cash flow. We posted a very strong quarter of $193 million of free cash flow comprised of $237 million of operating cash flow, offset by $43 million of CapEx. This reduced net debt to $1.949 billion with our bank-defined leverage or net debt to adjusted EBITDA decreasing to 2.21 times.","Regarding full-year fiscal 2018 results, consolidated revenues were $2.533 billion, up 18% or 7% pro forma. CooperVision revenues were $1.882 billion, up 12% or 8% pro forma, and CooperSurgical's revenues were $650.8 million, up 40% or 2% pro forma. Non-GAAP EPS was $11.50, up 19% and free cash flow was strong at $475 million.","Moving to fiscal 2019, we are introducing guidance of consolidated revenues of $2.6 billion to $2.66 billion, which is comprised of $1.94 billion to $1.98 billion at CooperVision, up 3% to 5% as reported or 6% to 8% pro forma growth. And $660 million to $680 million at CooperSurgical up 1% to 4% as reported or 3% to 6% pro forma growth. Within these numbers, it's important to note that we forecast currency having a negative year-over-year impact of $61 million with the heaviest impact being early in the year.","On a consolidated basis, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $11.30 to $11.70 based on 50.1 million shares outstanding. Within this, we forecast currency to have a negative impact of $0.55 with a majority of the impact in the first half of the year.","As this guidance assumes roughly current FX rates \u2013 all this guidance assumes roughly FX rates of our primary currencies being $1.13 for the euro, $1.27 for the pound and $1.13 for the yen.","Moving to high level detail within the P&L. We expect fiscal 2019 gross and operating margins to improve slightly year-over-year. Interest is expected to be down only slightly as we're assuming three separate 25 basis point interest rate hikes. For taxes we're assuming 14%, but that could go lower pending finalization of U.S. proposed regulations, continued legislation from Global Taxing authorities and audit settlement discussions we're engaged in.","Note, this tax rate does not include any assumption for excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation associated with the exercising of stock options, but it does include an estimate of our normal scheduled testing of equity brands.","Lastly on guidance, we are not providing quarterly details, but given the number of moving pieces especially with respect to currency early in the year we'll note that we're currently expecting Q1 operating income to be down slightly year-over-year and Q2 to be up only slightly. In both Q1 and Q2, we expect the effective tax rate to be little lower than in the back half of the year.","On free cash flow, we expect it to be similar to this past years $475 million, although we believe there's upside about $500 million depending on CapEx requirements associated with growth in our one-day silicon hydrogel franchise.","And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Johnson","Hey. Thanks guys. Good evening. Hope you can hear me okay.","Albert White","Yes. Hey Jeff.","Brian Andrews","Hi.","Jeffrey Johnson","Hi guys. Al, so first question for you. Just on the Asia-Pac numbers, I mean obviously they've been strong for a long time, double-digits I think for \u2013 I don't know 3 or 3.5 years at this point. But they have kind of taken an uptick here in the last few quarters. One just \u2013 what's the sustainability on the Asia-Pac CVI kind of double-digit and solid double-digit growth?","And then I know you've been pointing a lot to some of these key accounts and some of the big retailers in that, we've heard about a couple you won in Europe, some added activity here in the U.S., but kind of talk to me about the retail environment in Asia and where you might be winning some deals or how big of an effort that is there as well?","Albert White","Yes, good question. Asia-Pac obviously had a really strong quarter and has done really well for a number of quarters. The future remains bright there, and we have a good strong 23% global market share, but we're still under indexed in Asia-Pac, at about a 16% market share.","So I envision years of strong growth there, frankly. We have invested heavily on key accounts around the world that includes within the Asia-Pac region there are opportunities there. As a matter fact there's a couple exciting opportunities we're working on right now that I hope we get and will help continue to drive the double-digit growth for many years.","So I won't get into those details, but I will say that we are spending money building our key accounts, we're spending money on the advertising, the promotional activity and feed on the street in Asia-Pac and I'd say I feel good that you're going to continue to see double-digit growth in that region.","Jeffrey Johnson","All right, that's helpful. And then Brian, can you just help us on CVI gross margin, I know you don't guide, margin by segment, but obviously currency is going to have a headwind. It sounds like in the first half of the year, but then the pound starts helping in the back. So it seems to me there's going to be more volatility potentially around CVI gross margin this year than maybe in some of the past years. So any kind of color you can give us just on how to think about the gating of that line item throughout the year?","Brian Andrews","Yes, I mean, I would expect that it is going to be flat more or less year-over-year and obviously you had a pretty large FX impact this quarter and then some operational things that impacted, but I would say overall flat.","Jeffrey Johnson","And if you say flat overall is that down in the first half and up in the second half, again just some gating throughout the year color?","Brian Andrews","No, just really just flat throughout the year.","Jeffrey Johnson","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So a couple for you, Al. So on the Q3 call, you appear to be comfortable with \u2013 let's say $12.05 for fiscal 2019 or low single-digit reported EPS growth. So can you walk through kind of what changed from the Q3 call to today, where you are at about let's call it $11.50 at the midpoint or flat year-over-year? And I had one follow-up.","Albert White","Yes. You have a couple factors there that we touched on. You have to kind of piece it together from some of Brian's discussions, but obviously currency has moved against us since then and we're now looking at roughly $0.55 negative year-over-year currency impact, so that was a decent amount worth.","You look at the effective tax rate, we said 14%, I think we finished the year at 7.7% if I'm remembering right, so a little bit bigger of an amount hurdle there. And I guess the other point I would add is some of what I touched on earlier in the call there, which was some of the costs associated with the activity around the growth in daily silicones and distribution and logistics activity.","Lawrence Biegelsen","That's helpful. And then obviously you finished the year very strong in the second half in CVI, and I heard your commentary on fiscal 2019 and the guidance, obviously you have potentially a couple of new competitors coming. So my question is what makes you so confident in the 7% at the midpoint and hopefully better in fiscal 2019 with new competition coming? Thanks for taking the questions.","Albert White","Yes. Sure. Yes, I look at the last three years for CooperVision, it's been kind of 7.5%, 7%, a little bit over 8% here this last quarter. I mean we've had good strength and good momentum for a number years. We have the products. We have the ability to sell those products. We're meeting good solid shipping and delivery and logistics. We're putting advertising and promotional dollars there.","So there's a lot of positive activity and when I look at the new fit data that makes me feel good about us being able to continue to post strong growth. Fully acknowledging the world is \u2013 as its with issues and there could be some recessionary type activity following appreciating. We have competitors who are looking to launch new products and maybe not as fast as what at one point people thought they were going to, but still coming at some point.","So there's pluses and minuses, but when I look at our product portfolio and what we have going on today, the momentum we have with key accounts and different spots around the world, I feel pretty good that we should have another strong year this year.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Lawrence Keusch with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","John Hsu","Thank you, guys. This is John Hsu in for Larry. Couple of quick questions, one strategic, one financial, just on the strategic side, obviously your key accounts, it sounds like the strategy is going pretty well. I guess maybe related to that is $5 million per quarter still the right way to think about the incremental spend and maybe also as part of that Al if you could answer, if you signed any new key accounts in the fourth quarter and specifically are there any contracts specific with Clariti?","Albert White","Sure. Yes, thanks John. I won't get into individual accounts or signing new accounts. I will kind of confirm that. Yes, the key account strategy is going well. Yes, we are making product \u2013 we are making progress with relationships that we currently have and looking at some new relationships, so feeling good about that.","The $5 million per quarter, yes, that's probably a good way to look at it. The only kind of asterisk I would put on that is the more success we have, the more we would be willing to support those partners that we have in terms of moving incremental new fits to CooperVision.","Those costs that get associated with that our upfront cost and the life of that wearer is worth a lot more than that. So I hope that the key account strategy continues to progress as well as it's been progressing, so that that $5 million per quarter holds for a little while here. Obviously, once some of that tails off those cost can tail off too, so we'll see how that plays out.","John Hsu","Excellent. Thanks for that. And then just the financial question, how are you thinking about capital deployment in 2019? Is it still fair to assume that maybe debt pay down is a higher priority with the remainder for tuck-in M&A in share repurchase?","Albert White","Yes, I would say that's true. We had a strong quarter certainly with respect to cash flow this quarter and the team did a fantastic job, cleaning up some inner company loans and so forth, so we could get some cash move back over and we paid down debt under $2 billion.","So a very strong step in the right direction in this quarter and Q3 was strong also. So I would say, hey, we're still raising rate environment. I am certainly fine taking proceeds and paying down debt and keeping a decent eye on smaller tuck-in acquisitions if we can find them and they make sense meaning they provide sufficient returns and at the same time looking at now maybe start to deploy some additional dollars towards share repurchases.","John Hsu","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joanne Wuensch","Hi, good evening. A couple of questions. Could you give us an update on your product portfolio, particularly with fresh competition in Torics from Bausch & Lomb and Alcon? And I'm just going to ramble off to two other things quickly. In a rising interest rate environment, how do we think about interest expense next year? And you may have given this and I missed it, but what is your gross margin guidance for next year?","Albert White","Yes. Let me touch on those and Brian will add some color here if I missed anything or say something wrong. On the product portfolio, we're in great shape obviously with our existing product portfolio kind of across the Board right now, so we're pretty heavily focused on selling the products we have and be that Clariti or MyDay are Biofinity or Avaira Vitality and so forth.","We do have products kind of in our back pocket so to speak that we'll be looking at rolling out over time and we'll see how that plays out, but we do have products, we are ready to be in a position of launching products in the near-term. Having said that, we're going to focus with the products we have in the marketplace right now where we're seeing pretty significant growth.","On interest expense, we're assuming three interest rate increases this year, which means interest expense will just kind of go down slightly year-over-year and gross margins, even in the face of currency on a consolidated basis, should increase a little bit similar to operating margins.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Matthew Mishan","Great and thank you for taking the questions. Al, how are you thinking about the impact of Brexit, and could you put some conservatism in numbers given that's like smacked out in the middle of your fiscal year?","Albert White","Yes, great question, Matt. It's a little bit of a tough one for us versus some of these guys who will be at calendar year-end. You could imagine we've been doing a ton of work on Brexit. We might be a little bit better off than some of the other multinationals and that we manufacture product and have distribution centers in the UK and Europe and other spots, so we're fairly diversified.","But yes, we did factor in costs associated with Brexit in our guidance. We've done some work around increasing inventory in some locations outside of the UK to minimize any potential disruptions if there is kind of a hard exit if you will. I think there's risk for all of us if they can't come to some sort of decent resolution. So I won't speculate on that. I think we'll get some answers on that fairly soon and I'm kind of keeping my fingers crossed. But short answer being, yes, doing a ton of work on it, yes, included some costs in our guidance for next fiscal year.","Matthew Mishan","And then just a follow-up on the gross margin. How should we think about the timeline of the changes you're making in distribution? When those facilities fully come on line? And also I think you were talking a little bit about the gradual decline of the equipment in inventory charges. Can you just walk through like the timing of both of those through next year?","Albert White","Absolutely, yes. So if we look at the distribution side, you have two components of that. You have distribution expense, which is going to be higher this year, we're going to see that throughout the year and probably some even into 2020 as we start all these facilities up and complete all this automation kind of activity. And then I think you'll see \u2013 my guess is, distribution expenses kind of grow equal with revenues in fiscal 2020 and then we'll start seeing some real leverage out of that.","If I look at the impact to us internally, which hits in our cost of goods, you're going to see higher costs here, because we have some duplicative costs and some inefficiencies, because I mean, basically what we're doing here is we're kind of like think of it as the analogy of we're changing the tires on the car while the car is moving. I mean we're continuing to run our business, maintain very high quality shipping standards and so forth, while doing all these upgrades and we decided to do all that while maintaining premier customer service, so that's costing us some.","The nice thing about that is we should have higher cost this year, while we take care of all of our customers and so forth, but I would expect to see that starting to decline as we move through this year and probably be gone next year. So we'll see those kind of improvements in fiscal 2020. That would kind of be the piece.","Then when I look at the other side, we did have a very strong quarter in Q3 and a very strong quarter in Q4 when it comes to silicone hydrogel sales, all indications are that's going to continue for the market and for us. That puts pressure on our legacy hydrogel products. When we look to discontinue some of the products or when we cut back on manufacturing volume and end up either writing up inventory or writing off some equipment.","So I think we're going to have some of that activity, I think we're going to see kind of heightened cost associated with that in fiscal 2019, but then I think all the pluses of the power if you will of the successes around all the daily SiHys moves will allow us to be in a year-over-year improving position in fiscal 2020. So I kind of like our chances for a good fiscal 2020 based on that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Brian Weinstein","Hi guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Al, you had mentioned \u2013 somebody had mentioned, I think on the call something about recessionary activity, it's one of the things that we were going to ask you about. We haven't really seen a weaker economic environment as you guys have been rolling out daily silicone hydrogel. So can you talk about what you think the U.S. [indiscernible] demand is if we were to see the macro economy start to tip over a little bit in the U.S. and elsewhere?","Albert White","Yes, I mean I definitely think if you look at history, we're a recession resistant business. We've seen that before where we've hit heavier recessions and the contact lens industry still grows, and I would expect that same thing here. You have the product trade up, you still have geographic expansion, you have expansion of products themselves better towards better multifocals and so forth. So it obviously depends on the extent of the recession and what happens, but I would say that even in a decent recession the contact lens market still going to be flat to growing and I would expect us to be growing faster than the market.","Brian Weinstein","All right. And then speaking about the market, I mean you talked about it being $8.5 billion now with dailies, I think you said 52% of the market and SiHys there on a daily side in about 30%. I think historically you've talked about that eventually getting to 50%. Is there any change in where you see that going? Do you now have confidence that it's potentially above 50% of the daily market and how long do you think it takes before we get to that point?","Albert White","Yes, I mean I think that what you're seeing right now and you hear from the competitors are people are coming out fully recognizing, acknowledging whether it's the manufacturers or the practitioners themselves that yes daily silicones makes sense, right. Because I mean for a little while as I do silicones make sense in the daily, do you need them or do you just need them in reusable.","Well no, you need them in daily that's best for the eyes, best for our patients. We all understand that and the whole market industry is moving in that direction. So to me I think when you look at the percentage of silicones and reusable lenses, which is now like 82% and you look at what's ultimately going to happen within the daily market, and how much of the daily market moves there, I certainly believe that will go over 50%. As a matter of fact, I believe it will go well north of 50%.","So we'll see how that plays out in the timing and so forth, but everything from the market perspective is indicating that, that growth is going to continue. That strong growth is going to continue and yes I strongly believe we'll be well north of 50%. Ultimately, we'll see where it goes, but I think it's going to be much, much higher than that.","Brian Weinstein","Thank you, Al.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Block","Okay. Thanks guys. Maybe two questions. Al, first one for you. If you really could tell daily number, I guess what I'm trying to ask is do you have an estimate of the incremental market share that you believe you are now capturing within the dailies market relative to the 17% share that you cited today? And then maybe just attack on to that? Also just want to ask if there was any benefit this quarter with calling catch up on Energys, which I believe may have had some manufacturing constraints last quarter? And then I've just got a follow-up?","Albert White","Yes, quickly on Energys, I would say that we have some effort going in there, but \u2013 and the product is certainly doing well and growing. I can't remember the number, but well, well, well north of what Biofinity is growing. So I wouldn't say there was a catch up in there, I think the Biofinity number and Avaira combined at 7% was kind of a true number.","As I mentioned last quarter, we do have capacity that's come on line in Q2 and Q3 so I think we're in a better position to continue to grow that, but I wouldn't put a lot of emphasis on that. When you look at the daily SiHys side of things, we talked about this in the past, it's a little tough when you get to see a live data growth versus net and everything else, but at the end of the day silicone hydrogel lenses grew about 35% market wise for the third calendar quarter and obviously we're growing well north of that.","Jonathan Block","Okay. So that 35% just to clarify, is sort of relative to the 50% plus that you cited?","Brian Andrews","That's right.","Jonathan Block","Okay, got it. And then just to shift gears over to CSI, so PARAGARD \u2013 really strong number 20%, I think you mentioned some channel in there, but I'm just curious from a rep perspective where you think you may top out and it's hard to maybe predict that when you're growing in that sort of rate, but just thinking about tying this back to drop through an OpEx leverage within the PARAGARD franchise you're up to 70% where do we start to see that level off? Thanks for your time.","Albert White","Yes, I think we're probably getting to that point where that means to level off here fairly soon. I think that if we have a lot of success and things are going really well, could that get up to 100 sales reps I mean, I would say that's possible that would probably be the high point if I had to guess based on that product and the analysis that I've seen and we've done internally. So I would kind of say yes, we're at 70% that includes 20% internal.","Do we continue to add people? Maybe. I go again I wouldn't see us going any higher than 100. I do think that that offers kind of that product is a mid single-digit grower this year and next year in the following year we're in a good spot with good momentum on that. So let's see how that plays out. The stronger that is, the more we would look at adding select sales reps in very, very targeted marketing and sales activity in certain cities where we don't cover right now.","Jonathan Block","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Matthew O'Brien","Thanks so much for taking my questions. Just one market question for you Al and then a follow-up. I was a little bit curious to hear you talk about the outlook for the market in 2019. You're coming off of about a 7% growth rate in this market. It sounds like the dealers are going really well. So I'm wondering why you're backing off that ever so slightly, that I don't want to over read it too much. Also within there, are you starting to see fall-out rates or dropout rates come down slightly because of more and more use of dailies?","Albert White","Yes. Well, quickly on dailies, right, you have to love them, I mean you don't have solutions. So what you end up with is people moving into dailies and they're much more compliant and yes the dropout is not as high. Now having said that a lot of those wearers have spectacles, then they're going to wear glasses and so forth, so it's a little different kind of thing on the reusable space. When I look at the market, yes, I mean you're right I mean the markets, if I look at trailing 12 months has grown around 7% something like that.","I think \u2013 the market is going to continue to be pretty strong. We've talked for number of years about the market growing 4% to 6%. We were scratching our head for a while as to why it was at 4% \u2013 with everything going on. Now you've seen that acceleration, it's moving up into that more consistent 6%, 7% kind of growth each quarter and obviously that moves up and down a little bit. But you see that you see us growing faster than that.","I honestly think that's going to continue. I do \u2013 I believe the market's going to stay strong. I think J&J is doing a nice job and I think they're going to stay strong trading upwards. Obviously everyone sees what Alcon is doing and trying to come to market and buy shares and you know what where we stand and you know my optimism about where we are.","I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, right. We're given initial guidance for the year and we're looking at where we're going on a full-year basis and there's a lot of things that could happen, and a lot of different moving parts around the world. But do I feel good about the market being 4% to 6% and being in the upper part of that or even a little bit above that, yes. And do I feel good about us in the 6% to 8% and being able to push towards middle or upper part of that, yes, I do.","Matthew O'Brien","Okay. And then the follow up is a little bit of a strange one on the CSI business. But you worked with Utah Medical on this Filshie Clip sterilization business. They've comment that you're kind of backing off of that business. So are you just more focused on selling PARAGARD at this point or is there a product issue specifically with that you're stepping away from or are you going to shut that business and then focus on the higher margin products going forward?","Albert White","Yes, I mean, I won't comment on a specific relationship or a product like that's a relatively small product. I will say that, yes, we are heavily focused on PARAGARD. There's no question about that. But when I look at the Filshie Clip, which is part of the rest of our office of the surgical products business, those medical devices, I mean we had another strong quarter at 7%. That's a good business.","Mark Valentine runs that business for us, out of trouble, he has done really nice job there driving growth in that business. So we are absolutely focused on our medical devices, our core OB\/GYN business there in addition to PARAGARD and we'll continue to be heavily focused on that business in fiscal 2019.","Matthew O'Brien","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Christian Moore","Hey. Thanks for taking the question. This is actually Christian on for Robbie. Just have few on CVI, not to deliberate the market outlook plans. But Al, I know you mentioned that you see it growing in the 5% to 6% range. What's kind of your time frame for that outlook?","The reason I ask is because, one of your competitors that's been off soon recently mentioned that they see a 4% CAGR in the 2018 to 2023 range. So where just kind of your perspective differ on that? And then \u2013 on that as well, do you have anything baked in for 2019 for any kind of different impact for Alcon as the standalone company? And then I have one more. Thanks.","Albert White","Yes, I believe and you correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe when Alcon was kind of making their comment of 4% growth, that was a broader comment and I believe they were including solutions in that. If that's accurate, that would explain it. Obviously, the solutions market is under pressure, because of the growth of the dailies.","So I think when you look at the contact lens market to be saying that it's a 5% plus grower, 5% to 6% or whatever, I believe we probably have five years in front of us because I think the shift, the trade up shift from hydrogen dailies to silicone hydrogels dailies frankly probably has five, six, seven years in front of us. So I think that will drive pretty decent growth for a long time.","I think that that shift alone is going to put a lot of pressure on contact lens solutions. We have a contact lens solutions business, it's relatively small, but it actually declined year-over-year for us. So I'm assuming that they included that in there. And then, when you look at the impact from Alcon, it's hard to speculate on that I mean, I think that that would certainly be built into our 6% to 8% guidance that we gave.","Christian Moore","Got it. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up, you start to talk more recently about the customized product offerings, which I know is used to be called private label. We're not using the terminology anymore. Could you just help us understand how much of the existing base, maybe not hard numbers, but just at a high level, how much of your existing base is driven from that customized product offerings and then where you kind of see that going forward in the future in terms of becoming a much larger portion of Cooper's business? Thanks.","Albert White","Sure, yea. And private label being part of customized products, it falls under that umbrella, right. When I look at customized product offerings, we're talking about it could be all the way to specialized lens, product customized packaging, distribution, labeling, shipping of a whole variety of things, right, the store, brand, name and so forth. So it's a broader component than just saying private label. And I think that's key, because when people think of private label or when I think of private label, you could think about going into the grocery store and grabbing a different milk.","It goes well, well, well beyond that, this entire kind of customized product offering that we have. And frankly, I believe the market is going to continue to shift in that direction, which it has been. The market is kind of splitting and saying, hey branded is important, there's no question about that, but these customized product offerings are important also. And being able to offer premier shipping and specialized customized services to people is very important.","So that's a big part of our business right now. I guess I won't put numbers on it, but I'd say it's a pretty decent part of our business right now and it's growing. I mean we're here to drive new wearers to contact lenses, we're here to help our partners, drive those wearers.","So at the end of the day the key thing for us is, there is wearers out there they're going to practitioners offices and we want to help that whether that's a retail chain or buying group or whatever it is, but we want to help that partner grow the category and help them retain their wearers. So all that kind of customization is a big sell point for us in terms of being able to do that.","Christian Moore","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. The first question on CSI, second one on free cash flow. On the CSI side, it seems like your guidance for next year a little conservative when we consider how well PARAGARD is doing and the fact that you're calling for a return to growth in the fertility side. So can you maybe help us reconcile kind of some of the push pulls on what would get you to sort of the higher end of the range versus lower end, just trying to think about where you guys see risk in either direction on that part of the business?","Albert White","Yes sure, and I hope you're right, I hope that, that range is conservative. We thought about that, a decent amount as we were pulling it together, because I think that the fertility business is going to be mid-upper single-digit grower, including the genomics piece in there. And I do think PARAGARD is going to be mid single-digits and I'd like to think that frankly both of those have some upside.","And then I look at the base business that we've always talked about low single-digits and we've had a couple good quarters there and I'd like to think that continues strong. So I feel maybe overly optimistic, but being in the upper part of that range is something we can do.","Having said that, the base part of the business for a number of years was relatively flat. A lot of those products are older products, so we've had some success, but if that goes back to kind of being flat, it's a decent size, decent part of our business and if PARAGARD is indeed a mid single-digit grower, I could see us getting towards the bottom end of that range. So I would hope that doesn't happen and I'm optimistic it won't, but I think again, to start the year off that's kind of a good prudent range to provide.","Isaac Ro","Makes sense. And then on the free cash flow, interested in some of the moving parts between working capital changes and CapEx. And the reason I ask is, it look like you guys are on track for a pretty good uptick year-on-year this year for CapEx. I think last year was just over a $100 million, this year trending closer to $200 million. So if you can give us a sense of, when you \u2013 when you mention the investments you're making to serve the customer for next year, what that means for the CapEx trajectory and whether or not there are any other moving parts and working capital that would help derive that free cash number that you guided to? Thanks.","Albert White","Yes. I wouldn't put too much on working capital. We've a lot of growth outside of the U.S., which puts some pressure on working capital. I think you'll get a little fluctuation, because some of inventory and we discussed Brexit a little earlier, maybe being a little higher and then coming down, but then that I probably wouldn't put too much on that. I think the bigger pressure point is on CapEx related to daily manufacturing lines. At the end of day, I think that's the key point.","We have a number of new lines coming in right now that we've ordered. I feel good about all the capacity expansion that we're doing. If we keep going like we're going, we might have to order some additional lines and you're going to have more payments. So I definitely think we're going to be over $200 million of CapEx this year. I mean, we're ordering in anticipation of continued strong growth.","So I think you'll see that and that'll be the kind of one thing that holds back CapEx a little bit, otherwise we'd probably get a pretty good pop. This operating cash flow is going to show a nice increase. So I think we'll see how that plays out during the year. I'd say, yes, it feel pretty good about at least being able to put up another strong year approaching 500. And we'll see, I mean as I said earlier on something else, I kind of would like to see all this key account business continue to grow and our revenues continue to grow strong as it is which would mean maybe order in a couple of more lines which should be okay.","Isaac Ro","Okay. Thanks for all that detail.","Albert White","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks for taking my question. Just a few on margins and I'll just throw them out there. Maybe can you give us a sense Al of just margins from key accounts, is that a headwind or is that a neutral factor? And then maybe a little bit of color on the British pound, obviously that's down, I'm just wondering when should we expect that benefit to roll through the P&L? And then lastly just on sales force expansion, obviously that was a build in 2018, are those done and is that a neutral factor for next year? Thanks.","Albert White","Sure. I'll take those backwards. Sales force expansion we are still continuing to add to our sales force, but more in the normal course of business right now adding sales people as we grow make sense, see that in Asia-Pac is a good example. But I wouldn't pull that out as we had in the past and say oh that's a big kind of all this expense or something associated with this year because we're in pretty good shape with the sales force expansion that we've done over the last couple years, so I\u2019d kind of say hey that's normal.","With respect to the pound, we'll see what's going to happen with Brexit and that pound can move around a lot obviously. That rolls through our P&L six months later, we still manufacture a decent part of our product in the UK and then those cost could capitalize where that currency rate is and flows through our P&L roughly six months later. So there is a delay in terms of the pound.","And if you're trying to model our currency rate, you get the obvious, immediate impact on currency and revenues and operating expenses with the lag in the pound, which I know creates problems now and then when trying to model individual quarters, but that's the easiest way to think about it is a six month lag.","With respect to key account margins, I'm going to answer that from an operating margin perspective, which is the way that we have a tendency to look at our business and that we try to make it a win-win. We try to make it a win for our partners who we're working with, who are going to drive revenues and drive profitability and we try to do the same for us.","So I'm not going to really get into the specifics around any individual or even key accounts in general, but we've obviously built all that into our guidance and we do expect even in the face of currency operating margins to expand a little bit this year over last year.","Anthony Petrone","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Christopher Hartstein","Hi, this is Chris Hartstein in for Chris. I have another question on the surgical side of the business, over a year-ago when you announced the PARAGARD deal, you gave accretion guidance of $0.70 to $0.75. If I remember correctly this guidance assumed a 4% interest rate and a 35% U.S. tax rate, both of which look a bit conservative year later. Could you please provide where the accretion shook out for the full-year there? Thanks. I have a follow-up.","Albert White","Yes, sure. I'm not going to give you specific number on that because honestly I haven't calculated it. I will agree with you that from the time we did that deal, when you look at the tax rate and you look at the success of the business, the revenues, because obviously we gave some initial revenues guidance versus where we came in that is turned out to be a very nice deal and the returns on that are much stronger than we had anticipated they were going to be when they did the deal.","Having said that, let's not forget that we did add a lot of sales people, I mean initially we were looking at our existing sales force and medical device products, selling that product we've split that now where we have kind of the two sales forces, one selling medical device products, one selling PARAGARD and we've done a lot of advertising and promotional work there in order to drive success in fiscal 2019.","So at some point I believe those sales groups have come back together, maybe that's a couple years out, but we'll pull that together so we're selling as a more one unified front, but I'd say yes a number of more pluses than anything, but a number of investments in that business also.","Christopher Hartstein","Okay, great. That's a nice lead in for my next question. In that same vein it's now been three straight quarters or above trend growth in the PARAGARD business, given the investments you've been making there, and a year after there is a news in Journal of Medical study linking hormonal contraceptives to a higher risk breast cancer. While you still view this as a mid single-digit grower as we look ahead into fiscal 2019, especially considering the easy accounting related comp in 1Q? Thanks.","Albert White","Yes. I'm optimistic about PARAGARD growth and as a matter of fact, we've made some good advancements there. I mean we have a new website if you go to paragard.com, which is much better I think than the old one and we're doing some really targeted marketing activity. The marketing team there has done a really, really nice job, I'm impressed with everything coming out of that group.","And it builds on you're right, the New England Journal of Medicine publication and so forth, which is a positive for that product as a non-hormonal IUD option. I would say all that stuff positive, all good, feel good about the momentum, feel good about the opportunity for a multi-year growth strategy.","I always try to temper that with this is a product that's been in the market for 30 years. So you are seeing IUDs grow, you're seeing our product actually obviously show better growth in the marketplace there and feel good about it. But it is a product that has been around a long time. So I definitely do not want to get out in front of ourselves there. I'm hoping that we can continue to put up some good numbers there though.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Robert Cottrell","Hey, good evening. This is actually Rob Cottrell on for Steve. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Two quick questions around longer-term outlook; one, with the trade-up to dailies, can that frequent replacement other line continue to grow in that 2% range over the long-term?","Albert White","Yes, that's a good question. When you look at that reusable market, it is growing a little bit, it grew just a little bit this quarter, we're obviously growing a little bit faster. I believe that where we're probably settling in right now when you look at the reusable market meeting all the two-week in the monthly market that there is some growth there from products like Biofinity Energys and some of the Torics and some of the Multifocals out there and there are some growth opportunities as you move into more emerging markets, because of the cost point of those.","So I do think that we're going to be flat to up slightly there. I think that's probably the way to look at it long-term or at least for many years in front of us. All the growth \u2013 real growth will be coming from dailies and especially silicone hydrogels to dailies. But I think the reusable market flat to up a little bit probably is where it holds.","Robert Cottrell","Great. Thanks Al. And then lastly, just you mentioned myopia control leading to increased R&D activities. Have you put any numbers around the opportunity for that either near-term or longer-term?","Albert White","We have not yet. Stay tuned on that that's something we're excited about. We're definitely excited about that. We're excited about the clinical work we've done. We're excited about the reception that we're seeing from the market, some of our key accounts who are more strategic and kind of looking ahead a little bit more are analyzing that to see how they can properly roll that out. We're trying to work with them on that. So that is an area we're excited about and intrigued about, but it's still early stage. So no, we have not put numbers on that but stay tuned.","Robert Cottrell","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Steven Lichtman","Thank you. Hi guys. Just going back to Asia-Pac, you talked about the strength there earlier in your prepared remarks, Al, I think you specifically talked about a jump in Clariti in Asia-Pac. Is there something in particular that's opened up in the Asia-Pac market specifically for Clariti or nothing really to call out?","Albert White","Yes, I'm not sure I highlighted anything in particular necessarily other than the region has a little bit lower market share and the size of it is a little bit lower. When you look at Clariti, it's doing well there. We're rolling out in a number of countries there and I'm not sure I'd highlight necessarily anything specific other than, yes, product is doing well on it is actually accelerated off the prior quarter.","Steven Lichtman","Got it. And then Al, as you look at your outlook for the market, is your underlying assumption on price relatively flat? I mean, what's your overall view on price as you think about price increases versus rebates, et cetera?","Albert White","Yes. Right now it's flat, you\u2019re right. If you look at core pricing maybe going up a little bit, but the rebate activity creating an environment where net it's flat. That's kind of how we're looking at it right now. I probably say this every call, but I'd love to see pricing start to move up. That could be some easy growth for us. We are not forecasting or assuming that right now.","Steven Lichtman","Got it. Thanks Al.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. And there are no further questions in the queue. So now, it's my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Al White, President and CEO for closing comments or remarks.","Albert White","Yes. Great. Thank you everyone, I appreciate your time. And we're going to continue to plug away. We're going to continue to work hard. Everything we talked to you guys about, we're going to continue to work hard and continue on and look forward to catching up in roughly 90 days again on our next quarter and hopefully delivering a positive message.","So with that we'll sign off and speak with everyone later. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program and we may all disconnect.

Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2019 conference call. We\u2019re off to a strong start this year, as we continue successfully implementing our strategic objectives such as investing in key accounts, increasing promotional activity and investing in infrastructure. These efforts are all tied to producing strong sustainable revenue growth and they are paying off.","For the quarter, we reported $628 million in consolidated revenue, up 6% year-over-year, up 8% pro forma. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.88.","CooperVision posted revenues of $470 million, up 6% as reported or up 8% pro forma. CooperSurgical posted revenues of $158 million, up 9% as reported or up 8% pro forma.","I\u2019m extremely pleased with these results, as our focus on increasing our strategic partnership activity and supporting our market leading products is producing strong results.","For CooperVision, the strength was seen throughout the world. The Americas was up 4%, EMEA 9% and Asia Pac 13%, all pro forma. All three regions were led by continuing strength from our daily silicone hydrogel lenses, which grew 38% pro forma.","The Americas in particular posted significant strength around daily silicones with both clariti and MyDay performing well. EMEA was very strong, led by daily silicones, torics and multifocals, while Asia-Pac posted another robust quarter led by daily silicones and Biofinity. So I\u2019m happy to see strong and diverse growth around the world, driven by strong products and exemplary sales and service.","Regarding product families, both our daily silicone hydrogel franchises clariti and MyDay are performing extremely well and our focus will remain on these product families as the global contact lens market continues to shift in this direction.","Outside of dailies, Biofinity and Avaira Vitality continued performing well, combining the growth 7%. As a reminder, these two silicone hydrogel product families comprised our focus in the FRP or Frequent Replacement Product market which encompasses the two week and monthly modalities.","Also included in this segment are unique products such as Biofinity Energys, which helps individuals deal with digital eye fatigue. We also saw strength in torics and multifocals this quarter with torics growing 9% and multifocals up 8%, both pro forma.","Turning to the market, the global soft contact lens market grew 8% in calendar 2018 to roughly $8.7 billion. Within this we grew 10% and I\u2019m extremely happy to report our market share increased to 24%, so we\u2019re now tied with Alcon in the number two spot, while we estimated J&J share at 40%, B&L at 8%, and then a few small manufacturers making up the rest.","The primary growth driver for the market continues to be daily lenses which grew 13% last year and now accounts for roughly $4.6 billion or 53% of the total market. Within the segment, silicone hydrogel lenses drove the growth up 34%.","It\u2019s important to note that although 53% of revenue dollars are in daily lenses, the percentage of actual wearers in dailies is much lower due to the price difference. We estimate daily wearers encompass somewhere in the low to mid 20% range of the overall market and thus offer a very significant long-term trade up opportunity for the entire contact lens industry.","And regarding future market growth, you\u2019ve heard me talk about the positive trends in the contact lens market and these remain in place, be it the increasing incidence of myopia around the world, the global transition to daily contact lenses, geographic expansion or growth in torics and multifocals, the future looks very bright for our industry. I\u2019m not sure the market will continue growing 8% as it did this past year, but I could certainly see it growing 5% to 6% plus for several years in the future.","Turning to our strategy, I want to mention a few important points around our growth initiatives and silicone hydrogel one day lenses, key accounts, and our efforts around customized product offerings.","The shift to one day lenses from FRPs generates roughly two to three times more revenue per patient and within the one day market, the trade up from a traditional hydrogel to a silicone hydrogel generates an additional roughly 20% premium. This is great for the industry and I expect all contact lens manufacturers to continue sharing in this multi-year trade up trend as a rising tide should lift all boats.","Having said that, what\u2019s unique to Cooper is our current market share within dailies is only 18% compared to roughly 31% within the FRP space. This shows that if we can get our fair share of new daily fits, we should post strong growth for years to come and I\u2019m confident we can do that based on our momentum, our strong product portfolio and the positive new fit data.","Regarding key accounts, we\u2019re continuing to strongly support these strategic partnerships with a focus on helping them grow and retain their customer base. These are extremely knowledgeable business people and they understand the growth potential for contact lenses and that it goes well beyond the shift to dailies.","In particular, they appreciate the value of cross-selling contact lenses to their customers who wear glasses, working to reduce contact lens dropout rates, the value of fitting the best lenses for each situation such as torics and multifocals and the growth potential of expanding geographically. And we\u2019re here to help them in each of these areas driving growth in their businesses.","Regarding our customized product offerings, we\u2019re making excellent advancements within distribution, labeling, and packaging to support our efforts around providing customers a diverse set of options to help them grow and retain their patient base.","This includes opening new facilities, expanding others, upgrading systems and increasing our use of automation to become more efficient. All of this activity is very important in today\u2019s world where customers expect premier behind the scene support.","Finally, before moving to CooperSurgical just a quick note to say we completed the acquisition of Blanchard in January which is another specialty lens company with a strong position in scleral lenses.","Although, this is a small market focused on providing contact lenses to patients with concern such as irregular corneas hard-to-fit eyes or people with severe dry eye problems this is another step in growing our specialty business, which we\u2019re excited about.","Moving to CooperSurgical. We reported revenues of $158 million, up 8% pro forma. Fertility posted strong results growing 9% as last quarter\u2019s integration activity move behind us. We continue to believe the global fertility market has fantastic long-term growth potential and we are a market leader in the space.","As a reminder, this part of our business includes products like media, IVF medical devices and genomics and these products are sold throughout the world.","Outside of fertility, our office in surgical business grew 7% pro forma with strength noted in PARAGARD which is the only non-hormonal IUD or long-acting reversible contraceptive on the US market. This product grew 10% even off on an extremely strong fourth quarter and we continue to believe it will do well going forward.","Supporting this growth as an active advertising campaign including TV ads and select geographies, print media and social media. Depending on the market that you would and you may have seen the TV ads, but if not check out PARAGARD.com where you can see the commercial.","Although early in the campaign this promotional activity has generated significant interest and we\u2019ve seen dramatic increases and visits to our website and much greater discussion on social media.","In conjunction with this activity, we\u2019ve also been investing heavily in physician training to support practitioners as request for PARAGARD from their patient\u2019s increases.","We\u2019re closely monitoring these marketing efforts, evaluating the cost benefit, but early indications are very positive and we\u2019ve thus accelerated promotional activity that was planned for later this year into Q2 to allow us to concentrate this activity and obtain a more effective understanding of its impact.","After this quarter, we plan to return promotional activity to more normal levels to allow time to analyze the data and determine an appropriate go-forward marketing investment strategy.","Given PARAGARD has only roughly 17% market share in the 1 billion US IUD market, we believe there exist significant opportunity for future growth, if we can effectively communicate the advantages of the product. Outside of PARAGARD, our office in surgical business grew a solid 5% pro forma.","Lastly on CooperSurgical, we had two small business development items I want to quickly mention. First, we acquired a small company named Incisive Surgical in January which sells unique absorbable skin staple called INSORB.","Second Utah Medical brought backed out their US distribution rights with the Filshie Clip. The impact on revenues going forward is minimal as they offset one another.","So in conclusion, we\u2019re having a strong start to this year and I continue to feel very positive about the direction of the company. I want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication as that\u2019s what\u2019s driving our success.","And I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Andrews","Thank you, Al. And good afternoon, everyone. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today\u2019s earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Al covered revenues, so I\u2019ll focus on the rest of the financials and guidance.","Consolidated gross margins in the quarter held steady at 67.5% year-over-year. CooperVision\u2019s gross margin was 66%, down from 67.1% last year with the entire decline being attributable to currency. Outside of currency, operational positives such as product mix were offset by items such as rebates and temporarily higher secondary handling costs.","CooperSurgical\u2019s gross margin improved significantly to 70% to 72% from 68.8% last year driven by product mix including higher sales of PARAGARD and fertility products.","Consolidated operating expenses grew 9.9% in the quarter driven by increased investing in sales and marketing in both CooperVision and CooperSurgical. This includes both businesses continuing to enhance their sales forces by selectively hiring around the world with a focus on key accounts.","Within CooperVision, we also saw increased investments in distribution where we continue upgrading our infrastructure along with higher R&D, including continued activity around myopia management. Within CooperSurgical, operating expenses grew mainly associated to higher sales and marketing costs related to PARAGARD.","Operating income improved year-over-year by roughly $2 million even in the face of currency headwinds and the operating margin for the quarter was 26.2%. Below operating income, we reported $18.2 million of interest expense and an effective tax rate of 2.6%.","This low tax rate was driven by several factors including favorable internal restructuring activities, excess tax benefits received from the exercise of stock options and an audit settlement.","Notably regarding the audit settlement, we reached a final agreement with the UK Tax Authorities associated with our dispute over the transfer valuation of certain intellectual properties associated with the SoftOne acquisition. The settlement resulted in a refund of $29 million from the $42 million we paid in Q1 of last year.","Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $2.88 with roughly 49.9 million average shares outstanding. Free cash flow was $22.6 million, comprised of $101.8 million of operating cash flow offset by $79.2 million of CapEx.","Net debt increased by $41 million to $1.989 billion. The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of Incisive Surgical for $33 million and Blanchard for $31 million offset by operating cash flow.","Moving to guidance. We are increasing our consolidated fiscal 2019 revenue guidance to 2.631 billion to 2.676 billion. This includes raising CooperVision to 6.5% to 8% pro forma growth or $1.968 billion to $1.995 billion reflecting the strength we saw in Q1 and our belief that the rest of the year should be strong even against hard comps in the back half of the year. CooperSurgical\u2019s revenue guidance is also being increased slightly to a stronger 3% to 6% pro forma or $663 million to $681 million reflecting our strong Q1.","Outside of revenue, we continue to expect gross and operating margins to improve slightly year-over-year. Interest expense is expected to be slightly lower as we\u2019re now assuming only one additional 25 basis point rate hike which we model to occur later this month. ","As for taxes, we\u2019re now expecting a full year effective tax rate around 11%, down from our previous expectation of around 14%. This reflects Q1 and our latest expectations for the remainder of the year.","On FX, currency has moved slightly in our favor and we\u2019re now forecasting a negative $0.47 of FX this year, $0. 08 better than our initial guidance provided in December. Having said that, this $0.08 is offset by the Filshie clip transaction which resulted in the receipt of $21 million of cash, but the loss of near term earnings.","Incorporating all of this, we\u2019re increasing our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance to $11.85 to $12.15, up $0.50 at the midpoint. This increase is roughly comprised of $0.40 from tax, $0.07 from operational improvements and $0.03 from lower interest expense.","With respect to quarterly gating, as Al mentioned, we\u2019re shifting marketing spend associated with PARAGARD from the end of this year into Q2 and now anticipate fiscal Q2 non-GAAP EPS in a range of $2.70 to $2.80. Q3 and Q4 now expected to be slightly stronger than initially expected due to this.","And with that, I\u2019ll hand it back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me, okay?","Albert White","Yes.","Brian Andrews","Hey, Jeff.","Jeff Johnson","Great. Hi, Brian and hi, Al. How are you? So just wanted to start may be on CVI. On the European number, that number definitely came in a little bit better than we were expecting. I think, it stayed sequentially kind of stable at 9% versus where it had been a quarter before, but the comp was about 500 basis points tougher.","So just wondering, is that kind of a sign of some of that big retail business, some of the kind of big account wins? And is that - is there some sustainability to that strength in Europe than even as comps get kind of tougher this year throughout the year? Thanks.","Albert White","Yes. I would say yes to both of those. I mean, it is attributable to strengths we\u2019re seeing in key accounts. We kind of talked generically or broadly about key accounts around the world as there are obviously key accounts in different regions and some span multiple regions.","But when you look at the European region, there are a number of important key accounts there and we\u2019ve had success there and we believe we\u2019re going to have success going forward.","Part of the reason that we took our guidance up to 6.5% to 8% for CooperVision was to one, reflect the success we have in the first quarter, but two, kind of just show the confidence we have in the CooperVision numbers in total, including Europe, even against the challenging comps in the back half of the year.","Jeff Johnson","Yes, understood. And then maybe on PARAGARD, just as my follow up question. That 10% number, I know, is a good number. It did come in maybe a little light of what we were expecting and maybe we were just out of line with our expectations. But I thought you had some easy inventory comps there.","So again, just want to do a reality check, where was the PARAGARD performance this quarter relative to your expectations? And how is that performing at the profitability line as well?","Albert White","Yes. That\u2019s fair point. Q1 was a pretty easy comp because of PARAGARD. We had all that noise last year, it seemed like almost in every corner, with respect to channel inventory and trying to settle things down. But at the end of the day, the 10% growth that we had in Q1 for PARAGARD was in line with our expectations. So that\u2019s kind of the improvement.","That product is, as you know, is a very profitable product for us, having said that, we are reinvesting a lot of those dollars. I touched on that a little bit. Brian actually quantified that to some degree in terms of some of the investment activity we\u2019re pulling into the second quarter.","So I won\u2019t comment on direct profitability associated with it, other than to say it is indeed a highly profitable product and one that we really truly want to try to drive growth out of.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a really nice quarter Al. One geographic question, one tax\/EPS question. So, EMEA was very strong at 9%, but Al, Americas did dip to 4% from 8% last quarter and actually the comp was a bit easier.","So I mean, we did hear some anecdotal feedback that late in the year, the US market was a little soft. Can you provide any color on that and expectations going forward? And I have one follow-up.","Albert White","Yes, I would agree with that. I think if you look at our results and the result of our competitors out there - with their numbers, it show some of the weakness that was in the US market. I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s anything particularly that needs to be pulled off out of that right like any true fundamental change in the business. I think it was just a little bit softer of a quarter and that\u2019s okay. That happens sometimes and there\u2019s not too much we can do about that.","I mean, we grew 4%, so we obviously believe that we continue to take market share there and are happy with that number in terms of putting in the context of the overall market growth.","Larry Biegelsen","And then on EPS, Al, one, on the tax rate that 11%, how should we think about that going forward? And I know it\u2019s early, but just wanted to hear from you if you feel like you can get back to double-digit EPS growth in fiscal 2020. It\u2019s encouraging to see the guidance come up today for fiscal 2019 and how it\u2019s about mid single digits at the mid point, but how should we think about looking forward a little bit? Thanks for taking the question.","Albert White","Yes. I mean we have the low tax rate. There was a decent amount of activity this quarter that brought it down. I\u2019m talking about Q1, Q2, 3, and 4 will be somewhat similar in the low teens is our expectation.","If you look at next year, most of this activity is directly associated with this fiscal year, meaning, we would expect next year probably to be closer to a more normalized rate at 14%. Again, that wouldn\u2019t include like stock option equity and some of that kind of stuff which could pull it lower. But I think we\u2019ll can kind of go to that 14%-ish kind of rate that we talked about in the past.","With respect to getting to double-digit EPS growth, I was pretty clear that I felt really strong about that that we can do that. Now, the effective tax rate coming in at 11% going to 14% next year means we need to hurdle that, but we\u2019ll see what we can do on that. I don\u2019t want to get into guidance yet for next fiscal year.","But I continue to believe the fundamentals of the business are very strong, you can see that especially in the revenue growth. So I continue to be pretty optimistic about back half of the year and next year.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks, Al.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Cooley with Stephens.","Chris Cooley","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. I appreciate taking the questions. Al, I just wanted to see if you can maybe give us a little bit of an update on MiSight and myopia [ph] control, a lot of interest in myopia control at SECO this past weekend on both the frame, as well as the contact lens front with very limited data so far.","So could you just maybe give us an update on how that\u2019s tracking from an R&D perspective? And when we could start to see that here in the states? And I\u2019ve got one quick follow-up.","Albert White","Yes, definitely a fair question. I mean, we\u2019re excited about MiSight and the entire myopia management field here within CooperVision, there\u2019s no question about that and we\u2019re doing a lot of work on that internally. Some of that you obviously see in the R&D line and then some of it\u2019s within our operating expense infrastructure right now.","So, we\u2019re excited about it. We believe in the future. We believe there\u2019s actually significant upside there and I think that when you look at myopia management, you talk about getting kids into contact lenses, who are may be 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 year old that type of thing that expands the market for contact lenses that are also obviously helps everyone with visual correction.","Another interesting stat is the average contact lens where wears their lenses around seven years, but if they\u2019re fit in a contact lens first as their first form of visual correction rather than glasses they wore contact lenses on average 14 years. So getting wear into contact lenses to start is a significant advantage for the contact lens industry.","Having said all that, it\u2019s still a little early. I\u2019ve kind of held off a little bit of the myopia management side and MiSight and I\u2019m excited as you could tell about it. But I don\u2019t want to get too many details on it yet.","We\u2019re working through the approval process in the US market. We have the lens in the market in select countries around the world so we\u2019re making progress at the right point in time. I\u2019ll kind of get into that into more detail.","Chris Cooley","Appreciate the color. And then if I could just follow-up on Jeff\u2019s earlier on questions on PARAGARD. I know in the past you\u2019ve talked about the incremental spend at the marking effort and needing to see that requisite margin dropped through.","Can you just give us may be some broad strokes around what you saw in those markets where you rolled out the dancing in the streets marketing initiative there what type of pull-through are you seeing at the OB\/GYN level just kind of script conversion just trying to get an idea of some metrics that we see this incremental spend in the 2Q, what type of growth we should kind of model thereafter? Thanks so much.","Albert White","Yes, Chris. That\u2019s a great question. It\u2019s kind of same question that I have right now. So what we\u2019ve seen is we went into those markets, we did the TV commercials and the reaction has been very positive. We\u2019ve seen a very significant increase in traffic on our sites and PARAGARD related sites, whether it\u2019s blogs or anything along those lines in the social media side definitely much higher in those markets where we\u2019ve done the TV advertising.","How does that TV advertising in that significant increase in activity relate to or translate to actual product sales? That\u2019s a little bit more of the question. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now and we\u2019re going to continue the type of activity for several more months here. We ran it through February. We are in March, we are April those dollars are fairly large, but it\u2019s really a matter right now saying okay, how does that translate. There is a lot of activities. There\u2019s a lot of excitement. There\u2019s a lot of positive energy and discussion around the positive attributes of PARAGARD. Does that translate to actual wearer in - the wear base increasing?","So that\u2019s a little bit of a question mark right now. I mean, we\u2019re doing the work. We\u2019re tracking it carefully. I think we\u2019re doing everything right. I\u2019ve 100% confidence in the team who is working on that.","For now, we haven\u2019t really changed our guidance with respect to PARAGARD. I think because of the comps PARAGARD has kind of a challenge back half of the year, but we\u2019ll see maybe we can do little bit better. I\u2019ll give you - I\u2019ll be able to definitely give you more information on the next earnings calls to how some of that translate into actual sales though.","Chris Cooley","Thank you for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby","Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. One for Al and one for Brian. Maybe Brian, first if you could just provide a little more color on the tax audit that you broke out or the refund you broke out.","Could you just clarify the $42 million charged a year ago and then the $29 million refund this year. It wasn\u2019t clear to me in your P&L whether those were included or excluded in non-GAAP results in both periods?","And then secondly for Al maybe Al if you could just provide a little more color as it relates to some of the strategic accounts what\u2019s the customers are finding most interesting as you\u2019re partnering with these people? Is it inventory, pricing, private label, distribution or kind of all of the above?","Brian Andrews","Sure. So Steve, I\u2019ll handle the first one. As far as the DPT payment we made in Q1 of last year, in Q1 that impacted our free cash flow and took us down. The $29 million that we received as a result of the tax settlement actually was received - the cash was received in Q2.","So it\u2019ll improve our free cash flow in Q2, but the impact from the settlement resulted in our tax rate - well that was part of the one of the three reasons, the primary drivers of our tax rate going down at 2.6% in Q1.","Steve Willoughby","If I could just follow up real quick on that Brian, so not the labor and tax question on the call, but so a year ago then was it the $42 million was that charge included or excluded in non-GAAP numbers?","Brian Andrews","That was included in Q1 of last year. ","Steve Willoughby","Okay. Thank you. Perfect.","Albert White","On strategic accounts Steve, I can\u2019t say, it\u2019s all about the things that you mentioned. I think whether it\u2019s the ability to offer customer brands kind of as we historically talked about is private label, like the ability to offer customer brands, the ability to shift direct in many cases, our willingness and ability to do customized labeling and packaging all of that stuff and you combine that with our desire and our willingness to offer better marketing and promotional support.","And haven\u2019t all that kind of be tied in supporting key account. Like it\u2019s the key accounts relationship, we\u2019re here to support that key account and help them grow their wearer base and retain their wearer base. That\u2019s what we focus on and that\u2019s key and that entire message is being received really well by key accounts.","So I\u2019m not sure I would necessarily call one thing, but I would say the whole gamut of what we\u2019re offering from a customized solution perspective is what intrigues those key accounts. ","Steve Willoughby","Okay. Thanks, Al.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Block with Stifel. ","Jonathan Block","Thanks, guys. And apologize in advance if any question already asked. But maybe two for me. The first is, on some of the investments in CVI from a shipping perspective. Do you think those investments become leverageable so to say in 2020? Or do you believe there\u2019s going to be sort of a long tail or a longer tail of that as a fulfillment remains a big priority for the company? And then I got a quick follow-up.","Albert White","Yes, I don\u2019t think where we are today that we\u2019ll leverage those distribution items next fiscal year. My guess is the distribution expenses kind of grow in line with revenues, that\u2019s what I would expect.","I mean we\u2019re doing a lot of distribution expansion right now, a lot of upgrade work and so forth and so the expenses are heightened. I think that gets better next year, again growing kind of equal to revenues. And then I would expect that we\u2019ll probably see leverage from the distribution expense line in fiscal 2021.","Jonathan Block","Okay. And then if I can ask sort of a part B to that. Just goes throughout the P&L. I wouldn\u2019t think that\u2019s obviously a huge investment for you guys. Is there another ones either reps that you brought on, on CSI side specific to your initiatives are on PARAGARD.","So is there a way to think about maybe that item, if the DTC initiatives are successful that that might be a more leverageable line item next year because you brought in the reps, you will have some success arguably with the TV initiatives and maybe that\u2019s one where you start to see some leverage work, its way through the P&L next year?","Albert White","Yes. I would absolutely agree with that. We have around 60 direct sales reps right now in PARAGARD, about 20 reps internally. We hired those individuals kind of over the last year or so. So as we annualize that, that makes life a little bit easier, right. But we get into next fiscal year, you\u2019re absolutely correct, like, we\u2019ll be able to leverage that some.","I still believe that at some point in the future, we\u2019ll be able to combine those sales reps to some degree with our existing sales infrastructure \u2013 or sales reps doing our in-office medical devices now. We\u2019re not, obviously, doing that now, but we will in the future.","So I do believe there\u2019s some leverage opportunities within CooperSurgical. It\u2019s just, now is not the time to do that. We\u2019re really working on driving revenue growth in that business and we\u2019ll continue to for the foreseeable future.","Jonathan Block","Okay. And I hate to borrow one here and based on Steve\u2019s prior comments, I guess, I missed the color on the call. But maybe if you can just help me out, the tax rate going forward, does this dip down specific to fiscal 2019? It sounds like per your prior comments it may be, because there might have been a specific credit or refund?","Or do we sort of, when we look out and I think many of us has assumed that 14-ish-percent tax rate was the new level set going forward. Does that still take hold or we do we lower it going forward as well? Thanks guys.","Albert White","Yes. I think the 14% would be for now the correct way to look at next year. This activity was \u2013 will be \u2013 it was in Q1, it will all be within this fiscal year. So I think next year 14% will be the appropriate rate to use.","Jonathan Block","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks. May be one on MiSight, one on PARAGARD, just to may be get an idea of market opportunities. Just on MiSight, is there anything you could share just on exactly what the opportunity is within the US for myopia control for pediatric patients, so that would be in dollars if you have that information. That\u2019ll be the first question.","And the second on PARAGARD would be, just do have any information on sort of the number of active prescribers today and sort of where you think that can go with the direct to consumer advertising campaign? Thanks.","Albert White","Yes. Let me touch on PARAGARD. When we look at PARAGARD, some of the stuff that we\u2019ve learned is that it\u2019s important to get some brand awareness out in the marketplace. The physicians know the PARAGARD exists. It\u2019s been out there for a little while. They know it exists and if a patient walks in the door and ask about it, or specifically ask for it, then the doc discusses it with them and frequently that\u2019s the product that they walk away with.","So the feedback that we\u2019ve received from all the work that we\u2019ve been doing is create and - including from the physicians is, create some brand awareness about this. Let\u2019s talk about this, let\u2019s have a discussion around in non-hormonal advantages associated with this product. That\u2019s why you hear us talking more about the branding side and the advertising and social media marketing side of things.","We are also doing the training with the doctor. A lot of that activity is more just a reminder to the doctor hey, this product was not being supported or was not being heavily supported, marketed and so forth. It\u2019s still here, it still exists. As a company, we\u2019re obviously dedicated to the space. It\u2019s a very important space to us and we\u2019re going to continue to support this. So as individuals come in and ask for this product, doc, let them know that it\u2019s here and as a reminder do you hear the advantage of it - advantages of it. So that kind of gives a little bit of color around that.","On MiSight or myopia management in general, I\u2019m not going to get into any numbers yet. The only thing I would point you to on that is, myopia management really when we get into it is, you\u2019re talking about kind of kids, let\u2019s call it, eight years old to 13 years old, right? I mean children started going into contact lenses on their own around 13, 14 and it\u2019s not myopia management lenses, but they\u2019re still going - starting visual correction in the form of contact lenses.","How big is that 8 to 13 year old marketplace? It could be pretty significant. I mean it could certainly be fairly significant in the US and it could be on a global basis also. But there\u2019s still a lot of work to do there. So I don\u2019t want to get over our SKUs here. There\u2019s still a lot of work that we need to do and I don\u2019t want to start quoting numbers yet.","Anthony Petrone","Fair enough. Thanks, again.","Albert White","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc.","Matthew Mishan","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Al I\u2019m going to risk embarrassing myself with some poor math on the call here which is probably also why you moved away from these numbers giving them every quarter.","But I have 8% pro forma growth for CooperVision last year for your 2018. I believe you said calendar year that growth was 10%. Does that mean that November and December would have been much stronger than January? Did I get that math right?","Albert White","Yes. So you got two things that go in there. One is the fact that it\u2019s calendar versus fiscal. The other is the market data that we quote ends up being manufacturer sales data. It\u2019s our data, but it\u2019s not a gross basis versus a net basis.","So that\u2019s one of the reasons we pulled that out is because it was a little confusing, right, so you have to look at it a little bit more in directional basis. That\u2019s probably the easiest answer to give you on that.","You\u2019re exactly right, that\u2019s what we pulled some of those numbers out because the market data is great directionally, but when you really peel specifically into the numbers, it gets a little more challenging.","Matthew Mishan","Okay. Fair enough. And I\u2019m just trying to understand the legs of the key account strategy you have. I realized the key account is a broad term, but how should I think about how many more are there to sign? Is it a matter of increasing penetration with them or may be them like taking share in the market and you kind of growing with them?","Albert White","Yes, I think there\u2019s a few different ways that we look at that in terms of opportunities. There\u2019s no question that higher penetration rates within existing key account is very important. And we look at that from the context of saying we have a great relationship with someone we like to sell more lenses to that company.","The other way to look at it is to say we have key accounts where we have strong relationships with them, whether the relationship is stronger on the FRP side, the two-week or the monthly side and we really want to expand that relationship to the daily side.","Now that would be - you can look at that in terms of improved penetration rates also. But it\u2019s really to say, hey, we have a great relationship with you. Guys we love you, you love us, we have a great strategic partnership, let\u2019s expand that into daily silicone hydrogels as an example where in a lot of cases where we\u2019re under-penetrated there. So you get that.","And then you do get some situations where we do have either really low penetration or kind of minimal relationships with people as they grow. And we\u2019re trying to get into door to ensure that we\u2019re offering our full suite of products there. So, I think it\u2019s depending upon how you look at it comes from a few different angles.","Matthew Mishan","Okay. Thank you very much.","Albert White","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you very much for taking the question. It looks like the market accelerated the growth rate at the end of 2018. What do you think drove it to that 8% versus the historical 4% to 6% range. And how do you think that that\u2019s sustainable or not?","Albert White","Yes. A lot of that growth -- and obviously, it\u2019s always a little challenging by quarter, right. And you look at everyone\u2019s performance and then you have to look at prior years and comps and so forth, but you\u2019re right, there\u2019s strength in the marketplace right now.","A lot of that strength is getting driven by the factors that I was talking about, be it geographic expansion, be it growth in torics, multifocals and its heavily been driven by the shift to dailies. So within that sub-segment the silicone hydrogel daily component of the market.","There is a lot of growth potential in my opinion with those areas for many years. I mean, I believe that the shift to daily silicone hydrogel themselves has five, six, seven years something like that in front of us a pretty solid trade up growth from that. And then, when I look at geographic expansion as an example, I mean, some markets like India are tiny almost non-existent. I mean, they offer fantastic growth potential, same with China and a number of other markets that are out there.","And then when you look at markets wear that are more developed where you\u2019re having fits for like torics and multifocals like the U.S. and some other developed market. The penetration rates of those types of lenses are significantly higher than they are more underdeveloped countries.","And over the years, we\u2019ve always seen as countries develop contact lens usage increases and the fitting of the correct lens or the proper lens increases. And so I really believe we have many, many years in front of us as strong growth in the contact lens industry.","Joanne Wuensch","My second question has to do with SG&A spend, which increased year-over-year. Some of it is going to PARAGARD campaign but some of it is going into the key account strategy. Is it 50, 50? I mean, how do I think about how you decide which lever to pull for which franchise? Thank you.","Albert White","Yes. It varies by quarter. As Brian highlighted kind of at the end there, we are pulling some pretty decent promotional activity forward on CooperSurgical and that means that in Q2 you\u2019re going to have heightened activity associated with PARAGARD and that\u2019ll go back to normal.","I would say at the end of the day like we\u2019re investing in both of them. Like we\u2019re not afraid investing in both of them obviously within CooperVision we\u2019re doing everything we can.","Our business is incredibly important to us so whether it\u2019s investing in infrastructure, manufacturing capacity, key accounts salespeople and so forth we\u2019re driving everything. We\u2019re pulling every lever we believe we can that provides a good return by investing in that business.","Within CooperSurgical from a key accounts perspective we\u2019re also doing that, but as I discussed on PARAGARD we\u2019re being a little bit more selective here as we look at the cost benefit of that and coming up with the correct strategy.","Joanne Wuensch","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes with Matthew O\u2019Brien with Piper Jaffray.","Matthew O\u2019Brien","Afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess Al just for starters on the CVI performance. It\u2019s been very, very good. Dailies is quite good. It seems like you\u2019re pointing a lot towards the key accounts really driving a lot of that. Is there anything underlying in that business that\u2019s also doing well that we\u2019re not asking about?","And then back on the key partnerships side I think is there any kind of meaningful competitive response that you\u2019re seeing. I\u2019m assuming that your bigger competitors are also targeting these accounts. I mean, how are they responding to what you\u2019re doing and some of these account as you\u2019re taking share so quickly there?","Albert White","Yes. I think I kind of maybe answered both of those to some degree in the same way. I mean, we\u2019re the only company out there with the full and broad daily silicone hydrogel offering, right, the broadest like. We have MyDay on the premium side, we have clariti in the mass-market side we have full sweat and clariti is geared toward multifocal.","So we\u2019re out there. The products are out there in the marketplace. Obviously, we have competitors who have some products out in the marketplace, but for now we need to capitalize on the fact that we have a great broad product portfolio and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing and we\u2019re outselling that hard right now.","Now yes, competitors are going to come out with new products. Of course, they are. I mean, this is a highly competitive industry and it\u2019s not like some of the medical devices with heart valves or something like that. I mean we\u2019re 24% of the market. Alcon is J&J is, Bausch is, so people come out with new products all the time. We have new products in our back pockets and stuff that we\u2019ll be launching over time.","But for now the key on both of those is that, we have a great product portfolio and a highly energized team and that\u2019s the key behind our success. So we\u2019re anticipating competitors continuing to want to get back in and take share and we\u2019re doing -- through new products and we\u2019ll do the same through new products and we\u2019ll move the market.","Now one of the key points on this though and it\u2019s important to remember is that, as of the market shift to daily silicone hydrogel the market growth improves. And that\u2019s why I keep kind of going back to saying, this is not one guy wins one guy loses kind of thing.","This is the shift to daily silicone hydrogel and this trade-up and this geographic expansion and so forth is lifting all competitors. Everybody is getting better numbers. I mean, the market grew 8% last year. I continue to believe we\u2019re going to see strong growth in the marketplace. Everyone is going to grow as long as they\u2019re acting intelligently within the marketplace.","So I don\u2019t view this as kind of win-loss with competitors. I view this as a win-win. I think that we have a better product offering and some better capabilities than our competitors in the areas that we\u2019re focused on. We don\u2019t do the heavy branding like J&J does.","In the areas we\u2019re focused on, we have a great product set and a great skill set and we\u2019re executing and doing really well there so I think we\u2019ll continue to but that does not kind of disparage of our competitors who I believe continue to put up pretty good numbers. ","Matthew O\u2019Brien","That\u2019s very helpful. As a follow-up, you started to touch on this a little bit. It\u2019s just the Asia Pac growth continues to be very good. I\u2019m assuming most of that is Japan at this point, but China was an area that you guys have been talking about for years now.","Are we getting to any kind of an inflection point in that geography? And what kind of resource are you putting behind in that geography to deliver some outsized growth over the next couple of years?","Albert White","Yes, you\u2019re right. Japan is probably still around two-thirds of that market somewhere in that kind of range maybe it\u2019s 60%, 65% of that market. So it\u2019s an important driver there. The other countries that are there also important. Now that you mentioned China there\u2019s also a number of other countries and there. ","So we are seeing diverse growth throughout the entire region. We\u2019re under-indexed and there. There\u2019s no question about that. So it\u2019s incumbent upon us to invest there and we are investing there.","We are putting a focus on key accounts and salespeople and marketing and advertising efforts and we need to continue to do that. That team has done a very, very nice job over there and they\u2019ve done it for many years.","And frankly we continue to believe they\u2019ll do that for the foreseeable future. So I won\u2019t get into necessarily in particulars on that, but I would say that that\u2019s a very important region for us and we are investing dollars there and we will continue to invest dollars there.","Matthew O\u2019Brien","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Weinstein with William Blair.","Andrew Brackmann","This is Andrew Brackmann on for Brian. Al, maybe a strategic question for you, a lot of discussion has been sort of around the trade up in the dailies, but new wearers here sort of in developed markets how do you sort of grow that new wearer base in those markets? Does that still around key accounts? Is there anything else that you guys can do there? Thanks.","Albert White","Yes. We are seeing some growth in new wearers on a global basis. It\u2019s not much. Certainly low-single digits, but we are seeing some growth there. One of the things that we\u2019ll talk to some of the big retailers about and our key accounts about in -- we talk to them. But I think this is true for the entire industry is we need to do a better job with dropouts.","There is a lot of people that will go into contact lenses they\u2019ll get fitted because they want them. They will get some free lenses, they will take them home, they will try them. Maybe they have a hard time inserting the lens, or there\u2019s something that\u2019s causing them a little bit of problem and then they don\u2019t stick with the lenses.","They go back to glasses, and we get too much drop out there within that first week or two weeks. So we\u2019ve been talking about that with people and say, hey, we need to do better job with follow-up here, right?","We fit somebody with contact lenses, let\u2019s give them a text or give them a phone call, something where we reach out to them two days later or three days later, four days later. Hey, how it\u2019s going? What can we help you with? How is the insertion going? How is the comfort going and so forth. I think, we needed to do a better job there.","I mean, there are some interesting stats out there and they\u2019re kind of big numbers. But if you look at, right now, there\u2019s like 140 million contact lens wearers in the world and there\u2019s like 200 million contact lens wearer dropouts. And that includes people who just initially started wearing them and dropped out and it could be people who have gotten older and stopped wearing them.","But if we can just do a better job capturing the dropouts and working with these key accounts in these big retailers and reaching out to patients and saying, I know you want contact lenses, I know when you were in the store you like them and wanted to keep wearing them. Why aren\u2019t you buying more of them? That\u2019s a key way for us to grow this industry.","I mean, we can literally double the size of the industry by just keeping people in contact lenses that want to be in contact lenses. So I think that\u2019s an area where all of us can improve. I mean, we can improve on that, J&J and our friends at Alcon and Bausch and the big retailers. I mean, we can all do a better job of growing the wearer base.","Andrew Brackmann","Got it. Thank you. Very helpful. And then, Brian, may be a question for you. Could you maybe provide an update on where you\u2019re at with daily silicone hydrogel margins here? I think you\u2019re adding some capacity. So is it safe to assume that those might be under a little bit of margin pressure here in the near term versus long term? Thanks.","Albert White","Yes. I mean, I\u2019m not going to get into the specifics about where those margins are landing. But suffice it to say, the margins on our daily silicones are -- put a little pressure on our margins overall. But that being said, we said that gross margins are going to be up slightly year-over-year, operating margins up slightly.","So we try to manage this business to the operating margin level, now, whether you\u2019re talking about our key accounts or just our business in general and so we\u2019ll work through it and as we get more volume to our plants and as we continued to improve our sales in those products, our cost premium goes down and our gross margin go up. So that\u2019s been the story historically for Cooper.","Andrew Brackmann","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks. Al or maybe Brian, can you quantify the spending that you\u2019re pulling forward into the second quarter. I just want to get a sense for the EPS impact, because you called that out as the reason for the below consensus guide in 2Q.","Albert White","Yes. I mean, we had talked about kind of $2.70 to $2.80 in the quarter. And then, I know, everybody kind of had their expectations out there. For us, it\u2019s a fairly decent pull forward as you can imagine. It will depend on a couple of different factors, but we\u2019re certainly could be talking $5 million, $6 million, $7 million, in that type of range.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Al, can you give us any color on the relative strength of your two daily silicone hydrogel franchises these days? Is MyDay still growing faster than clariti off of a smaller base or is that moderated now, given clariti is addressing maybe a larger market segment?","Albert White","Yes. It\u2019s still - that\u2019s still the same. Both lenses are doing really well. Our both product families are doing really well. MyDay is growing faster than clariti, but it\u2019s still a decent amount smaller than clariti.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.","Robbie Marcus","Thanks. Appreciate the question. May be a housekeeping question, can you go through some of the pro forma adjustments in the quarter may be what FX was on the top and bottom line and how you\u2019re thinking about FX for the year?","Albert White","I\u2019ll let Brian.","Brian Andrews","Okay. So, FX for the quarter was about $16 million negative, $0.20 detriment to EPS. For the year, we\u2019ve got the detriment from revenue around $55 million and a $0.47 negative to EPS.","Robbie Marcus","Were there any other pro forma adjustments that you could give us in the quarter?","Brian Andrews","There wasn\u2019t really much - there wasn\u2019t much Blanchard and we had Incisive, but both of those I think closed in January that was really no adjustment for that.","Albert White","Really wasn\u2019t much there, no.","Robbie Marcus","Okay. Maybe and then Al just a follow-up on your comments before without getting all of those patients who have dropped out back into the system. Can you talk about may be the pathway to do that? Is that something you as Cooper and J& J have a database to do or is that going to have to be driven from the doctor level?","Albert White","Yes, it has to be driven by someone so to speak. So, if I use my example that a patient comes in, says, hey I want to try contact lenses. The practitioners says here try clarity, it\u2019s a great product, you\u2019re going to love this and here\u2019s five days\u2019 worth of lenses.","What needs to happen is at some point at least once during those five days, someone needs to reach out and it can be a text, right, it could be a phone call, but someone needs to reach out to the patient and say how is it going? You like those lenses? Everything okay with the visual acuity and the comfort and so forth?","So, whether that\u2019s coming from us or whether it\u2019s coming from the practitioner themselves like it\u2019s important to reach out. So, the idea; one, is obviously, it\u2019s the practitioner or the practitioner\u2019s office is reaching out, inquiring with the patient how things are going.","But we can work with them on that. I mean automation itself is important. I mean when you think about some of the stuff that we do with EyeCare Prime and reaching out to patients and letting them know, hey, it\u2019s time for you to come in and for your annual check-up and that kind of stuff.","If we can link some of those IT platforms together where it says hey someone was a fitting lenses, let\u2019s send them a quick text and how ask it how\u2019s it going and so forth, that would be us a working to help the physician themselves. So, I think, however we do it as an industry, it\u2019s something that we need to continue to focus on improving.","Robbie Marcus","Thanks a lot.","Albert White","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer.","Steven Lichtman","Thank you. Hi guys. In Asia-Pac, Al, obviously, Cooper results remain strong. You mentioned, of course, that you\u2019re under-indexed there. So, what do you think the underlying market is growing in Asia-Pac?","Just trying to tease out how much you\u2019re growing ahead of the market probably in that region? Have you think about the sustainability of that market growth looking ahead?","Albert White","Yes. I think that market is going to continue to grow nicely I believe that. I mean when you end up looking at the Asia part -- Asia-Pac market, if you will, for the last calendar year, it grew 7% and we grew 13%. I\u2019m talking about calendar quarter data now, I\u2019m going to market data.","If you look at the fourth quarter, that market grew 9% and we grew 16%. So, I think you\u2019re getting a number of different factors there. One as I was saying, we\u2019re under-indexed. We\u2019re hitting the market hard with some great products. So I think our chances of growing faster than the market are good.","But the market itself is strong. The shift to dailies that we talked about is not as dramatic there because a larger percentage of population is already dailies but you are getting a shift to daily silicones.","And then you\u2019re getting the geographic expansion, the new wearer base that\u2019s where you\u2019re getting a lot of new wearers. So when I talk about low single-digit, let\u2019s call it 1% globally of wearers that is a higher percentage in Asia Pac.","So I think when you combine all of the things I talked about there the excitement around torics, multifocals, the excitement around geographic expansion that kind of stuff is driving the growth in Asia Pac and we\u2019ll frankly for quite a while, I think that that region probably has the best, best long-term growth dynamics of the industry.","Steven Lichtman","Got it. And then Brian apologies if I missed this, but I know you talked about some gross margin headwinds this year on the last call and some of the proactive work you\u2019re doing on distribution center expansion some legacy product write-offs. Overall, any change in your thoughts in your impact there either way this year on gross margin?","Brian Andrews","Yes. I mean, as far as gross margins go what we said is gross margin will be up slightly year-over-year. I think when you look at the impact to FX I mean, you\u2019ve got that headwind from FX really kind of impacting us mostly in Q1 in Q2.","Albert White","He\u2019s talking about the secondary handling.","Brian Andrews","My bad. Yes. So secondary handling that was a bit of a drag for us in Q1, but it was what we expected. We kind of gave a little bit of a range and built that into our guidance last quarter, no real change and update there.","We certainly are going to have some elevated freight and secondary handling some inventory obsolescence that will flow through the year, but it\u2019s baked into our guidance and expect some of that stuff to fall away as we get towards the end of the year and certainly into next year.","Steven Lichtman","Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro","Good afternoon, guys. Two questions one on growth and one on margins. On the growth side, can you talk a little bit about your expectations in the Americas just given all your comments about global market growth that 4% number, I was interested if that was sort of new normal number you expect for the short to medium term?","Albert White","No. I think that we saw some weakness kind of the marketplace in the Americas in the U.S. marketplace here, but there\u2019s still a lot of positive underlying fundamentals especially the shift to dailies we talked about the ship to dailies and daily silicones, but both of those are happening in the U.S. market. So I would envision the U.S. market posting better numbers.","Isaac Ro","Okay. It\u2019s helpful. And then on the margin question, there was some detail you guys gave us on the investments you made this quarter and then kind of what to expect on the pull forward.","Can you just maybe quantify the incremental investments doing year-on-year that you guys made this quarter just to help reconcile the year-on-year margin performance, if we separate the investments versus FX and other items? Thank you.","Albert White","Yes. We gave some numbers on that last quarter. I think in particular, we talked about like $0.14, if I\u2019m remembering right from kind of an elevated inventory and secondary handling charges and so forth. And then, we build that in our guidance this year and we\u2019re not going to break out any more numbers or detail on that.","It\u2019s already built in the number and I\u2019d echo Brian\u2019s comments that we did have heightened costs here. Those are reduced as we move through the year. We\u2019ll still have some stuff probably within the inventory obsolescence depending upon how we move through things even into next year. But they\u2019re all wrapped into the numbers.","Isaac Ro","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Al White for any closing remarks.","Albert White","Thank you. I don\u2019t really think I have much to add. A good solid quarter, appreciate the interest appreciate the questions and so forth. We\u2019re continuing to execute to on our strategy and we look forward to reporting to everyone again when is our next earnings call. Its a little earlier than usual, I think it\u2019s May 30th, is the day to mark for our next earnings call. So with that, thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program.

I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Kim Duncan. Ma'am, please go ahead.","Kim Duncan","-- Matz, Chief Financial Officer; and Al White, Chief Strategy Officer.","Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including all revenue and earnings per share guidance and other statements regarding anticipated results of operations, market or regulatory conditions, and integration of any acquisitions or their failure to achieve anticipated benefits.","Forward-looking statements depend on assumptions, data or methods that may be incorrect or imprecise and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Events that could cause our actual results and future actions of the Company to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements are set forth under the caption Forward-Looking Statements in today's earnings release and are described in our SEC filings, including the business section of Coopers Annual Report on Form 10-K. These are publicly available and on request from the Company's Investor Relations department.","Now before I turn the call over to Bob, let me comment on the agenda for the call. Bob will begin by providing highlights on the quarter, followed by Greg who will then discuss the second quarter financial results. We will keep the formal presentation to roughly 30 minutes, and then open up the call for questions. We expect the call to last approximately 1 hour. We request that anyone asking questions, please limit yourself to one question. Should you have any additional questions, please call our investor line at 925-460-3663 or email ir@cooperco.com.","As a reminder, this call is being webcast and a copy of the earnings release is available through the Investor Relations section of The Cooper Companies' website.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob for his opening remarks.","Bob Weiss","Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to the second quarter conference call. Let me start by highlighting three key points.","First, we continue to make significant advancements with CooperVision including integrating Sauflon. Highlights include resolving the back-order issues we had in the U.S. with Clariti in March and April, the startup of our two new manufacturing facilities in Costa Rica and the U.K., and Clariti -- and new Clariti and MyDay lines going into production. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned to finish this year strong while carrying the momentum into 2016.","Second, CooperVision posted 6% pro forma revenue growth in the second fiscal quarter, including 16% pro forma growth for silicone hydrogel lenses. For the first calendar quarter, CooperVision grew 6% compared to the market at 1% and we gained share in every region of the world. We expect CooperVision to continue taking share and forecast pro forma revenue growth of around 9% in fiscal 2015, which shows the strength we expect in Q3 and Q4 as Clariti gains traction in the United States.","Third, we had two items this past quarter that were not included in the guidance we provided on our last earnings call. And we expect these items will impact us for the remainder of the year. The first is currency, which everyone knows about. The second is challenges that CooperSurgical is facing as a result of things outside of their control, specifically lower OB\/GYN patient visits due to Mesh [ph] and other litigation that doesn't involve us but has negatively impacted the market.","From the day of our last earnings call, these two items negatively impacted Q2 by $0.05, with currency accounting for $0.02 and CooperSurgical for $0.03. As a result of these items, we're reducing revenue guidance by $44 million at the midpoint, although our continued operational improvements, especially with respect to Sauflon, are allowing us to maintain our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance.","I want to stand [ph] on these takeaways as I walk through the quarter's performance, but I want to reiterate, we remain very optimistic about the underlying fundamentals of our business and believe we're well-positioned to deliver solid results for the remainder of this year and through 2016.","On a consolidated basis, second quarter revenues grew 5% year over year to $435 million and we posted non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.72. Free cash flow was $68 million. CooperVision posted revenues of $360 million, up 9% year over year and up 6% pro forma. Excluding solutions, pro forma revenue growth was slightly over 6% but didn't round to 7% as it did in the first quarter.","To give a little color on this, we had a strong quarter in Europe and a pretty decent quarter in the Americas, but slightly softer-than-expected sales in Japan as we hurdle last year's VAT increase. Remember, last year's comps for Asia Pac was 20% pro forma growth, which was driven by significant growth in Japan as the increase in the VAT went into effect on April 1st. Regardless, this was a pretty good quarter.","Overall, our silicone hydrogel family drove top line growth with $197 million in revenues, up 16% pro forma. In addition to strong daily growth, our monthly Biofinity family grew 12% pro forma and our two-week family of products grew 13% pro forma. We remain under index versus the market both in the two-week and the monthly silicone hydrogel space, with silicons representing roughly 77% of that market and us at 69%. So we anticipate our two-week and monthly silicons to do nicely over many years.","Regarding one-day silicone sales, for competitive reasons we won't provide specific details on individual product sales. However, as reported for the one-day silicone hydrogel lenses, we're $32 million, with Clariti posting a very strong quarter, up 41%, and MyDay up 46%, both pro forma. This met our expectations. As a reminder, we're the only company offering a two-tiered approach in the daily silicone hydrogel market with Clariti positioned as the mass market offering and MyDay as our premium offering.","We continue to believe there's a great opportunity to split the daily silicone market with a premium and mass market lens. We also believe we have the premium portfolio to become the market leader in coming years, in addition to being the only company offering a two-tiered strategy. Our one-day mass market portfolio includes a sphere, a toric and a multifocal which no one else has.","Regarding Clariti, we continue -- we remain capacity constrained but our manufacturing build-out is going well and we believe we'll be able to fully meet demand exiting this fiscal year. This obviously positions us really well for fiscal 2013. In the U.S., our rollout is back on track. As we -- sorry -- 2016.","In the U.S., our rollout is back on track. As we discussed on our earnings call, we had some issues in the second quarter, a strong demand created back-order problems and we had to adjust packaging. As you can imagine, this created a number of internal challenges and resulted in delays. Having said that, we resolved these issues in April and we're now in good shape.","Some of you may ask what the P&L impact was on the quarter, but I'm not sure we could properly quantify it. So, suffice it to say, it's behind us and we're in much better shape currently.","And remember, the U.S. Clariti launch is the largest and fastest product rollout in CooperVision's history, so, some challenges are expected. Regardless, I'm happy to report that demand remains very robust.","Regarding MyDay, sales are doing very well in Europe and we are starting to release lens key opinion leaders in the United States with a full launch scheduled to occur in August. We're continuing to sell everything we can make and we're bringing on additional more efficient lines to help beat demand. As anticipated, MyDay is fitting perfectly into our high-end segment of the silicone hydrogel market. Regarding MyDay in Japan, we still are in the regulatory process and anticipate approval in time to launch in fiscal 2016.","Combining Clariti and MyDay, we still expect sales of around $175 million this fiscal year, with Clariti comprising around 75% of that.","Our specialty business remained strong and torics are up 7% and multifocals up 8%, both pro forma. Multifocals were strong in the silicone space, but weakened legacy hydrogel portfolio. Having said that, we continue to lead the global market in these specialized categories and we're taking market share. Regarding Proclear, sales were down 3% pro forma, driven by softness in our non-daily products.","On a regional basis, the Americas were up 5% pro forma. This was led by a solid quarter for Biofinity and the introduction of Clariti. Clariti was still very small in Q2, but we anticipate our U.S. growth will accelerate as the rollout of Clariti progresses.","Sphere posted a solid quarter, up 8% pro forma. I continue to be impressed by the team as they're posting strong results while completing significant integration activity. Meanwhile, Asia Pac was up 2% pro forma, lower than normal due to the Japanese VAT change I mentioned earlier.","To provide more details on Sauflon integration activity, as I mentioned, we've made a lot of progress. You'll notice the non-GAAP adjustments this quarter for manufacturing and operating costs, and I believe you'll see similar charges in Q3 and Q4. Most of this work is still targeted to be completed this fiscal year, although some of the manufacturing activity may fall into the first quarter of next year.","We also completed our analysis around current and future plant needs and started up two new manufacturing facilities in Costa Rica and the U.K., with production forecasted to begin in a few quarters. Regarding manufacturing space, we embarked on our expansion plans prior to the Sauflon acquisition, and as a result, we now have some excess space, which we will utilize over time.","Sauflon, we did a ton of manufacturing positives such as lines with smaller footprints, and this has allowed us to reevaluate our plans to include diversifying our manufacturing footprint by putting several Clariti lines in Costa Rica.","Ultimately, all this will reduce CapEx and significantly improve free cash flow. As a matter of fact, the improvements look pretty significant, and I wouldn't be surprised to see free cash flow over $300 million in fiscal 2016.","Finally on Sauflon and the integration activity, it's important to remember, this acquisition was a major step forward for CooperVision, Sauflon's manufacturing lines cost roughly one-third the cost of our equivalent lines. They're received in one-half the time and they have better flexibility, shifting production from one product to another. A large reason for this is material formulation, which provides the ability to produce silicone hydrogel lenses without alcohol. This is a major step forward in integrating this manufacturing and formulation expertise roles [ph] to add manufacturing lines in a much more cost-effective manner. This will reduce future CapEx, thus reducing -- or improving free cash flow, allowing, along with yielding a lower cost per unit, which we anticipate seeing in the P&L beginning in middle of 2016.","To conclude on integration activity, nothing has changed with respect to my beliefs around the future. Our team continues to do a great job integrating the business, and that includes ramping up production.","Now let me comment on the overall contact lens market. As a reminder, this information is listed on the last page of our earnings release. Overall the market was up 1% in the calendar Q1 and CooperVision was up 6%. As I mentioned earlier, this data is skewed because of Japan, which increased VAT last April 1st, resulting in significant purchases before the increase went into effect. This can be seen in the Asia Pac numbers with the market down 7% and CooperVision down 6%. In the Americas, the market grew 2%, with CooperVision up 11%. And in EMEA, the market grew 7% and we grew slightly stronger than 7%.","As you can tell, our growth was clearly led by the Americas and its strong results. Having said that, we grew faster than the market in every region of the world, so I'm very happy with our performance. Also, if we look at the market on a modality basis, the single-use market continued to drive growth, up 4%, while we grew 11%. Non-single-use lenses declined 2% while we grew 4%.","In general, when I look at the market, I expect to rebound and grow in the mid-single-digits now that Japan's VAT issue is behind us. We also have the UPP or unilateral pricing policy issue which is impacting the U.S. market.","As many of you are aware, there's a lot of legal activity around that right now, and it includes all the contact lens manufacturers. It's impossible to say how long it will last, but hopefully we get it resolved soon so we can all get back to business as usual. Overall though, the market looks fairly stable and continuing growth in the single-digit market.","In the single-use market, especially in the silicone hydrogel part of the market, should support overall market growth of 4% to 6% in the coming years. The key takeaway is that we have a fairly healthy market and I believe we'll continue taking share, especially with the rollout of Clariti now beginning in a robust manner.","Moving to CooperSurgical. This was a challenging quarter. On the plus side, we continued making progress in our fertility business by focusing on disposable sales and we're taking share in that space.","This performance is offset by the continued reduction of lower marginal capital equipment sales. We also - we're also dealing with the negative impact of currency on an as-reported results. This performance is offset by the continued reduction and lower margin in capital equipment sales. We're also dealing with the negative impact of currency on an as-reported results as roughly two-thirds of our fertility business is outside the U.S.","We saw that this quarter, fertility was down 15% on an as-reported basis but only 1% in constant currency. Meanwhile, our surgical products business was down 3%. As many of you know, there's been a significant slowdown in women's healthcare market due to the litigation associated with Mesh slings [ph] and Morcellation. We're not involved in any of that litigation, but regardless, the activity is impacting patient visits in surgical activity, thus impacting several of our OB\/GYN products. It's tough to quantify this impact but it's definitely hurting our performance more than we were expecting. I believe the issue is temporary, but we're taking down CooperSurgical's revenue guidance by roughly $18 million at the midpoint to reflect this, along with negative currency.","One piece of positive news though is, you'll remember, we acquired EndoSee last year and we're -- we've recently launched their hysteroscope at a large gynecology conference. Early indications are extremely positive, as are early indications on several of our other small product launches. So we're optimistic 2016 will be a much better year for CooperSurgical.","Now let me touch on -- a little more on guidance. Regarding revenues, we're taking down CooperSurgical revenues for the reasons I just mentioned and we're reducing CooperVision mainly to reflect product rationalization, updated currency rates, and the second quarter results.","As a reminder, last quarter's guidance was with euro at $1.11, the yen at 120, and the pound at $1.53. And we're now using updated rates of the euro at $1.13, the yen at 124, and the pound at $1.53. Based on this, new revenue guidance for CooperVision is $1.512 billion to $1.544. CooperSurgical is $308 million to $316 million. And in total we're at $1.820 to $1.860.","We expect both businesses to be slightly better in the fourth quarter than the third quarter in the area of revenues and operating income. On a positive note, even with the reduction of revenues, our fiscal year 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share guidance remains the same as our business fundamentals remained strong, including greater synergies from the Sauflon acquisition.","From a longer perspective, we are still targeting operating margins above 26% in 2018. Although currency remains a significant headwind, I believe we have fairly straightforward path to achieving this goal by staying focused and executing within our existing businesses.","Lastly, on the financials, cash flow remains extremely important to us, and we reduced debt this quarter by $48 million, which was very solid. We're maintaining our guidance of having our free cash flow and CapEx over $200 million this year. Having said that, I continue to believe we will see lower CapEx in fiscal 2016 while operating cash flow continues to grow. So I anticipate very strong free cash flows in 2016 and continued strength in subsequent years.","Regarding strategy, we continue with our successful strategy, which I've frequently articulated in the past. This includes investing in our business to take market share by expanding geographically, aggressively rolling out products such as Clariti and investing in emerging markets such as China. We do all this remaining keenly focused on delivering solid earnings per share growth. We believe we can accomplish all our objectives while reducing debt and increasing profits. And we remain focused on delivering strong shareholder returns.","In summary, we're making significant progress integrating Sauflon, and although we have a lot of moving parts, the remainder of this year should be solid and 2016 should be a really good year for us. Our profit margins are solid, our free cash flow generation strong, and I remain bullish about the future.","With that, let me express my appreciation to our employees, our number one asset. Their hard work and dedication to creating value is the backbone of our success.","And now I'll turn it over to Greg to cover the financial results.","Greg Matz","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. Bob provided an overall summary of our performance, including a review of the market and our revenue picture. So let me start with gross margins.","Looking at gross margins, in Q2, the consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 61.6% and 63.4%, respectively, compared with 65.1% for GAAP and non-GAAP in the prior year. The primary difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is related to products and equipment rationalization, due to the Sauflon acquisition and facility startup costs directly attributable to our two new manufacturing facilities which are currently being completed. Both the Speedwell plant in the U.K. and the Costa Rican plant will be initially dedicated to our expansion into [inaudible] manufacturing.","When comparing non-GAAP gross margins this quarter to Q2 '14, we experienced the significant negative impact of revenues from FX, slightly offset by some favorable FX impact on our cost of goods sold and product mix led by Biofinity.","CooperVision on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis reported gross margins of 61.2% and 63.3%, respectively, versus 65.2% for GAAP and non-GAAP in Q2 last year. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is largely related to product and equipment rationalization from the Sauflon acquisition and the facility startup costs mentioned earlier. The drop in the non-GAAP gross margin was due primarily to FX, partially offset by product mix led by Biofinity.","CooperSurgical had a GAAP and a non-GAAP gross margins of 63.4% and 63.5%, respectively, which compares to Q2 '14 of 64.7%. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP relates to approximately 140K of restructuring costs. The year-over-year non-GAAP margin declines is mainly due to product mix and restructuring costs.","Now looking at operating expenses. SG&A. On a GAAP basis, SG&A expenses increased by approximately 8% from the prior year to approximately $167.6 million. And we're roughly 39% of revenue, up from 38% in the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A increased approximately 5% to $162.1 million or 37% of revenue. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP was $5.4 million, due largely to integration and restructuring costs related to the Sauflon acquisition. SG&A on a non-GAAP basis decreased 3% sequentially, led by synergies from Sauflon.","Now looking at R&D. In Q2, R&D on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis was $16.8 million and $16.6 million, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, R&D was 3.8% of revenue, down from 4% in the prior year.","In Q2, depreciation was $32.2 million, up $7.9 million, and amortization was $12.3 million, up approximately $4.8 million, primarily due to the Sauflon acquisition.","Moving to operating margins. For Q2, consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $71 million and 16.3% of revenue, versus $88.9 million and 21.6% of revenue in Q2 last year. This drop was primarily due to integration-related costs and increased amortization from the Sauflon acquisition, as well as the manufacturing facility startup costs. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $96.7 million and 22.2% of revenue, versus $97.4 million and 23.6% of revenue from the prior year. The reduction in operating income and margin are driven by the reduction in gross margin from the impact of currency on the top line.","In Q2, CVI had GAAP operating income and margin of $67.7 million and 18.8% of revenue, versus the prior-year Q2 of $82.6 million and 25% of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income and margin were $88.8 million and 24.7% of revenue, versus $87 million and 26.3% of revenue in the prior year.","CSI had GAAP operating income and margin of $14.2 million and 18.9% of revenue, versus the prior year of $18.1 million and 22.3% of revenue. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $18.8 million and 25% of revenue, versus Q2 '14 at $21.5 million operating income and 26.4% of revenue. Primary reason for the year-over-year decline is due to reduction of revenue related impact to gross margins.","Interest expense was $4.7 million for the quarter, up $3.1 million year over year, primarily due to the acquisition of Sauflon and higher interest rates on our bank pricing grid, which became effective in Q1. We were still forecasting interest expense for the year around $18 million.","Looking at the effective tax rate, in Q2 the GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate was 8.7% and 8.4%, respectively, versus Q2 '14 GAAP effective tax rate of 9.3% and non-GAAP effective tax rate of 10.3%. As we've mentioned before, you know, the effective tax rate continues to be below the U.S. statutory rate as the majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates.","With respect to Sauflon, we have made significant progress in incorporating them into our global trade arrangement. We anticipate being substantially complete by the end of the fiscal year.","Earnings per share. Our Q2 earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was $1.23 and $1.72, respectively, versus $1.62 and $1.76 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in the prior year.","Regarding foreign exchange. We're using rates as of June 4th, for our main currencies, we're using $1.13 for the euro, 124 for the yen, and $1.53 for the pound. Net impact year over year for Q2 was an unfavorable impact of $0.50. As has been the case for some time, this is primarily related to the yen, pound, euro and euro tracking currencies, in addition to a number of other currencies that have also weakened against the dollar.","Based on the differences in rates from our Q1 earnings call, Q2 is negatively impacted by an additional $0.02, and we forecast an additional negative $0.03 impact EPS in the second half of 2015. Total negative impact to EPS for the year is now forecasted at $1.68, with a negative impact on revenue of $147 million.","Looking at some balance sheet activity. Total debt decreased within the quarter by $47.6 million to $1,348 million. At April 30th we had approximately $894.8 million of total credit available.","Inventories increased approximately $12.4 million to $402.5 million from last quarter, largely due to the increase in daily advances [ph]. For the quarter we're seeing months on hand at 7.2 months, 7.6 months on hand excluding inventory and equipment rationalization charges and facility startup costs. And this is up from the months on hand of 7.2 months last year and up from 7.3 adjusted months on hand last quarter. Days sales outstanding is 56 days, which is down from 57 days in the prior quarter and up from 51 days last year.","Now turning to guidance, in order to provide a little more color for your models, I will share some additional specifics on our non-GAAP guidance. The revenue range, as Bob had mentioned, for the Company, is $1.82 billion to $1.86 billion, or 7% pro forma growth at the midpoint. CVI's revenue range is $1.512 billion to $1.544 billion, or about 9% pro forma growth at midpoint. CSI's revenue range is $308 million to $316 million, or flat at the midpoint.","We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be just north of 63% for the year. OpEx is expected to be around 40%. Operating margin is expected to be around 23%. Interest expense, as I mentioned earlier, is expected to be around $18 million. Our effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 8% to 9%, and this includes transitioning Sauflon into our global trade arrangement. Our share count is expected to be roughly 49.2 million shares for the year. Our non-GAAP EPS remains in the range of $7.40 to $7.70, or 24% to 28% growth on a pro forma basis.","Finally, we expect both capital expenditures and free cash flow for the year to be north of $200 million.","With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session.","Kim Duncan","Operator, we're ready to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Jon Black with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Jon Black - Stifel","Great. Thanks, and good afternoon. Maybe I'll stick largely sort of big picture. Bob, we're now several of quarter into UPP, we've seen the industry growth even trailing 12 months slow pretty notable. Can you just talk again at a high level, what are you thinking UPP is doing? In other words, is this just inventory noise on the J&J side or is it ushering in a little bit of pricing pressure? Any color you can give us on the channel would be helpful.","Bob Weiss","Well, there's no doubt that UPP has scrambled the egg a bit, not only from a manufacturing point of view, from a retailer point of view. And I think the net of it is there is some reduction of the -- what's out there in total, whether it's fitting at the retailers or whether it's fitting in the distribution channels. And there's no doubt that when you look at the J&J numbers, the fact that they went broad-based with UPP, they maybe got more of the noise tied in with them.","So, you know, the jury is still out what it means ultimately, and where it goes ultimately, as I indicated, we remain kind of neutral on it, thinking there is basically a lot of other ways to service the eye care professional who's the one that puts all of the time and energy into fitting patients, and particularly the new patients. So I would say net-net-net it's tightened the pipeline a bit and to some degree a negative on the overall market growth we're seeing right now.","Jon Black - Stifel","Okay. And then just my quick follow-up, I didn't think I'd burn one on CSI, but the metric you're alluding to, I had the old days of American Medical, I just thought that was well in the rearview mirror. So, just to be clear, is this more on the headline litigation noise that's sort of scaring people away from a volume perspective? And then lastly, to flip back to CVI, just to be clear, I think you had 6% market growth expectations last quarter, and did you dial it down just slightly to call it, you know, four or five on the mid-single-digit? Thanks guys.","Bob Weiss","As far as -- yeah, I'll come back on your second question on clarification. But the first thing as far as Mesh [ph], the combination of Mesh [ph] and stress -- urinary incontinence, anything to do with slings [ph] as well as then the tie-in with Morcellation which was, albeit separate, but kind of the same surgical arena, if you will, has taken a toll on really the amount of people going into the gynecologists or surgical procedures at this juncture. So there's a lot of confusion. Can they use Morcellation? We know J&J pulled out of the market an ongoing acceleration of lawsuits and that whole arena. But the long and the short of it is a lot of doctors don't know what they can use and they're kind of defaulting back to the good old, you know, incontinence, things like adult diapers which are doing very well in the market, but that's about where it ends. So, who knows?","Your question on the 6%, you want to kind of recap that one?","Jon Black - Stifel","I'm sorry. I just said, I think last quarter you gave some color on industry growth for lenders of around 6%. I don't want to put words in your mouth but you sounded a little bit more cautious. I think you mentioned mid-single digits. So I'm just trying to figure out, could you dial down the market growth expectations on the contact lens side ever so slightly for 2015? Thank you.","Bob Weiss","Yeah. For -- overall we've been saying 4% to 6% without necessarily saying any particular number in that range. So, did we dial down this year? A little -- yeah, there's no doubt that the combination of UPP has taken a little weight off of it, so that this year, 2015, I don't see us being at the top end of the range.","Having said that, I think if you adjust for the VAT year over year on a trailing 12-month basis, we're still at around 4%, which is the bottom end of that range. And I would expect improvement going forward.","Jon Black - Stifel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with JPMorgan. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Jon Black - Stifel","Thanks. I want to clarify a couple of points in the guidance. I understand the FX and the surgical commentary, but it looks like you're also making at least a modest reduction in your expectations for CVI pro forma growth. Could you just talk about that and what's behind it?","Bob Weiss","Yeah. I made a comment in my comments on the guidance that it really is a combination of FX as a factor, and the other factor is rationalization of the portfolio, the legacy products that come into play. We did indicate when we put Sauflon together with our product line, we had some decisions to make on which we would promote, which we would redirect, which we would discontinue. So it's factoring in a bit more cannibalization\/rationalization.","Chris Pasquale - JPMorgan","Do you feel like that process has now concluded or is that still something you're working through?","Bob Weiss","I would say in our revised guidance, we think we factored the current thinking. Having said that, I would not say we've concluded all the challenges of what to do with kind of the plethora of legacy products we have on both sides of the aisle. So in some degree, some cases were taking a product into a private label modality and it will survive; in other cases it will not survive. That is not a concluded exercise at this juncture.","Chris Pasquale - JPMorgan","Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about what's driving the tax rate guidance lower and what the earnings impact of that is, helping you sort of offset that top line hit?","Greg Matz","I think, yeah, from a tax perspective, we are -- we had, you know, again, we've had some normal discretes that we normally do in the quarter. We have incorporated Sauflon, which is -- has gone well. And so it's nothing really out of the ordinary that we've seen in the prior quarter. Rate is a little bit low. You know, rates do fluctuate. We felt comfortable looking at the full year that the rate would be a little lower than we had originally guided to. And again that -- it just takes an opportunity to see where the tax -- where tax laws are going, and as of now we feel comfortable of that 8% to 9% range.","Chris Pasquale - JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hope you can hear me okay.","If I heard correctly, the CooperVision pro forma growth is 9% for the full year. You gave 6% in the first half. So that implies, if I'm doing the math right, 12% in the second half for CooperVision, which is pretty strong?","Unidentified Company Representative","Yeah.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","So what drives that? Do you expect a step-up in the growth rate in the third quarter from Q2? And I had one follow-up.","Bob Weiss","Okay. Well, a couple of things. We obviously talked a lot about product ramp-up with our new products Clariti and MyDay. So the fact that we, among other things, will be rolling out and launching MyDay in the U.S. in August, and when it comes to Clariti, the ramp-up of production has gone very well. We're actually ahead of the curve there, which gives us a little bit more muscle and power in the marketplace.","Keep in mind, in the second quarter, with the Clariti rollout in the U.S., we were still at a bottleneck getting the supply channel freed up, getting fitting sets out. Now we're in a pretty robust rollout of our fitting sets and are optimistic we have the supply channel coming onboard to better service the quarter and the roll forward.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Bob, on the step-up in Q3, so you expect a sequential increase?","Bob Weiss","Yes. And part of the step-up relative to the year-over-year growth is easier comps. In the second quarter, of course, we had Japan and the VAT which was a substantial hurdle as we can see from the Asia Pac numbers, the fact that they're down for the calendar quarter substantially, 6%.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Thanks, Bob. And then just lastly for me, could you talk about your commitment to CooperSurgical at this point? I mean it's obviously unrelated to CooperVision, so the recent performance has kind of been great. Are you still -- do you still think it makes sense to keep these two companies together? And Greg, is that tax rate sustainable beyond 2015? And I'll drop. Thanks.","Bob Weiss","All right. So I'll take the first one.","CooperSurgical, we understand kind of the revisiting of that with the things going on between our rationalization of the product line in IBF [ph]. The foreign exchange hit we had in IBF, which is an offshore business predominantly, and then now coupled with the Mesh [ph] and the Morcellator issues in the U.S., we think that's short-lived. We're very excited for the new product pipeline that is now coming through surgical. And we see the IBF [ph] business as very attractive long term once we're through the rationalization period. So we like that side of it. The fact that there is minimal CapEx and it generates a lot of cash flow and it first perfectly in what our tax structure. And with that, I'll turn the tax side over to Greg.","Greg Matz","Yeah. And Larry, as you know, we don't give guidance on the tax rate going forward. But there's a lot that goes into it. There's geographic split of income, there are discretes that we have year to year. And so there's a lot that we look at, and also tax law changes. There's a lot happening on the forefront.","So at this point in time with our current structure, we've ran over the last three or four years, we've been at non-GAAP tax range of around 9%. So I think there's nothing that we see at this point in time that dramatically changes that.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Guys, let me ask one clarifying question, then I have one other follow-up as well. But Bob, on the U.S. market where CLI data is showing a plus 2%. I know you talked about that being somewhat UPP related and things like that. My understanding is the CLI data is kind of sell-in data at the distributor level from manufacturer to distributor and manufacturer to end-user, or retail accounts, things like that. What does HPR data, or anything that would kind of show us end-user pull-through demand, is that data looking better? It's not data we see, but hopefully you still see HPR data or something else. Is the U.S. market healthier at the end-user level than it is at what we use when looking at the CLI data?","Bob Weiss","Great question. The data we look at is also known as GFK data. The -- it used to HPR in the past, now there is new data. But the same concept is basically On Eye. And it doesn't populate everything, but what it does populate looks very good relative to the traffic into the eye care professionals.","So what we're seeing in the industry going out the door is not a true picture of what is happening in the On Eye part of the industry, which is good news. It means that, once the pipeline kind of gets realigned to wherever it needs to settle out post-UPP, it should settle out at some time in the near future while we catch up with the robust growth of the On Eye part of the industry.","So we're --","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Right. Yeah, that's helpful.","Then one other question, just on the CLI data, and then on your fiscal results. You know, it looks like your growth in the calendar 1Q by CLI data was much better than your fiscal growth, fiscal Q2 growth, which one read on that could be that April was a bad month for you guys. Now it doesn't sound like that's the case from some of the things you're saying, but it sounds like, you know, CLI data January through March was better than fiscal being February through April. So, can you help reconcile that for me? And then kind of tell me what the reach should be from all that?","Bob Weiss","Yeah, I think your read is right that the first calendar quarter was robust. April was okay. Part of that is comp related. So we're not reading -- I guess the short of it is we say one quarter does not a trend make, whether or not you're looking at fiscal or calendar. We look at a lot more than that. And there's nothing we see particularly anomalous relative to the month, April, that comes into play.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Thank you so much. Can you hear me okay?","Bob Weiss","Good. Go ahead, Joanne.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","I had two questions. The first one is on UPP. How does this impact you? I mean, how do we think about the impact to your sales? And are there additional expenses legal or otherwise that we need to be thinking about until this comes out of [inaudible] or it's resolved?","Bob Weiss","Yeah. On UPP, obviously most of the manufacturers are only dealing with some new products they've rolled out. UPP to us, while we can't predict what it means from a legal point of view, there's obviously legal activity that goes on in various proposals. Net-net-net, Cooper doesn't weigh in one way or the other. If it goes away tomorrow, that's okay. That's okay.","What it means in the marketplace on AR -- average realized prices are the prices going up from the manufacturer or down. Suffice it to say, there seems to be more arguments that some manufacturers are net up in their pricing. But having said that, that's a little difficult as an assessment because in most cases, ex J&J, they're all about new products. So that's kind of arbitrary assessment. Is it net up or net down or just a new product launch and a technique. So, remains to be debated there.","I think manufacturers are doing their price strategy as they see fit with or without UPP, which means, at the end of the day we're going to position products, if it's going to be in the premium market, the way we want, if it's going to be in the mass market, the way we want. And coupons and other vehicles that had been around forever will traditionally play into that, and it's kind of like UPP is just another marketing strategy, if you will.","So it's no big deal to me but I know it's a bigger deal with a lot of people.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Thank you. And as a follow-up, what was interesting to us is that you lowered the revenue but maintained the UPS. You noted operational efficiencies. Can you highlight a couple of those and if one is greater than the other? That would be helpful. Thank you.","Bob Weiss","Sure. Sure. The operational efficiencies that are going well, we're ecstatic about two things. One is the production ramp-up with related lower cost of goods. So that will ripple its way into more of the tail-end of our gross margins in the fourth quarter because we -- we kind of see some of that coming through.","On the SG&A area, the integration around the world has gone very efficiently, particularly in Europe which is getting the brunt of a lot of the rationalization and realignment. So all of that has gone extremely well and we're more optimistic about the amount of synergy we're getting out of that integration.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Larry Keusch - Raymond James","Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon. Perhaps for Greg. If you look at the reduction in the guidance, I guess particularly on CVI, at the midpoint of the range. Could you help, you know, just parse out what's driving that absolute reduction there?","Greg Matz","So I think Bob mentioned in his script, you've got a little bit of product rationalization. And part of that, you also have to step back and look at what we did in Q2. So, a good chunk of that comes from the fact that Q2 we were light and probably, based on various guidance, the actual is probably light somewhere around $9 million. So, taking that off, you had some currency impact there.","And then as you go into the second half, a little bit of currency impact and then you've got again the product rationalization, maybe cannibalization.","Larry Keusch - Raymond James","Okay. So you're saying that, at the midpoint of the range, if the math's right, that $27 million, that CVI is coming down. Nine sounds like it's coming out of the 2Q performance. And then the remainder is FX and product rationalization, is that the right way to think about it?","Bob Weiss","Yeah, probably --","Greg Matz","-- but, yeah --","Bob Weiss","Yeah. I think we're saying about $3 million of FX in the back half.","Larry Keusch - Raymond James","Okay. Okay, perfect.","And then, Bob, on the fitting sets, you provided a little bit of commentary around that. But could you step us through kind of where we are today with how, you know, sort of the timeline for continuing to move the bulk of those fitting sets? Originally you had sort of planned to really get it done by June. Obviously it sounds like that's not necessarily going to happen.","And if you were to think about your targeted accounts, you know, what percentage now, you know, really has a fitting set there, for Clariti?","Bob Weiss","Yeah. I guess I don't want to overplay how advanced we are in terms of having done it off. We were very successful in unbottlenecking what we wanted to get out in March and in April. So, as of the end of the quarter, we were -- I guess about now, we're north of 20,000 fitting sets. Keep in mind that that is -- that some accounts have three different fitting sets, and that 20,000 is the combination of multifocal, torics, as well as the spheres.","Relative to the total market, the total market is over 37,000 fitters, of which let's say 30,000 is the total. We have a long way to go to address all of that market with all of the types of lenses. But obviously we're doing that in a prioritized manner, but not always doing just the Cooper accounts. We also are, to a degree, going after our competitors' choice accounts, which to some they would be frequent to reciprocate on that.","So, long and the short of it is the rollout of fitting sets is a multiyear program, it's not going to be done in total just the next 12 months. We're far from saying we're there already on that.","Larry Keusch - Raymond James","Okay. And then lastly, just on the free cash flow comment that you made relative to '16, and you're saying you won't be surprised that we're at north of $300 million. Can you step us through again sort of how you're thinking about CapEx this year, what it might imply for the following year to be up in that $300 million range? And again, where do you think the, you know, as you move through this sort of manufacturing cycle, where do you think CapEx can bottom out at?","Bob Weiss","So I think where we are is this year we're expecting to be north of the $200 million we've talked about. And it wouldn't surprise us to be in the range of $50 million to $75 million less next year than we are this year.","So for example, this -- we finished this year at 225, just to pick a round number, someplace north of 200, and it came down $75 million to $150 million. It would be in that kind of level, $50 million to $75 million of incremental free cash flow, combined with improved profitability, would get us to that $300 million-ish range of free cash flow.","As far as sustained, if we talk about the sustained CapEx rate, where we're going north of $200 million now, it clearly will be well below that 200 and probably below the 150 mark post-2016. So that what we have done the last couple of years is built a lot of the bricks and mortars, spent a lot of money in what we call Speedwell in the U.K., and Costa Rica, our facility there, building the bricks and mortars.","As I indicated in our capital requirements, the cost of a line for Sauflon's production for silicone hydrogel is one-third our cost. So you're talking about a huge model change on capital requirements, the same level of throughput capacity. So that's why we're pretty optimistic not only about 2016 but the go-forward period.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein with William Blair. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I'm wondering if you could provide any early feedback you've had from the KOLs in the U.S. on MyDay? You've started shipping stuff to them right after last quarter's conference call. So, any positive or any negative feedback that you're getting from your KOLs?","Bob Weiss","Yeah. It's probably a little early to, you know, too much substantive feedback on the U.S. key opinion leaders, but suffice it to say MyDay has been in the market for several years now in Europe. So we have a pretty good read on how it compares to others in the premium category where it's headed. So that, you know, that's clearly total one end [ph] and TruEye, we feel good about MyDay in that space and how the market should handle it.","Brian Weinstein - William Blair","Given the focus here, obviously on the dailies, we've seen over a period of, what, seven, eight, nine years for the silicone hydrogel in the two-week and monthly modalilities to kind of go from this high teens to over 70% of the total, how long does that take for the dailies to kind of get to that sort of a level? Is it a nine-year process again? Is it a five-year process? You know, what are your thoughts on that?","Bob Weiss","Well, I think that's where we come in to play. Because if things kind of continued the way they were, with only premium silicone hydrogels, then your model would be you'll never get there. Because not everyone can afford a premium silicone hydrogel. Our whole thesis is we want to make it available for everyone and the sweet spot of the market, which is the [inaudible] spot of the market, where the masses are.","Now you're talking about moving that paradigm to never getting there to probably still five to seven-year period to really significantly influence. The one thing going for us is we already have a lot of converted masses so that eye care professionals already know they like it in the two-week and the monthly market. What's going against this is you're now dealing where 730 lenses are a lot to buy. So to the extent someone is really price limited, they're going to look for the bottom of the basement on what's a good product at the lowest price. And that may mean they don't go with a silicone hydrogel. So I think that part of the paradigm is really when we talk about -- it will take you a lot longer to reach much further down, which would be more cost of goods reduction play if it's going to really get there.","So I think it will move quite a bit but it's not going to move quite as high as we are in the two-week and the monthly.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open, please go ahead.","MOB:","Good afternoon. Thanks for sneaking me in. Just a couple of real quick ones.","As far as the [inaudible] in the Q now for a while, as far as the ability to expand the utilization of that manufacturing process into other modality that you're selling [inaudible] et cetera, can you just give us any sense for your ability to take that elsewhere over time, not necessarily this year or even next year, but can you get it into the other modalities that you're selling?","And then just real quickly, Greg, you paid down about $50 million of debt this quarter. You're talking about $300 million of free cash flow next year. Do you think that we should expect some level, you know, absent M&A et cetera, some level of pay-down similar to this quarterly rate next year, so, maybe $200 million on annual basis? Thank you.","Bob Weiss","All right. As far as the use of the platform, suffice it to say, our pipeline of products and product rationalization, certain products will not be able to make, at least in any short-term sense, a migration from alcohol product to a non-alcohol product. So we would not be able to take a Biofinity and a Novera [ph] and move them onto a Sauflon platform as we know it.","Having said that, is there mixing and matching attempts going on? Of course, in R&D. So we're looking at future generations of products. And looking at future generations of products, we obviously will have a bias to take the knowhow we now have and leverage that as best we can.","Having said that, we have so much to do in terms of the ramp-up and rollout of Clariti as we now know it, that it's going to keep us busy for several years. So, even if we did have a magic bullet that can take one of our existing products onto that platform, we're still limited in terms of capacity for the near future on that platform. But as I indicated in my commentary, that's something that the ease of expansion is proving reasonably easy by way of the cost of the equipment, the timeframe in getting the equipment in. So, two years from now we should have a different discussion on that.","As far as free cash, go ahead, Greg.","Greg Matz","Yes. So I think, Matt, when it comes to debt, yeah, we are happy with being able to pay down the roughly $47 million worth of debt. And I think next year is we have more free cash flow. Obviously our uses of cash stay the same. We're organic investment, M&A, debt paydown is obviously one of those, and we would definitely be looking at the opportunity to do that as the quarters progress. So, yeah, that's definitely one of the things that we'll be paying attention to.","How much, I don't want to get into, how much it is, there's a lot that plays out between now and then.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research","Hi, good evening, and thanks for taking my questions. Just two primary ones. First, Greg, I think I probably asked you this question last quarter, but from two quarters ago, the midpoint of your revenue guidance is now down I believe $90 million or roughly 5%, but your earnings guidance really hasn't changed all that much. It sounds like also your operating margin guidance you also haven't changed all that much. So, could you maybe walk through what's driving your ability to kind of maintain earnings despite your revenue coming down an expected 5%?","And then secondly, on the Clariti lenses and your comments regarding product rationalization, I heard I think both Bob and Greg today talk about cannibalization as well, and so, for the first time, which I hadn't heard in the past. So I was wondering if you could -- do you have any thoughts as to the Clariti one day sales, you know, who -- what lenses are those replacing? Are they your own, are they competitors, et cetera? Thanks so much guys.","Greg Matz","Yeah. I think, Steve, just going on the earnings, it really comes down to the guidance. It seems similar, but if you look at it, let's just take gross margin, and we said it was around 63, we're now seeing it being north of 63. So we're seeing it, you know, sliding up a couple of tenths here and there. Operating margins, the same thing. Taxes is definitely, you know, we were guiding originally 10 to 12, now we're looking at -- or 9 to 11, I mean, and now we're looking at 8 to 9. We've dropped our shares a few hundred thousand shares. So you put all that together, you know, from the standpoint that we're feeling comfortable with our midpoint now and we definitely want to make sure again we feel good about the second half, and so I think we're good at where we're at this point.","Bob Weiss","Yeah. As far as product rationalization and cannibalization, there always was the expectation that we would rationalize, there also was always the expectation that some of the Clariti rollout would cannibalize, and the whole of Sauflon would cannibalize part of our portfolio and others. So the introduction of Clariti into the U.S., for example, is -- the whole plan is to cannibalize, if you will, the sweet spot of the market, which is more J&J's Moist, meaning we're trying to switch out as well as get the new fits in the marketplace. We're directly targeting their wears.","So that was always part of the plan and it was always part of the plan to have some cannibalization as well as some rationalization in the guidance we were coming out with.","The comment on the $90 million drop in revenue at the midpoint from December, yeah, that was very indicative of the fact that we, as we've gotten to Sauflon, see a lot more synergy coming to play and are really impressed with their ability to cut costs [inaudible] with the foreign exchange hit, we had - you would have seen real degradation of gross margin which are not seen in the numbers. So we've been able to hold on to the gross margin that otherwise would have been penalized by the amount of foreign exchange hit we've taken along the way.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research","Okay. Bob, just one follow-up on that. I think one of the things, at least I'm confused on, is, you know, it looks like you're bringing down your revenue guidance by around $30 million due to, I would say, operations, whether that's product rationalization or cannibalization. Can you provide any kind of specifics to what you're doing in terms of this product rationalization? Because it was my understanding that you kind of had already assumed product rationalization when you bought Sauflon and provided guidance over the past couple of quarters.","Bob Weiss","Yes. So, some of that is, and I think, in my comments, I alluded to some of our legacy products, which would be your two-week and your monthly, and in particular, your non-silicone hydrogel families, are being, if you will, impacted, and some of them were discontinuing. So in those areas, we're talking about we've been able to take off the top and hold the bottom line by just having a more efficient, higher gross margin product portfolio.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies","Thanks. Maybe just to stay on that topic, Bob, in terms of product rationalization, I'm just wondering, you know, swapping in Clariti and taking out some of the older lines, how that plays out from an ASP standpoint? I was under the impression that Clariti actually carried somewhat lower ASPs than the Cooper base of lenses. So, just wondering how product rationalization affects price near term, medium term. And then I have one follow-up. Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Well, as far as -- of course, selling the one day and going from a two-week or a monthly to a one-day is of course a trade-up of revenue. Relative to gross margin, gross margin is considerably more attractive than what we initially thought about the one day modality. So, said another way is whereas the past -- kind of think of the model is 50% for one day at the gross margin line but a much smaller operating cost, we actually are seeing margins that are north of that 50% with Clariti. So, better gross margins.","ASP, yeah, you can't compare the ASP on a one sell versus a sell-to-sell basis. You're obviously sort of comparing a monthly using 24 lenses or a two-week which happens to use 24 lenses even though it should use 52, then obviously you're going to get a much lower ARP with a much higher revenue in aggregate with that switch.","As far as -- we look to the o-eye [ph] line when we do those trade-offs of the profitability. Switching out to some of these products on a profit-for-patient basis is enormous if we can switch them from a two-week to a daily, for example, in the process.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies","That's helpful. And maybe just to follow up, would be on UPP. I'm just wondering, have you seen that result in market share shifts? And so you mentioned on prior calls that big box [ph] retailers are really not in favor of UPP, and those that had been more aggressive where they potentially are at risk of losing share, is that something that you've seen or is that something potentially you can see going forward? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Yeah. Well, I think anyone that tracks the reported numbers of our competitors know there is some pretty big market share shifts going on surrounding that. And you're correct, the big box [ph] retailers have been more vocal, as we know, and some of that shift or reactionary, if you will, to what at least one of our competitors did in the marketplace.","So, now that's a two-way street because obviously not everyone is an independent eye care professional and not everyone is a retailer and there's a whole bunch of gradations in the middle So it's not one size fits all. But net-net-net, you can see Cooper's numbers that we're putting up are pretty robust.","Operator","Thank you. And I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Bob Weiss for any closing remarks.","Bob Weiss","Well, I want to thank everyone for their participation and questions. And we look forward to updating you on the progress we're making and the MyDay launch that happens in August when we're on the phone for our next call which is September 3rd.","And with that, operator, thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"6031":["The Cooper Companies Inc.

Welcome to first quarter 2017 conference call. We are off to a good start this year with both CooperVision and CooperSurgical posting solid results. On a consolidated basis, we reported $499 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.93. CooperVision posted strong results in all key areas resulting in 7% as reported and 9% constant currency revenue growth. Our daily silicone hydrogel lenses grew 49%, with Biofinity and Avaira products combined growing 15% both in constant currency. CooperSurgical posted revenue growth of 29% or 3% pro forma. Fertility was the high spot with growth of 83% or 9% pro forma.","Moving into the details, CooperVision posted Q1 revenues of $389 million, up 9% in constant currency. The Americas grew 7%, Europe grew 7%, and Asia-Pacific posted a very strong growth of 16%, all-in constant currency. Throughout the world, our growth continues to be driven by our market leading portfolio of products, including Biofinity in the monthly space, Avaira in the 2-week space and diversified product set in the daily space. Regarding Biofinity, we continue posting strong growth, supported by our ongoing expansion of the product family, including Biofinity Energys and Biofinity Toric XR. Both of these new products are early in their lifecycles, but are being received incredibly well and are now available in the Americas and more recently in Europe.","In addition to growing Biofinity through product expansion, we are also seeing diversified geographic growth, including double-digit growth in all regions this quarter. Within the 2-week space, our transition of Avaira to Avaira Vitality from Avaira continues to move forward successfully. Our customers are receiving this upgraded 2-week offering positively and we will continue making this transition as we move through the year.","Regarding daily lenses, our broad offering of silicone hydrogel lenses continues driving growth with our Clariti portfolio of spheres, torics and multifocals leading the way. MyDay is also doing very well, posting strong growth throughout the world and MyDay Toric is now being rolled out in Europe, following the successful launch in Japan.","Turning to product categories. Torics grew a solid 14% and multifocals grew 7%, both in constant currency. We have a highly diversified product offering within these categories, including both silicone hydrogel and traditional hydrogel lenses within the daily, 2-week and monthly modalities. We are the global leader in these specialty lenses and expect to continue delivering growth for many years. Looking at just silicone hydrogel lenses, these products grew 20% in constant currency and now represent 63% of total CooperVision revenues. It\u2019s no surprise that our strong performance is being driven by our silicone hydrogel portfolio. We also have the broadest portfolio and I believe the best options available in the market. This includes being the only company offering premium in the mass-market, silicone hydrogel lenses, including spheres, torics and multifocal lenses.","Now, turning to the overall contact lens market. We took share in calendar Q4 following \u2013 growing 10% with the market up 6%. Geographically, we grew 12% in the Americas, while the market grew 5%. We grew in line with the market in EMEA or Europe, up 5% and in Asia-Pacific, which grew 10% with the market up 8%. On a modality basis, single-use lenses continued driving growth, with CooperVision up 15% and the market up 13%. For non-single use lenses, we grew 7%, with the market flat. For the full calendar 2016, CooperVision grew 9%, while the market grew 4%, so another strong year where we more than doubled the market. Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% growth driven by the continuing shift to improve technology, such as a wider suite of silicone hydrogel lenses, the continuing shift to dailies, geographic expansion and the expansion of the wearer base. We continue growing faster than the market. We expect to continue to grow faster than the market.","Moving to CooperSurgical, we reported Q1 revenues of $110 million, up 29% driven by organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, we grew 3% with fertility, leading the way up 83% or 9% pro forma. I am also happy to say this is the first quarter fertility has posted revenue greater than the office and surgical products business. Our initiative to become the global leader in fertility, again, back in 2012 with our acquisition of Origio and has continued through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Our fertility growth is now driven by diversified portfolio of medical device products, capital equipment and lab services and we believe our market leading portfolio is the broadest in the space.","Our office and surgical products business was softer than we would have liked declining 2% due to tough comps tied to the expiration of our OEM contract in last year\u2019s first quarter. If we exclude the OEM contract, growth within the office and surgical would have been 1% and total for surgical growth would have been 5%. We expect the office and surgical part of the business to bounce back in Q2 to a more normal low to mid single-digit growth rate.","Finally, on CooperSurgical, the teams continue making a lot of progress integrating acquisitions. This includes integrating Wallace, which was acquired in early Q1. Integrating multiple acquisitions is always challenging, especially while running your existing operations. So, I would like to thank the CooperSurgical team for their extra hours and hard work. I remain very excited about the future of this business.","Lastly, let me update you on our initiatives around expanding our sales and marketing activities within both CooperVision and CooperSurgical. We made a lot of progress this quarter, and I am happy with where we stand. We are continuing to hire sales reps around the world, while also investing in marketing programs to help drive performance this year and into next. I believe we are in a great position with both businesses and it\u2019s prudent to continue investing to drive long-term growth.","With that, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication. They truly drive the success of our business. And now, I will turn it over to Al.","Al White","Thank you, Bob and good afternoon everyone. As a reminder, most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis and a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in today\u2019s earnings release. It\u2019s worth noting that our non-GAAP adjustments are quite a bit smaller this quarter as our Sauflon integration is behind us. Bob covered revenues, so let me walk through the rest of the financials and provide some color on our results.","For the quarter, gross margins were 62.9% on a consolidated basis, up from 61.4% last year. CooperVision\u2019s gross margins were 63.1%, up from 60.9% last year, driven by product mix, led by Biofinity. CooperSurgical\u2019s gross margins were 62.2%, down from 63.6% last year due to a couple of acquisitions, which have lower gross margins. We expect this year-over-year gross margin pressure at CooperSurgical to continue in Q2, at which point we will annualize the acquisitions. One other point on gross margins, which we mentioned out on December call, is that we are still forecasting elevated idle equipment and inventory charges this year. There is no change to our estimate of around $0.30 for the full year with these costs declining as we move through the year. I do believe we will see some of these costs roll into next year, but we are clearly making progress utilizing more equipment and transitioning products.","Operating expenses grew 13.1% in the quarter, driven by additional costs from acquisitions. We also continued investing in infrastructure throughout both businesses to support continued growth. Included in these investments is our focus on sales and marketing. And as we discussed in our December call, we are expecting heightened expenses this year in both CooperVision and CooperSurgical as we move through the year. Regardless, operating income grew 14.6%, resulting in operating margins of 22.8%, up from 22.1% last year.","Moving to items below operating income, we reported $7.3 million of interest expense. We also posted an FX loss of $3 million due to some large currency moves, which resulted in losses tied to revaluing our offshore inter-company loans. Our effective tax rate was 7.9%, which was lower than our initial guidance of 10%, largely due to two discrete items, one positive and one negative. These were the adoption of a new accounting standard related to stock based compensation, which was a positive, offset by a new valuation allowance, which was a negative. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.93, with roughly 49.4 million average shares outstanding.","Moving to the balance sheet, total debt increased $91 million in the quarter to approximately $1.43 billion. This was driven by our $168 million acquisition of Wallace that closed in the first week of November. We also recorded a $4.1 million balance sheet adjustment to our fiscal 2016 year end retained earnings to reflect an increase in the rebate accrual accumulated primarily on activity prior to fiscal 2014. This adjustment did not have any impact on this year\u2019s numbers.","Moving to free cash flow, we had a strong start to the year with $80 million of free cash in Q1, comprised of roughly $109 million of operating cash flow, offset by $29 million of CapEx. Regarding guidance for fiscal 2017, revenue guidance remains the same with consolidated revenues at $2.09 billion to $2.13 billion. This is comprised of $1.62 billion to $1.65 billion at CooperVision, which equates to roughly 6% to 8% constant currency growth and $470 million to $480 million at CooperSurgical, which equates to roughly 6% to 8% pro forma growth. The remainder of the P&L is expected to be similar to our prior discussions, although there are two negatives that we need to hurdle. The first is we are now forecasting interest expense to be $2 million higher at around $30 million due to assuming a 25 basis point rate hike at this month\u2019s Fed meeting. The second is we have updated FX rates and the impact is now a negative $0.16 for the year or $0.06 worse than when we provided initial guidance in December. This detrimental move has basically happened over the last few days as the odds of a March rate hike have increased. For the primary currencies, we are using euro at 1.05, yen at 1.15 and pound at 1.22. These two items combined for a $0.10 negative impact to EPS.","Having said that, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2017 on the low end by $0.10 to incorporate our Q1 performance and improved confidence around the remainder of the year. The new range is now $9.10 to $9.30 based on 49.4 million shares outstanding. Note that the FX move also negatively impacted our revenue forecast by an additional $4 million, increasing the full year negative impact to $61 million, but we are guiding to hurdle that. Lastly, we continue focusing on delivering consistent annual performance. This includes expecting over $400 million in free cash flow this year, which supports our objective of delivering over $2 billion of cumulative free cash flow over the next 5 years, while also targeting operating margins of 28% in 2021.","And with that, I will hand it back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Lawrence Keusch from Raymond James. Your line is open.","John Hsu","Hi, good afternoon. This is John Hsu in for Larry, how are you?","Bob Weiss","Excellent.","John Hsu","Just one quick question, one quick financial and then one strategic question for you guys, on the financial side, the OM was \u2013 the operating margin came in very strong, higher than what we are looking for, SG&A came in a bit lighter, so can you just talk about the investment spend, is it on plan, can you talk about that $10 million, is it kind of ratable through the year. And then the strategic question is, you guys can maybe do really well on the specialty side, of course but there are some recent competitive launches in that space, so I guess at a high level, could you talk about how you think about the competitive landscape in torics and multifocals? Thank you.","Bob Weiss","Sure. The first item on the sales and marketing, probably the best way to visualize that as well as the timing is we essentially have expanded already as of the end of January our sales force, both in surgical and vision combined, 10% compared to where it was six months ago. So a lot of that investment and a lot of the hiring is already taking place. And obviously, what\u2019s gone on in the last six months continue to run through the P&L on a go-forward basis and we will continue to expand upon that going forward. But pretty much, most of what it would take to get to the $10 million run rate is in place. On the second point, as far as \u2013 yes, we are number one in the area of specialty lenses, torics and multifocal lenses. You have seen that we put up some pretty good numbers in our \u2013 and clearly, in that venue with our torics business being up 14%. And keep in mind, torics is the lion\u2019s share. When you think about the market, it\u2019s about 27%, 28% specialty lenses, and for us, it\u2019s much higher than that, 42%. And we are sustaining good growth with toric. Our product, Biofinity XR toric, is pretty knowledge \u2013 novel. A lot of competitors will not go there and address the, if you will, the fringes of the bell-shaped curve. They do the easier to set torics, but not the custom. So we do have proprietary, if you will, advantage. In addition, obviously our strategy in the 1-day market with Clariti being the only one with a toric, a sphere and a multifocal puts us at an advantage in the 1-day space. And particularly puts us at advantage being the only silicone hydrogel in the mass market of the 1-day space. So we think we have enough going for us. The market will continue to perform well worldwide, with a lot more maturity in the U.S. and a lot less outside the U.S. We will continue to have solid growth in specialty lenses in many of the locations regionally throughout the rest of the world beyond the U.S. So we are looking for a good market going forward and we think we have a broad enough portfolio to hold our own and continue to actually gain.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good evening guys. Bob, I don\u2019t know if I heard single-use or daily silicone growth rate, or 2-week, monthly silicone growth rates, maybe I just missed them, but if you can provide those. And then, just on Biofinity Energys, I am assuming the 2-week, monthly silicone numbers look good this quarter, maybe you can talk about some of the tailwinds that product is providing, I know you mentioned it in your prepared remarks, but I would be interested in knowing how that\u2019s helping or if it\u2019s helping gross margins yet, I know you are leaving a little bit more of that profit at the doctor level, but I would assume it\u2019s helping your gross margins as well, so if you could give us any color there, that would be great?","Bob Weiss","Yes. We put a 15% growth in silicone hydrogel lenses for Biofinity and Avaira in the 2-week and the monthly product. Assume they are both doing ballpark that area, so solid performance for both Avaira in the 2-week space. Keeping in mind there, most of our energy is in a trade out, if you will into Vitality and as opposed to going after new areas, so that\u2019s pretty impressive there. And then with Biofinity off of a very large base, it\u2019s our franchise product, if you will, within CooperVision within the company. We are very early in the game with Energys just starting to pickup momentum in different places. We are very early in the game with Biofinity XR Toric, so look for those to help continue that momentum and it will take us a very long time to roll them out around the world. Meaning its well beyond 2017, even 2018 when it comes to some of those venues. We are, in fact, still rolling out Biofinity and it\u2019s first stage in some parts of the world as we look to some of the South America and Asian theaters as well. So, a long way to go on that. Gross margins, we are not really leaving a lot of gross margin on the table in terms of \u2013 the market is strong from a pricing point of view and a lot of the margins will continue to improve as we convert Avaira into Vitality and as we convert \u2013 as we continue to expand in Energys, likewise to say, trade-up strategy. So, there are some considerable tailwinds in our cost of goods gross margin area.","Al White","One quick add, Jeff, I think you asked what the daily silicone hydrogel lens growth was, that was 49% in the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew O\u2019Brien from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Matthew O\u2019Brien","Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just to talk a little bit more about the investment, Bob. You have said you are 10% bigger over the last 6 months than you had been. There is a lot of dislocation or disruption, I guess around the contact lens industry right now, from UPP to some of your competitors internally. So I am wondering if the timeframe for you to take share to see a return on those investments potentially could be shorter than what you are accustomed to or what you are even modeling at this point?","Bob Weiss","Yes. Our expectation is that it takes about 12 months to get the average rep into the area where they are productive and we expect a very high return on our investments there, well north of, on average, 1-year payback, much higher than that quite frankly. So, it\u2019s a profitable investment as long as you have the supply sources and the products and we strongly believe we do. So, we look for that as we will continue to grow our sales and marketing, equal or at least as fast as the top line over the next 1 to 2 years. But normally, you would expect leverage out of that line and so the increment is above the normal leverage that we would expect is that $10 million when we think about it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Larry Biegelsen","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I have two questions. I am going to ask the first one and if possible, let me get the second one in. Can you talk about Bob the growth of your private label business and how it compares to the growth in your branded business? And I had one follow-up, but it\u2019s a long one, so I don\u2019t want to ask both at the same time.","Bob Weiss","Okay. Well, private label is ballpark around 30% of our business. And I would say, historically, Cooper has got some phases where it\u2019s gone down a little, gone up a little above that 30%ish. It is obviously keeping up with the growth of our branded products and \u2013 which are also performing well. So, when we look at our composite growth, think of it as leveraging both sides of the business, the private label as well as the branded. Private label has \u2013 there clearly are a lot of opportunities that exist and will continue to exist that we will explore. And I would say private label is a much bigger factor outside the U.S. than it is inside the U.S. So, there is room flipping that around. There is clearly room to make more headway in the U.S. in terms of inroads into deeper areas of private label with some more exchange. So, we are pretty excited about private label strategy.","Larry Biegelsen","That\u2019s helpful, Bob. So CooperVision did 9% in the first quarter, and the fiscal 2017 guidance of 6% to 8% implies a significant deceleration in Q2 to Q4 to about 6.5%. And I assume it\u2019s because the comps in Q2 and Q4 especially are tough. But my question is, on the Q4 call, you explicitly said you wouldn\u2019t be happy growing 6% to 7% in Q2 to Q4. So my question is has anything changed that would make growing above 6% to 7% difficult? And if not, why didn\u2019t you guys raise the CVI guidance? Thanks for taking the long question.","Bob Weiss","Yes. So yes, we grew 6% in constant currency. And of course, in our overall guidance, Al mentioned the $4 million of headwind, which is foreign exchange related. In terms of our range, 6% to 8% for the full year, it\u2019s correct. We said we had slightly \u2013 we had some easier comps in Q1 than the next three quarters, so that still leaves us in the venue where we think that the 6% to 8% overall is the right range for us.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joanne Wuensch","Good evening. Can you hear me okay?","Bob Weiss","I can.","Joanne Wuensch","Wonderful. Two questions. The first one you have been fairly acquisitive in the CSR area as it relates to M&A. How do we think about that on a sort of a go-forward basis? Is there a shift in your thinking for any particular reason or the same as you have done historically? And then my second question has to do with some of your competitors. Novartis, Alcon seems to be struggling a little bit, not really sure what\u2019s going on at Bausch, would love your view. And then Johnson & Johnson talked about stocking in the last quarter, wondering if you are seeing any of that also? Thank you.","Bob Weiss","I will let Al take the first one on the acquisitions of Surgical.","Al White","Sure. Yes. So obviously, we won\u2019t comment on any M&A activity that we are looking at, but having said that, we have been very active. We are incredibly active right now integrating the acquisitions that we have done and heavily focused on that. So we will continue to look at acquisitions if they make sense. They need to be the same as what they have been in the past, which is strategic acquisitions that offer us a good return. If we can find those kind of opportunities, we will capitalize on them. And if we can\u2019t, that\u2019s also okay. We will execute on the acquisitions we have done and integrate them and drive synergies.","Bob Weiss","As far as competition within CooperVision, you are correct that Alcon is struggling a little, although they did put up 7% growth number for the quarter. There is obviously the disruption of are they going to be spun-off, sold or kept. And Novartis reiterated their assessment that they are still open, they still have not made up their mind on what to do about Alcon and how that compares to them being a pharma business, if you will. So, we obviously like the uncertainty that that presents. We also like the fact that with few exceptions, Alcon is at the more mature end of a growth curve with some of their major products both in the monthly as well as in the 1-day space. TOTAL1 has the target on its back within \u2013 clearly, within the premium silicone hydrogel space. Everyone is shooting at them. And Cooper is shooting at them and MOIST in the mass market 1-day space. B&L put up some numbers. They highlight the growth products. They do not put it all together other than to say that their overall business grew 2% of lens care and lenses, so nothing to write home about there. They obviously are caught off in the cloud of what is that Valeant going to do to basically pay down some of its $30 billion of debt. And obviously in the marketplace, we think that their products are basically behind the curve, both as to the fact that they do not have a 1-day silicone hydrogel in that market and they still do not have and they have been at it for I don\u2019t know for how many years now, a complete portfolio with ultra, meaning a toric and a multifocal, so very slow to roll out in that venue. And quite frankly, most of what they have done their spend, trading from PureVision into ultra anyway. J&J just completed the acquisition of AMO. And obviously, they will be going through an integration within the Vistakon for eye care piece. They did mention on their call, they put up very robust numbers, but they did indicate that, I think 3% of their growth was tight buy and sell on shelf that had to do with the price increase they had effective early January and so they were selling into a pretty broad based price increase that pulled forward some of their purchases. And that\u2019s what they were referring to. I would not take that across the rest of the industry. I think that was mainly unique to their strategy and their view that you can \u2013 there was room to increase pricing in the marketplace.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel. Your line is open.","Jon Block","Great. Thanks guys. Good afternoon. I will try to ask both upfront, unfortunately they are both sort of long, but first, just from a geographic standpoint, the small felt of short share gains for CVIs in EMEA, well, it looks like it\u2019s almost in line with the market for the trailing 12 months versus sort of multiple of market for CVI in Americas and APAC, so Bob, can you just talk to the competitive dynamics in Europe versus Americas and APAC and why they are more muted, why is it a more muted European share gains, is that just a function of clariti being in Europe, first. And then the second one, Al, maybe this is more for you, I know you guys are getting the gross margin benefit from Avaira to Vitality in terms of when someone makes that switch, but are you guys seeing that in fiscal \u201817 or is it sort of awash in \u201817 and it takes hold more in \u201818 and beyond? Thanks guys.","Bob Weiss","So on EMEA yes, sure, your point is valid that our 1-day silicone hydrogel, clariti and MyDay got there first and we put up some good, solid numbers over the year. EMEA has been growing over the last 3 years at almost 2x the market. And importantly, when it comes to our performance in Europe, we are just on the heels of Alcon relative to one and two. So we have the highest market share of our three geographic locations in Europe, as contrast to Asia-Pac where we have the lowest market share of our three regions, yet we have a very full product portfolio. So we would expect, prospectively, to continue to grow faster in Asia-Pac than we would in EMEA. Having said that, we still think we have a lot of legs in terms of growth within EMEA in terms of gaining market share in that market. So we would look for, if you will, better than just holding our own this last quarter.","Al White","Yes. Thanks. So with respect to the Avaira Vitality shift Jon, your kind of basis is right there that, that\u2019s a very positive move for us. But I can tell you that in fiscal \u201817, we are not expecting to see any real gross margin expansion on that. If anything, it\u2019s possible it\u2019s little negative here early. But the transition from one product to the other product, especially a transition that\u2019s pretty unique, this was pretty unique in terms of its size versus anything else we have done, creates a lot of inefficiencies. So we will likely not see any real gross margin improvement from that product this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Hanover from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrew Hanover","Thanks for taking the question. I just had a couple and I will rattle them off. But you already talked about J&J, but I just wanted to delve in this a little bit more, it sounds when doing channel checks, the foot traffic in ECP offices were up pretty high in December and January, you obviously had the pull forward of J&J orders before they had some price increases, you delivered 9% in constant currency growth, but you also had an easier comp, so how do I think about the foot traffic in ECP offices, potential forward orders of J&J versus easier comps than what you all delivered and should we expect the second quarter for some of that to be a little bit easier for you. On the margin side, for gross margins, I just was thinking about you delivered 63.1% in CVI, which is up 220 bps year-over-year and I just want to understand how to think about the $0.30 of idle equipment still weighing on that segment, because you exited 2016 at 64.8%, which is a pretty nice up-tick, so if you don\u2019t mind, just those two questions? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Yes. As far as the J&J performance and Cooper\u2019s performance and our easier comps, if you will in Q1, I would assume that it\u2019s good for our point, we are obviously guiding 6% to 8%. And the easier comps, as much as anything, had to do with some of the disruption we had a year ago and that rolled into prior year comps from Asia-Pac where we \u2013 I am sorry, from Europe where we had done the integration of distribution centers in the fourth quarter of 2015 and that rolled into 2016, creating some adjustments, if you will and some performance issues with European customers, so some of it there. I think we have put up good numbers in the first quarter, so most of that is a reflection of our performance in the market in total, with the market growing 6%, us growing 9%. So the market was a little bit more robust. We are assuming that that momentum continues as far as the product rollouts, be it Energys, be it Vitality conversion. And so I think the Vitality conversion is more. As Al pointed out, somewhat disruptive as you go through the conversion process from a gross margin point of view. And from energy [ph] perspective, we are spending more time converting than we are looking for new business right now with the Vitality product. So we have got some work to do there that will give us some momentum. We also \u2013 I commented on the investment we are making in the sales force. So my belief is feet on the street are going to translate to a better shot at good top line growth and I think we have that going for us also. And that momentum builds. We now have some of the people that we hired in the fourth quarter last year that will start becoming productive as we move throughout the third quarter and into the fourth quarter and things of that nature.","Al White","Yes. With respect to the idle equipment, you are right, CooperVision has pretty strong gross margins right now and that does offer us upside. That $0.30 of idle equipment charge has decent impact on gross margins. So when we look at that, it\u2019s not necessarily going to be linear, but that $0.30 should be declining as we move through this year. And moving to next year, we will probably still have some. You have idle equipment associated mostly with daily as well. The strength that we are seeing in daily is obviously is good news as we are turning lines on. And then some of the heightened inventory activity is associated with things like Avaira and so forth, so that should also decline if that transition happens. So net-net, all that kind of being good news should indicate that CooperVision\u2019s gross margins are going to strengthen as we move through the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks and good evening. So just a quick housekeeping question, what was baked in for FX last quarter and just how does that compare to this quarter. And then two quick product questions would be just an update on MyDay in Japan. And then maybe just higher level in monthlies, it seems that the enhanced Biofinity portfolio is doing quite well and actually gaining share by our numbers, so maybe just an update broadly on how Biofinity sits within monthlies and then specifically, anything on ACUVUE VITA over the past quarter, any update there will be helpful? Thanks.","Al White","Sure. I will cover the FX one here quickly. So in our initial guidance in December, it was a $57 million negative impact to revenues on a year-over-year basis and a $0.10 unfavorable impact to EPS. Now on the updated rate that we just used today, it\u2019s a $61 million negative impact to revenues, so $4 million worse and it\u2019s a $0.16 negative impact to EPS or $0.06 worse.","Bob Weiss","As far as Japan and MyDay, we are very pleased with the progress we are making with MyDay in Japan and are ramping up and getting the MyDay toric into that market now and we will be broadening that toric, MyDay toric rollout in other regions around the world, Europe being next stop. As far as VITA and ultra and Air Optix, which are in the monthly space, obviously we are putting up great numbers. You can look at the fact that the market for 2-week and monthly is flat and we put up 7% growth for the quarter. And the market, ex dailies, for the trailing 12 months is down 1% and we put up 6% growth, which, obviously, the lion\u2019s share of that is driven by our monthly performance with Biofinity. So Biofinity is stellar and as I mentioned in a earlier question that both Avaira and Biofinity are growing ballpark about the same in constant currency, so both in around that 15% mark. So there is nothing and that\u2019s quite an accomplishment for Vitality when the energy is really going into that to swap out more than it is a trade up at this juncture. So I think both are doing strong in a market that we are the driver of the market, if you will. If you strip us out, the rest of the market is losing \u2013 is declining ex Cooper, if you will.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Steve Willoughby","Good evening guys. Two questions for you. First, Al, on your tax rate, 7.9% this quarter and you said that you benefited from the new stock comp accounting change, I am just wondering what you are assuming for the full year tax rate now where I believe you were previously expecting 10%. And then secondly Bob, just one final question on the industry growth, in calendar 4Q, correct me if I am wrong, but J&J I think grew 10% and Alcon grew 7% and you grew 9%, so how did the industry only show 6% growth in calendar 4Q, do you think? Thank you so much.","Al White","Yes. For the tax one, you are right. So we were guiding to 10%. We came in at 7.9% in Q1. So when you factor that in Steve, it\u2019s most likely to be a little bit under 10% for the full year. The rest of year at this point in time, we kind of contemplate being similar to what we had expected, so a little bit less than 10% now for the full year.","Bob Weiss","As far as the industry growth Steve, good question. Yes, J&J put up 10% and Alcon 7% and us 9%. And obviously, B&L was a lot less than that, but it\u2019s not big enough to move the needle that much. I think we had this discussion last quarter when we talked about there was a little skewing between market data and publicly reported data. And I think this is kind of \u2013 it\u2019s part of the \u2013 the flip side of that where all of a sudden, you have strong public reported numbers. And I believe the same thing is true that the skewing that we talked about that occurred before was the fact that there was a huge pipeline sell of when OASYS 1-day hit the market in the third quarter and the fourth calendar quarter in 2015. And now, you are seeing the flip side of that. That pipeline sell would then minimize in the publicly reported number by the difference between gross to net, particularly at J&J and that\u2019s speculative, but I do think are reasonable. So now, you have the flip side where there is less rebating and gross to net differential that is involved. And all of a sudden, the public reported numbers are coming out stronger than was the case a year ago. So that gross to net more impacted more the fourth quarter of public reported data a year ago and this year, a lot less. And therefore, the public reported numbers look a lot better this year, particularly at J&J.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Steven Lichtman","Thank you. Hi guys. Two questions, first on the sales and marketing investments Bob, you mentioned investments in both Vision and Surgical, should we assume the majority is in Vision or is it more balanced in the two? And generally, are the marketing investments \u2013 how do they differ from the type of programs you may have had in the past? And then secondly wondering if you talk a little bit about the MyDay performance in particular within the broader MyDay Clariti growth? How are you seeing the uptick with MyDay and how it\u2019s competing against the other more premium silicone hydrogels? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Alright. So, the sales and marketing investment is pretty intense in both Vision and Surgical. Surgical obviously is putting together a kind of a whole new business model with a lot of energy on the sales and marketing effort of this new combining. So, you have an integration going on, but you also have some products being sold with the sales force for the first time. It used to be some of those companies we bought were word-of-mouth in a cottage industry of IVF. So, we are investing on both sides of the equation, if you will both segments. Relative to the type of marketing dollars, Cooper is spending its marketing dollars broad-based. We have some new novel products to talk about like Energys, so there is some more unique marketing tools that are going on there. We continue to be very active in terms of our alignment with the eye care professional in terms of making them more efficient. So whether it\u2019s a lens area or whatever it is called, a number of programs that help the eye care professional become more and more proactive in terms of dealing with their individual customers. So we are out to make them better business people. And we invest money in that domain.","In Surgical on the other hand, as I mentioned, there it\u2019s transitioning from what may have been a word-of-mouth industry in PGS and PGD, which is preempt implementation diagnostics and screening to really talking about it and doing the push\/pull, not only with the IVF centers, but also with the OB\/GYN. So, there is stories to be told, once again, trying to enhance the industry called IVF, if you will. MyDay, the MyDay growth versus the Clariti growth, basically, MyDay off of a smaller \u2013 much smaller base is growing faster as a percent, but off of a smaller base. It is in the process of rolling out the toric and they were at \u2013 we are in first inning of that rollout with a lot of innings to go yet. Even with MyDay, we are probably only in the second or third inning, so a lot further to go. Clariti is probably more in the fourth inning than the first or second innings, but it likewise has a lot of countries to access. And quite frankly, now that we have gone through the transition of the enhanced edge, we will be more and more aggressive in terms of going after not converting one Clariti to another, but going after new fits in our competitive products, so the mass-market. So look for the combination of our sales force, feet on the street, the marketing programs and having a good \u2013 plenty of capacity to put behind the product to make us more aggressive in the mass-market space.","Operator","Thank you. And I am showing no further questions from our phone lines. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Bob Weiss for any closing remarks.","Bob Weiss","Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us.

Weiss","Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon and evening to everyone. I\u2019m very pleased to report a record \u2013 to report record results for fiscal 2012, including record revenues at CooperVision and CooperSurgical and record earnings per share for the Company. There were a number of positives this year, including operational successes such as Biofinity, the re-launch of Avaira Toric, the launch of single-use silicone and the success within CooperSurgical of its surgical business. In addition, there were the acquisition or there was the acquisition of Origio, our $1 billion credit facility and our purchase of 984,000 shares of our stock. These were great accomplishments and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the efforts of our people.","Now on to fourth quarter and three items, I\u2019d like to discuss before getting into the details. We experienced channel inventory contraction in the United States with our distributors. This is something we have carefully been managing in order to improve manufacturing distribution of efficiencies and we\u2019re happy with the progress we\u2019re making.","Having said that, on a year-over-year basis, we would have generated roughly $7 million in additional sales or about $0.07 without this contraction. Our effective tax rate came in several points higher than we had anticipated, hurting us by roughly $0.05. This was nothing out of the ordinary, just increased income and higher tax jurisdictions primarily with the United States and Denmark tied in to Origio and a less than expected release of reserves.","I should point out our guidance for 2013 continues to be in the 10% to 12% range and we remain confident with the regulations in place that are structured as sustainable. Hurricane Sandy unfortunately has impacted us and you can see a dip in the Americas for CooperVision and CooperSurgical revenue numbers. Although we were able to operate through the storm, our revenues were negatively impacted by roughly $2 million or about $0.02. There was slightly larger impact CooperSurgical given it is headquartered in Connecticut, but CooperVision also was impacted as its distribution center is located in Rochester, New York. Although negative in the fourth quarter, this has generally resulted in a good start to our fiscal 2013.","A few last items to mention before digging into the details. You will note we had $5 million insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter. This was from business interruption insurance for operational losses tied to ruptured pipe in our fire suppression sprinkling system in the U.K. plant last October of 2011.","As you may have noticed from our prior earnings in transcripts, the insurance company reimbursed us throughout this year for damage capital and manufacturing is back to normal. So this was related to lost profits. It was also unique expenses in the quarter as we spend approximately $6 million and additional OpEx items related to legal costs for certain contractual disputes and costs associated with decisions to expedite our Avaira Toric re-launch. Note, we won\u2019t comment on any at this time on the status of any legal matters.","Now on to some details. Our sales results, our silicone hydrogel family is driving our growth. During the fourth quarter, our silicone hydrogel family continued on its path of sponsoring our revenue growth. Silicone hydrogel revenues were $124 million. Our silicone hydrogel family grew 24% in cash and currency. The family now reflects 39% of CVI\u2019s revenue. The launch of Biofinity and Toric into Japan and the re-launch of Avaira Toric, while still modest in terms of contributions in the fourth quarter should have a much bigger impact going forward and in particular their halo effect on each respective product family.","Geographically foreign exchange headwinds slowed a bit and we\u2019re only 2% in the fourth quarter as well as for the fiscal year. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange essentially all of the Euro our growth at CooperVision would have been 7% in constant currency. Recently we have solid results in constant currency, the Americas up 3% for the quarter, EMEA up 11%, Asia Pac 12%, and overall 7% in constant currency.","Our growth drivers were in the Americas trading up to Biofinity, including the success of Biofinity Multifocal as well as the solid performance in the one day category contributed by Proclear 1 Day Sphere and Multifocal. These were overcame the effects of the authorized distributor contraction and Sandy.","In EMEA same as the Americas Biofinity, was a major contributor in the entire line including Spheres, Torics and Multifocal as well as Proclear 1 Day Spheres. And Asia Pac primarily Biofinity, Spheres, Proclear 1 Day Spheres and other one day Spheres and Torics were the contributors to our growth.","The worldwide soft contact lens market in the third calendar quarter of 2012 was up 4% in constant currency, while CooperVision was up 12%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the market was up 5%. On a trailing 12-month basis, we were up 10% on the strength of Biofinity and Proclear 1 Day. For the calendar quarter, the market growth was sponsored by one day, Multifocal and Torics. While CLI has stopped reporting the growth of silicone hydrogel material, most likely this trade-up of material remains a solid growth driver.","We were up 33% in constant currency for the calendar quarter in the area of silicone hydrogel lenses. This market continues to be a trade-up market, trading up includes the premium products; silicone hydrogel lenses, Torics and Multifocals. The trade-up to silicone hydrogel is in the 20% to 40% range. Importantly, a trade-up of a one day disposable expands per patient revenue by 400% to 600%. More importantly, the one day, where generates about 300% to 500% more profit.","Also it\u2019s important to understand that Torics and Multifocals have a long way to go in capturing the market opportunity especially outside the United States. Geographically, the strength of the Americas up 7% during the calendar quarter, led to an overall 4% market growth worldwide.","CooperSurgical, our women\u2019s healthcare franchise, had a solid quarter with $78 million in revenue. Revenue growth of 37% reflected the July acquisition of Origio, which contributed $19.4 million in revenue, excluding acquisitions CSI grew 2% during the quarter. Hurricane Sandy considerably impacted CooperSurgical\u2019s organic growth, given we ship out of Trumbull, Connecticut or the greater New York City area, if you will, which was considerably impacted at the end of October. Ex-Sandy we would have been in the 4% to 5% range of organic growth.","In addition to acquisition drivers of growth, growth continues to be weighted towards surgical procedures, hospital and same-day surgery, where revenue was up 15%. The Origio acquisition has considerably shifted our product mix. In the fourth quarter fertility was up 489% and comprises 29% of CooperSurgical\u2019s revenue or about four times its previous mix. We now have a good balance of our products targeting the office 40% of CooperSurgical\u2019s revenue, surgical procedures are 31% of our revenues and fertility the remaining 29%.We are making good progress with Origio integrated into \u2013 integrating it into CooperSurgical in a few short months that we\u2019ve had Origio under our fold.","With the addition of Origio we\u2019re the global market leader in in-vitro fertilization or IVF. And importantly, CooperSurgical has become a much more global business now having close to 30% of its revenues outside the U.S., more than double its prior mix of revenue. CooperSurgical now has direct presence in Japan, China, Russia, India, a minority position even in India.","While considerably impacted by Origio, CooperSurgical still put up very respectable operating ratios with gross margin at 64% in operating income non-GAAP excluding acquisition related costs of 19% for the quarter. ","To comment on guidance, we now have given some color on our expectations for 2013. We look for the soft contact lens market to stay a steady state in the 4% to 6% range. At CooperVision we look to continue gaining share with the strength of Biofinity and Proclear 1 Day together with the benefit of recent launches Proclear 1 Day Multifocal single-use silicone lens and the re-launch of Avaira Toric.","CooperSurgical growth will be sponsored mainly by the full-year impact of the IVF acquisition, Origio. On a non-GAAP earnings per share basis, we\u2019re guiding to a range of $5.70 to $6 and influencing the range among other items includes some of the fourth quarter events Sandy and authorized distributors.","Important considerations in 2013 include some remaining foreign exchange headwinds versus the prior-year, primarily in the first quarter. Avaira Toric re-launch cost, which began to ramp up in the fourth quarter of 2012 are expected to significantly impact the first quarter of 2013 as we re-launch this product, a minimum pick up from the Origio acquisition until later in the fiscal year and continued ramp up of our single-use silicon and geographic expansion that continues targeting not only China, but also some new developing country market locations. So net, we\u2019re still considerably in the investment mode and in spite of getting great return on invested capital from our Biofinity and Proclear family of products.","On strategy, we\u2019re continuing with our successful strategy. We believe it is solid and it has delivered results. CooperSurgical is putting up outstanding results and is leveraging its infrastructure. This franchise was built with the solid understanding of the value of critical mass in a women\u2019s healthcare market targeting the OB\/GYNs. We follow the professional wherever they go; office, surgery center, hospital or IVF centers. Although the call points are different for each, the leverage is considerable.","CooperSurgical\u2019s fourth quarter 2012 gross margin was 64%, our operating margins are close to 20%, and due to minimal CapEx requirements CooperSurgical is a significant contributor to our free cash flow. We are dedicated to this strategy and we will continue tuck-in acquisitions to leverage the CooperSurgical structure. At CooperVision the strategy is more complex and is much more global in nature.","In the $7 billion soft contact lens industry, because of the uniqueness of our manufacturing platform and product portfolio, we\u2019re the only participant that aggressively promote silicone hydrogel and non-silicone hydrogel, that is the Proclear family. We emphasize branded and non-branded products. And as I\u2019ve said in the past, private-label does not mean lower priced.","We actively promote and specialize in custom lenses with a high gross margin. We support all modalities that the eye care professional prescribes one day, two week, as well as monthly lenses and we support all types of lenses, Spheres, Torics and Multifocals. We are close to 30% share in the high growth specialty lens categories, Torics and Multifocals. It is acknowledged by eye care professionals that we\u2019re pretty good at specialty contact lenses.","Few would challenge the success of Biofinity Toric for astigmatism, put a great design together with a great material and great things can happen. We have seen similar successes for the same reason with the Biofinity Multifocal, which hit the market in the middle of calendar year 2011.","On the capacity front with the exception of Avaira Toric, we\u2019re ahead of plan to deliver considerably more products where we had previously been supply constrained. The Biofinity family, Proclear 1 Day, our one day Torics are all ramping up nicely. And the newest challenge will be the ramp-up of the one day silicone hydrogel lens, which is still a niche market. Our pricing \u2013 on pricing, like the rest of the soft contact lens industry, we have a trade-up strategy. Our new wearers and existing wearers are targeted for silicone hydrogel, the Proclear family and one day or single-use lenses, each creates more revenue per wear.","A one day modality for example, results in four to six times more revenue per wear. While this strategy sacrifices the gross margin percent, it generally generates three to five times more profit for the \u2013 for wearers \u2013 per wearer. Of course this strategy competes head on with the lens care space since we\u2019re shifting the wearer\u2019s resources from lens care to contact lenses only. Competing for lens care dollars is more of a problem for some of our competitors.","In my opinion, we continue to be the most focused Company in the industry lacking many of the distractions that some of our competitors are now going through. I might add with Biofinity, Avaira and Proclear we have a lot to talk about with eye care professionals around the globe.","As we look down the road over the next several years, we expect to continue improving operating margins and delivering above average shareholder returns. We expect to continue to average double-digit earnings per share growth while investing in geographic expansion and new product development. In today\u2019s market, we have a solid product portfolio to leverage in all modalities, multiple materials, all lens types, and we retain our expertise to emphasize customized lenses for the 10% to 20% of those lens wearers requiring other than standard lens sizes and\/or designs.","We have a lot of work to do before we come anywhere close to having exploited our number one contact lens family, Biofinity. This is particularly true when it comes to geographic expansion and fully developing the Biofinity family of Torics and Multifocals around the globe. The same applies to Avaira, where the Avaira Sphere has been anxiously awaiting the re-launch of Avaira Toric. The combination will put us in a much better position to exploit the U.S. two-week space owned by Johnson & Johnson and to also exploit our private label strategy more aggressively with this family.","While we already have pretty respectable gross margins and operating margins, from a cost perspective we\u2019ve considerable upside yet to be fully developed. Upsides include the elimination of a silicone hydrogel royalty, which expires \u2013 the patents expire in September of 2014 in the U.S. and March 2016 in the rest of the world. The reduction of our manufacturing costs by among other things, improving molding cycle times, increasing capacity utilization, and improving yields in general, each of these are key areas to us. Also, given the considerable amount of free cash flow we generate, we\u2019ll continue to look for tuck-in acquisitions and geographic expansion opportunities like Origio in our two businesses. The requirements, however, is that they must exceed our minimum investment hurdle rates.","Additionally, the market for both women\u2019s healthcare and soft contact lenses are much less developed outside the U.S. We generate a considerable amount of cash offshore due in part to our level of manufacturing outside the U.S. As such, we will continue to aggressively invest in global expansion opportunities. With over 95% of the population on the planet outside the U.S., we believe we will find opportunities to invest in other countries for decades to come thereby retaining our low effective tax rate indefinitely. Finally, as was the case in the first quarter, and again in the third quarter, when the stock was suppressed, we even demonstrated we\u2019re at times willing to buy in some of our own stock.","In summary, before I turn it over to Greg, the fourth quarter although a bit more challenging in many of our quarters, we continue to make good progress in delivering bottom line results. We continued gaining share in soft contact lenses. Additionally, we put up solid revenue growth, solid growth in operating ratios versus the prior-year. Delivered another year of solid free cash flow, while investing in our future and we strengthened our balance sheet achieving investment grade status. The year was filled with many exciting events including the amendment and extension of our credit agreement, the acquisition of Origio, the buyback of almost 1 million shares of our stock as well as the exciting launch of two new products Proclear 1 Day Multifocal and single-use silicones in select markets in Europe, as well as re-launch of the Avaira Toric.","During the quarter, we continued our exciting expansion into developing geographic markets with good progress in China and others. While the economy has shown an ability to remain sluggish for several years now, we continued to demonstrate that our $7 billion soft contact lens industry remains recession resistant. I see no end to this dynamic going forward. While we continue to reinvest in many areas, we also continue to provide a good return on invested capital targeting yet another year of double-digit earnings per share growth again this coming year.","And lastly, as always, I want to thank our employees, our number one asset in the Company, for the great job they continue to do all around the world. They\u2019re what makes Cooper such a great Company.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg.","Gregory W. Matz","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Bob has given you a pretty thorough review of the market and our revenue picture. Let me start with gross margins. Looking at gross margins, in Q4 the consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 63.8% compared with 62% for GAAP and 63.4% non-GAAP in Q4 last year. Remember last year\u2019s fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margins were impacted by the Avaira recall for $6 million, which included $4.9 million in cost of goods sold, inventory reserves, and $1.1 million for return provisions.","As you can see we had a solid gross margin quarter in line with our expectations due to the increased manufacturing efficiencies and favorable product mix. For the year, we had a GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin at 63.9% versus 60.5% for GAAP and 62.1% for non- GAAP in 2011. Origio had a 30 basis point negative impact on gross margins for the quarter and about a 10% basis point negative impact for the year.","CooperVision on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis reported a gross margin of 63.7% versus 61.3% for GAAP and 63.1% for non-GAAP in Q4 last year. As I just mentioned, the difference in 2011 between GAAP and non-GAAP was the impact of the Avaira recall.","For the full year, CooperVision\u2019s GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin was 63.4% versus 59.7% for GAAP and 61.5% for non-GAAP in 2011. As you can see, we continued the multi-year trend of improving margins, a special thanks to our manufacturing team for the great work that they have done.","CooperSurgical had gross margin of 64.1%, which compares to Q4 \u201911 of 65.3%. Excluding Origio, gross margin would have been 66.3%. The ongoing year-over-year improvements in the base business were mainly due to manufacturing efficiencies and favorable product mix especially in the surgical space. For the year, CooperSurgical had gross margins of 66.4% versus 64.8% 2011.","Now looking at operating expenses, SG&A, in Q4 on a GAAP basis, SG&A expenses increased by 9% from Q4 last year to $152.4 million and were 38% of revenue versus 39% the prior-year. Remember in Q4 \u201911, we did have the $10 million charge for the Rembrandt settlement. Excluding this item, SG&A would have grown 17.5%. If you adjust the 17.5% to exclude Origio then the increase was 11%. That 11% reflects increased spending on marketing and sales headcount adds from earlier in the year, numerous Q4 marketing projects and product launches around the world, our re-launch of some of the additional Avaira Toric fitting sets as well as some one-time legal expenditures. The majority of this spend was variable in nature versus infrastructure spend. As a follow on, SG&A on a non-GAAP basis increased only 8% sequentially, 5% sequentially excluding Origio. For the year GAAP SG&A grew 10%.","Now looking at R&D, in Q4, R&D increased by 20% year-over-year to $14.1 million or up about $2.4 million and was 3.6% of revenue, up from 3.3% of revenue in Q4 \u201911 and up from 3.5% sequentially. Excluding Origio, R&D increased approximately 12% at $1.4 million and would have been about 3.5% of revenue. This increase excluding Origio is mainly attributable to a variety of spending on new product development and clinicals. We would expect that R&D will continue to grow slightly faster than sales for the coming year. For the year, R&D grew 19% or $8.1 million. Excluding Origio, R&D grew 16% or $6.8 million.","Depreciation and amortization, in Q4, depreciation was $23.5 million, up $2.8 million or 13% year-over-year and amortization was $7.3 million, up $1.7 million or 31% year-over-year, for a total of $30.8 million. Origio amortization for the quarter was $1.9 million. For the year, depreciation and amortization were $87.2 million and $24 million respectively for a total of $111.2 million.","Moving to operating margins, for Q4, consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $79 million or 19.9% of revenue versus $56.6 million or 18.5% of revenue in Q4 \u201911. This represents a 19% increase in operating income over Q4 \u201911. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the Origio acquisition costs of approximately 800K in the current quarter and the $6.2 million impact of the Avaira recall as well as the $10 million Rembrandt settlement in Q4 \u201911, operating income and margin were $79.8 million or 20.1% of revenue versus 22.9% in the prior-year. This reduction is largely attributable to the increased investment in selling and R&D we\u2019ve done over the last year.","On a GAAP basis for the full year, our operating income and margin were $283.4 million or 19.6% of revenue, up about 24.5% in dollars. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income and margin were $288.3 million or 19.9% of revenue and up approximately 11% in dollars.","Now moving onto interest expense, interest expense in the quarter was $2.7 million. Included in gain on insurance proceeds is \u2013 Bob had mentioned this earlier is $5 million of insurance proceeds for business interruption related to the October 28, 2011 incident where a pipe ruptured in our fire suppression sprinkler system, causing water and fire retardant foam damaged to one of our manufacturing buildings in the U.K. as we\u2019ve talked on previous calls.","Moving onto the effective tax rate, in Q4, the GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate was 12.7% and 13% respectively versus Q4 \u201911 GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate of 9.9% and 9%. As we\u2019ve discussed before, the effective tax rate continues to be below the U.S. statutory rate as the majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. The quarter\u2019s rate was higher than expected and as we had expected some favorable adjustments to your reserves as well as we saw an increase in profits in higher tax jurisdictions mainly the United States and Denmark. The combination of factors drove the Q4 rate up, but we did achieve our full-year guidance. On a full year basis, the GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate was 9.7% versus 9% for GAAP and 10.1% for non-GAAP in 2011. Stock-option comp Q4 was $4.9 million. Total comp for the year \u2013 stock-option comp for the year is $21.5 million.","Moving on to earnings per share, as Bob mentioned, our Q4 EPS on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was $1.46 and $1.47 respectively, versus $1.15 and $1.46 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in Q4 \u201911. For the year, EPS was $5.05 for GAAP and $5.16 for non-GAAP versus prior-year GAAP and non-GAAP of $3.63 and $4.50 respectively.","Hurricane Sandy, as Bob mentioned, negatively impacted revenue by approximately $2 million, which would have had approximately $0.02 impact on EPS. The quarterly effective tax rate came in higher than we guided in Q3 as I mentioned a few moments ago. Had the effective tax rate been at 10%, the mid-point of our guidance we would have seen an additional $0.05 earnings per share non-GAAP.","Moving on to share repurchase program from that perspective, no additional shares were repurchased during the fourth quarter. On December 5th, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 150 million of common stock under the existing share repurchase program. With this approval, the Company has now authorized to purchase up to 300 million of its common stock.","During 2012, we purchased approximately 984,000 shares at an average cost of $72.30 for a total cost of $71.1 million. This new authorization leaves us with approximately $228.9 million left in the program.","Moving onto balance sheet and liquidity items, in Q4 we had cash provided by operations of $114.8 million, capital expenditures of $32.6 million, and excluding Origio acquisition related cost of $1.3 million, resulting in an $83.5 million of free cash flow. For the full-year, we generated $230.4 million of free cash flow, our full-year CapEx number was $99.8 million, so just under $100 million. Total debt decreased within the quarter by $106.4 million to $373.7 million. Debt as a percent of the total capitalization is now 14%. This leaves us with approximately $653.7 million of total credit available at October 31.","Inventories increased by $18.5 million from the last quarter, approximately $18 million is related to silicone products and related raw materials in CooperVision. For the quarter, we\u2019re seeing months on hand at 6.7 months, up from months on hand of about 5.5 months in Q4 \u201911 or if you adjust Q4 \u201911 for the voluntary recall of certain Avaira contact lenses would be about 5.9 months on hand. Accounts receivable continues to be closely monitored with DSOs at 54 days, down from 55 days last year.","Moving on to guidance, in order to provide a little bit more color for your models, let me share some additional specifics on our guidance. Bob touched a bit on the revenue ranges, but just to reiterate for the Company\u2019s standpoint, $1.565 billion to $1.625 billion in revenue for the total Company. CooperVision $1.25 billion to $1.290 billion for CooperVision and CooperSurgical $315 million to $335 million, again for CooperSurgical revenues. If I move on to gross margin, it\u2019s in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%. It\u2019s currently expected that the medical device tax would have a 30 basis point negative impact in 2013.","Our gross margins are positively impacted by increased efficiencies in the manufacturing process as well as impacted by a mix between such products as Biofinity, Avaira, single-use silicone, and traditional hydrogels as examples for CVI, and mix examples for surgical would be a mix between the surgical products and the IVF products.","From an OpEx perspective, we are guiding to a range of 43% to 44% of revenue, operating income as a percent of revenue is expected to be in the 20.5% to 21% range. Interest expense expected to be in the $10.5 million to $11.5 million range. Amortization should be approximately $29 million. The effective tax rate is 10% to 12%, as Bob had mentioned earlier.","I realize we finished 2012 at 9.7%, but remember we did have some unique events like settling the federal tax court case, which did hold our rate down below this range in 2012. GAAP and non-GAAP EPS are expected to be in the range of $5.70 to $6 for the year. Free cash flow guidance is at $200 million to $230 million range with CapEx at the $120 million to $150 million range. Share count guidance is 49.8 million shares, and as always guidance assumes constant currency at the date of issuance.","With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session.","Kim Duncan","Operator, we are ready to take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Kim Gailun with JP Morgan. Please proceed.","Kimberly Gailun - JP Morgan","Hi, guys. Good afternoon. So first question, I guess, is on the inventory. You called out $7 million and $0.07 in the quarter. And just to be clear, are you saying that this \u2013 some of this inventory has bounced back here in the first quarter? And how can you be sure that this is actually inventory and not end customer demand?","Robert S. Weiss","I think you\u2019re talking about the shrinkage in the authorized distributors, which was $7 million and that shrinkage is a function of us working with our distributor and \u2013 back up to a year-ago, you may recall in 2011 we \u2013 on the quarterly calls, focused in on reducing the levels of inventory on hand at authorized distributors, which we successfully did the first three quarters which was caused by a shift in the way we approached them in 2011, but we still had an annual commitment. So what happened in the fourth quarter a year-ago was that the distributors recognizing they had annual commitments and annual incentives still took their inventories up by and large, and I\u2019m blending it across all authorized distributors higher than we would have preferred a year-ago.","This year, we worked not only the quarters, but we preempted that phenomena and that\u2019s what caused the year-over-year reduction in inventory on-hand at distributors as of the end of our fiscal year. So, that is something that from an efficiency point of view, going forward, we do not anticipate building backup to the levels anything like existed as of October 31, 2011, following all that management we went through of inventory, the first three quarters.","So, it's an efficiency factor that comes into play. Year-over-year had \u2013 we had the same level of inventory at the distributors, it would have been another $7 million higher, if you will, that we would had on our balance sheet. Next question?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on some clarification questions on the quarter. The $5 million insurance gain, why did you book that as non-GAAP EPS this quarter and the $6 million in additional OpEx for legal and the Avaira Toric re-launch, how much is for legal and should we expect any additional legal expenses related to this matter in 2013? And lastly, Bob, you talked about a good start to fiscal 2013. Can you elaborate on that a little more please? Thanks.","Robert S. Weiss","Okay. As far as the $5 million, which was business interruption, it reflects some of the activity that happened or didn\u2019t happen throughout the P&L in 2012 and then into 2013, so it\u2019s operational in that sense. And quite frankly, the story would have gotten complicated if we were to excluded from the non-GAAP together with some of those other factors that had to do with higher than, let\u2019s say, a number of legal things coming together all at once.","The answer to your question is the $6 million, about half of that is legal matters and that\u2019s plural, there are several events, all of which were concentrated in the quarter and I\u2019m really not going to get into any one of those events for obvious reasons. And then the other half of that was the \u2013 if you will, the acceleration and the push of the re-launch of Avaira Toric. And there is kind of an anomalous result of those \u2013 the re-launch because it is a re-launch being a much more expensive event from an accounting point of view than were it just new sets going out the door that get spread over three years. In the case of a re-launch, a good chunk of those fitting sets get charged to the P&L.","So in the fourth quarter and again in the first quarter of 2013 there will be a unusually high charge to operating costs for the re-launch of let\u2019s say old fitting sets from the initial Avaira Toric launch and that is somewhat anomalous. But I respect the fact that you can debate all over what those three events, the legal matters, the re-launch, and the $5 million below the line and its impact on above the line or not above the line from an operating income point of view.","Gregory W. Matz","Larry, just to throw in too, the legal expenses going forward we don\u2019t expect to see them forward, it was a one-time thing here for this quarter.","Robert S. Weiss","As far as the start of 2013, I think the plus is there is some ripple effect of the \u2013 what didn\u2019t all go out the door because of Hurricane Sandy. I\u2019d balance that or temperate it, if you will, by the fact that quite frankly some \u2013 if you think about the phenomena of not getting Rx primarily Rx Torics out the door in October because there the doctors aren\u2019t open. They\u2019re canceling their patients and the patients are being put back in the queue. Whether or not all those patients get back in the queue, on the East Coast in the first quarter or later, because there is a bottleneck remains to be seen. But the risk \u2013 some of that will all come back in the subsequent periods.","As far as the tempering, I emphasize that we will continue the rollout of Avira Toric fitting sets and I\u2019d say about half of them, meaning the initial fitting sets that went out the door and are being re-launched, went out prior to the end of the fiscal year and the other half will go out the door essentially all in the first quarter. So there is that week in the first quarter, that will not repeat itself post the first quarter, I want to emphasize that point. Next question?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please proceed.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James","Yeah. Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to understand the outlook for free cash flow, which was it looks like it\u2019s sort of flattish in guidance for 2013 versus 2012. It sounds like you\u2019re increasing CapEx, so I want to understand what that\u2019s all about. And on the share repurchase, you obviously had not completed your authorization, so I want to understand why the increase in the authorization at this time? Thanks.","Robert S. Weiss","I will take the first half and then let Greg add anything I miss, but from a free cash flow perspective, you\u2019re right, the culprit so to speak, is increase in CapEx. And as you know, we\u2019re moving more aggressively down the path of investing in silicone hydrogel 1 Day in that market even though it\u2019s a niche today. I\u2019d say, three to five years down the road or some point in time it will become more than that and we want to be there and participate in that arena. And we think we\u2019ve a pretty good product in our test market or rollout market, if you will, in Europe right now.","So, that\u2019s the catalyst for increasing capital requirements. As far as the authorization of the buyback of our stock had a termination date at the end of the calendar year and we had to renew it, and in so renewing, since we already had put a dent into half of it, we expanded it and took away the time deadline, if you will, for that. Next question?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird. Please proceed.","Jason Bednar - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Good afternoon, guys. This is actually Jason in for Jeff. I just wanted to ask on the single-use silicone. You\u2019ve mentioned before that some of the cost reductions in manufacturing this product will be volume related, while many others will just take time. Wondered if you can focus on the latter here, just \u2013 as it sounds like volume of this product are still pretty well, have you overcome any hurdles in the last few months with this product. Can you remind us how you see gross margin on it playing out over the next 6 to 12 months and the next one to two years?","Robert S. Weiss","I\u2019d say we\u2019re more than happy where we\u2019re already. Its \u2013 I\u2019d view it as a several year program. In fact we\u2019re still getting cost out of our first one days in our Proclear 1 Days. So in some cases we\u2019ve been added for five, six, seven years and are still improving the process. As far as silicone hydrogel 1 Day, a lot of costs have come out, I\u2019d say quite frankly and I won\u2019t get into much more close in this, it is the cost that\u2019s well less than half of what it used to cost us to make a little over four, five months ago, which might be a relative term, but we\u2019re clearly in the mode where it is unlike when we first launched it \u2013 it has a positive gross margin and it\u2019s pointing in the right direction. That will continue for the indefinite future and we already know things we want to do to improve the whole manufacturing process going forward as we talk about spending more capital in that area. Next question?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with William Blair. Please proceed.","Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company, L.L.C","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and I apologize for any background noise that you\u2019re picking up there. Just to follow-up a little bit on Kim\u2019s question Bob, I just want to make sure we\u2019re clear on this that, with this distributor adjustment there is nothing that you\u2019re seeing as far as any customer demand changes that\u2019s precipitating this adjustment to the distributor network. And then on top of that, just with the CVI guidance for 2013, it seems you\u2019re calling for at the high-end of the range, couple of hundred basis points to share taking with 8% growth if the market is even up 6%, what products specifically or regions tend to get us there? And then lastly, Greg, just to finish up my three-part question here, just to be sure, there is nothing assumed in guidance for any kind of share repurchases for 2013, is that correct?","Gregory W. Matz","Yeah, Matt, to your last question right. There is nothing planned for share repurchases.","Robert S. Weiss","As far as is there any implications of the reduction of inventory on-hand at the distributor tied in with pull through, the answer is, no there is not. You can see that both in our quarterly CLI data that wouldn\u2019t have the skewing of the distributors, particularly in the last quarter. And importantly, relative to what\u2019s going to continue to see that we will gain share or why we expect to gain share, clearly the driving factors will continue to be the Biofinity family, which is doing very well and you can see how well silicone hydrogels have done driven by Biofinity.","The fact that Proclear 1 Day continues to be double-digit, solid double-digit growth around the world with lot of opportunities still to go. The fact that we have the three new launches of products that occurred late in 2012, which would be the single-use product in Europe, the Proclear 1 Day Multifocal, which is getting good market reception as well as our rollout of Biofinity Toric into Japan, which also has a halo effect on the sphere, so that you have a family of products developing in Japan. So, we are pretty optimistic, we will grow faster than the market and that the market will remain in that 4% to 6% range going forward and we\u2019ll gain share. Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO. Please proceed.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Can you hear me?","Robert S. Weiss","We can.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Wonderful. Thank you. Let\u2019s just talk about your Toric sales in the quarter. Forgive me if I missed this, but that growth rate seemed a little bit lower than what I was expecting. Is there a particular reason behind that?","Robert S. Weiss","Yeah, there really are two reasons. One is if you think about the fact that a lot of Torics are Rx and they go straight to the doctor\u2019s office for the patient. So when we talk about Hurricane Sandy and what didn\u2019t get out the door, what did get out the door is what went to the distributors. We did not have a problem getting product to them, which we worked around the storm. What did not get out the door is really, primarily, that one \u2013 that Toric business that is Rx. So, the bulk of Sandy, I\u2019d say would be Toric related.","The second thing is the year-over-year contraction at the distributors, since Biofinity is such a huge product worldwide. It is \u2013 suffice it to say, our distributors carry a fair amount of Biofinity for the easier to fit SKUs or the more popular, if you will. And as a result of that, that contraction of the 7 million, some of that rippled into that arena also. If you were to look at, for example, the calendar quarter ended September on a year-over-year basis, our Torics grew 11% against the market of 7% and if you look on a trailing 12-month ended September 30th, it\u2019s likewise 11% versus the market 8%. So overall our Torics are doing well and what you\u2019re seeing is somewhat the implications of those two events. Next question?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi. Please proceed.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup","Hi. Bob a question for you, this is not the first time that you've gone into a year ahead where there is uncertainty and issues around investment and new product launches. And at this time last year, the earnings range you gave was $0.20. This year going into 2013, the EPS range is $0.30. Is there that much variability and visibility or are there competition issues, like why such a broad range going into 2013 when you've had similar types of issues to deal with in the past? And second, for Greg, can you just confirm on the P&L where the device tax is going to be booked? Thanks.","Robert S. Weiss","The answer to the first question on the range, quite frankly we\u2019ve been pleased to beat our range frequently in the past and now we\u2019ve kind of in this fourth quarter certainly not beat the range we put out there of the $1.50 to $1.55. There is variability caused by a lot of things, including the whole debate on what\u2019s going on in Europe, the whole debate on the fiscal cliff in the United States, while we\u2019re recession resistant. That\u2019s not to say on a given quarter there aren\u2019t events that really cause a contraction or some anomalous event.","So is $0.30 spread against something in the neighborhood of $5.70 large? I know we can debate that probably forever. I think it\u2019s prudent to give a broader range than to try to micro a narrow thing, which is unrealistic in my opinion, at least as we\u2019re sitting here nine months ahead of or 10 months ahead of time.","Medical device, I'm going to take a shot at it and I will let Greg refine anything I say wrong. That is still to be determined. There are different ways to operate, as I understand in the domain, some companies are going cost of goods and some companies are going operating cost. And quite frankly those that are going cost of goods are actually managing the process better than those that are going operating cost, but it\u2019s to be determined whether or not we will end up with a model that is one or the other.","Gregory W. Matz","Yeah so, Bob, I think you hit it. There has been a lot of focus groups and industry groups over the last couple months trying to understand the guidance and more and more white papers from various companies coming out about how to treat this. And again, still undetermined, we\u2019re still looking at that. In guidance, we had stuck it in cost of goods sold.","Robert S. Weiss","Next question?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies Group. Please proceed.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Thanks. Just one industry question and I maybe wrong here, so just to confirm, but we did see a report in late October early November that the 1-800 CONTACTS and Wal-Mart would be dissolving their relationship come December 31st of this year. So a couple of questions there. One, is that true? A follow-up would be is that due to the WellPoint acquisition of 1-800 CONTACTS and if indeed it is true, how does that affect your business? Thanks.","Robert S. Weiss","It\u2019s my understanding that it\u2019s true that they\u2019re parting their ways or their current structure. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s WellPoint related or not and it didn\u2019t matter to us when they put it together and it doesn\u2019t matter when they take it apart. So we don\u2019t \u2013 we really don\u2019t care. Next question?","Operator","And at this time there are no further questions in queue. And I\u2019d now like to hand the call back over to Mr. Bob Weiss for closing remarks.","Robert S. Weiss","Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us today on this call. Look forward to launching into 2013. We think we\u2019ve a lot of exciting things in the pipeline that are going very well.

Welcome to our third quarter 2016 conference call.","Let me start by highlighting three key points. First, I'm pleased to report another strong quarter including first ever quarter with revenues over $500 million. This includes CooperVision reporting revenues over $400 million for the first time and CooperSurgical reporting revenues over $100 million for the first time. This resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.30 and free cash flow of $98 million. Second, CooperVision posted strong results in all key areas of its business resulting in 6% as reported in constant currency. Single use silicone hydrogel lenses grew 40% while two week and monthly silicone hydrogel lenses grew a combined 11%, both in constant currency. Third, CooperSurgical had another strong quarter posting revenue growth of 38% or 6% pro forma. Fertility was the highlight posting the strongest quarter in many years with growth of 108% or 10% pro forma.","Moving into details; CooperVision reported second quarter revenues of $410 million, up 6%. This was another strong quarter, and continues to show the strength of our product portfolio. The Americas grew 6% in constant currency with strength in multiple categories led by Biofinity and our 1-day silicone hydrogel franchise. Our enhanced Clariti lens continues to perform well and MyDay had another strong quarter. During the quarter we received FDA approval for Avaira Vitality and began to launch in the U.S. in late July. You will recall Avaira Vitality is the replacement product for Avaira in the two week silicone hydrogel market. The market reaction has been positive. We remain optimistic about this upgraded product. We also introduced Biofinity Energys at the American Optometric Association Conference in July and began to launch in August. This premium Biofinity product has received excellent reviews and we're confident we will great success in its offering.","EMEA posted a solid quarter from 3% year-over-year in constant currency against the tough comp. Growth was driven by Biofinity and the 1-day silicone hydrogel franchise. Asia Pacific had a very strong quarter with 16% constant currency growth; growth was strong throughout the region during Biofinity, and the 1-day silicone hydrogel franchise. Within Japan, our MyDay share launches progressed well and we introduced MyDay toric during the quarter. We believe both, MyDay sphere and toric have the potential to be a very successful premium offering in this market.","Turning to our product categories; toric's grew a healthy 10% year-over-year and multifocals grew 5%, both in constant currency. We remained the global leader in specialty lenses and our success with Biofinity and Clariti in both of these categories should continue to drive growth for many years. Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses, these products grew 16% in constant currency and now represent 61% of our total sales. Within the two week and monthly space, Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 11% in constant currency. We remain under-indexed in the two week and monthly silicone hydrogel space at 75% of revenue versus the market at 79%, so we expect to continue growing faster than the market given our strong product portfolio.","Regarding our silicone hydrogel 1-day lenses, Clariti and MyDay, they combined to grow 40% in constant currency. The biggest driver in our contact lens market is 1-day growth and we strongly believe we have the best product portfolio offering in the space as the only company with premium and mass-market lenses including a full portfolio of 1-day silicone hydrogel sphere, toric and multifocal lenses.","Now let me comment on the overall contact lens market and remember, this information is on the last page of the earnings release. For the calendar quarter, Q2, we continue taking shares growing 10% with the market up 5%. Geographically, CooperVision grew 8% in the Americas, while the market was up 4%. In Asia Pacific, we grew 20% with the market up 4%. And in EMEA, we grew 9% with the market up 7%. On a modality basis, single use lenses continued driving growth with CooperVision up 18% and the market up 10%. For non-silicone hydrogel -- non-single use lenses, we grew 7% while the market grew 1%. As you can see, our growth remains diverse and strong.","On the trailing 12-month basis, CooperVision grew 8% and the market grew 5%. Going forward, I expect the market to continue growing 4% to 6% over the next five years and most likely closer to 6%. The drivers will continue to be a shift to DAILIES geographic expansion and the expansion of the wearer base. We expect to continue taking market share led by our strong silicone hydrogel portfolio.","Moving to CooperSurgical, we reported Q2 revenues of $105 million, up 38% year-over-year driven by strong organic growth and acquisitions. On a pro forma basis, growth was up 6%. Our fertility products led the way up 108% or 10% pro forma. Within fertility, we had growth throughout the business and continue to believe our market leading product portfolio which includes medical devices, genetic testing and capital equipment is the broadest portfolio in the space and should continue to drive growth for many years to come. Within our office and surgical category, our growth moderated slightly from the last few quarters up 3%. We're continuing to execute on several product launches including our disposable stoke NOC [ph], we believe we were well positioned in this segment going forward.","Regarding acquisitions, we've been actively working in on integrating the deals we've done over the past year, and the strategic rationale behind these deals remains intact. We are very focused on becoming a full service provider within the global IVF space.","Finally on CooperSurgical, we're continuing to execute on several initiatives which should significantly strengthen the business and pay dividends for many years to come. These include transitioning to a geographic sales model adding sales reps and underpenetrated areas, launching products in new markets and increasing our focus on high growth areas such as IVF genetic testing. To some degree, these investments are masking our strong underlying operating performance but it's critical that we lay the ground work to support the business on a long-term growth perspective.","Now turning to guidance, I'll let Greg go through the details but let me touch on a few items. For Q4 we're guiding CooperVision to roughly 5.5% to 7% constant currency growth and CooperSurgical roughly to 5% to 8% pro forma growth. So similar growth to Q3 regarding non-GAAP earnings per share for Q4 we're guiding to $2.15 to $2.30. Regarding fiscal 2017, it's too early to provide financial guidance but I will say it should be a strong year, even the momentum in our two businesses as well as recent currency moves. From a longer term perspective, we're still targeting operating margins of 27% or higher in 2020.","In conclusion, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for all their hard work and dedication. I also want to say a special thank you to Greg Matz, who has announced his plan of retirement after more than six years of service of our company, including roughly the last five years of our CFO. Greg will be greatly missed and we wish him the best in his future endeavors. With Greg's departure, we have announced Al White, who many of you know really well, will succeed Greg as CFO. Al will assume this role in addition to his current leadership responsibilities with CooperSurgical. I'm very confident that his leadership and abilities will allow us to continue driving long-term shareholder value. From a timing perspective, Greg will remain CFO until the end of the fiscal year and then Al will take over the position. Greg will remain with us through March of next year to ensure a smooth transition.","And now I'll turn it over to Greg to cover our financial results.","Gregory Matz","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon everyone. Bob provided an overall summary of our performance including a review of the market and our revenue picture. I am going to focus primarily on our non-GAAP results for the quarter, for the reconciliation to GAAP numbers please refer to our earnings release.","Looking at gross margins, in Q3 the non-GAAP gross margin was 63.6% compared to 62.4% in the prior year. This increase is largely due to a favorable mix by Biofinity and favorable FX offset by recent CSI acquisitions which have lower gross margins. CooperVision on a non-GAAP basis reported gross margins of 64.2% versus 61.8% in Q3 of last year. The factors which impacted margin were the IMs I just mentioned. CooperSurgical had a non-GAAP gross margin of 61.2%, which compares to Q3 '15 of 65.4%. Acquisitions in the genetic testing space were the primary drivers for this reduction.","Now looking at operating expenses, on a non-GAAP basis, SG&A increased approximately 8% to $179.7 million or 35% of revenue, down from approximately 36% of revenue in the prior year. Primary driver behind this drop was strong spending controls as we had leverage in both, CooperVision and CooperSurgical. Now looking at R&D in Q3; R&D on a non-GAAP basis decreased 2% to $16 million or 3.1% of revenue, down from 3.5% of revenue in the prior year. The primary driver of the leverage we're seeing from the Sauflon acquisition.","Moving to operating margins; for Q3, consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $102.7 million and 19.9% of revenue versus $50.3 million and 10.9% of revenue in Q3 last year. Non-GAAP operating income and margins were $131.6 million and 25.6% of revenue versus $106.1 million and 23% of revenue for the prior year. The primary difference in the operating margin year-over-year is improved gross margins and operating expense leverage.","In Q3, CooperVision's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $119.4 million and 29.1% of revenue versus $97.7 million and 25.3% of revenue in the prior year. CooperSurgical's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $23.5 million and 22.4% of revenue versus Q3 '15 of $19.5 million of operating income and 25.6% of revenue.","Looking at depreciation and amortization; in Q3, depreciation was $33.9 million, down $7.5 million year-over-year. Amortization was $15.6 million, up $3.1 million, reflecting our recent acquisition activity. Interest expense was $8 million for the quarter, up $3.3 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher debt and interest rates associated with acquisitions.","Looking at the effective tax rate, in Q3, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 7.7% versus a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 3.1% in Q3 '15. As a reminder, in the prior year, we had a higher dollar amount of Q3 discrete items related to prior years which reversed in that quarter. On earnings per share, our Q3 earnings per share on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis was $1.79 and $2.30 respectively versus $0.91 and $1.97 for GAAP and non-GAAP in the prior year.","Now looking at some balance sheet and liquidity items in Q3, we had cash provided by operations of $128.9 million, plus capital expenditures of $31.1 million, resulting in $97.8 million of free cash flow. Excluding integration costs of $6.5 million, adjusted free cash flow was $104.3 million. Total debt increased slightly within the quarter by $2.7 million to $1,444.1 million, primarily due to higher average cash balances and acquisitions, largely offset by operational cash flow generation.","Inventories decreased by approximately $3.3 million to $430.3 million over last quarter. In CooperVision, we saw overall inventory decline as growth in silicon daily inventory to support our product launches was offset by a reduction in our hydrogel inventory. In CooperSurgical we saw small increase largely due to the new acquisitions. For the quarter, we're seeing months on hand at 6.5 months, down from 7 months last quarter. Day sales outstanding is at 54 days, same as last quarter and down one day from the prior year.","Now turning to guidance; for our main currencies, we are using 1.10 for the euro, 1.04 for the yen, and 1.30 for the pound. And looking at the full year, the consolidated revenue range is being raised on the low end to reflect our Q3 performance and is now $1.944 billion to $1.957 billion or approximately 6% to 7% pro forma growth, up from the previous 5.5% to 7% range. For the fourth quarter, CooperVision's revenue range is $390 million to $400 million or roughly 5% to 7.5% constant currency growth. And CooperSurgical's revenue range is $106 million to $109 million or roughly 5% to 8% pro forma growth. We expect non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter to be slightly over 64% driven by a strong quarter for CooperVision. This would result in a full year gross margin around 63%.","OpEx is expected to be slightly under 39% for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year. Operating margin is expected to be around 26% in Q4 which would result in the full year margin being in the mid-24% range. Interest expense is expected to be a little over $7 million in Q4 or slightly over $28 million for the year. Our effective tax rate guidance is the same as last quarter; a full year rate of around 8% translates to 10.5% to 11% in Q4. Our expected share count is around 49.1 million shares, our non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $2.15 to $2.30 from the fourth quarter which equates to $8.32 to $8.47 for the full year.","From our last earnings call, currency was a positive in Q3, helping roughly $0.04 but we are expecting a negative impact in Q4, roughly $0.02 from our previous guidance. Unfortunately, some of the positives we experienced in Q3 from currency such as the yen and the euro are now being more than offset by the move in the pound since Brexit occurred in late June. As Bob mentioned, if currency holds, which would see a lot of benefit next year led by cost of goods, as roughly 40% of CooperVision's product as manufactured in pounds with roughly a six months lag to the P&L. To be clear, this is roughly 40% of CooperVision's manufacturing, so on a consolidated basis, this is roughly 30% of our total cost of goods. Also note, the pound move associated with Brexit occurred in late June, so this positive impact starts in January; so more muted positive impact in fiscal Q1 versus the remainder of the year.","And the other point to note as I mentioned earlier, is our effective tax rate guidance remains unchanged which means the Q4 tax rate range of about 10.5% to 11%. Regarding cash flow, our CapEx was low this quarter but we do expect around $50 million in Q4, so around $170 million of CapEx for the year now. This should result in free cash flow over $300 million and adjusted free cash flow and excluding integration related activity at well north of $300 million.","With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session.","Kim Duncan","Thank you, Greg. Operator, we're ready to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good evening guys. Can you hear me, okay?","Bob Weiss","Can hear you fine.","Jeff Johnson","Okay, great. Greg, I just wanted to say, it's been great working for you -- working with you, not for you but working with you for the last few years and best of luck in the future. And Al, plus or minus, we'll see how it goes here over the next few years; that was a joke. And so, Bob, I just want to start with you just on kind of the monthly trend here. It's always tough to read CLI data and try to translate that given the off one-month how you're fiscal quarter closes. But I look -- it looks as if maybe the forward month slowed a little bit looking at CLI data versus your reported number for the quarter. There has been some question of utilization issues out there. So just -- any color you can give us on kind of the monthly gating [ph] of what you've been seeing in the industry here over the last few months?","Bob Weiss","Good question Jeff, and just kind of jump off the page a little that July must have been soft relatively speaking. There is really primarily but one answer to that and its industry-wide answer with that sort of reason, most people would think. While in the past have we talked about work days in a month but in this case I'll highlight the fact that in July this year there were 19 work days compared to 22 last year because of the way we can sell. That translates to about 17% -- 16% to 17% reduction in revenue if you had the same revenue per day or the orders per day. So pretty profound impact that weighted heavily because of the normally of the way we can sell. Conversely, you get some of that back in August, relative to a full quarter however, probably the best way to look at it is, work days were down 3% this year in the third quarter and they will be up 1.5% in the fourth quarter. So there is one more work day in the fourth quarter, so it's smooth now within the quarter but there is some anomaly between July and August caused by work days.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein from William Blair.","Brian Weinstein","Thanks for taking the question. Can you guys just talk a little bit about what you're seeing obviously from the competitive launch from J&J? And then also you have a couple of launches in the FRP space, so how are you seeing that kind of two week and monthly space playing out at this point and any color you can talk about with respect to just a competitive launch in general? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Yes, the competitive launch -- J&J has been active in taking away since two weeks which was their sweet spot and expanding it into a one day, one week and then a one day and now they are moving with the different package into the monthly modality with Vita. The amount of push they put behind Vita [ph] was nothing compared to a year ago when they launched the OASYS one day modality, so a lot more muted. Having said that they are one of the more active ones in this space, albeit leveraging their OASYS franchise if you will. Interestingly, they still do not call OASYS one day a silicone hydrogel lens but as we all know it is silicone hydrogel lens.","As I think I indicated in the past, it was my belief that there would be some swapping off the two week non-compliant into the monthly compliant which in essence is a clever way to think it's a trade-up strategy and I think we're seeing more and more of that as they are trying to continue the deceleration or the negative growth of the two week space which they own 90% of, and migrate it into more profitable buckets. And there is no doubt profitable bucket means the one day modality but quite frankly the strategy is not short-sited. So to speak when it comes to a monthly price point yields more revenue than a two week non-compliant and most of vast majority of the two week wears are non-compliant.","As far as our product in the non-one day space, we rolled out initially Biofinity and are just -- it's getting, it's very early in the game but so far so good, there is a lot of excitement about novel wins that really addresses people with iPhone's and being in front of TV screens and computer screens, professionally. So there is lot of interest by the eye care professionals that we have engaged in discussion thus far. We also are have got approval to launch Vitality in the two week space and Vitality is targeted to replace our low gross margin Avaira product in the two week space. That low gross margin came about as a number of years ago when we had a recall and had to change the manufacturing technique which became very cumbersome.","So it is a significant step up in gross margin and it's very early in that launch, I think it was late July. And the intent there is, it will probably take two to three years to roll out the entire family of the toric and the sphere worldwide in this migration. The sphere will go faster and the majority of the Avaira product line is the 70% of it or more is the sphere side, so that one will show up quick. But it's an inventory term and when you have toric, it takes longer to transition if you will that. So we're excited about that and then of course we have all the action that's going on in the one day space.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block from Stifel.","Jon Block","Great guys, thanks and good afternoon. Maybe two, I'll ask them both upfront. The CSI margins Greg were down a decent sequential pull back from fiscal 2Q results, not asking for guidance for the next year but sort of the 61% gross margin, the right place to be looking forward when we think about the recent acquisitions weighing on the margin a bit. And then separately for CVI, Bob can you just talk to the EMEA market? I mean you're gaining a lot of share in APAC and you've seen to be well positioned in the U.S. The game seem to be accelerating, can you talk about what you're seeing in the EMEA market regarding share? Thanks guys.","Gregory Matz","Jon, on the gross margin, I think what you should expect to see is -- fixed as one of the low point, you should see it to be a little bit higher than that and again the base business will kick in a little bit. The new acquisitions come with a lower gross margin and so that you did see that pressure, especially in Q3.","Bob Weiss","As far as the EMEA market, we continue to gain shares there and happy to say we're right on the heels of the number one player there which is Alcon in the market. So -- and that happens to be the part of the world where we have the highest market share in EMEA. Our overall market share is 23% but in Europe, it's 33% contrasted to where was weakest share but growing fast in Asia Pac. So the market there remains focused in on the one day modality, Eastern Europe continues to be a robust area. And then the Biofinity continues to charge very nicely there. And then of course the other thing is, U.S. market was the first one to arrive with specialty lenses, torics, and multifocals, and now the rest of the world including EMEA is catching up. So you have a more robust market there which plays to Cooper's strength, recognizing we're number one in the world in the specialty lens area overall.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Mishan from KeyBanc.","Matt Mishan","Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. Bob, could you give us a sense of what is driving the double-digit growth in Asia Pac and with MyDay being a bigger piece over there going into next year, is double-digit growth sustainable for little bit? And then can you talk a little bit about what you see is the opportunity for the MyDay toric in Japan and why you launched there first?","Bob Weiss","Sure. First of all, double-digit in Asia Pac is somewhat of reflection of our immaturity in that market with a fabulous product portfolio. So we have a great product portfolio, lot of it emanated out of EMEA; so it started in Europe, it came to the U.S. and really Asia Pac is the last to get it all. In addition, we were clearly under index overall in that market. We have invested over the last three or four years heavily in some areas like China and the surrounding geographic area. So we're starting to get momentum there. As far as MyDay in Japan, MyDay is a one day product, there are silicone hydrogel players in the Japanese market. TrueEye I started there selling silicone hydrogel market when we started for all fast flow purposes in Japan. The beauty of having a MyDay toric in Japan, first of all, we have Clariti available in the western world, Clariti has a sphere of toric in the multifocal.","In Japan, we only have MyDay at this juncture and having a toric to go along with it, have a halo effect, we will be the only one in the Japanese market with a silicone hydrogel sphere and a toric. While the toric market is not as mature as even the European market, it's certainly in the cycle there. It is a nice halo effect that lot of practioners wanted and particularly more so, some of your independence in Japan, so it's a good story with not only those retailers that exist there but also the independence. So, yes, I do expect that we will put up robust numbers going forward, double-digit numbers certainly in many quarters going forward into Asia Pac marketplace.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien from Piper Jaffray.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Jay [ph] for Matt. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to dig deeper on gross margin, and I know you're not giving guidance for 2017 but you've got a lot going on with -- you've got a weaker British pound which as you said after six months once you work through inventory you'll see a benefit there. And Clariti as it continues to ramp, it should be accretive to differ my gross margin in response to the two week period that has better gross margins as well. So I try to think off, is there any reason why we can't get above 65% next year? And then just a longer term question on gross margin, I mean we needed to be -- the Sauflon acquisition, you kind of gotten the stability of doing silicone hydrogel having the need for alcohol in the manufacturing process, and just trying to think of when you can take that manufacturing ability and start launching your own organic products with that kind of unique process and when we should expect some products like that?","Gregory Matz","I think on the gross margin, you've covered a lot of the points that there are obviously some tailwinds and where Clariti is coming in at far better than we first thought when we launched the company. The pound as we mentioned that especially the pound at these rates as I mentioned in the earlier comments will have a nice impact going forward. At the same time, again we are -- you saw the acquisitions that CooperSurgical is doing and that will have some impact on the overall gross margins because if you get into more lab-based businesses, they're going to come with lower gross margins. And so as you said, we're not giving guidance for next year, you've seen the gross margin start to edge up throughout the entire year, so you can see that where we're looking at being in the fourth quarter is again higher than we were in the third quarter.","Bob Weiss","And I think just on the comment on the Sauflon platform, yes, we're static about the alcohol-free nature of it and the fact that it's so full [ph] that we have to see as the toric and the multifocal to leverage. We're static by the fact that we were able to ramp up very quickly and therefore we're not capacity constraint. So that is clearly a tailwind in a high gross margin area. However, I would agree with Greg's point that with the surgical acquisitions that we have made and with surgical now and around 61 -- going up a little bit from there, there is a mix headwind that comes into play. So directionally you're right, there is tremendous amount of tailwinds to help us out and we'll see where that all lands down the road.","Kim Duncan","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch","Hi, good afternoon. I hope everybody is well and congratulations to Greg and Al. Multi product questions, first, two multi product questions. FX, we all sort of search in a stock price after the Brexit moment and so I'm sort of curious what you're thinking of the FX impact maybe for 2017 without giving guidance but maybe as a contributor so that we also get our heads around with no surprises when you do give guidance. And the second part of that question has to do with -- what was the FX impact on EPS in the third quarter and the current thinking for the full year? And then my second question, it has to do more big picture, we've all been very worried and very focused about J&J's product launches and while Ciba and Bosch have struggled, is there anything that you see coming down to the pike that we need to be aware of as we look forward? Thank you.","Gregory Matz","Joanne, I'll jump in on the FX question real quick. So from a third quarter perspective, if you look at the actuals, we had a $0.06 benefit year-over-year and that was about $0.04 above what we had guided to or what was in our guidance in Q3, I'm sorry Q2. If you look for the full year, we're looking at -- FX is about flat, it's about up $0.02 for the full year year-over-year. When you talk about Brexit, one of things to keep in mind and I mentioned that in the script when it hit, so it hit in late June. So we would start to see the benefit of that really coming in in January. So Q1 will be a little bit of benefit and provided the rate stay where they are at, you'll get that benefit throughout the rest of the year. So it's a nice benefit from a CooperVision perspective about 40% of our COGS are in pound-based manufacturing, and that's 30% roughly because of total company. So you will see that flow through again good part of the next year provided the pound stays at about these rates. That's definitely down quite a bit from prior years and that's -- we win more on -- when that happens from a pound perspective, we win more on the manufacturing than we lose in the revenue but in the short-term like Q4, we actually get impacted by the revenue first and the benefit will come out outside of this fiscal year.","Bob Weiss","As far as some of the product launches of J&J -- when we look at J&J, B&L and Alcon; J&J is the one that already have their act together, the best of the three. And Alcon obviously is still in a remaking mode. B&L is in a remaking mode, changing their structure yet again, I think. And J&J with a fairly weak product portfolio is a good marketing company and so I would complement them on making the best of the product portfolio they have. Some of their programs, the whole disruption they've caused in the marketplace over the last two years with directions going all the way with UPP and then direction going the other way, they've taken some bumps in terms of their messaging. So one day they are saying to you was the friend of the independent with these products and then the next day they are saying, well, we have a different story to tell you but it's going to be UPP. So there is no doubt there is some reaction to that.","As far as Vita for example, their new product launch in the monthly space very much -- it's moving into a space where it's going against some franchise products and Biofinity is a franchise product and Biofinity is the product that has a toric and sphere and a multifocal, plus now it has things like Energys which is an enhanced product where people -- like 99% of the people on the planet are using more and more technology. So I don't expect them to get too robust about that. I do think that's a lot different than what they did a year ago with OASYS one day where they basically said, we want to participate into shift so [indiscernible] whereas leaving the two week space and catch some in the one day market with a huge trade-off.","So they are playing out that strategy, to a large degree they cannibalize TrueEye in the U.S., not worldwide but in the U.S. and OASYS one day and TrueEye and MyDay are giving a competition in this case Alcon's Total 1 run for their money. Now Alcon got out there first when there was only one competitor in that space which is TrueEye. J&J knew that was a deficient product in the U.S. and I'm not sure why in the U.S. when it actually has done pretty well historically in Japan but for whatever reason, the U.S. it's a week two product.","So product roll outs, we hear a lot of noise about B&L on ULTRA which is their answer to trying to refresh the product line for monthly products, monthly silicone hydrogel products. They've gone and expanded now I think from beyond sphere but a lot of what B&L is doing is capturing some of their legacy products, Purevision and SofLens 66. So when you put it all together, B&L has some new products, ULTRA but it's about holding breakeven with the entire product portfolio including the fall-off of their legacy products.","So worldwide I think the last quarter there probably 1% to 2% growth. So they would have lost some margins here last quarter. Alcon likewise, came up with 2% numbers in a market growing 5%, so they lost share. So the gainers were Cooper and with the robust 10% in J&J.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Good afternoon guys, thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations Greg and Al. Just -- for my multi product question here. Bob, is it safe to assume that August bounce back from what sounds like a weak July because of the day count? Second, on 2017, you guys have historically given some color, even last year you did on EPS, is it safe to assume that you're pretty comfortable with concerned to this top and bottom line at this point roughly speaking, otherwise you would -- if there were something out of whack, you would call it out. And lastly, the inventory write-off and the ideal equipment charges we saw in fiscal Q2 which resulted in $0.30 hit, should we -- are those over or do you expect more of those either in the fourth quarter of 2017? Thanks for taking the questions.","Bob Weiss","All right. First question on August and July, yes, it's safe to assume that the anomalies between the weak July and August have to do with workdays, not anything engrained in the marketplace. Relatively to 2017 where we indicated we're not prepared at this juncture to put specifics on the line. No, we wouldn't comment one way or the other on what consensus is out there. I would highlight however that some of the analyst have more aggressive foreign exchange rates and some analyst's maybe -- I think Greg kind of hit the nail on the head. Some of the models on the impact of the pound etcetera, emphasizing that it's on 30% of our worldwide instead of 40% of our worldwide cost of goods, it is an important attribute. So hopefully, we gave some color for people to sharpen the pencil with their models in some case. So beyond saying there is a lot of tailwinds that we're standing by and happy with, and the foreign exchange rates will be whatever they are and they change literally by the hour. We're not going to add anymore color at this juncture.","As far as the 10-10-10 hit, $0.10 in the second quarter, $0.10 in the third quarter and $0.10 in the fourth quarter due to idle equipment and inventory write-offs that were over and above normal, they are in the numbers. There are other write-offs that are routine and they continue throughout 2016 and will continue throughout 2017. Directionally, we indicated that a lot of those call out charges are associated with some of our improving efficiency a lot more than we thought. So that let us to idling some equipment. So directionally you can see the growth numbers in our 1-day silicone hydrogel franchise of 40%; that certainly will go towards improving absorption. And importantly, when something goes from idle to used in productions, it goes from a direct period charge which is what the 10-10-10 is about to certainly it moves on to the balance sheet when it's making the inventory. So that will continue throughout 2017 if you will.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch from Raymond James.","Lawrence Keusch","Good afternoon, and also congrats to Greg and to Al. I guess, again, two part financial question here. On the CapEx, I mean if you go back and look, it -- it tends to be cyclical, then you do get into periods where there is investment as you guys bring out the lines and expand capacity. There are also periods of time where you grow into that capacity and in this case you've got some of these ideal equipment sitting around now that will add to that. So I just wanted to get your take on where you think CapEx can go here over the next several years. I think you said 170-ish million is for this year but where does it go and how does that translate to free cash flow generation? And I guess along with that should we expect no additional Sauflon integration charges next year? And then the other part of the question is, I think certainly the odds of an interest rate increase have gone up and we could see something coming in this month and how are you thinking about that and what's built into guidance? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Well, few things on that. The cyclicality of the CapEx spend, you're absolutely right, we ramped up Biofinity and Avaira in the last decade. We're very capital intense. We got real efficient, we ramped down and then all of a sudden, particularly with the Sauflon acquisition and with MyDay rollout of silicone hydrogel 1-day, we became very capital intense again over the last several years. And along the hold [ph], we got real efficient and so we are again a little ahead of ourselves in the perfect world. Translation there is, we think we have a pretty long runway on improving efficiencies that will continue over the next several multiple years and that will be somewhat of a cap on CapEx requirements. Look for we've taken the CapEx needs this year from $200 million, down $30 million to $170 million, the outlook for post-2016 will be for less than that. We're thinking in that $150 million range, so year-over-year a reduction of in that $50 million range. When you look at cash flow, we've now taken our -- should get the $300 million to a lot stronger statement about $300 million. So where $300 million headed towards $400 million, no real change in that signal on that going forward. There is, in my opinion, multiple years of runway on some of those efficiencies that we're talking about.","As far as Sauflon interest charges, the -- what's built into our thinking is given that we forward cash flow generation, we see that as part of a minimizer. So when you're -- you have $1.4 billion in that worldwide, you're generating $300 million to $400 million in cash flow that will serve to offset. We do expect that probably between now and year end there will be some movement in rates and of course we've only guided through year end. So at this juncture we haven't really guided if treasury goes crazy, then that will obviously influence the guidance we've come out within -- in December. But I think between foreign exchange volatility and interest rates, depending on whose got their mouth open on a given moment, out there it seems like the government is very more proactive and trying to direct economic thinking which is a detriment I think, overall, because it does create uncertainty involved in volatility. But we're still on a low inflationary modality, we can all speculate and pretend we're economist, so stay tuned and we'll refresh -- what our thinking is in December.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby","Hi, good evening. And congrats Greg and congrats Al. Just first on this year's guidance, Greg, if I heard you correctly, it sounds like FX was an incremental $0.04 positive for you here in the third quarter but an incremental $0.02 headwind versus what you're expecting for the fourth quarter. So I'm just trying to correlate that to your -- the guidance, the full year guidance you've given where you brought down the high end just a little bit. If it looks like net-net, FX is about incremental $0.02 positive to your previous guidance.","Gregory Matz","Yes. Last time that we gave guidance, we talked it being about a wash and it's net-net, you're right, it's a $0.02 positive for '16 at this point year-over-year.","Steve Willoughby","And so what's the driver to the reduction I guess at the full year guidance then?","Gregory Matz","The reduction to the full year guidance?","Steve Willoughby","Correct. Yes, I mean you said -- sorry, go ahead Bob.","Bob Weiss","Yes, let's just say I'm not sure overall against our guidance we raised a midpoint [ph] in our guidance.","Gregory Matz","Yes, we actually raised midpoint by $0.04, it was the FX that we experienced in the two was related to probably an operational increase.","Steve Willoughby","Okay, thanks very much.","Bob Weiss","So we took it up in our account.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew [ph] from JP Morgan.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for taking our question and congrats Greg and Al. I wanted to go back to the fewer and extra selling days in the third quarter and excited in the fourth quarter. And what was the impact on growth in the third quarter and what are -- for the fourth quarter?","Bob Weiss","If you took work days in the quarter, it would be a 3% headwind in Q3 and 1.5% tailwind in Q4, all other things being [ph].","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer.","Steven Lichtman","Thank you. Hi guys, two questions. Bob, within your 1-day silicone hydrogel franchise, in the recent period here last few months, has the incremental contribution from MyDay and Clariti, pretty balanced or has one been contributing more incrementally over the past few months? And where do you see now that the mix going between those two products overtime? And then Greg, that's actually popping up here in the fourth quarter. The reason why are we going to see that move higher -- any changing your thoughts on tax rate beyond '16? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","So on the mix of MyDay and Clariti, there -- obviously MyDay is with smaller base, so it's percentages are higher and Clariti, which has a big European franchise has a bigger hurdle. Clariti is still the one that is targeting the mass market and therefore we'll always be most likely the bigger product. It's the one with the toric and the multifocal which also will make it the bigger product. So it's still about -- I don't know, 70-30-ish. However, with MyDay off of a lower base and going into Japan you may see it as that rollout occurs, take over somewhat bigger portion of the pie, given Japan is such a huge 1-day market. I guess Greg on the tax rate?","Gregory Matz","Yes, on the tax rate; since the March guidance we have been guiding to the 8% for the year, around 8%; and so we're still holding to that. And when you look at it, things have been choppy and it also depends a lot of times when discrete relates this year, we had discrete related in Q1 where normally it's Q3. Typically Q4 is a higher quarter, last year was an exception to that and that was based on a lot of work around the integration and restructuring cost which were allowed deductions. So the Q4 rate being in the 10.5% to 11% is probably more typical outside just the last year or so.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Bob Weiss for any closing remarks.","Bob Weiss","Well, I want to once again thank Greg for six great years and wish him the best going forward. He will be around as we indicated throughout the transition period, throughout the rest of this calendar year. And we look forward to updating you on our year end results in December and I think the date there is December 8 if I'm not mistaken; and a lot of good stuff going on, so we look forward to giving you an update on that. Everyone have a great Labor Day weekend and summer has come and summer has gone already and life goes on. With that, we'll conclude.","Operator","Thank you.

Please proceed.","Kim Duncan","Good afternoon, and welcome to The Cooper Companies\u2019 fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings conference call. I\u2019m Kim Duncan, vice president of investor relations, and joining me on today\u2019s call are Bob Weiss, chief executive officer; Greg Matz, chief financial officer; and Al White, chief strategy officer.","Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that this conference call contains forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including all revenue and earnings per share guidance and other statements regarding anticipated results of operations, market or regulatory conditions, and integration of any acquisitions or their failure to achieve anticipated benefits.

Bob will begin by providing highlights on the quarter, followed by Greg, who will then discuss the fourth quarter and full year financial results. We will keep the formal presentation to roughly 30 minutes then open up the call for questions. ","We expect the call to last approximately one hour.

As a reminder, this call is being webcast and a copy of the earnings release and historical Sauflon financial information, including quarterly detail, are available through the Investor Relations section of The Cooper Companies\u2019 website.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bob for his opening remarks.","Robert Weiss","Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2014 conference call. Let me start by saying I\u2019m very proud of our accomplishments this year, highlighted by revenue growth of 8% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 14%.","Fiscal Q4 was a very busy quarter, and we\u2019ve entered into fiscal 2015 with strong momentum. I\u2019m pleased to say we remain confident we\u2019ll be taking market share and driving strong earnings growth in 2015 and well beyond.","Before getting into the details, let me start by providing three key highlights to take away from this call. First, CooperVision posted 9% year over year pro forma revenue growth in the fourth quarter and when I refer to pro forma, I mean adjusting for currency, Sauflon, and [I me]. CooperVision also took market share in every region of the world, including the Americas.","Second, we delivered $108 million of free cash flow this quarter, and we believe our free cash flow in the coming years will be stronger than we envisioned prior to the Sauflon acquisition. This is due to advantages we gained from Sauflon, which will lower future capex.","Third, our fiscal 2015 guidance has been reduced but solely due to currency. If we exclude currency, we actually increased earnings per share $0.10 to reflect greater synergies from Sauflon. Our internal forecast for our outer years has also improved due to Sauflon, and we feel more comfortable with our 26%-plus operating margin target in 2018, even hurdling the significant impact of currency this year.","Having said that, we can\u2019t ignore the significant negative impact of currency to our current and future results. I\u2019ll discuss foreign exchange and the three takeaways in more detail during the conference call. ","Moving to the fourth quarter highlights, on a consolidated basis, the fourth quarter revenues grew 14% year over year to $468 million. We posted non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.95 and recorded free cash flow of $108 million.","CooperVision revenue grew 18% year over year or 9% pro forma. CooperSurgical was down 3%. Although CooperSurgical was down, as we discussed last quarter, we are reducing our focus on low margin capital equipment sales within fertility, so results didn\u2019t meet our expectations.","CooperVision revenue and consolidated earnings per share were lower than expected and this was primarily the result of three items. First, currency negatively impacted revenues by an incremental $3 million from the time we last gave guidance on September 4th\u2019s earnings call.","Second, we experienced some temporary softness with Sauflon in the U.S. as a result of back order and logistical problems due to high demand and an inefficient distribution network. This was a double-edge sword as demand was, and is, very strong, but it created a situation where customer service wasn\u2019t up to our standards. ","We made a decision to address this by focusing on existing accounts rather than aggressively calling on new accounts. Ultimately, this meant reducing the rollout of Clariti in the short term. Meanwhile, we began working quickly to move distribution to our state-of-the-art U.S. distribution center. ","We still have some work to do, but we\u2019re in excellent shape as we enter the new fiscal year and our plan is to begin a robust rollout beginning in January. It\u2019s a little bit of a guess as to how much this impacted fourth quarter revenues, but it was likely around $4 million. ","Thirdly, inventory reductions impacted the U.S. distribution channel. I\u2019ve mentioned this before, and I hate to sound like a broken record, but it happened again. We have several distributors in the U.S. and our days on hand at these distributors are now at the lowest they\u2019ve ever been. ","I believe this is attributable to the progress we are making on improving our own distribution process, which has given outside distributors more confidence in receiving shipments from us, along with the possibility of some competitors seeing inventory growth in the distribution channel.","To provide comfort, our [new fit] data remains strong, indicating that we\u2019re taking share, and we contractual obligations with our distributors to maintain certain inventory days on hand levels. Based on this, I feel confident that this is the last time I\u2019ll be raising this issue.","This item impacted us around $6 million for the quarter. The three items combined to reduce our fourth quarter revenue by roughly $13 million or roughly$0.13 of earnings per share. In spite of this, I\u2019m pleased with our performance as 9% pro forma revenue growth in the quarter was very respectable.","Now let me get into some additional detail on Sauflon. I believe everyone is aware that the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, or CMA, decided to evaluate the acquisition, giving formal notice on September 19th. ","This was unexpected and resulted in CooperVision temporarily halting all direct and indirect integration activity, which could impact the U.K. This cause around two and a half months\u2019 delay, but I am extremely pleased to say the CMA approved the transaction today, and we\u2019re back to integrating the businesses. ","As a result of the CMA order, non-GAAP operating margins at Sauflon came in lower than we had expected in Q4 at 13%. Included in the 13% was a large number of overlapping operational costs, which will be rationalized over the next year. ","As an example, in the fourth quarter Sauflon had $5 million of general and administrative expenses. Without the CMA order, we would have likely reduce the number in half, saving around $2.5 million. Ultimately removing the $5 million in G&A will increase the operating margin to 23%, which is clearly heading in the right direction.","And that\u2019s just G&A. There are other overlapping operational items, which we\u2019ll be addressing quickly as we proceed with integration. In general, the most important takeaway is that we now believe we\u2019ll see more synergies than when we initially acquired Sauflon. ","When we look at Sauflon by region, in the U.S. Sauflon was building significant infrastructure prior to the acquisition. Almost all of it duplicated our operations, and thus offered relatively quick synergies. ","I\u2019m happy to say we\u2019ve consolidated the majority of their U.S. business into ours. We still have some things to finish, such as the distribution network I discussed earlier, but we\u2019re in great shape and poised to aggressively market Clariti in the U.S. as we enter January. ","Sauflon\u2019s remaining business, which is mostly in Europe, was impacted by the CMA order, but it didn\u2019t stop us from completing integration planning or posting solid operating results. We saw a lot of strength in Europe, especially with Claritis daily and we\u2019re looking forward to integrating Sauflon and making them fully part of CooperVision.","Finally, on Sauflon, I want to highlight product demand and manufacturing operations as two drivers that make me very optimistic about the future. Demand for Clariti is extremely strong and we see this in many parts of the world. With the decision I discussed earlier to address the U.S. distribution network, we\u2019ve been able to rebuild inventory, and we are in a great position to aggressively market Clariti in the U.S. beginning in January. ","Also, we grow more and more excited with what we see from Sauflon on the manufacturing and formulation standpoint. They\u2019ve been doing a great job ramping up production and everything is going to plan or ahead of plan. ","Remember, their manufacturing lines cost one third the price of ours. They receive these lines in half the time it takes us, and their lines have better flexibility around shifting production from one product to another. ","A large reason for this is their material formulation, which provides them with the ability to produce siliconized shell lenses without [unintelligible]. This is a major step forward and as we integrate this manufacturing and formulation expertise, it will allow us to add manufacturing lines in a much more efficient manner.","This will reduce capital expenditures beginning in late 2015 and afterwards. This will also lower our cost per unit and we anticipate seeing the benefits in the P&L beginning in mid-2016. These investments have already allowed us to evaluate certain product upgrade opportunities, and we acted on Avaira Toric. ","As you may remember, we had a recall with the Avaira family back in 2011, which resulted in changing our manufacturing process. This was done successfully, but resulted in a higher cost of production, especially for the toric. The acquisition of Sauflon and the advancements made in silicon manufacturing will now allow us to implement improvements with Avaira Toric. Upon finalizing this decision, we took certain charges in the fourth quarter, and these charges are part of our non-GAAP adjustment.","For competitive reasons, I don\u2019t want to get into too much detail on the changes being made. The decisions will not impact the availability of Avaira Toric, and they will have no impact on Avaira Sphere. We\u2019re currently running gross margins on Avaira Toric at less than 50%, and I believe the changes will significantly improve gross margins by late 2016.","To conclude on integration activity, you should expect to see integration related activity throughout fiscal 2015, but tapering off significantly as we end the fiscal year. This will include normal integration work such as organizational decisions, along with some product rationalization work.","Now, back to CooperVision, our performance for the quarter. On the sales side, we had consolidated revenues of $385 million, up 18% year over year and up 9% pro forma. Included in this is Sauflon\u2019s business, which had revenues of $50 million, up 50% above the prior year, and this was in spite of the back order and logistics issues in the U.S., which I discussed earlier. Excuse me, the 50% was up 20% over the prior year.","I don\u2019t want to get to granular on Sauflon, but demand for daily silicons was very strong. Solutions and some noncore products were weaker. This was expected. Overall, for CooperVision, our silicon hydrogel family continues to drive our top line, with $198 million in revenues. ","Our silicon hydrogel family is very deep, with our monthly Biofinity family leading the way, posting 13% constant currency growth in the fourth quarter. Our two-week family of products, Aviara, also grew very nicely, up 31% in constant currency. ","It\u2019s important to note we\u2019re still underindexed against the market in the two-week and monthly silicon space. Silicons represent approximately 76% of the two-week and monthly space, and we\u2019re at 67%, so we should continue growing nicely in this part of the market for several years. ","Regarding silicon dailies, MyDay had a solid quarter, up 79% in constant currency. We had several strong production months for MyDay in the back half of fiscal 2014. Average gross margins grew slightly above expectations at 11%. Going forward, our expectation is to continue seeing margin improvements as we bring on additional lines and position the lens as a premium offering.","We plan to launch MyDay in the U.S. in March to key opinion leaders and then roll it out more aggressively in the back half of the year. We continue to believe there is a great opportunity to split the market with a premium daily silicon hydrogel lens and a mass market lens. We also be we have the premier portfolio to become the market leader in the coming years. ","As a reminder, with the Sauflon acquisition, we are the only company offering a full daily silicon hydrogel product portfolio, including a premium and a mass market offering, of which the mass market portfolio includes a sphere, toric, and multifocal. ","The toric business remains strong, growing 13%, and torics now represent 29% of CooperVision\u2019s revenue. Multifocals grew 26% and now represent 10% of CooperVision\u2019s revenue. We continue to lead the global market in these specialized categories and we\u2019re taking market share.","Regarding Proclear, sales were up 5% in constant currency for the quarter, and represent 22% of CooperVision\u2019s revenues. This was a pretty solid quarter for Proclear and shows there\u2019s still some growth in the non-silicon hydrogel space.","Regionally, we were also very strong this quarter, growing solid throughout the world. Before I get into the CooperSurgical, let me comment on the overall contact lens market for calendar Q3 and remember, this data is listed on the last page of our earnings release. ","We are presenting this data without including Sauflon as we closed the acquisition in the middle of the third calendar quarter. Obviously, if we did include their results, our performance would look even better. ","Also, when I discuss market results, I\u2019m doing so off of manufacturer sales, which are the best metric to determine market share. The market was softer in calendar Q3, growing 2% while CooperVision grew 8% and again, this is without Sauflon.","Regionally, the Americas grew 2%, with CooperVision posting growth of 7%. In EMEA, or Europe, the market grew 4% and we grew 7%, while in Asia Pacific, the market grew 2%, and we grew 11%.","I couldn\u2019t be happier to say we grew faster in the market in every region in the world. Also, if we look at the market on a modality basis, the single use market continued to drive growth up 6% while we grew 12%. Non single use lenses were flat for the market, and we were up 6%.","At a high level, I don\u2019t believe this quarter reflects where the market is really growing. If we look at a trailing 12 months, the market grew 5%, we grew 9%. I believe this is a better representation of the market growth and our share gains. We have a fairly healthy market and I believe we\u2019ll continue seeing a stake share, especially with the addition of the Clariti portfolio.","Moving to CooperSurgical, the business declined 3% on an as reported basis, or 1% in constant currency. Fertility was down 5% or 1% in constant currency, while the office surgical procedures business was down 1%.","As we discussed on our last earnings call, we continue to work to find the optimal model of sales growth and margin improvement. With respect to our fertility business, this may result in lower revenue growth until we annualize the removal of certain low margin capital equipment sales. We expect this to begin in fiscal Q3 of 2015, so Q1 and Q2 revenues will likely be lower with acceleration in Q3 and Q4.","Meanwhile, our office and surgical procedures business continues to deal with the pains of lower OB\/GYN office visits in the United States. On the plus side, our CooperSurgical team is very focused on driving operational improvements and their standalone non-GAAP operating margin increased from 25% to 28% for the quarter. This was driven by an increase in our non-GAAP gross margins from 64% to 65% and strong expense control.","Now let me touch a little on guidance and on ongoing strategy. In September, we provided some early guidance for fiscal 2015 and today we\u2019ve updated it to reflect currency and operational improvements. Currency had a significant negative impact and Greg is going to walk through these details.","Excluding the adjustments for currency, our revenue remained the same and our non-GAAP earnings per share increased by $0.10 on the bottom and top of the range. This increase is driven by [unintelligible] will be seeing some synergies in the Sauflon acquisition, more synergies in the Sauflon acquisition, than we initially guided to.","For CooperVision, we\u2019re forecasting pro forma revenue growth of 8% to 11%, which is higher than the 7% to 10% we guided in September, but it reflects the belief that we have a strong fourth quarter 2015 due to easier comps as a result of the events I discussed earlier, which negatively impacted this year\u2019s fourth quarter.","I feel confident this should be a strong year with the back half leading the way as we really start rolling out Clariti and MyDay in the United States. For CooperSurgical, we\u2019re starting to see a little sunshine on the horizon, and we\u2019re forecasting 3% to 7% constant currency revenue growth.","This should result in non-GAAP earnings per share of $7.30 to $7.70. This earnings per share range is up 16% to 22% from fiscal 2014 on a constant currency basis. Regarding free cash flow and capex, we believe both to be slightly over $2 million. Having said that, I believe we\u2019ll start seeing a reduction in capex in fiscal 2016, while operating cash flow continues to grow, so I anticipate a very strong 2016 free cash flow number.","Now a few comments about strategy. We\u2019ll continue with our successful strategy, which I\u2019ve frequently articulated in the past. We believe it is solid and has delivered results. This includes investing in our businesses to continue taking market share, including direct investments such as the new manufacturing facility in Costa Rica, where we anticipate production beginning in late 2015, our investments in emerging markets such as China, and our strategic acquisitions such as Sauflon.","We\u2019re also keenly focused on improving our non-GAAP operating margins, which we see being 26% plus in fiscal 2016. And finally, we\u2019ll buy back shares if it makes sense as we did in the fourth quarter, repurchasing roughly 176,000 shares at an average price of approximately $147.","In summary, before I turn it over to Greg, let me say how happy I am with our businesses. We\u2019re making a ton of progress integrating Sauflon and our family of products is extremely strong. Our profit margins are solid and our free cash flow generation is strong, and we believe it will get a lot stronger in the coming years.","We remain keenly focused on delivering improving results, mindful of our desire to invest and leverage prudently, thereby delivering optimized long term total shareholder value. With that, I\u2019ll remind you that our employees are our number one asset, and to them, I express my appreciation for their dedication to creating value and delivering results.","And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg to cover financial results. ","Greg Matz","Thanks, Bob, and I\u2019m battling a little bit of laryngitis, so I apologize for my voice. Good afternoon everyone. Bob shared with you a pretty thorough review of the market and our revenue picture. As a reminder, we\u2019ve excluded amortization from the non-GAAP numbers, and any non-GAAP comparisons year over year will reflect this.","Let me start with gross margins. Looking at gross margins, in Q4 the consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 59.7% and 63.2% respectively, compared with 64.1% for GAAP and non-GAAP in the prior year. The main difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is related to inventory and equipment rationalization due to the Sauflon acquisition.","When comparing non-GAAP gross margins this quarter to the prior year, we saw an approximate negative 160 basis point impact with FX due to the combined impact of FX on revenue as well as pound-based inventory flushing through the system.","In addition, the acquisition of Sauflon had an approximate 100 basis point negative impact. These headwinds were partially offset with product mix, led by Biofinity. Full year non-GAAP gross margin finished at 64.5%, just under the 64.7% in 2013.","CooperVision, on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis report gross margin of 58.7% and 62.8% respectively versus 64% for GAAP and non-GAAP in Q4 last year. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is related to the Sauflon acquisition.","The drop in non-GAAP gross margin, as I mentioned earlier, was due to FX, Sauflon, which had a gross margin just above 54%, partially offset by product mix, led by Biofinity. CooperVision\u2019s full year non-GAAP gross margin was 64.5% versus 64.8% for 2013.","CooperSurgical had a GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin of 64.4% and 64.9% respectively, which compares to Q4 2013 of 64.3%. In the past, we\u2019ve not really talked about FX impact on CSI, because currencies had a relatively minor impact, but we did have a negative 40 basis point FX impact to gross margin this quarter due to the significant moves in the currency. ","The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP relates to approximately $436,000 of severance costs. For the full year, CooperSurgical\u2019s non-GAAP gross margin was 64.6% versus 64.2% in 2013. ","Now looking at operating expenses, on a GAAP basis, SG&A expenses increased by approximately 32% from Q4 last year to $208 million and were 44% of revenue versus 38% in the prior year.","On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A increased approximately 8% to $169.2 million. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is about $39 million due largely to acquisition restructuring costs related to the Sauflon acquisition, which is included in our GAAP numbers.","SG&A on a non-GAAP basis increased 8% sequentially and actually declined about 5%, excluding Sauflon. You can see the strong expense control management happening in both businesses.","Now, looking at R&D, in Q4, R&D increased by approximately 15% year over year to $18.2 million or up $2.4 million, of which $1.7 million was related to Sauflon. R&D was 3.9% of revenue, up from 3.8% in Q4 2013 and 3.7% sequentially.","In Q4, depreciation was $28.6 million, up $4.5 million or 19% year over year. Amortization was $14 million, up approximately $6.3 million or 82% year over year, for a total of $42.6 million. On a GAAP basis, we expect approximately $7 million of amortization per quarter for the Sauflon acquisition. For the year, depreciation was $102.5 million.","Moving to operating margins, for Q4, consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $39.4 million and 8.4% of revenue versus $62 million and 15.1% of revenue for GAAP in Q4 last year. ","Primarily due to the Sauflon acquisition and the related integration, inventory and equipment rationalization, and restructuring charges, which we\u2019ve already mentioned, we believe it makes sense to focus on non-GAAP. Our non-GAAP operating income and margin were $108.9 million and 23.3% of revenue versus $90.8 million and 22% of revenue for the past year. This represents a 20% increase in operating income over the prior year non-GAAP numbers.","On a non-GAAP basis for the full year, operating income and margin were $403.9 million and 23.5% of revenue, up approximately 13% in operating income and 100 basis points on the margin. ","In Q4, CooperVision had GAAP operating income and margin of $33.8 million and 8.8% of revenue versus the prior year Q4 of $54.9 million and 16.8% of revenue for GAAP. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income and margin were $98 million and 25.4% of revenue versus $80.2 million and 24.5% of revenue in Q4 2013.","On a non-GAAP basis for the full year, operating income and margin were $370.3 million and 26.6% of revenue, up approximately 13% in operating income and 80 basis points on the margin.","CSI had GAAP operating income and margin of $18.4 million and 22.2% of revenue versus the prior year Q4 of $17.8 million and 21% of revenue for GAAP. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $22.9 million and 27.8% of revenue versus Q4 2013 of $21.2 million operating income and 25.1% of revenue.","The main difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is related to approximately $1.3 million of acquisition and severance costs as well as the $3.3 million worth of amortization. On a non-GAAP basis for the full year, operating income and margin were $84.2 million and 25.9% of revenue, up approximately 12.5% in operating income and 250 basis points on the margin.","Interest expense was $3.3 million for the quarter, up 71% year over year, primarily due to the acquisition of Sauflon. Interest expense was $8 million for the year.","In looking at the effective tax rate, in Q4 the GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate was 10.4% and 8.7% respectively versus Q4 2013 GAAP effective tax rate of 6.2% and non-GAAP effective tax rate of 11.4%. Again, as we\u2019ve mentioned before, the effective tax rate continues to be below the U.S. statutory rate as the majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates.","The full year GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were 8.3% and 9.1% respectively. In thinking about Sauflon, we have been a little delayed due to the CMA, but we are finalizing our tax planning, and we expect Sauflon to be absorbed into our global trade arrangement sometime in the first calendar quarter.","Our Q4 earnings per share on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis was $0.63 and $1.95 respectively versus $1.15 and [$1.16] on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis in Q4 2013. GAAP EPS includes the impact of acquisition and restructuring related charges of approximately $56.6 million and includes amortization expense of $14 million. ","For the full year, our EPS on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis was $5.51 and $7.29 respectively. Non-GAAP EPS was up approximately 14% for the year. ","We\u2019ll mention, during Q4 we repurchased approximately 176,000 shares with an average share value of around $147 per share, for a total cost of $25.8 million. This leaves approximately $186 million available for future share repurchases under the current approved plan.","Regarding foreign exchange, we\u2019re using rates as of December 3 or last night. For our main currencies, we\u2019re using 1.23 for the euro, 120 for the yen, 1.57 for the pound. The net impact year over year for Q4 was an unfavorable impact of $0.22, which is $0.05 more than we guided to on our last earnings call. ","This earnings per share deterioration is primarily related to the yen and the euro, but also a significant number of other currencies, which also weakened against the dollar. This brings the negative FX impact to $0.36 on EPS in fiscal 2014.","If we look at currency from the date of our last earnings call, when we first provided fiscal 2015 guidance, currency rates have moved significantly against us, down over 8% on a weighted average basis. The yen led the way, down 14% and the euro down over 6%. This has had a significantly negative impact on our revenues and EPS. From an incremental standpoint from our September guidance, revenues have been reduced $100 million and EPS $1.","Note the revenue calculation is based on roughly 60% of our revenues being outside the U.S. The EPS impact is calculated off of the revenue impact, offset by offshore costs including manufacturing and operating expenses.","If we look at currency from a year over year perspective, we expect FX to negatively impact our fiscal 2015 earnings per share by $1.19. This is a very significant impact, and is driven by an overall decline in currencies of 10% on a weighted average year over year basis. This is primarily the result of the weakening of the yen, which has moved against us by 16% year over year and the euro, which has moved against us by 10% year over year. ","One of the most frustrating things about currency has been the locations of the moves. When we look at a location like Japan, where we have relatively low operating expenses, roughly 72% of the currency move falls through to OI, or operating income. In Europe, it\u2019s slightly better, it\u2019s 60%, as we have more infrastructure. ","We do have a natural offset from the pound given our U.K. manufacturing, but unfortunately it only moved 5%, and there\u2019s a lag roughly five months, which has delayed the upside on cost of goods sold into the back half of fiscal 2015. Additionally, due to a high pound five months ago, it\u2019s actually negatively impacting cost of goods at the start of this fiscal year. ","Rolling all this together, as you can tell, we\u2019re expecting the impact of EPS to be equivalent to roughly $0.12 for each 1% move in currency. That\u2019s definitely at the high end of how much currency could impact us, but unfortunately, this is almost a perfect storm, with very strong moves in currencies where we have little offset and a relatively small move in the pound.","In general, as a rule of thumb, if you assume 1% move in all currencies, the impact will be between $0.08 and $0.12. The $0.12 comes from the situation we\u2019re in, and the $0.08 would occur if the moves were more heavily weighted in currencies such as the pound and the euro. And remember, our revenues outside the U.S. have increased significantly over the past several years, with the acquisitions of Sauflon and Origio, combined with strong growth in our core businesses.","Regarding timing on fiscal 2015, I don\u2019t want to get too granular, as there are a number of variables which influence the impact of currency on EPS, such as future sales, but assuming rates stay the same, the FX impact will clearly be greatest in Q1 and relatively high in Q2. It will then start to taper off in Q3 as lower pound inventory starts to have a positive impact. Q4 will have the lowest impact.","Moving away from FX and to balance sheet and liquidity, in Q4 we had cash provided by operations of $152.1 million, capital expenditures of $60.1 million, and excluding acquisition related costs of $16 million, resulting in $108 million of free cash flow. Free cash flow for the year was $236 million versus $239 million in 2013. ","Total debt increased within the quarter by $1.034 billion to $1.382 billion. Inventories increased approximately $28 million to $381.5 million from the last quarter. This increase is largely due to adding Sauflon, offset by some inventory rationalization due to the acquisition.","For the quarter, we are seeing month on hand at 6.1 months on a GAAP basis and 6.6 months on hand, excluding inventory rationalization, down from month on hand of 6.9 months last year and down from 7 months on hand last quarter.","Days sales outstanding is at 53 days, consistent with the prior quarter and last year.","Now, turning to guidance, in order to provide a little more color for your models, let me share some additional specifics on our non-GAAP guidance. But before getting into the details, remember the significant impact of currency I discussed earlier. Not only has currency impacted revenues and EPS, but it\u2019s obviously also affected the rest of the P&L, including margin percentages. ","The revenue range for the company is $1.9 billion to $1.96 billion. CVI\u2019s revenue range is $1.575 billion to $1.62 billion. CSI\u2019s revenue range is $325 million to $340 million. And we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be around 63% for the year. The margin should be lower in the first half of the year due to higher pound-based inventory rolling through the P&L, and then should improve in Q3 and more in Q4.","Opex is expected to be around 40%. Operating margin is expected to be around 23%. interest expense is expected to be around $18 million. Our effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 9% to 11%, and this includes the transfer of Sauflon\u2019s IP. Our non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.30 to $7.70 off of a $50 million share count.","Finally, we expect both capital expenditures and free cash flow for the year to be north of $200 million. ","From a timing perspective, as you can tell from my previous comments on currency, we expect a challenging beginning to the fiscal year. At this point, I believe our Q1 and Q2 non-GAAP EPS in fiscal 2015 will likely be below Q1 and Q2 2014 with Q1 being a bigger challenge. However, I want to stress that we\u2019re making a lot of progress operationally and things are moving ahead well, and in many cases better than we had laid out in our prior discussions.","If it wasn\u2019t for the currency, we\u2019d be guiding to extremely strong as-reported numbers, but currency hides the fact. We\u2019re guiding to a midpoint of 9% pro forma constant currency growth for the year, including an 8% to 11% pro forma constant currency range in CooperVision and a very strong non-GAAP EPS growth of 16% to 22% in constant currency.","With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session. ","Kim Duncan","Operator, we\u2019re ready to take some questions. Thanks. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Mr. Matthew O\u2019Brien of William Blair. ","Matthew O\u2019Brien","I was hoping we could start with the currency commentary, Greg, not to make you speak any more than you need to tonight, with your voice. But I just want to make sure that we flesh this out a little bit. ","As you mentioned, and just using some simple math, I think what you\u2019re saying is that the 60% of revenue being OUS, your Japanese related revenue specifically, I guess $250 million-ish roughly, and so that\u2019s coming down by about 14%, and then the other piece of the business or about $1 billion of sales, is coming down about 6%-ish related to currency. So that, together, gets you to around $100 million of the revenue reduction? Is that the right way of thinking about it? ","Greg Matz","Yeah, Matt, I think that\u2019s the right process, and that does get you close to it. One of the things I mentioned too is it really does impact where the currency is declining. We\u2019ve given percentages in the past, we said a 1% decline. If you look at how currency has reacted over the last couple of months, it hasn\u2019t been a 1% decline, and it hasn\u2019t been even across all currencies.","And so you\u2019ve seen, as an example, the yen, taking a bigger hit, and that has a bigger hit than average than if it was a euro decline. So you even saw the Russian ruble down 53%. I mean, you\u2019ve got currencies that are really in a freefall against the dollar.","Matthew O\u2019Brien ","And then if I may, with a quick follow up, on the market, I know you\u2019re optimistic going forward, but last couple of quarters, it\u2019s been fairly soft. With the UPP coming in and some potential for some pricing pressures from your bigger competitors, what gives you the confidence that the market\u2019s going to remain healthy and grow 5% plus-ish, and then how do you think about your pro forma CVI growth if the market continues to be somewhat weak? ","Robert Weiss","I think looking at the last 12 months, as I said, one quarter does not a trend make. The 2% was certainly soft. We had a very robust first quarter last year when you put it all together, trailing 12 months 5%, I think is pretty indicative. Keep in mind, the drivers, a lot of them are still in place, a continuation of the one-day modality in the U.S. being very robust. So I do believe the market has good legs to it, and that\u2019s certainly been borne out the last four or five years, and I think that will continue. ","Relative to Cooper, while we\u2019ve been gaining share in all regions, keep in mind probably our strong suit has been Europe, where both Clariti and MyDay are represented. In the U.S., for all practical purposes, we have only just begun. We\u2019re in the first inning, if you will. There was somewhat of a scrambled egg we had to work with because of the weak distribution system in the fourth quarter, so that\u2019s not indicative of where Clariti in the U.S. should end up.","We\u2019re very optimistic about Clariti\u2019s rollout in January in the U.S. I\u2019m proud to say that we\u2019ve dealt with the distribution channels, and we\u2019re now shipping out of but one warehouse in the U.S. and so we like to say one invoice, one shipment, instead of two different distribution centers and two different invoices. So I think we\u2019ll start seeing some momentum build, particularly in the United States, with that product family. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Christopher Pasquale.","Christopher Pasquale","Bob, could you just update your thoughts on daily silicon hydrogel sales in FY15? I know you\u2019ve had some moving pieces here with Clariti. How are you thinking about the combination of Clariti and MyDay in the coming year?","Robert Weiss ","Well, we\u2019re clearly thinking about it from a combined point of view, as opposed to each individually. So one influences the other, and we\u2019re, obviously in the U.S., putting a lot more muscle behind Clariti and waiting until we have a more robust production support for MyDay. But also, and most importantly, even if we had plenty of MyDay, we would not attempt to do both single use products rolled out in the U.S. concurrently.","So MyDay is going to continue to work Europe. Clariti is reaching from Europe, where it\u2019s done extremely well, into the U.S. We have the capacity. We now have the distribution system. So when I look at single use one day, we\u2019re still kind of gearing towards $175 million in total for the combined silicon hydrogel one day portfolio. ","Christopher Pasquale","And then it seems like the solutions business has gotten tougher recently for some of your peers. Can you comment on how that piece of Sauflon performed year over year, and whether some of the weakness there changes the outlook for that piece of the business going forward?","Robert Weiss ","Solutions has been pretty much a flat market since the late 90s. So there\u2019s been no growth in the last 17 years. No reason to think there will be growth. We\u2019re not na\u00efve to that fact, and typically as contact lenses move from planned replacement into the one day modality, there\u2019s even further pressure on that.","Having said that, what Sauflon did very nicely is package a nice portfolio of products, leveraging some large retailers that, among other things, get into direct to consumer shipments, combination lenses, and lens care for those that are not on the daily regimen. And still, keep in mind, the majority of wearers are not on the daily regimen.","So off of a small base, we think there\u2019s something there to look at. We have yet to determine how much muscle we\u2019ll put behind it. So think of 2015 as kind of doing our homework. But don\u2019t expect that we\u2019re going to rush to any rash decision in terms of minimizing that business.","To your question how did it do, it kind of held its own. It was a flattish business in the quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. "," ","Larry Biegelsen","So the 1% FX change and 12% EPS, but the $100 million reduction in the top line EPS is 6% year over year change, and that equates to $0.15. So it\u2019s a $0.90 reduction. It\u2019s a 1%, it\u2019s over $0.15 based on the change, if you\u2019re following my math. So $100 million, negative 6% year over year, and then so I\u2019m trying to understand\u2026","Greg Matz ","Sorry, Larry, if I could jump in, it\u2019s Greg. We had a 10% move year over year in currencies.","Larry Biegelsen ","Okay. I\u2019ll go back and look at that. The $100 million change is 6% versus what you reported in fiscal 2014. So the $0.90 divided by six gives you 15% for each 1% change.","Robert Weiss ","Larry, just on that point, the 10% devaluation year over year, in other words, using last year\u2019s exchange rates thank you, would have been 10% higher, the $100 million higher. That 10% is, of course, the foreign exchange piece, and if you then say 60% of our business is outside the U.S., that\u2019s 6% on the overall number. So I think maybe we\u2019re saying the same thing, the six equals the six. ","Larry Biegelsen ","We can take it offline. I\u2019m not sure I can do the math on the fly, but I\u2019m not quite following. That\u2019s okay. We can take it offline later. And then just one other question, the change [unintelligible] issues in the U.S., it seems like that will continue into the fourth quarter. How do you guys see that impacting you guys? Is that an opportunity for you guys?","Robert Weiss ","Well, J&J has been one of the generous people in the marketplace the last couple of years, and obviously they\u2019ve gone pretty aggressive on UPPS. Someone asked the question on UPP before. We still think that\u2019s kind of somewhat faddish, although we\u2019re, in the case of Clariti, going along with a decision that Sauflon made to use UPP in the U.S. ","Certainly, J&J has leveraged the UPP concept somewhat to their benefit on one side of the aisle, but very much to their detriment on the other side, if we compare the independent to the retailers. So they certainly have alienated the retailer.","We\u2019re still of the opinion that it\u2019s somewhat novel but is not a long term strategy, meaning UPP is not the way the market should go. We\u2019ll let that play out. J&J is, of course, as we look at it the next two years, they have in the one day modality, where the market is shifting from two weeks, their sweet spot. ","They own, for all practical purposes, ex-Avaira, they own the two-week market in the U.S. That is shifting somewhat into the monthly modality, but very much into the one day modality where J&J still gets a fair amount of business, but they\u2019re also losing a fair amount of business. So that\u2019s where the real game gets played, is what goes on in the one day modality in the U.S. We like our chances with ProClear one day, Clariti, and then down the road, MyDay in that space. ","J&J has moist, which is not bad as a non-silicon hydrogel, and we think that when someone has a choice, the eye care professional, when we look at planned replacement, 75% of the revenue dollars are in the silicon hydrogel modality. The only reason that does not also apply in the one day modality, which is now more like 15% to 16% silicon hydrogel, the only reason it\u2019s not bigger is price point. ","And that\u2019s where True Eye and Total One are on the high end of the price point, the premium price point, and that is not the average consumer, and therefore we think that\u2019s where a lot of fair game is for our product portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Matt Mishan of KeyBanc. ","Matt Mishan","Can you talk a little bit about the added synergies you kind of expected to see? I was a little surprised by that, because of the delay in the integration with Sauflon in the U.K.","Robert Weiss ","Yeah, there was no doubt the two and a half month delay cost us, and that\u2019s why we ended up with the 13% OI for Sauflon. And a lot of people were on planes ready to hit the go button in September when all that hit. ","So yeah, we lost some timing, and relative to where we\u2019re going, on the $0.10 pickup, that really is reflected in the fact that there have been a number of things, both on their cost structure, on the manufacturing side primarily, that is driving us to be a lot more bullish. And we will make pretty good inroads into catching up on the synergy side and basically have identified more synergies than we initially thought, which led to the $0.10 pickup. ","Matt Mishan ","I think you said that you expect about $200 million in daily silicon hydrogel sales for 2015. Is that still ballpark, maybe $75 million MyDay, maybe $125 million for Sauflon?","Robert Weiss ","I quoted last quarter, and again today, $175 million in total. We have not done the split out, because as I indicated, we\u2019re going to be pushing Clariti, particularly in the U.S., a lot harder than MyDay, and reserving MyDay mainly for the continuation of the European rollout, for two reasons. One, we have the capacity with Clariti, and so why not put the muscle behind it. And two is we don\u2019t want to try rolling out two silicon hydrogels at once in the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Larry Keusch of Raymond James. ","Larry Keusch","Bob, for those of us that lived through the integration of Ocular, I recognize that Sauflon obviously is smaller, less complex, less distribution centers, less manufacturing sites, etc. But help us really understand the confidence that you have that the time that you took this quarter to deal with some of these service disruption issues are truly behind you, so that when you get going in January, you\u2019ve got a clean slate in front of you and we\u2019re not going to hear about it on the next quarter\u2019s report.","Robert Weiss ","Fair question, and with Ocular, for those that don\u2019t know, it was pretty much a $400 million company buying a $330 million company. So for all practical purposes, two companies about the same size with very diverse information systems, different locations on distribution, one on the East Coast, one on the West Coast. ","Since we\u2019re just starting the rollout, and the reason we kind of stopped it before it went too far in the last quarter, was it was coming out of separate distribution systems. That was in a startup mode, knowing it was going to be in a shutdown mode, which is kind of very difficult to ramp up and ramp down. And we also wanted to get it right from the point of view of the consumer, so what we did, recognizing that, is service only existing accounts without trying to roll out and create new demand that then couldn\u2019t be met by the distribution center.","Effective December 1, all inventory of contact lenses is shipped out of West Henrietta already, and it\u2019s integrated into our system. It\u2019s a simple product line called basically Clariti One Day, not a complicated one like Ocular had. All the private labels may have had 20 or 30 different private labels, and a lot of complexity to it. It was as complicated as Cooper in some respects, because of the private label modality, not the toric modality, if you will.","But no, we feel highly confident that our systems are ready, and in the interim, we\u2019ve been able to beef up the preparation of fitting sets that are rolling out to the field, so there\u2019ll be a fair amount of muscle behind the product on all fronts, the fitting sets, the marketing emphasis in January, as well as what\u2019s behind the scenes in the back office. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ms. Joann Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch","There were three explanations that you gave. One was temporary softness with Sauflon. The second one was inventory reductions. Can you remind me what that third one was that in total hit $13 million or $0.13 a share? ","Robert Weiss ","Yeah, it was foreign exchange impact on the fourth quarter of $3 million top line.","Joanne Wuensch ","So the inventory reduction issue, we\u2019ve been hearing this now a couple of times. You said, I think I\u2019m quoting here, but you feel confident this is the last time we will be raising this issue. Is it possible that just the purchasing patterns of your end users, your vendors, has changed permanently, and therefore you\u2019re going to be coming up against odd quarters for some time?","Robert Weiss ","I think it has changed permanently, and if I kind of look at it from a three-year point of view, three years ago, we were down 20%. Last year, we were down 16%. This year, we were down 17% in days of inventory on hand. There are minimums that the distributors are allowed to have. They\u2019re at those minimums now, so they cannot contractually go below on any extended basis.","I think we\u2019re pretty efficient, and I\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times in the past that as an example, we ship a lot of the custom-made torics and the odd torics, the onesies and twosies, on behalf of the distributors, so they don\u2019t have to stock it. That led to a much more efficient requirement on the distributor in terms of what they had to carry. In other words, they\u2019re carrying the high turnover SKUs and not the slow, complex SKUs like many of the torics are. ","So the entire distribution channel is a lot more efficient in total, and I don\u2019t expect that to revert back the other way. We\u2019ve kind of got down to the floor. It took three years, and I would have said a year ago, when we had already gotten down, basically down 20, down 16, in aggregate down 36%, that would have been far enough.","The reason I\u2019m confident now is that floor, the contractual floor. If they go below where they are now, then that runs the risk of back orders and servicing the customer, and that\u2019s kind of where we push back, if you will. ","Joanne Wuensch ","And my second question has to do with manufacturing. Back in the spring, there was a warning letter in Puerto Rico, I believe. I\u2019m curious where that is in the process of resolution. And also, now that you\u2019ve owned Sauflon a little bit longer, is the current thinking still to keep all of the individual manufacturing sites or are you starting to shift towards thinking about how to consolidate some of that?","Robert Weiss ","The first question, on the warning letter, which came out of Puerto Rico, was issued earlier this fiscal year or early in the calendar year, I should say, and that has been removed. It has not yet been posted on the FDA site, but basically back in October the FDA cleared the warning letter. So happy to say that.","Relative to consolidation, we have basically robust locations in Puerto Rico where we make over a billion lenses, well over a billion lenses, and in the U.K. Certainly, the U.K. is kind of a campus in the greater Southampton area, so that would be one site where, from a physical plant location point of view, we\u2019ll still look at it. Hungary is in a ramp up mode, and that will continue in a ramp up mode with Clariti. And Hungary and Costa Rica are our low cost labor centers. And so we would expect to continue to ramp up and expand into Costa Rica.","In the one day modality, you talk about making a lot of lenses, so I don\u2019t see a huge amount of consolidation shutdown opportunity. We\u2019re certainly not going to exit either Southampton or Hungary or Puerto Rico, making a billion lenses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Jeff Johnson of Robert W. Baird. ","Jeff Johnson","Greg, let me ask one more currency question, and you know, as you go through the explanation, it all seems to kind of make sense, at least as much as it can to a simpleton like myself, but if look at fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014, you didn\u2019t have nearly as much of an EPS impact. 2013, you had some euro help offsetting a real big yen move, so I guess that makes sense. ","But in 2014, it looks like to me the euro was down 7% year over year, the yen down about 10% year over year, and yet the EPS impact was only $0.36. So again, I hear all your explanations for 2015, but kind of, you know, why a factor of 3X bigger in 2015 over 2014, when the moves in 2014 actually were pretty sizable themselves? ","Greg Matz ","Yeah, Jeff, I\u2019d have to go back and look at the detail, but one of the things to keep in mind is if you go back to, you know, when I started with the company in 2010, we were 50% U.S., 50% international, and we\u2019ve steadily grown. In each year, we\u2019ve grown that number. So from that perspective, we\u2019ve had a bigger and bigger hit each year. ","Also, the dramatic moves, it\u2019s not been a 1% move. And in the prior years, and again, I\u2019d have to go back and look at 2013 to 2014, because I don\u2019t have that with me in the room, but the yen, again, was moving, but the yen\u2019s at 120, almost a freefall, and so that has been pretty dramatic in having an impact on where we\u2019re going. And again, not every rate is different.","The other thing is all currencies are going against the U.S. dollar. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s any one that\u2019s not. And that\u2019s a little different than the past, where you\u2019ve had regional moves. And you\u2019re right, three years ago, it was the euro that hit us, then it was last year it was the yen and the euro went the other way, offsetting, and the pound has been fluctuating between $1.69 and $1.55 for I don\u2019t know, five years or whatever. ","And this year was a little different. Everybody went against us. And you really saw that beginning the latter part of Q3. So I\u2019d have to go back and look specifically, Jeff, but again, we spent some time modeling this and looking at it, and it\u2019s definitely a painful fact. But the fact that the cost or the impact per 1% has gone up is the fact that our reach has gone up, and our growth outside the U.S. has gone up. ","Robert Weiss ","Yeah, Jeff, I do have the cheat sheet a little on some of that. The euro actually, as Greg alluded to, took a hit back in 2012, but actually gained slightly in 2013, and by that, I mean it went from $1.29 to $1.32. And then it went from $1.32 to $1.35 in 2014. So actually, from a full year point of view, it\u2019s net marginally up. ","It is the yen that, in 2013, took the big hit, 19% down, from 79 to 94, and then this year, it\u2019s gone from 94 to 103, down another nine. And now, of course, ever since September 4, it\u2019s just fallen off the cliff. So in aggregate, the yen is now devalued 56% since its high point of 77 back in 2012.","So the combination of not only the yen, but also the euro and then of course the pound kind of joining it, but on a six-month lag base, and actually working against us as Greg indicated in the first six months of 2015, the pound goes the wrong way even. And then it starts going favorable as becoming a part hedge.","So that, combined with the fact that our business has migrated from 50% outside the U.S. to over 60% outside the U.S. is a big factor, and what used to be $0.06 is now $0.10 with a range of eight to twelve depending on where the pound is moving in that pendulum.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. ","Anthony Petrone","I guess just to stay on the topic of FX Bob, and just to round out that conversation would be, can you just give us a sense, again, of the Sauflon U.K. revenues and their exposure to the pound and just how that\u2019s moving through the first half and how that plays into the equation as well? ","Robert Weiss ","Yeah, the Sauflon, if you will, is essentially 90-plus percent an outside the U.S. business with a lot of currency in euros, some currency and some expenses in pounds, and then of course Hungary, the plant Hungary. And I know we have that as a dollar functional currency, but for all practical purposes, it\u2019s moving more in tandem with Europe, or not in tandem with the dollar, if you will.","So Sauflon is part of the reason that we\u2019ve moved up north of the 60% balance of U.S.\/non-U.S. From a manufacturing point of view, there\u2019s somewhat the natural hedge of Hungary that comes into play, just like the natural hedge of the U.K. plant. But in terms of the revenue side, that is, where we are right now, 90% outside the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby","Just a quick question for you, Bob. I know you said capex would start to drop in 2016. Can you give any more color on what that might look like, and then what operating cash flow might look like given the incremental revenue and earnings from Sauflon?","Robert Weiss ","You know, we guided to, or my comments are we expect north of $200 million in free cash flow next year. This year, we had, of course, $235 million, I think it was, or $236 million. ","So our expectation is that towards the end of 2015, as we go through the integration activity and rationalization, and recognizing that Sauflon is where our future capital requirements for growth are really going to be, the fact that they spend one third what we spend for the same production volume, if you will, makes it an attractive model. ","There are certain types of equipment in the CooperVision pre-Sauflon aisle, if you will, that were very expensive and rest assured, we expect to be buying a lot less $30 million pieces of equipment as has been done in the past, going forward. ","So that mix, particularly as we rationalize some of what\u2019s going on with the manufacturing technologies and which products are made on which platforms, we\u2019re highly optimistic that by the end of 2015, and moving into 2016, capital requirements will drop substantially, if for no other reason the fact that they spend one third as much for the same volume as we had been spending with the Clariti side.","As far as free cash flow, post 2015, other than to say you\u2019re going to have two drivers, one is improved operating results from the integration activity being substantially complete by the end of 2015, number one. And number two, the reduced capex should lead to very attractive improvements, both on the P&L and on free cash flow in 2016. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Jon Block of Stifel.","Jon Block","Maybe two quick ones. First one, just Bob, can you talk about how you\u2019re doing in Europe, where you have both [unintelligible] daily lenses, MyDay and Clariti, how do you view your market share of new fits? And then the second one would be, you know, we keep on hearing from our checks and from you guys all these great things about dailies, but if you look at the growth, even on a trailing 12 month basis, dailies has gone from 12% to 10% to now 9%. So can you talk to us about what you\u2019re seeing from sort of a unit versus price standpoint within dailies?","Robert Weiss ","As far as how we\u2019re doing in Europe, if you look at our three regions, the one that really is stellar in pro forma constant currency, in other words, what we did is adjust it as if we owned Sauflon in the prior year. That was up 13% in constant currency compared to U.S. five and Asia Pac seven. That\u2019s where we have Clariti and MyDay both in the marketplace, and they\u2019re basically doing stellar there.","If you look at from the point of view of how are our products doing in the single use modality, you\u2019re correct that from a CLI perspective, the market of one day worldwide last quarter was only 6%. But as I indicated, I don\u2019t think one quarter does the trend make, and if I look at it from a 12 month point of view, it was 9%. Maybe that was the 9% you were quoting.","We, on the other hand, put up 11% constant currency growth - once again, pro forma constant currency growth - this last quarter. So pretty robust there, and that kind of reflects the driver being, among other things, Clariti in the one day modality and MyDay, to a much lesser extent. And for the last 12 months, trailing 12 months, we were at 16%, likewise very robust. ","I think part of that 11% we had this last quarter was the fact that as far as deceleration was what was going on in the U.S., where we really didn\u2019t have MyDay into the U.S. market. And quite frankly, Clariti did next to nothing because of some of the things I explained regarding the disruption and our decision to pretty much stop new emphasis and opening new accounts and only service the existing accounts until January. So it will start showing up post the calendar year end and we look forward to good things really after the first quarter [unintelligible] starting that process.","As far as pricing, I would say overall pricing in that modality is on net, up, meaning you have the trading up phenomenon as we, particularly Total One, which is off the charts trading up. So you have ARPs migrating up for a variety of reasons. Silicon hydrogel within the one day modality space. And I don\u2019t see any change in that. In other words, as we go from conventional hydrogel lenses to silicon hydrogel lenses, that is a trade up activity that will continue.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we will now hear from Mr. Bob Weiss for closing remarks. And thank you for your participation in the question and answer session.","Robert Weiss","Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. I wish we had a better story on foreign exchange, so if there\u2019s anyone on the line that knows how to weaken the dollar, please send your suggestions to Washington DC or someplace. And I know we\u2019re not the only company that is dealing with foreign exchange, trust me, but it is kind of painful.","We think hopefully you\u2019ll look beyond foreign exchange to what\u2019s really going on in the company. We are extremely jazzed about that, and I must admit, just getting that official notice this morning that the CMA cleared us to go forward was just a nice thing to have going forward, because then the walls come down and we can hit the go button throughout the world relative to Sauflon.","So I\u2019m jazzed about that, and we look forward to updating you on our next quarterly call, which will be March 5, 2015, on the progress we\u2019re making. Look forward to it. Thank you.

Weiss","Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our fiscal fourth quarter and our fiscal year 2013 conference call.","Let me start by saying I'm very proud of the fiscal year and our accomplishments highlighted, our revenue growth of 10%, our non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 15%.","Having said that, I know many of you are looking at our fourth quarter results versus our guidance. And I want to immediately provide some color on that.","Let me start with revenue. As you will have noted on our earnings release, our consolidated revenue growth was significantly impacted by our CooperVision Americas growth of only 2%. This came in around 7% wider than we were expecting and it was driven by one key item, channel inventory. This came in $7 million lighter than we were expecting and it was driven by one key item, channel inventory.","User demand has remained strong and we've seen no negative signals on that front. However, the largest 2 U.S. distributors merged and their efforts to consolidate operations and reduce inventory impacted us significantly in the month of October. This flows into gross margin as a larger portion of the lost sales would have been Biofinity to carry gross margin over 70%.","On a positive note, CooperVision Americas revenue in November was up 18%, so we are beyond the year-end reduction in channel inventory, and we're entering fiscal 2014 off to a good base.","Next, let me provide some additional color on gross margins. Cost of goods came in around $6 million higher-than-anticipated. The biggest reason for this was changes regarding the manufacturing of MyDay, our daily silicone hydrogel lens.","We made a couple of important strategic moves at the end of our fiscal year to accelerate manufacturing and expand our parameter range.","This was done to capitalize on the success we're seeing with the MyDay in the market place. Unfortunately, there isn't accounting yet, with these moves and MyDay was produced at a negative gross margin in the fourth quarter. We've done this with many products over the years, and as volume increases and as we bring on additional lines, we see these costs decrease.","It's very important to note that our manufacturing process for MyDay and our ramp-up of MyDay production is ahead of schedule, and there's no manufacturing surprises.","The fact is that demand for MyDay is very strong and accelerating in the manufacturing process for margins. This is absolutely the right strategic move and we're confident it will pay off in fiscal 2015 and beyond.","Also with respect to 2014, we're comfortable we've captured the impact of the MyDay in our guidance. For competitive reasons, I don't want to get into too many details, but I do believe we'll have sales of MyDay of roughly $25 million for fiscal year 2014. Margins will start the year very low, if not negative, but we should finish the year with margins in the upper single digits.","Combining these 2 items, the channel inventory reduction and the higher cost of goods, resulted in a negative impact on gross margins of approximately 175 basis points from where we were when we gave guidance in September.","Lastly, with respect to the fourth quarter, let me touch upon SG&A over the last couple of months of the quarter, which came in roughly $5 million higher than we originally forecast.","Again, the largest part of this was tied to our success with MyDay. MyDay has been received extremely well and recently won an award for the best contact lens product at the prestigious SILMO global optical show in Paris in late September.","Based on that, we made the decision to be more aggressive launching the product in Europe. I believe this was the right decision and we'll remain aggressive marketing this product going forward.","Totaling the 3 items, the channel inventory reduction, the high cost of goods and the higher SG&A cost, earnings per share was negatively impacted by roughly $0.30 at the end of the fourth quarter.","Let me say I'm not concerned about the end user demand and we believe we are beyond the channel inventory issue. I'm also not concerned about the production of MyDay or the demand for this product. I will discuss later -- as I'll discuss later, MyDay will have a significant impact on our P&L in coming years as it's a reduction of gross margins, not a driver of top and bottom line growth. And we believe it is absolutely a positive for our business.","Now let me spend some more time on the revenue line. Our sales are a tale of 2 cities and overall strong quarter for CVI and CSI in a very weak October in CooperVision Americas.","As I mentioned, the Americas weakness was due to the channel inventory matter, asset distributors and it negatively impacted revenues by $7 million. At the end of the day, though, end-user demand remains strong throughout the world with all of the CVI regions and core products posting solid results. This is clearly seen in the market data for calendar year Q3, but we grew 10% almost twice in the market. Additionally, in spite of the U.S. distributor issue in October, our sales in silicone hydrogel continue to drive our market share gains. Silicone hydrogel sales were up 19% in the quarter in constant currency and now represent 45% of CVI's revenues. The key driver continues to be Biofinity, on a global basis with strong contributions from all modalities, as well as all lens type spheres, torics and multifocals. In Japan, our rollout of Biofinity continues to go extremely well with sales up 2x the prior year. 2x.","Avaira had a decent quarter growing 8%, and as mentioned, MyDay rollout is very strong, constrained only by our capacity issues. Also, our Proclear 1 Day product continues to gain share with revenues up 19% in constant currency.","Once again, I'm happy to say we believe we are gaining share across the board in all regions, all modalities, all lens types, spheres, torics and multifocals and materials, be it silicone hydrogel or traditional hydrogel lenses. This demonstrates the breadth of our product portfolio. Within CooperSurgical, I'm pleased to report sales growth of 8% led to our -- led by our IVF franchise, which grew 24%.","Stock geographically. Foreign exchange headwinds continue reducing CooperVision revenue 3% in the quarter. Excluding foreign exchange, CooperVision growth was 6% in the fiscal quarter.","Last year, the euro was down 7%. This year, the yen was down 19% in the fiscal year and 25% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. With $200 million of revenue in Japan, this is not only impacting our revenue, but it's also negatively impacting our gross margin, as well as our operating income and our bottom line. Even with the major -- this major nuisance on the strength of the product lines we are putting up some solid numbers.","From a revenue perspective regionally, we have put up solid constant currency growth except for the Americas, which was impacted in October by the 16% decline in days in inventory at authorized distributors.","Regionally, the Americas is up 2% in the fourth quarter in constant currency; Europe, 8%; Asia-Pac, 11%; and worldwide, 6% in constant currency.","Our growth drivers are: In the Americas, trading up to Biofinity, including the halo effect of Biofinity; multifocal with the entire family doing well; also while off of a smaller base Proclear 1 Day, sphere and multifocal is a key contributor.","In Europe, right now, currency is helping offset some of the yen, driving our 8% constant currency growth in this region is the entr\u00e9e -- the entire Biofinity family and the 1 Days, including MyDay.","In Asia-Pac, while foreign exchange took its toll on revenues, our constant currency revenues were up 11%, 12%, excluding Aime. Drivers, the tremendous success of the Biofinity family, especially with the halo effect of Biofinity toric and the Proclear 1 Day.","Let's talk a little bit about the marketplace. The worldwide soft contact lens markets. In the third calendar quarter, 2013 was up 6% in constant currency. While CooperVision was up 10%.","For the trailing 12 months ended September 30, the soft contact lens market now at $7.4 billion worldwide was up 5% in constant currency.","CooperVision was up 10% on the strength of Biofinity and Proclear 1 Day. For the calendar quarter, the market growth was sponsored by 1 Day growth, which is up over 10%. While industry growth data is no longer available on silicone hydrogel material, most likely this trade up of material remains a solid growth driver.","CooperVision was up 23% in constant currency in the calendar quarter, third quarter of 2013. And at CooperVision, silicone hydrogel now represents 45% of our revenues. The soft contact lens market continues to be a trade-up market. This includes premium products silicone hydrogel, lenses, torics and multifocals.","The trade up to 1 Day disposable expands patient revenue by 400% to 600%. Even more important, the 1 Day wearer generates 300% to 500% more profit per patient.","Also, it's important to understand that torics and multifocals have a long way to go in capturing the market opportunity, especially outside the United States.","Geographically, the Americas did best, up 7% in the calendar quarter on the strength of the 1 Day trade up. Asia-Pac, 6% on the strength of a 10% growth, excluding Japan; and in Europe, it was up 4% also on the strength of the 1 Day trade up.","CooperSurgical, our women's health care franchise turned in a solid $84.8 million in revenue, up 8% with the prior year fourth quarter. On the strength of a $29 million contribution from fertility, which accounts for 34% of CooperSurgical and was up 24% above the prior year.","I'll talk briefly about guidance. We have now provided more color on what we think fiscal year 2014 will bring. We remain bullish about top line growth and gaining market share. We expect upper single-digit top line growth with CooperVision growing close to double digits in constant currency and continuing to outpace the market.","Our assumption is that the soft contact lens market will continue to grow in that 4% to 6% range. Between Biofinity, Proclear 1 Day, and now, MyDay, we have the products to address the growth areas of the global soft contact lens market.","On the profit side, we will have a few ongoing challenges. Clearly, the yen will stay a headwind at least through the first 6 months of the fiscal year with the prior year comps for the yen being 85 in the first quarter last year and 95 in the second quarter.","The other muddying factors will be the ongoing expense of the MyDay rollout and the numerous capital expansion programs we are in the middle of. Also, geographic expansion will continue on several fronts. Even so, we remain optimistic that Biofinity will continue to deliver good top line, gross margin percent and operating profit to fund many of our ventures.","The net results is we expect to deliver very respectable growth in non-GAAP earnings per share in the 13% to 18% range or the $6.70 to $7 in our guidance in the fiscal year 2014.","2014 will be another year of heavy commercial -- heavy commitments to capital expenditures. We expect capital expenditures will exceed $200 million. Even so, we again except to deliver in excess of $200 million of free cash flow.","One more point before I leave guidance. I, for several years, have been very clear and very deliberate about saying we will forgo our greatly improve gross profit percent for the trading up to the 1 Day modality. That is expected to deliver 400% to 600% more in top line revenue per patient. And longer-term, 300% to 500% more profit per patient.","This will come at the expense of the lens care industry. We remain committed to the strategy into our 2018 objective of a 25% operating income margin.","Other contributions in the 2014 to 2018 period include the rolloff of the CIBA royalty, the elimination of the 10-year amortization period on the Ocular Sciences acquisition in January 2005, it roll offs in 2015, the beginning of the expiration of depreciation on many of the Gen II lines that came with the Ocular acquisition and additionally, the expiration we will begin -- and additionally, the expectation that we will begin leveraging some of the investments we've been making in global sales and marketing and R&D the past 6 years. All in all, we believe a 25% operating income target for 2013 is achievable.","One thing I have historically put much color -- not put much color on is how we have done the first month following the quarter. Breaking with tradition, given my earlier comments about the 16% shrinkage in the U.S. authorized distributor pipeline, I thought I would add some color.","In November, CooperVision's revenues were up 5% as reported but up 12% in constant currency excluding Aime. The Americas were up 18%. These November results have been factored into our fiscal year 2014 guidance.","Enough on guidance and outlook. Today, I'm going to skip some of the traditional comments on strategy to allow a bit more time to have Greg review the financials and for questions-and-answers.","So in summary, before I turn it over to Greg, let me say how pleased I am -- I remain with our results. We continue to outperform the marketplace, most recently growing in the neighborhood of 2x the market for soft contact lenses.","Our family of products: Biofinity, Avaira, Proclear 1 Day and MyDay and in the women's health care fertility all have promising growth potential in the global marketplace. We have continued to invest in global expansion and are making good progress in many of these markets. Our balance sheet and our free cash flow are strong, and we'll fund our global expansion plans as we aggressively move into the 1 Day market, which accounts for over 40% or $3 billion of the $7.4 billion soft contact lens market worldwide.","While we are more than willing to trade off our gross profit for 1 Day top line, we will do this in a manner that increases our operating income margins and earnings per share. We remain keenly focused on delivering improving results, mindful of our desire to invest and leverage prudently, thereby, delivering optimized, long-term total shareholder returns.","I might add, we purchased almost 1 million shares of our stock in the fiscal fourth quarter, and will continue to do this if we believe it makes sense.","Lastly, as always, a reminder that at Cooper, our #1 asset is our employees. I wish to continue to express my appreciation for their dedication to creating great results.","And now, I'll turn it over to Greg to cover more of the financial highlights.","Gregory W. Matz","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Bob shared with you a pretty through review of the market and our revenue picture. Bob also gave you the highlights of our Q4 gross margin and earnings per share versus our expectations we had shared in guidance on September 5. Let me start with gross margins looking at the full fiscal Q4 '13 versus Q4 '12.","In Q4, the consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 64.1% compared with 63.8% for GAAP and non-GAAP in Q4 last year. We continue to see strong headwinds year-over-year due to the impact of foreign exchange, predominantly the yen, on our revenue and the related direct impact on gross margins, which had approximately a 95-basis-point impact year-over-year. We're seeing a large impact to margins of approximately 70 basis points due to MyDay and a combination of mix and start-up costs.","As we discussed in the past, we've been fluctuating between low and no margins on this product, which is normal in the start-up phase where you're building capacity.","Helping to offset the headwind has been favorable product mix, excluding the impact of MyDay and the CIBA royalty savings. On a full fiscal year basis, we finished at 64.7%, up 80 basis points from the prior year.","CooperVision, on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, reported gross margin of 64% versus 63.7% for GAAP and non-GAAP in Q4 last year. Factors impacting gross margin in the quarter, as I mentioned, are the currency headwinds, MyDay and the CIBA royalty savings. For the full year, gross margins went from 63.4% in 2012 to 64.8% in 2013.","CooperSurgical had a GAAP and a non-GAAP gross margin of 64.3%, which compares to Q4 '12 of 64.1%. Fertility with lower margins will continue to put pressure on our gross margin, but we still expect CooperSurgical's margin to be modestly higher in fiscal 2014.","For the full year, CooperSurgical's margin went from 66.4% in 2012 to 64.2%, 2013. The reduction was largely due to the purchase of Origio in July 2012, which expanded our presence in the IVF space.","Now looking at operating expenses. SG&A in the quarter on a GAAP basis, SG&A expenses increased by 3% from Q4 last year to $157.2 million, and were 38% of revenue, same as the prior year.","On a non-GAAP basis, SG&A grew 4% year-over-year. Now the difference is that GAAP SG&A for Q4 '12 included $800k of Origio integration costs.","As Bob previously mentioned, during this past quarter, we did experience higher selling and marketing expenses than planned as we ramp some of our product launch efforts for MyDay in Europe. On a sequential basis, SG&A was up 3%.","As we discussed in the past, CooperSurgical is impacted by the medical device excise tax. We had 736k of medical device excise tax in the quarter hit SG&A. We had a total of about $2.4 million hit in 2013, but we would expect to see around $3 million for this tax in 2014.","Now looking at R&D. In Q4, R&D increased by approximately 12% year-over-year to $15.8 million, or up $1.7 million. R&D was 3.8% of revenue, up from 3.6% in Q4 '12. We expect R&D will continue to grow faster than sales in fiscal 2014.","Depreciation and amortization. In Q4, depreciation was $24.1 million, up 560k or 2% year-over-year, and amortization was $7.7 million, up approximately 400k or 5% year-over-year for a total of $31.8 million. For the year, depreciation and amortization were $95.1 million and $30.2 million, respectively, for a total of $125.3 million.","On October 31 this year, we completed a transaction to sell Aime, our rigid gas permeable contact lens and solution business in Japan, to Nippon Contact Lens Inc. The business was originally obtained as part of the December 2010 acquisition, which included obtaining the rights to market Biofinity in Japan. The divestiture is consistent with CooperVision's strategy to focus on its core soft contact lens business.","The company recognized a fourth quarter GAAP charge to earnings under the line of loss on divestiture of Aime in the amount of $21.1 million. This will have a GAAP EPS impact of $0.28 for the quarter and $0.26 for 2013. Going forward, this is expected to be neutral to earnings per share.","Moving to operating margins. For Q4, solid consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $62 million and 15.1% of revenue versus $79 million and 19.9% of revenue in Q4 '12.","On a non-GAAP basis, operating income and margin were $83.1 million and 20.2% of revenue versus $79.8 million and 20.1% for non-GAAP in Q4 '12. This represents a 4% increase in operating income over Q4 '12 non-GAAP numbers.","The difference in the current year between GAAP and non-GAAP operating income is the $21.1 million Aime charge. For the full year, GAAP operating income and margin were $305.9 million and 19.3% of revenue, up 8% in operating income, down 30 basis points on the margin.","On a non-GAAP basis for the full year, operating income and margin were $327.6 million or 20.6% of revenue, up 13.7% and up 70 basis points on the margin, respectively. Interest expense was $1.9 million for the quarter, down 30% year-over-year.","In looking at the effective tax rate. In Q4, the GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were 6.2% and 10.3%, respectively, versus Q4 '12 GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate of 12.7% and 13%, respectively.","As we've discussed before, the effective tax rate continues to be below the U.S. statutory rate, as a majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates.","The full year GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate were 4.9% and 7.4%, respectively, versus 2012 rates of 9.7% for both GAAP and non-GAAP.","Looking at earnings per share. Our Q4 earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was $1.15 and $1.48, respectively, versus $1.46 and $1.47 on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis in Q4 '12.","Earnings per share is down 21% on a GAAP basis, largely due to the $0.28 charge for Aime in the current quarter and the $0.10 benefit in Q4 '12 from insurance proceeds.","On a non-GAAP basis, EPS is up 1% or $0.01 versus the prior year. In Q4 '12, the non-GAAP earnings also benefited from the $0.10 favorable impact of insurance proceeds.","As Bob discussed, our Q4 earnings per share was impacted negatively by U.S. distributor inventory reductions and certain items in cost of goods sold and operating expenses led by decisions to support our MyDay product.","For the full year, our earnings per share on a GAAP to non-GAAP basis was $5.96 and $5.95, respectively, which is a growth of 18% and 15.3% GAAP and non-GAAP, respectively.","During Q4, we repurchased approximately 960,000 shares with an average share value of $128 per share for a total cost of $123 million. This makes a total shares repurchased during 2013 approximately 1,421,000 shares, at a total cost of $167.3 million or $117.78 per share. This leads the remaining $61.6 million available for future share repurchases under the current approved program. The earnings per share impact of our 2013 share repurchases is $0.01 in Q4 and $0.05 for the full year.","Regarding foreign exchange, currency continues to have a big impact on our business. From a year-over-year perspective, currency negatively impacted us by $0.12. And this was mainly driven by the yen, which is down 25% year-over-year.","For the full year, we saw a $0.50 EPS impact due to currency. At the current FX rate, we'd expect an approximate $0.21 negative FX impact in EPS next year, which is baked into our guidance. For our 2014 guidance, we use today's rates of roughly 1.36 for the euro, 102 for the yen and 1.64 for the pound.","Looking at balance sheet and liquidity items real quickly in Q4, we had cash provided by operations of $150.3 million, capital expenditures of $72 million, resulting in a $78.3 million of free cash flow. For the year, our free cash flow was $239.4 million. CapEx for the year was $178.1 million.","On September 16, we announced the company closed a $300 million, 5-year senior unsecured term loan, which matures September 12, 2018. We use the facility to pay down borrowings under our $1 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit, which matures May 31, 2017.","This term loan provides additional financial flexibility through an improved maturity structure, additional capacity and lower interest rates. Total debt increased within the quarter by $101 million to $344.7 million due to $123 million of share repurchases. This leaves us with approximately $1 billion of total credit available at October 31.","Inventories were basically flat at $339 million from last quarter. For the quarter, we're seeing months on hand at 6.9 months, up from a months on hand, 6.7 months last year and down from 7.1 months last quarter.","Accounts receivable continues to be well managed with DSOs at 53 days, down slightly from 54 days last year, and the same as the end of last quarter.","Now turning to guidance. In order to provide a little bit more color for your models, let me share some additional specifics on our guidance. Revenue range for the company is $1.675 billion to $1.735 billion. CooperVision's revenue range is $1.355 billion to $1.395 billion. And finally, CooperSurgical's revenue range is $320 million to $340 million.","We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be around 65% for the year, and slightly less than the first half as we make progress on the MyDay ramp-up, specifically around reengineering current equipment for MyDay.","We continue to expect efficiencies in manufacturing process, positive impact due to Biofinity, offset by MyDay and currency, especially the pound impact on manufacturing as we look at rates up into the 1.64 range. As we stated in the past, just under 50% of our production value is produced in the U.K.","OpEx, we're expecting around 43%. Amortization at $28 million for the year, with around $7.4 million in Q1 and Q2 and Q3 and Q4 would each be about $6.7 million.","R&D is expected to grow slightly faster than revenues. Operating margin is expected to be around 22%, interest expense to be around $8 million, our effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 8.5% to 10.5%. Our earnings per share, as Bob mentioned, for GAAP and non-GAAP is expected to be in a range of $6.70 to $7.","Finally, we expect capital expenditures and free cash flow for the year to be above $200 million.","With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session.","Kim Duncan","Operator, we're now ready to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Bob, I just want to go back to your comments on the 25% operating margin in fiscal '18. And Greg, you laid out a plan here of maybe 130, 140 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal '14. So from fiscal '14 to fiscal '18, Bob, obviously, you're going to have a lot of moving parts as MyDay becomes an even bigger part of the mix. You obviously have some things coming off on the IP side and also on the amortization side. But wondering, as you paint the picture going from 20%, 20.5% this past year to 25%, is it up a pretty consistent 100, 150 basis points a year each of the next 5 years? Or when we get beyond fiscal '14, is there risk that we may be flat now that the margin line for year or 2 with MyDay has a bigger impact before then seeing a nice a kind of tick up from there?","Robert S. Weiss","Jeff, I think it's going to be -- I don't want to say smooth, but 2015 should be an okay year relative to 2014 and then when you move into 2016 likewise you have some favorable events. So as I see it, it's maybe not a straight line going up from 20% to 25%. But it shouldn't be a hockey stick, meaning we hang out at 21.5% to 22% until the last 2 years, that's not the way I see it. I see it improving somewhat every year.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jon Block from Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I guess, maybe I'll just try to wrap this up in one question. Can you just speak a little bit, Bob, to MyDay? It's been out there in Europe, the pricing. And then you talked a little bit about manufacturing. It seems like hitting the gas there, you now have approval in hand with the U.S., but you're seeing strong demand in Europe. So can you talk to -- is Europe pushing out the U.S. because you want to make sure that you're feeding those mouths? Or you're trying to hit the gas even come to the U.S. sooner?","Robert S. Weiss","Jon, we're obviously very pleased with the progress we're making in Europe, and following good military guidelines, you don't overextend yourself and then tick off everyone. So Europe is obviously in the queue first up. And suffice it to say, that means depending on how Europe is going will influence the timing in the U.S. Having said that, on the other front, on the supply end, we're doing everything we can do to accelerate within reason the production side, and obviously, because of the long lead times somewhat problematic to just kind of wish it all here to mark and it's just not going to happen. But Europe is doing very well. The gold award at the SILMO Conference, best product there, we gave it a better shot on the arm. One of the things we did do is deliberately round out the product portfolio, which means build out the plus powers, as well as the minus powers. And that obviously was done with the intent of giving the customer a better product line to pick from and it did cost us short-term in terms of yields, it cost us short-term in terms of cost of goods. We just think there is the right kind of decisions to make. But to answer your question about the timing into the U.S., we'll probably get here sometime next year. But at #1, it won\u2019t be robust. #2, it is somewhat influenced by Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Just a question on the MyDay, and what that product kind of looks like going forward. For gross margins to kind of get into the -- maybe let's just say 40% to 50% range where other 1 Day lenses are. Can you maybe walk through kind of what needs to happen there? Is it just a matter of increasing your capacity and volume for that product? Or do we need some sort of kind of break through the manufacturing process in order to get the margins up on that product?","Robert S. Weiss","Steve, I guess I would describe it this way. There are some easy fixes and easy improvements, getting the first -- getting to the right zone, so to speak. So we have a pretty good map of where we are going the next 3 or 4 years by way of improvements in the equipment. We're manufacturing improvements in the yields on the existing lines. When you then get down to the point where maybe you're approaching 40% margins, moving the next 10 gets a bit more challenging, and you have to find those ideas sooner rather than later if you're going to alter some of the equipment or modify the equipment. So it's very much like the description of 20% OI, going into 25, it's going to happen in steps along the way. But directionally, it will -- we'll get a good way down the path.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kim Gailun from JPMorgan.","Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Question on MyDay, at what revenue level do you think that MyDay becomes operating margin-neutral? Yes, you talked about some of the gross margin ramp that you're expecting in '14, but I also imagine you're going to be spending on sales and marketing behind the MyDay rollout. So at what level should we think about that becoming a product that's closer to kind of operating margin neutral relative to the corporate average?","Robert S. Weiss","Kim, many products that we roll out like this, be it Proclear 1 Day, be it Biofinity, quite frankly for several years, didn't make operating profit. And for sure today, it makes operating profit. We're going to look at how much muscle at any point in time we have by way of capacity and how many markets we have available to dictate that. So my expectation is that it is unlikely we will be making profits on MyDay the next several years with the intent of continuing to develop that franchise, continuing to drive down cost of goods, but we'll be putting a fair amount of muscle as the capacity increases behind the product once we come to the U.S. and then once we go into other markets around the world. So it isn't -- if we wanted to make money, clearly, we could kind of map out the European model, invest 1 year and start reaping profits as early as 2 years from now, but I don't think that's the right model and I truly hope that the product has more legs so that we have investment opportunities even post the 2-year period. So I don't want to assign any $1 amount and say, chief, if we get to $100 million, we arrive at profitability. Cost will be coming down, no doubt, as you ramp up and it's $100 million product line instead of a $25 million product line, but there are other valuables that we'll consider in drawing that line.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien from William Blair.","Kaila Krum","It's Kaila in for Matt. First off, I was wondering to get a little bit more color on the channel inventory issues that occurred this quarter. And if you can just help us understand, what gives you the confidence that those issues won't linger into 2014?","Robert S. Weiss","Kaila, good question. The confidence we really have is, a year ago, some of you may remember we had a reduction in channel inventory, and that reduction was around 20% in the authorized distributors here in the United States. I'm talking principally about the U.S. now. And so we assume that, that probably would be where it would settle out. Then during the course of this year, the merger came along, off the 2 largest distributors, or certainly our 2 largest distributors in the United States. And we kind of knew maybe something would happen that would, they had different model and we weren't sure which model would preempt which and in what time frame and what the implication would be. So it turns out we found out at the end of the fourth quarter that those levels were going to come down to a pretty tight level. It's our best view that that's where it's going to settle out. That means that in 2013, we really lost arguably 1 to 2 weeks of sales to distributors in the year, and therefore, we quite frankly have slightly easier comp in 2014 than we do in 2013 as a result of that phenomena. But we think based on what we saw in November and month to date in December that we have a handle on the fact that they got it down to the level they want and its business as usual going forward.","Kaila Krum","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on MyDay, you've mentioned that $25 million estimate in 2014. Does that assume any sort of contribution from the U.S. next year?","Robert S. Weiss","No. Nominal.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'm trying to understand if the items in the fourth quarter that hurt you by $0.30 on the EPS line, we should see them as onetime or not? And if they're onetime, then your EPS would have been about $6.26 for the year and the guidance for 2014, then the implied guidance will be 7% to 12% growth, not the low double digits that you said in the third quarter call. So if you could help me understand that, that would be helpful. And Bob, on the gross margin, I heard the 65% for 2014 in the guidance and then I heard obviously, your commentary earlier. Can you talk about what -- how is the gross margin progression looks over the next few years given some of the headwinds and tailwinds even directionally, do you think the gross margin can go up or should we kind of model it flat for the next few years?","Robert S. Weiss","As far as how much is reoccurring and how much is not reoccurring, clearly, things like the authorized distributor shrinkage in 2013 should not repeat and should be viewed as nonrecurring. So that's kind of a step up of be it -- in a $0.10-plus or minus. So that gets you, if you will, from $5.95 to $6.05. When it comes to those things surrounding MyDay, that is not black and white. Some of it was onetime, within that pot, such as taking a machine down and retooling it for the MyDay operation. Some of that will, if you will, once you get into production away. Having said that, some of that activity continues into 2014. So there will be some repeating of some of the events in the fourth quarter into 2014, which is built into our full year guidance. So I think the comp is not at either extreme, not at $5.95 compared to, let's say, the midpoint of $6.85, just to pick a number within that range, nor is it at the -- I add $0.30 to the $5.95 and then do the comps. It's some place in the middle of 30 and then 0. On the second question of gross margins, where did they go from here? There are a number of moving parts, there's no doubt the royalty, there's no doubt things like depreciation, there's no doubt MyDay. There is no doubt the remnants of foreign exchange, which have played havoc on us in the last 2 years. How you look forward, the 65 going down the road to 2018, some of that will be the more successful we are with MyDay, the more pressure we obviously put on that gross margin going forward. And I think I've indicated several times, I really don't care if it turns out to be 1 Day is 50% of our portfolio, our gross margin undoubtedly will be lower than 65%. And I kind of hope that happens because it obviously is good for our operating income line and not only the top line growth but the operating income growth. So I would assume that the 65 going forward has some potential pressure on it if we're extremely successful with MyDay. Beyond that, if it's kind of middle-of-the-road, we have a fair amount of good things going that may minimize some of the mix issues by MyDay. Whether or not that leads to 65 or some modestly lower, I don't know quite frankly.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","The channel inventory situation, which segment of CVI did that impact the most? And do we assume that the entire rolloff that happened in the fourth quarter comes completely back on? And then my second question is, is the operating margin for CSI don't really seem to be recovering from the Origio acquisition. And can you talk about plans to help that move forward too?","Robert S. Weiss","First of all, on the channel inventory, which comes from CVI U.S., and I think we indicated that a fair amount what that distributor gets, which is the U.S. profile, if you will, of products, excluding the limited volume SKU for torics, for example, which we shipped direct and they don't go through the distributors. So our large distributor takes the entire breadth of the U.S. product line of CooperVision x the stock keeping units that don't make sense to carry at that level. As far as the impact, the impact was on the fourth quarter. We are expecting that, that level, that new level of inventory on hand will stay quarter-by-quarter hereafter, which is to say, no new collapse, no new comeback. It's not going to step up, it's not going to step down, it's going to stay steady-state, that's our underlying assumption. There is some modest tweaking that goes on within the quarterly cycles for cyclical reasons, but it is fairly modest, it's nothing like what we're talking about at year end. As far as the operating margins of CooperSurgical, will they rebound to where they were pre-Origio? Origio, number one, is a very global acquisition. And as you go global, building out that structure, it's going to operate a little less efficiently by nature than having a U.S.-centric business where make it in the U.S., ship it in the U.S., that's all there is. So that's one downward pressure. Second thing is, we continue to invest in Origio as it builds itself out globally, and grew 24% this last quarter. And as long as it's putting up good growth numbers, we will continue to invest and not try to reap the profits on that. The one thing we do have in mind, however, is ultimately fine-tuning its production process, I guess, in a sense of product mix and profitability on the gross margin line. And I would hope that as we look forward over the next several years, we improve somewhat on its gross margin.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla from Citigroup.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two quick ones for Greg. Greg, just number one, share count guidance for '14. And second on Aime. I just want to reconcile on a non-GAAP basis the charge and the impact on revenues into earnings to the fourth quarter based on Aime.","Gregory W. Matz","Okay, Amit. The first thing, the share count is 49.5. And so for Aime, if you look at Aime, there are a couple of pieces, one, the charge was, the $21.1 million we mentioned. It had for the fourth quarter, $0.28 impact. For the year, it's $0.26 and that difference is really around taxes. There was a tax true up in there so -- and you actually had some additional $0.05 of tax true up in the quarter. So if you look at the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP, you see $0.33 and that really is an additional $0.05 on top of the $0.28 Aime. Or it's a typical tax true-up at the end of the year. You estimate your rate throughout the year. Once you hit your end, finish your provision, you're able to go back in and exactly hit what your tax rate will be. So nothing unusual.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, does that conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's call. I'll now turn the call back over to Bob Weiss for closing remarks.","Robert S. Weiss","Well, thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. We are obviously very excited as we look down the road to 2014. I think you can tell that from our guidance, we're feeling pretty bullish about what is going through the pipeline. We're very bullish about MyDay, and look forward to talking to you a lot more on our first quarter conference call about our progress in some of these areas as we go forward.","With that, I think our next conference call is on March 6, if I have it right, of 2014, which is a Thursday.

Weiss","Thank you, Elizabeth, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and good evening in some cases.","Well, a few financial highlights. A solid way to start the new year, top line growth of 7%, 11% in constant currency excluding the divestiture of Aime. GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.47 and non-GAAP earnings per share is up 20% versus the prior year's first quarter.","Some highlights and key events. During the quarter, we continued to gain market share and grow at 2x the market. Our silicone hydrogels are posting -- posted $154 million in revenue. Were up 30% in constant currency in the fourth quarter or in the full first quarter. Our rollout of MyDay, most notably in Europe, proceeds to plan. Our manufacturing ramp up of MyDay is also proceeding to plan, if not slightly, ahead of plan.","The depth of our top line growth is broad-based. All regions, all modalities, all types of lenses, spheres, torics and multifocals, in both hydrogels and silicone hydrogels. We delivered a solid top line, a solid gross profit percent, a solid operating margin and a solid earnings per share. We took the opportunity to continue opportunistically buying our shares -- buying in another 396,000 shares for $50 million.","At $326 million, CooperVision revenues put up a solid top line results in the first quarter. Excluding the effects of the divestiture of Aime, our CooperVision sales were up 14% in constant currency versus the prior year.","Our silicone hydrogel family continue to drive our top line. With revenues of $154 million, our silicone hydrogels were up 30% in constant currency. Our silicone hydrogel family is now very deep. Monthly which is Biofinity; 2 weeks, Avaira and now, the daily disposable MyDay.","All modalities performed well even our non-silicone hydrogel products performed well. Our Proclear family, led by daily disposables was up 12% in constant currency and accounts for 25% of CooperVision's revenues.","By lens type, we also kept our momentum with torics accounting for 31% of CooperVision's revenues, up 12% in constant currency. And multifocal is now 10% of CooperVision revenues, up 24%. We continue to lead the market in these more specialized categories.","When it comes to the fastest-growing modality, daily disposables or single-use lenses, we put up stellar numbers with single-use spheres, up 14% in constant currency and overall single-use, up 19%.","Geographically, CooperVision's foreign exchange headwinds continue reducing our revenues, down 3% in the quarter. Excluding foreign exchange and the Aime divestiture, our CooperVision revenues growth was 14% in constant currency.","The biggest headwind is still the year-over-year comps on the yen, which was down 21% versus the prior year. With $200 million of revenue in Japan, this certainly is a drag, but one that should moderate starting in the second quarter.","From a revenues perspective, we have put up solid constant currency growth in all regions. Our growth drivers are in the Americas trading up to Biofinity including the ongoing halo effect of Biofinity multifocal with the entire family doing well. Also while much smaller base Proclear 1 Day and the Avaira Toric and Sphere family are significant contributors.","In Europe, right now, the euro is helping offset some of the yen, driving our 13% constant currency growth is the -- in this region is the entire Biofinity family, 1 Day is including MyDay and Avaira.","In Asia Pacific, while foreign exchange took its toll on revenues in constant currency -- our constant currency revenue was up 17% excluding Aime.","The Biofinity family, with strong support both Biofinity Toric and Biofinity Multifocal and single-use led by Proclear 1 Day, are key drivers. In the Asia-Pac, torics and multifocals are key drivers by lens type.","Worldwide [indiscernible] -- soft contact lens market in the fourth quarter of 2013 calendar quarter was up 6% in constant currency while CooperVision was up 13%.","For the calendar 2013, the soft contact lens market now $7.5 billion worldwide was up 5% in constant currency. CooperVision was up 11% on the strength of Biofinity and Proclear 1 Day and by lens type, torics and multifocals.","For the calendar fourth quarter, the market growth was sponsored by 1 Day, now 43% of the soft contact lens revenue dollars worldwide. While industry growth is not currently available on silicone hydrogel material, this trade-up material is most likely the growth driver and we believe silicone hydrogel accounts for about 48% in the soft contact lens revenues worldwide. CooperVision is currently at 47% of silicone hydrogel revenue dollars.","Soft contact lens market continues to be a trade up market. This includes the premium products silicone hydrogels, torics and multifocals. The trade up to the 1 Day disposable expands revenue per patient by 400% to 600%. Even more important, the 1 Day wearer generates 300% to 500% more profit. Also it's important to understand that torics and multifocals have a long way to go in terms of capturing the market opportunity, especially outside the United States.","Geographically, the Americas divest up 8% in the calendar quarter on the strength of the 1 Day trade up and a strong showing from silicone hydrogel, torics and multifocals. Asia-Pac delivered 6% growth, aided by a strong showing of silicone hydrogel lenses; and in Europe, was up 5% for the same reasons.","Looking at CooperSurgical. I want to talk to our franchise. It turned in a slightly positive revenue performance in the quarter. We were pleased with the continued strength of top line growth in fertility, which was up 15% above the prior year. Our fertility business now accounts for 35% of our CSI franchise.","With our office in surgical space, we continue to run into industry headwinds caused by the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, if you will. Having said that, the negative 6% we reported is not truly reflective of that business as we had some orders we typically received in the first quarter get placed in the second quarter. This would have brought our office in surgical sales closer to a flat quarter.","For the year, we believe we will see moderate top line growth for CooperSurgical with gross margins similar to last year and operating margins expanding to some operating expense leverage. Overall, CooperSurgical continues to be approximately 20% of our overall local business.","Looking at guidance. We continue to increase our earnings per share by raising a lower end and narrowed our revenue guidance initially provided on our year end earnings call. This guidance reflects our successes in the first quarter, including $0.04 benefit of our buying of almost 400,000 of our shares in the open market in the first quarter.","MyDay, our new 1 Day silicone hydrogel being rolled out in Europe and in Australia and New Zealand, is marching to plan and we're continuing to expect around $25 million in revenue this fiscal year limited only by capacity constraints.","Our strategy, we continue to -- we are continuing with our successful strategy, which I frequently articulated in the past. We believe it's a solid one and it has delivered results. CooperSurgical is putting up solid results and is leveraging its infrastructure. The franchise was built with solid understanding of the value of critical mass in the women's health care market, targeting the OB\/GYNs.","We follow the professional wherever they go, office, surgery center, hospital or IVF centers. Although the call points are different for each, the leverage is considerable, CooperSurgical's first quarter gross profit percent was 63%, operating margin was 18%. And due to minimal capital requirements, CooperSurgical is a significant contributor to our free cash flow. We are dedicated to this strategy and we'll continue tuck in, in non-U.S. acquisitions to leverage CooperSurgical structure and products.","At CooperVision, the strategy is more complex and is much more global in nature. The $7.5 billion soft contact lens industry, because of the uniqueness of our manufacturing platforms, we are the only company that participates with a very broad and very deep product portfolio.","Just to crystallize this point. CooperVision aggressively promotes silicone hydrogel and non-silicone hydrogel, which is the Proclear family. CooperVision emphasizes branded and non-branded products, note private label does not mean lower operating margins.","Already, we actively promote specialized custom lenses with a high gross profit percent, I might add. We support all modalities. The eye care professional prescribes 1 Day, 2-week and monthly lenses and we support all types of lenses: spheres, torics and multifocals with approximately 30% of our share in the high-growth areas, specialty lens categories: torics and multifocals. It is acknowledged by eye care professionals and we're pretty good at specialty contact lenses.","Few eye care professionals would challenge why the success of Biofinity Toric for astigmatism. Put a great design together with a great material and great things can happen. We have seen similar successes for that same reason with Biofinity Multifocal, which first hit the market in the middle of calendar year 2011, almost 3 years ago.","On the capacity front, we are capable of delivering considerable more product, where we had then previously supplied constraint. The Biofinity family, Proclear 1 Day and our 1 Day toric, and all -- are all in good capacity shape. Our newest endeavor is now ramping up MyDay, our 1 Day silicone hydrogel.","On pricing, we, like the rest of the soft contact lens industry, have a trade-up strategy, our new wares and existing wares are targeted for silicone hydrogel and Proclear family and 1 Day or single-use lenses. Each creates more revenue per patient. A 1 Day modality, for example, results in a 4x to 6x more in revenue per wear. While this strategy sacrifices the gross profit margin, that is percent, it generally creates 3x to 5x more profit per wear.","Of course, the strategy competes head-on with the lens care space since we are shifting resources from lens care to contact lenses only. Competing for lens care dollars is more a problem with some of our competitors. In my opinion, we continue to be the most focused company in the industry, lacking many of the distractions that some of the -- of our competitors are now going through. I might add, with Biofinity, Avaira, Proclear and MyDay, we have a lot to talk about with eye care professionals around the globe.","As we look down the road over the next several years, we expect to continue improving our operating margins and delivering above-average shareholder returns. We expect to continue to average double-digit earnings per share growth, while investing in geographic expansion and new product development.","In today's markets, we have a solid product portfolio to leverage in all modalities, multiple materials, all lens types and we retain our expertise to emphasize customizing lenses for the 10% to 20% of those wearers requiring other than standard lens sizes and\/or designs. We have a lot of work to do before we come anywhere close to having exploited our #1 contact [ph] lens family, Biofinity. This is particularly true when it comes to geographic expansion and fully developing the Biofinity family of torics and multifocals around the globe.","The same applies to Avaira, where the Avaira sphere was anxiously awaiting the launch of Avaira Toric. This combination has now put us in a much better position to exploit the U.S. 2-week space owned by Johnson & Johnson and to exploit our private label strategy more aggressively with this family.","While we already have a pretty respectable gross profit and operating margins, from a cost perspective, we have considerable upside yet to be fully developed.","Upsides include the elimination of silicone hydrogel royalty with the expiration of patents, a reduction of our manufacturing cost buy, among other things, improving, molding cycle times, increasing capacity utilization and improving yields in general. Each of these are key goals for us. And as previously mentioned, our expansion plans include a lower cost labor location in Costa Rica that is now being built. This is a multi-year project that will further help us manage down our cost.","Also, given the considerable amount of free cash flow we generate, we will continue to look for tuck-in acquisitions and geographic expansion opportunities like Origio in our 2 businesses. The key requirements, however, is that each of the acquisitions must exceed our minimum investment hurdle rates. Each must achieve, over time, a hurdle rate that exceeds 10%.","Additionally, the markets for both women's health care and soft contact lenses are much less developed outside the U.S., and we generate a considerable amount of cash offshore to impart to our level of manufacturing outside of the U.S. As such, we will continue to aggressively invest in global expansion opportunities. With over 95% of the people on the planet outside the U.S., we believe we will find opportunities to invest in other countries for decades to come, thereby, sustaining a low effective tax rate indefinitely.","And finally, we again, this year, demonstrated we are opportunistically willing to buy in our stock to maximize total shareholder return.","In summary, before I turn it over to Greg, let me say how pleased I am with our progress. We continue to outperform the marketplace more than 2x in -- market growth in 2012 and 2013 and almost 2x over the last 5 years.","Our market share gains are deep, covering all geographies, modalities, lens types, lens materials and are both branded and private label. Our family of products like Biofinity, Avaira, Proclear, 1 Day and MyDay, as well as fertility and women's health care have very promising continuing growth potential in the United States and throughout the rest of the world. We believe our optimism is with good reason.","Because of our solid gross profit percent performance, we have been able to continue investing in geographic expansion, sales force expansion and R&D the past the 5 years. Our improving operating income margins have been cost -- driven, leaving room to invest. Our balance sheet and our free cash flow are strong and we will continue to fund each of these areas, as well as capital expansion North of $200 million.","Being a player in the 1 Day soft contact lens market requires commitment to capital. Not everyone will play. Today, this market is over $3 billion and growing double-digit.","Given the 4x to 6x trade up of the 1 Day conversion, we are more than willing to trade off our gross profit percent for the added profits per patient of a 1 Day wearer, but we remain committed to our 2018 objective of 25% operating income and related earnings per share growth impact.","We remain keenly focused on delivering improving results, mindful of our desire to invest and leverage prudently, thereby, delivering optimized long-term total shareholder returns. I might add, we purchased cumulatively 2.8 million shares of our stock the past 3 years at an average cost of $103. We have done this opportunistically with our strong balance sheet and free cash flow, so our focus is on delivering bottom line total shareholder returns.","Lastly, as always, a reminder that at Cooper, our #1 asset is our employees. To them, I express my appreciation for their dedication to creating value and delivering results.","And now, I'll turn it over to Greg to cover some of the financial results.","Gregory W. Matz","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Bob shared with you a pretty thorough review of the market and our revenue picture.","Now let me start with gross margins. Looking at gross margins. In Q1, the consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 64.9% compared with 63.3% for GAAP and non-GAAP in Q1 last year. We continue to see strong headwinds year-over-year due to the impact of foreign exchange, predominantly the yen, on our revenue and the related direct impact on gross margins, which had approximately an 80 basis-point impact year-over-year.","We are continuing to see an impact to margins for approximately 95 basis points due to MyDay, somewhat equally split between mix, impact and start-up cost. As we discussed in the past, this product will have low to no margins earlier in the year, but will exit the year in a high-single digit margin range, which is normally in a start-up phase where you're building capacity. Helping to offset the headwinds has been favorable product mix, led by the Biofinity family and the CIBA royalty savings, which started in January 2013.","At CooperVision, on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, we reported a gross margin of 65.4% versus 63.1% for GAAP and non-GAAP in Q1 last year. Factors impacting gross margin in the quarter, as I just mentioned, are the currency headwinds of MyDay, other favorable product mix and the CIBA royalty savings.","CooperSurgical had a GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin of 63.1%, which compares to Q1 '13 of 64.1%. Fertility with lower margins will continue to put pressure on our gross margin, as that part of the business continues to become a larger part of their mix. But we still expect CooperSurgical's margins to be around 64% for the year.","Now looking at operating expenses. SG&A in the quarter on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses increased by approximately 5% from Q1 last year to $158.1 million, and were 39% of revenue, down from 40% in the prior year. SG&A was up less than 1% sequentially.","Now looking at R&D. In Q1, R&D increased by approximately 15% year-over-year to $15.7 million, or up $2.1 million. R&D was 3.9% of revenue, up from 3.6% of revenue in Q1 '13 and 3.8% sequentially.","We continue to expect R&D to grow faster than sales for fiscal 2014.","Depreciation and amortization. In Q1, depreciation was $23.9 million, down $265,000 or 1% year-over-year, and amortization was $7.5 million, up $136,000 or 2% year-over-year, for a total of $31.4 million.","Moving to operating margins. For Q1, consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP operating income and margin were $81.6 million and 20.2% of revenue versus $68.8 million and 18.1% of revenue for GAAP and $69.4 million and 18.3% of revenue for non-GAAP in the first quarter last year. This represents almost a 19% increase in operating income over the prior year GAAP numbers.","In Q1, CooperVision had GAAP to non-GAAP operating income and margin of $84.1 million and 25.8% of revenue compared, with the GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 '13 of 22.3%. This year-over-year improvement comes from a combination of improvement in gross margins and leverage in SG&A. Operating income grew 25.5%.","CSI is -- for surgicals, GAAP and non-GAAP operating income and margin were $14.2 million and 18% of revenue, compared to margins of 17.9% for GAAP and 18.7% for non-GAAP in the prior year. Operating income grew approximately 1% year-over-year on a GAAP basis but was down approximately 3.5% on a non-GAAP basis.","Interest expense was $1.7 million for the quarter, down 36% year-over-year. As a reminder, included in our Q1 '13 GAAP numbers, under gain on insurance proceeds, is $14.1 million of insurance proceeds for business interruption related to an October 28, 2011 incident in our U.K. facility.","In other expenses included in the other income loss categories, approximately $900,000 of FX losses versus roughly $600,000 gain last year. Over the quarter, we experienced relatively sizeable currency moves that resulted in some FX losses associated with our intercompany loan, some of which are in restricted currencies which are difficult and expensive to hedge. We do our best to minimize these types of losses or gains through our balance sheet hedging program, but we do experience fluctuations every quarter so we will always see some gains or losses.","And looking at the effective tax rate. In Q1, the GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate was 9.1% versus Q1 '13 GAAP effective tax rate of 7.5% and non-GAAP effective tax rate of 9.2%. As we've mentioned before, the effective tax rate continues to be below the U.S. statutory rate. And is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower taxes. We continue to expect the full year GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates to be in the 8.5% to 10.5% range.","Looking at earnings per share, our Q1 earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was $1.47 versus $1.50 and $1.23 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in Q1 '13, respectively. GAAP EPS is down $0.03 over the prior year, largely due to the $0.28 favorable impact due to the business interruption insurance proceeds, which were shown in 2013 GAAP earnings but excluded from non-GAAP earnings. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS is up $0.24 versus the prior year.","During Q1, as Bob mentioned, we repurchased approximately 396,000 shares with an average share value of $126.21 per share for a total cost of $50 million. This leaves the remaining $211.5 million available for future share repurchases under the current approved plan. There was no impact on EPS for Q1 due to our Q1 share repurchases, but we expect a $0.04 impact for the year.","Looking at FX. Regarding the foreign exchange, currency continues to have an impact on our business. From a year-over-year perspective for Q1, currency negatively impacted us by $0.14 and this was mainly driven by the yen, which was down 21% year-over-year.","At the current FX rate, we now expect an approximate $0.22 negative FX impact on EPS in 2014, with the majority of the remaining impact actually hitting in fiscal Q4. This is reflecting the impact of the strengthening of the pound in our U.K. production cost and the impact to our P&L based on our inventory turns as we've discussed in the past. Net-net though, keep in mind, this currency impact is pretty similar to what we hit when we gave our initial annual guidance in December.","For today's guidance, we used rates of 1.38 for euro, 1.03 for the yen and 1.67 for the pound.","Looking at balance sheet liquidity. In Q1, we had cash provided by operations of $68.6 million, capital expenditures of $61 million and insurance proceeds of $1.4 million, resulting in $9 million of free cash flow.","Total debt increases in the quarter by $1.1 million to $345.7 million. We now have approximately $1 billion of total credit available as of January 31. Inventories are basically flat at $339 million from the last quarter. For the quarter, we're seeing months on hand at 7.2 months, up from months on hand of 7 months last year and 6.9 months last quarter.","Accounts receivable continues to be well-managed with DSOs at 53 days. Same as the prior quarter and down from 58 days last year.","Looking at guidance for the remainder of the year. Bob mentioned that we raised the bottom of the revenue range by $10 million and dropped the top of the range by a similar amounts. The full year revenue range for the company is now $1.685 billion to $1.725 billion. CooperVision's revenue range is $1.365 billion to $1.395 billion. Finally, CSI's revenue range is $320 million to $330 million. Regarding earnings per share guidance, we raised the bottom of our earnings slightly and both GAAP and non-GAAP is now $6.75 to $7.","Quickly covering our annual guidance, there are no changes from December. Gross margin percent still expected to be around 65%. OpEx, we're still expecting around 43%. Operating margin around 22% and the effective tax rate in the range of 8.5% to 10.5%. We are expecting the share count to be around 49.5 million shares. In addition, free cash flow and CapEx are still expected to be greater than $200 million.","With that, let me turn it back to Elizabeth for the Q&A session.","Elizabeth Bremner","Operator, we'll now take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird.","Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So let me ask 2 quick questions here. One's about -- on competition. A lot of noise out there over the last couple of months on competition, some of us think it's maybe somewhat normal, maybe a little bit higher than normal here, but nothing too egregious. Others maybe thinking it's a bigger year on the competitive front. I would like your take, just not necessarily asking which competitors or anything specific like that, but just how you view the competitive environment going into 2014? And then also on the daily business, just on your daily disposable business, if I back out an assumption on MyDay of a few -- $3 million to $5 million or so, it looks like the rest of your daily business may be growing mid-, slightly above mid-single digits. So is that a sign that MyDay is cannibalizing your Dailies business or just how should we think about MyDay being incremental versus cannibalizing some of your current Daily business?","Robert S. Weiss","Well, as far as competition, the concern, I would say, it's, in 2014, looks to be as active as the past. I would say noticeably more or less. We had a lot of good products come out with some of our competitors over the last 5, 6 years and I would speculate the only thing that shifts is who's making the most noise in a given year, and clearly, we have kind of a new entrant, if you will, in the U.S., but one that's been around for really 20 years in Europe. And there's a couple of these products from companies that have been less active in the last 10 years. When you put it all together, I know that it noticeably changes much other than maybe the market upticks a little bit more because I think we're all getting a little better at the trade-up strategy to 1 Day and now, it's the silicone hydrogel 1 Days, which is seen even a bigger trade-up. As far as cannibalization with MyDay, we kind of looked at that, thought about it and we know where the majority of -- by far the majority of the revenue is coming from new fits and competitive products. So very little by way of cannibalization occurring.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","It's a little bit of a similar but different question if there is such a thing on Dailies. I was going to ask, in the U.S., Bob, if you feel like the Proclear 1 Days may face, if you can just sort of walk us through, if they may face some modest headwinds over the next several quarters until MyDay is out there. In other words, are you seeing some of the Proclear 1 Days move to a competitive U.S. sight high [ph] lens only because you guys don't have MyDay in the market yet? And then I've got a quick follow-up, if you would.","Robert S. Weiss","Yes, I think the niche -- it's still a niche market in the U.S. with TruEye and Total1 and they're at the high end, not where one would expect to find Moist and Proclear 1 Day. Proclear 1 Day, I would say, is more at the top end -- let's say at kind of a spot-on location of Moist and then MyDay would be -- which is not relative to the U.S. market but be more nipping at the top end of the Moist. If we kind of divided that pie in half, the top end, top half of the pie. So no, I don't think there's much of an impact at this juncture with 1 Day silicone hydrogels in the U.S. market on Proclear 1 Day.","Jonathan D. Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Okay and then just as a quick follow-up, you mentioned MyDay and feeling good or maybe a little bit better on the manufacturing side. And can you maybe give us a little bit more detail there? In other words, is that specific to your ability to ramp manufacturing capacity or is it the thought that maybe you're doing something better on the cost side of things in that high-single digit gross margin exiting '14 might inch up? Any kind detail you can give on MyDay manufacturing would be great.","Robert S. Weiss","Yes. The rollout of MyDay in 2014, 2015 is totally capacity-driven and that's what capped us off at $25 million in terms of that expectation in 2014 and we're still feeling very good about that number, mainly because it looks like we will be able to deliver on supply side enough to deliver that revenue number and maybe a small bit more, but not enough to take to the bank. So all is going well on the capacity roll-out front. On the yield curve, we talk about entering the year, the first half being in the low singles, and the second half being the upper singles, and then moving into the teens next year. That all is looking very promising. Timeline's getting equipment in, getting it production-quality as we [indiscernible] is going on schedule and the yield learning curve is on schedule and maybe slightly better. So there in our -- my little comment about being maybe a little ahead even on the manufacturing side, which would be good news.","Operator","And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Guys, just 2 for me. On MyDay, can you give us any sense of what you think 2015 will look like beyond the $25 million in 2014? I'm just trying to understand if you think you'll have a significant additional capacity by fiscal 2015 if we should assume a ramp? And secondly, we have heard that the weather did have an impact in January and February on the U.S. contact lens market. Can you give us any color around what you're seeing in January and February?","Robert S. Weiss","First, Tom, on the question on MyDay ramp-up rollout in 2015. We expect to be able to triple our 2014 number, meaning 25, going up to around 75. Once again capacity limited, but that's a function of number of lines coming on board. And with that, we would then of course enter the U.S. market beyond just in 2014. As you see, the product in the U.S. will be mainly with key opinion leaders, just a handful of them, not much more than that. So it's still restricted to mainly Europe and, to a lesser extent, New Zealand and Australia. As far as the weather, the weather we kind of monitored. I'm sure you're -- -- you're right, we've certainly have heard some limitations caused by the weather and we certainly know, watching the news, that a lot of shops weren't open in the Southeast when Atlanta got shut down a few days, and then it go it again. So there's no doubt that took a modest impact on the contact lenses space, as well as our revenues. Having said that, our numbers were robust enough. I don't think we're really saw the impact of those impact our P&L. So therein we didn't make much of a statement about it.","Operator","The next question comes from Larry Keusch with Raymond James.","Lawrence S. Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I guess 2 here. First one, Bob, again just coming back to MyDay. When you went to the change in the manufacturing to go to the higher powers, as you did in the fourth quarter, you sort of went negative margins. I just wanted to confirm that you're back positive margins on the production here. And then secondly, you showed really nice leverage on the SG&A line, certainly growing substantially less than the top line. And I just wanted to get a sense of what's driving that and how sustainable that this through the year.","Robert S. Weiss","On the first comment on the gross margin of MyDay is -- has moved into that low single-digits or single-digit arena, aside from the fact that when we did take lines down and ramped them back up, the second lines for example, as we called it, the galactic line, there was idle equipment during that period of time, so there is a charge in the P&L. In addition, let's say, if you were to overlay that into MyDay, MyDay would have a net loss on the gross margin line when considering idle equipment and start-up cost on the second line. When we look to the line-making product and selling product, we are in that single-digit arena. On the SG&A commentary, yes, we're getting some leverage albeit modestly so in terms of ramping up. Greg, I'll kind of defer, if you want to add anything to that.","Gregory W. Matz","I think the only thing I would add is that we're aware that as our gross margin improvement has slowed, that we've been talking for the last year that we need to get that in SG&A, and there are focused efforts to look and be mindful of SG&A. So I think we're seeing some of that work.","Operator","The next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Jefferies Group.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just going back to MyDay as well and maybe just to revisit margins there for a bit. Understanding that margins on the product are in that low single-digit range but sort of as you look out and we look into the next 2, 3 years, can you just give maybe a feel of where margins can go on that product over time and sort of when do you see that product eventually becoming margin-accretive to the business?","Robert S. Weiss","My expectation is that this is a 3-year rollout of investing first year in Europe, 2014; second year in the U.S., 2015; and the third year in Japan and Asia, 2016. During the period of time, margins will move from single-digit this year into the teens, upper teens next year. The normalized margins, I would expect, post-year 3 and then you'll get in to the 40s, and ultimately, we should get in around that 50% neighborhood on gross margins. Operating margins as we get into year 4, by then you start getting a more normalized operating margin contribution from the 1 Day modality, which still should be in the -- some place in the 20s. But the long-term objective, if we look at the model to 2018, and we have 25% operating margins, the success of the 1 Day strategy should not result in any undue push on the operating margin to 25%. However, we'll certainly influence the gross profit percent and its related mix.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up there. Does that CIBA royalty, I mean how much does the CIBA royalty run off by the end -- by 2016 in total to the business, sort of play into those figures?","Robert S. Weiss","Well, what we've said on the CIBA royalty runoff is that it's going to certainly be part of the equation going from 21% last year to 25% in 2018. We're going to take some of that and spend it on certain areas, R&D and geographic expansion. But that we, between leveraging the P&L, a favorable shift on the continuing growth of Biofinity, which is a very high gross margin, and will help to keep our gross margins reasonable in this 5-year period, that we have enough strings to pull in terms of operating expense leverage to get to the 25%. The other variable, you have the royalty is one, you have the runoff of the 10-year anniversary of the Ocular acquisition where amortization drops off as a favorable tailwind. And then you also have some depreciation on the initial equivalent we got with the Ocular acquisition, which is now going to anniversary at 10 years also. So not only amortization, but also depreciation on the first line of equipment. Having said that, we're spending a lot of money on capital equipment, so don't expect to see depreciation in total go down, it will go up as we shift into that 1 Day modality. Net-net, we're -- the royalty is a contributor to that 25% objective.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","Actually just two quick ones for you. So I know last quarter, there was some destocking that was a bit of a headwind. Just wondering if you -- there was any restocking this quarter. And then secondly, I saw on the press release when you guys were talking about cash flow, there was about a $1.4 million insurance recovery. And I was just wondering if that impacted the income statement as well anywhere. And if so, where?","Robert S. Weiss","I'll let Greg answer the second one. But on the first one, the discussion on the -- I'm sorry, distributors at the end of the fourth quarter, no, there was not a rebuild of inventory so they have the same level in terms of stocking levels essentially that they had at the end of the fiscal year, there was no build during the quarter. On the insurance, the $4 million?","Gregory W. Matz","Yes, it was like $1.4 million. That is -- no P&L impact, that's all balance sheet. It was reimbursement for a damaged equipment in that October 2011 U.K. issue where the fire suppression system malfunctioned.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company","And so you already got that back? Because I thought maybe a year ago, you got some of that got back and it positively impacted the GAAP number.","Gregory W. Matz","Yes. The difference was the business interruption insurance. So business interruption insurance hit the P&L on a GAAP basis, and you saw that last year. In fact, in Q1, it was $14.1 million. The reimbursement for the equipment that was damaged, that always went through the balance sheet and there was no P&L impact.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt O'Brien with William Blair.","Kaila Krum","This is Kaila in for Matt. You talked a lot about Biofinity as a growth driver. And so we just wanted to get a better sense and update on the opportunity there as you see it? And particularly in the U.S. with the new competitive launch in the monthly space, I know you touched on the competitive dynamic a bit, but just how you anticipate that will impact your presence here?","Robert S. Weiss","Well, Biofinity has been doing well in the U.S. and throughout the rest of the world. And in this last quarter, it add growth, I want to say, in around 20%, 28% or 24% it was right up there, if you will.","Gregory W. Matz","28%.","Robert S. Weiss","28% constant currency worldwide. Relative to the launch of a monthly fear in the U.S. market, I don't anticipate that we'll see much of a volume, if you will, of that product in 2014. Partly, it's undoubtedly supply limitations on just very much like we have on MyDay where, if you only have 1 line running, it's going to be hard to make a lot of product and your limitations are there. I think the second issue there is, I think there'll be a lot of cannibalization of that product with their franchise products in the same space and that will evolve. And then thirdly, complete lines having a toric and a multifocal, as well as a -- Sphere is an important factor in the monthly modality. Let's just -- on the 1 Day modality, in case you were kind of cherry picking, if you will, but in the monthly space, very important to have the halo effect. And they still don't have that product finalized, let alone in production. So for 2014, maybe into -- close to 2015, I don't think it's a big deal. I'm not convinced from things I've heard from the competitor that's all the money they need to on capital, let alone if they're going to do a two-pronged approach in the monthly, as well as on the daily product group. So I'm not too -- losing too much sleep about it.","Kaila Krum","That makes sense. And then we also just wanted to focus in on the toric result. I know that over the last several quarters, growth in that business has been in the single digits. And it looks to have accelerated this quarter off of a more difficult comparison. We're just curious if there's anything in particular, that's driving that uptick beyond just continued strength in the market?","Robert S. Weiss","No. Torics is doing good particularly outside the U.S. and particularly some of our 1 Day torics has done very well and our Biofinity in Japan as we kind of roll out toric into -- or Biofinity and torics into new areas. So the rest of the world is playing catch-up and I would expect that the toric modality and the multifocal modality are, as a market, doing very well, and we continue to gain share in both of those markets. As far as the one impact in the fourth quarter, we, of course, had a fair amount of Biofinity that went into that authorized distributor, and so that had some impact on the Biofinity family, which would include, to a lesser extent, some torics in that equation. But that would be -- I don't think there's anything unusual year-over-year in terms of our comps on that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Can we spend a minute on CSI, please? This business used to be sort a mid-single digit revenue grower with much higher margins. What brings it back?","Robert S. Weiss","One more time, what's your question?","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Question is about the CSI business. It has to do with the slowdown in the revenue growth rate, as well as the compression in the margins. You touched upon it a little bit in the introduction, but I'm trying to understand what if anything can bring this back?","Robert S. Weiss","Oh, okay. I think what can bring it back is you have a settling in with the cloud of the Affordable Care Act and Obamacare. So there's a lot of -- 2 dynamics going on. One is that Act, one is consolidation within the profession of the OB\/GYN, meaning more women coming into the profession, more men leaving. The older demographic was men that are retiring. The newer demographic, women coming into the profession. They are more inclined to go into group practices. Therefore, if you needed one of a product for each office you need, there are less office fronts, if you will. I think most of that will have leveled out. I think the Affordable Care Act is going to translate to more companies that have one product and do not have critical mass and cannot deal with buying groups, leaving the marketplace and being gobbled up. So I would anticipate a new round of buying opportunities over the next 10 years caused by the Affordable Care Act and the related effects of it. We are in prime positions to be in front of buying groups and large hospitals making a decision for the main hospital, as well as -- the main campus, as well as all the satellite locations. So I do think that will bring it back. One of the important things for Cooper, and part of that model is refreshing. And quite frankly, we'd had some misses on the check the box on refreshing the portfolio, with some new acquisitions over the last 2 years. It's not because we haven't been kicking tires. We just didn't land the right one yet. But we are certainly active in the area of looking and seeing what opportunities come out of the Obamacare environment, if you will. And I would suggest there will be some. So I do think that will bring it back. We are very leverage-able in that model, as it stands.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. As a follow-up, gross margins came in almost at 65% in the first quarter. Your guidance is still 65% for the year, improving MyDay margins should dictate that you have leveraged throughout the year. Is this just a touch of conservatism as you discuss that?","Robert S. Weiss","For that one, I'd take Greg. But I think the pound was the factor in it.","Gregory W. Matz","Yes, one of the things that we're going to see especially the third and fourth quarters, we'll start to see the impact of the pound, the fact that it's been strengthening and 40% of our production happen in U.K., as we've mentioned in the past. And so that will have -- that will put some headwinds on our gross margin in the second half.","Operator","And we have no other questions in the queue, so I'll hand it back to Bob for any closing remarks.","Robert S. Weiss","Well, I want to thank you for all -- joining us on our first call for the new fiscal year. I look forward to updating you on MyDay and other developments for the second quarter on our call that I think it's going to be the 5th of June, if my calendar is correct on a Thursday. So we look forward to updating you at that point in time. And with that, I'll conclude.","Operator","Thanks, everyone, for your time and your participation.

Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Kim, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2016 conference call. We're off to a good start this year and I'm optimistic about our performance as we move forward. Let me start by touching on three key items: First, I'm pleased to report our fiscal first quarter financial results were strong. On a consolidated basis, we reported $450 million in revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.83. We are raising our fiscal 2016 revenue and earnings guidance to reflect this out-performance and to incorporate updated currency rates.","Second, CooperVision posted 4% constant currency revenue growth, which met expectations. As such, we are maintaining our 5% to 7% constant currency revenue guidance for CooperVision for the fiscal year. Third, CooperSurgical had a strong quarter posting revenue growth of 12% or 6% pro forma. This was especially impressive given non-GAAP operating margins expanded 400 basis points over Q1 of last year. As a result of this outperformance, we are raising CooperSurgical's full-year revenue guidance to 15% to 18% or 5% to 8% pro forma.","I'll expand on these items as I walk through this quarter's performance, but suffice it to say I'm proud of where we stand and excited about the future. CooperVision reported Q1 revenues of $364 million, down 1% year over year, but up 4% in constant currency. The Americas were down 3% in constant currency due to the tough comp and aggressive promotional activity by Johnson & Johnson associated with their new daily silicone hydrogel product which we discussed last quarter. Going forward, we expect the Americas to return to more normal growth starting in the second quarter.","Regarding EMEA, sales grew 8% in constant currency. This was despite the Sauflon integration disruptions we discussed on our last earnings call. These disruptions ended in Q1, but resulted in certain customer concessions that reduced results. EMEA growth was driven by a full family of silicone hydrogel products: Biofinity, clariti, MyDay and Avaira. We also had a strong quarter in Asia-Pacific, growing 12% in constant currency, and this growth was also driven by our family of silicone hydrogel products. We expect both these regions to continue performing well going forward.","Within our specialty business, overall toric sales were up 4% year-over-year and multifocals were flat, both in constant currency. This was softer than in the prior quarters due to the Americas where \u2013 which is the largest region for these types of lenses. We remain a global leader in specialty lenses and expect sales to bounce back in Q2 as the Americas returns to growth.","Looking at silicone hydrogel lenses, this family of products delivered a strong growth of 13% in constant currency. Biofinity and Avaira combined to grow 7% in constant currency, with the only weakness being seen in the Americas. And again, we expect the Americas to rebound in Q2. We remain under-indexed in the two-week and monthly silicone hydrogel space, with the market being roughly 77% silicone hydrogels and offset 72%, so we anticipate posting nice growth for many years to come.","Regarding 1-Day silicone hydrogel lenses, sales of clariti and MyDay grew a solid 50% in constant currency. We remain very optimistic about these products and are committed to our growth strategy, which includes a two-tiered approach with clariti positioned as the mass market offering and MyDay as the premium offering. Remember the contact lens market is being driven by 1-Day growth, and we strongly believe we have the best product offering in the space as the only company with premium and mass market lenses including a full portfolio of 1-Day, sphere, toric and multifocal lenses. Regarding production on these products, MyDay is ramping up nicely. And we're selling everything we can make. Production is also going extremely well for clariti and we continue to expect clariti gross margins to be accretive to worldwide gross margins as we exit the fiscal year. Regarding Proclear, sales of this hydrogel product line were down 4% in constant currency driven by our continuing shift to silicones.","Before moving to market data, let me finish with a comment on CooperVision's non-GAAP adjustment. As expected, we had around $23 million in charges this quarter, split roughly 60%-40% between manufacturing and operating expenses. With the majority of the Sauflon integration behind us, we expect this number to decline to under $10 million in Q2, with most of the charges in cost of goods associated with accelerated depreciation which relates to decisions we made last year.","Now, let me comment on CooperVision's performance against the overall contact lens market. And remember, this information is on the last page of our earnings release. For calendar Q4, we continued taking market share, growing 6%, with the market up 4%. Regarding the market, the underlying story was J&J's strength due to a new product launch and easy comps while Alcon's business was soft against difficult comps. Regionally, CVI grew 9% in EMEA, with the market up 5%. In Asia-Pac, CooperVision grew 12%, with the market up 5%, and in the Americas, CooperVision grew 1%, with the market up 4%. If we look at the market on a modality basis, the single-use market continued driving growth, with CVI up 14% and the market up 12%. For non-silicone (8:41) use lenses, CVI grew 2% while the market declined 1%.","And as you can see, our growth remains diverse and strong. For the full year, calendar year 2015, CooperVision grew 7% and the market grew 4%. Going forward, I expect the market to continue growing 4% to 6% over the next five years and most likely closer to 6%. The drivers will continue to be the shift to dailies' geographic expansion and expansion of the wearer base. We expect to continue taking market share, led by the strong silicone hydrogel portfolio.","Moving to CooperSurgical, we reported Q1 revenues of $85 million, up 12% year-over-year or 6% pro forma. We made solid progress in our office and surgical business, growing 7%, and our fertility business growing 6%, both pro forma. These results are much stronger than our initial guidance and there are a number of ongoing activities which are driving this. First, we significantly increased our focus on sales during the fiscal fourth quarter of last year. This included existing products, new product launches and acquired products. This new emphasis was seen in our Q1 results and we believe it will continue through the year.","Second, we are combining our office and surgical and fertility businesses, including transforming to a geographic sales focus. This is enabling us to cross-sell more effectively, which is especially beneficial with products such as our newly launched disposable hysteroscope EndoSee which sells to OB\/GYN offices but also to fertility centers. This change will also allow us to better manage our infrastructure going forward and we'll reinvest those savings in sales and marketing to continue driving revenue growth.","Third, as we continue to progress through the year, we'll be adding more sales personnel in underpenetrated areas and increasing our focus on high-growth areas such as genetic testing. We anticipate doing this while leveraging revenue growth to improve operating margins as we did in Q1. All in, CooperSurgical is clearly moving to a more aggressive and efficient business model with a life sciences look and feel.","With respect to CooperSurgical's products, the office and surgical business comprises a diverse portfolio of roughly 600 products sold primarily to obstetricians and gynecologists. As I stated earlier, this product portfolio grew 7%, with strength in several key products. Within fertility, we grew 6% pro forma. Sales growth is still being negatively impacted by our strategic decision to exit low-margin, non-CSI-manufactured capital equipment. This will continue through Q2, but then become largely immaterial in Q3. Also within fertility, our genetic testing business is performing extremely well. We entered the lab services space with the acquisition of Reprogenetics last August, and it's proving a very nice strategic fit.","Lastly, we added complementary IVF products in mid-December with the acquisition of Research Instruments. And we also acquired a small fertility microneedle company at the beginning of February which we expect to add roughly $1 million of revenue per quarter going forward. These deals are incorporated in our updated guidance. So overall, I'm very bullish on CooperSurgical. The passion and drive of our surgical team is extremely high and I'm really proud of their efforts and excited about our future.","Now let me touch a little more on guidance. Our fiscal 2016 revenue guidance for CooperVision remains unchanged at 5% to 7% constant currency growth. We are raising our CooperSurgical revenue guidance to 5% to 8% pro forma growth or 15% to 18% on an as-reported basis. We're also raising our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to $8 to $8.30, up 13% to 17% pro forma. For cash flow, we continue to expect around $300 million of adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2016.","In conclusion, we're continuing our successful strategy which we frequently articulated in the past. This includes: investing to take market share by expanding geographically, aggressively rolling out new products and investing in emerging markets. We do this while remaining focused on growing earnings per share and cash flow to deliver strong shareholder value.","I'm pleased with our results and happy the issues we encountered in the fourth quarter, such as the European Sauflon integration activity, are behind us. I remain very optimistic about the underlying fundamentals of our businesses and I believe we are well positioned to deliver strong results for fiscal 2016 and beyond.","With that, let me express my appreciation to our employees, our number one asset. Their hard work and dedication to creating value is the backbone of our success.","And now I'll turn it over to Greg to cover our financial results.","Gregory W. Matz - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Bob provided an overall summary of our performance including a review of the market and our revenue picture. I'm going to focus on primarily our non-GAAP results for the quarter. For the reconciliation to GAAP numbers, please refer to our earnings release.","Looking at gross margins, in Q1, the non-GAAP gross margin was 61.4% compared with 64.2% in the prior year. Factors which impacted our non-GAAP gross margins were a net unfavorable FX impact, with the favorable U.K.-based cost of goods sold impact more than offset by the unfavorable revenue impact. In addition, product mix was a negative as the sales weakness Bob mentioned in the Americas hurt our margins, as this region has the greatest amount of toric and multifocal lenses, along with being a strong Biofinity franchise. We expect gross margins to rebound in Q2.","CooperVision, on a non-GAAP basis, reported gross margin of 60.9% versus 64.2% in Q1 of last year. The factors which impacted our non-GAAP gross margin were the unfavorable net FX impact as well as the product mix I just mentioned. CooperSurgical had non-GAAP gross margin of 63.6%, which compares to Q1 2015 of 64%. Strength in the OB\/GYN and IVF product families were offset by the inclusion of our two recent acquisitions, Reprogenetics and Research Instruments, which have lower gross margins.","Now looking at operating expenses, on a non-GAAP basis, SG&A decreased approximately 3% to $161.8 million or 36% of revenue, down from approximately 38% the prior year. The primary driver behind this was a reduction in G&A where we saw leverage in good management of expenses within the businesses.","Now looking at R&D. In Q1, R&D, on a non-GAAP basis, was $14.8 million or 3.3% of revenue, down from 3.6% in the prior year. We are seeing investment in CSI, offset by synergies from the Sauflon acquisition and CVI.","Moving to operating margins, for Q1, consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $57.4 million and 12.8% of revenue versus $73.1 million and 16.4% of revenue in Q1 last year. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $99.4 million and 22.1% of revenue versus $102.6 million and 23% of revenue for the prior year. The difference in operating margin year over year is the reduction in gross margin we discussed, partially offset by operating expenses.","In Q1, CooperVision's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $87.4 million and 24% of revenue versus $98.4 million and 26.6% of revenue in the prior year. CooperSurgical's non-GAAP operating income and margin were $22.8 million and 26.7% of revenue versus Q1 2015 of $17.5 million and 23.1% of revenue.","Now looking at depreciation and amortization in Q1, depreciation was $37.3 million, up $8 million year over year, which includes $6.1 million of accelerated depreciation related to the Sauflon acquisition which we excluded in our non-GAAP numbers. Amortization was $16.2 million, up $2.6 million. The year-over-year amortization increase reflects recent acquisition activity. Interest expense was $5.3 million for the quarter, up $1.3 million year over year, primarily due to acquisitions and higher interest rates.","Looking at the effective tax rate, in Q1, the non-GAAP effective tax rate was 3.9% versus a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 10.8% in Q1 2015. The year-over-year effective tax rate was favorably impacted by several items, including the release of reserves associated with a prior year tax filing which would normally have reversed in Q3 of 2017, as well as a reduction in the UK tax rate which was enacted in November. Also note, as we've mentioned before, the effective tax rate continues to be below the U.S. statutory rate as the majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower taxes or lower tax rates.","Our earnings per share, our Q1 earnings per share on a GAAP basis and a non-GAAP basis was $1.05 and $1.83 respectively versus $1.25 and $1.75 for GAAP and non-GAAP in the prior year. Non-GAAP EPS on a pro forma basis, which adjusts for currency and acquisitions, grew approximately 15% in the quarter.","Looking at FX impact, the net currency impact on EPS year over year for Q1 was unfavorable by $0.18. This was $0.04 less than we guided as currencies were generally favorable to guidance rates.","Looking at the balance sheet and liquidity, in Q1, we had cash provided by operations of $89.5 million, less capital expenditures of $45.1 million, resulting in $44.4 million of free cash flow. Excluding integration costs of $12.3 million, adjusted free cash flow was $56.7 million.","Total debt increased within the quarter by $28.1 million to $1.377 billion primarily due to acquisitions, partially offset by operational cash flow generation. Inventories increased approximately $11.2 million to $430.9 million from last quarter, primarily due to an increase in daily lenses for CooperVision and an increase due to acquisitions for CooperSurgical. For the quarter, we are seeing months on hand at 6.9 months. DSO is at 57 days, which is consistent with the prior quarter and last year.","Before I get into guidance, let me comment on our senior credit facilities which we mentioned in our earnings release under Other. We entered the bank market a couple of months ago to refinance our $1 billion revolver and raise a small term loan. We priced these facilities as investment grade and were pleasantly surprised at the demand.","As such, we closed a five-year replacement of our $1 billion revolver and a new five-year, $830 million term loan. We used the term loan proceeds to repay certain existing indebtedness and will be reducing our $700 million term loan which matures in August of 2017. Overall, this activity is positive as it extends the life of our facilities at favorable terms and conditions, while providing additional flexibility through greater capacity. The financial impact we're expecting is for interest expense to be higher by roughly $1 million per quarter going forward. As Bob mentioned, this is offset by the higher operating income being generated by CooperSurgical.","Now turning to guidance, foreign exchange rates have been very volatile and can have a large impact on our results. For guidance on our main currencies, we are using $1.07 for the euro, $1.15 for the yen, and $1.38 for the pound. With our rate assumptions, we're expecting a negative impact to full-year 2016 revenues of approximately $58 million and an unfavorable $0.41 impact to full-year 2016 EPS.","Given Q1 was a negative $22 million in revenues and $0.18 on EPS, we are looking at a negative $36 million in revenue or $0.23 for Q2 to Q4, with more than negative impact in Q2 and Q3. The negative revenue impact of $58 million is unchanged from our December guidance, which may be surprising. The positive moves from several currencies, including the euro and the yen, are offset by the negative move in the pound, along with a few other currencies like the Russian ruble and the Brazilian real. Having said this, the earnings per share impact is less negative as the pound is helping COGS in the back half of the year and positive moves in currencies like the yen are having a positive flow-through impact to our operating income.","For 2016 guidance, the revenue range for the company is $1.865 billion to $1.905 billion or approximately 5% to 7% pro forma growth. CooperVision's revenue range is $1.51 billion to $1.54 billion or 5% to 7% constant currency growth. CooperSurgical's revenue range is $355 million to $365 million or 5% to 8% pro forma growth. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be around 64% for the year. OpEx is expected to be around 40%. Operating margin is expected to be around 24%. Interest expense is expected to be around $24 million. Our effective tax rate is expected to be around 8%. Our expected share count will be around 49.2 million shares. Our non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $8 to $8.30, which equates to a pro forma EPS of 13% to 17% growth. CapEx is expected to be around $200 million. Adjusted free cash flow is expected to be around $300 million.","With that, let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session.","Kim Duncan - Vice President-Investor Relations","Operator, we're ready to take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much. I have two questions. The first one is what did you give for the year-over-year growth of silicone hydrogels? And can you help break out how your daily silicone hydrogels are doing?","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Joanne, two things. Our year-over-year growth for silicone hydrogel was 13%. So, the entire family of four, Biofinity, Avaira, clariti and MyDay. For the 1-Day silicone hydrogels, it was 50% constant currency year over year.","Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. And are you planning on launching any next-generation types of products beyond clariti and MyDay? I mean, I've been hearing about next-gen Biofinity, for example.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let's just say that our focus is on obviously the two that we're in the middle of, which is clariti and MyDay. There will be enhancements along the way of many of our families of products. There will be extended ranges of the families. And so, suffice it to say, you can call those future generation upgrades, if you will.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","J.P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi, everyone. This is actually J.P. in for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I want to just on \u2013 I'm trying to dig into what changed in your core EPS for the full year. The $8 to $8.30, when I back out the $0.17 from FX reduction, plus the $0.30 beat in the quarter, is there anything changing in the core business or is that kind of flat from an EPS standpoint?","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, we had a $0.26 beat for the quarter of which $0.04 was foreign exchange compared to guidance or $0.22. And for the back nine months, we improved it $0.15 in aggregate, $0.14 of which was foreign exchange and $0.01 \u2013 did I get it? It's actually...","Gregory W. Matz - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer & Senior Vice President","It's $0.13 and...","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","$0.14 in aggregate, of which $0.13 is foreign exchange and $0.01 is basically improvement in operations.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Chris T. Pasquale - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Bob, I wanted to circle back on your comments about the slower growth in torics and multifocals. I get that the U.S. is the biggest market for those products and you're facing some competitive headwinds there. But the new competitive launches are primarily spheres, if I'm not mistaken. So if you could talk a little bit more about what's causing the slowdown in specialty lenses and how you reverse that.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, the slowdown is really a function not of what's getting an eye. It's year-over-year tough comps, which is U.S. dominant, if you will. We had 11% growth a year ago, and so it's against that tough comp. Since the U.S. is so weighted to specialty lenses compared to outside the U.S., yet shows up as what appears to be a deceleration of the growth of the lenses in our specialty area, torics and multifocals. Our expectation, as we indicated several times, is that the comps are easier post the first quarter, so we expect to return to a more normalized growth rate which is built into our revenue guidance, and certainly that would impact specially \u2013 heavily because of its U.S. orientation. And it will also impact our gross margin going forward since specialty lenses carry a higher gross margin percent.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Brian D. Weinstein - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. It sounds like you guys are selling everything you can on MyDay, but where are you guys sort of building out the capacity for that? It would seem to me that if demand is strong for that that you're going be looking to aggressively build out the capacity of a similar product. But I don't think I heard anything on the call about where you are on that capacity build. Thanks.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As of today, we're still capacity-constrained with MyDay. We are rolling out shortly into Japan. We are ramping up very nicely, we're happy with that. And suffice it to say that within the next year, we will expect to say we are no longer capacity-constrained even on MyDay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Robert Baird. Your line is now open.","Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good evening, guys. Maybe two questions, Bob, for you. Can you quantify at all the customer payouts in Europe, if CVI was 4% constant currency growth, what would have been ex those, I believe, were contra-revenue payments? And then also, you mentioned clariti gross margins exiting the year accretive to companywide. I think last call, you just talked about maybe going from the low-50%s to the low-60%s. My definition of accretive to gross margin would be kind of closer to 62%, 63%. Is that kind of a fair range of where you think those clariti gross margins go exiting the year?","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So on the first item, we're not going to get into the specifics of what concessions we made that impacted revenue. But suffice it to say, Europe put up reasonably respectful numbers as in \u2013 the growth area at 8% constant currency. So that probably will allow you to gauge it a little. From the point of view of clariti being accretive, our intent is consistent with what your assessment is that it would not be a drag on our overall gross margin going into the acquisition of clariti, and that would be, yes, north of that 62%-63% range that you assessed.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you. Just two quick ones. Bob, I think you mentioned roughly $200 million of CapEx spending for the year. Again, just coming back to an earlier question around MyDay, is there a scenario where you might decide to step that up a little bit to, again, improve your ability to supply MyDay? And then the second question is, UPP continues to hang around. If that goes away, what would your expectations be for the market and the way Cooper's positioned?","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, as far as could we do anything to accelerate the MyDay rollout by expanding our CapEx requirements, there are long lead times with MyDay. So we've already put in place all the bells \u2013 all the orders, so to speak, and requirements to get that ramped up to where we need to. That's already in the works and built into our forecasted CapEx numbers. And things, as I indicated, are going very well to plan in that arena.","Relative to UPP, if it went away \u2013 or Unilateral Pricing Policy, if it went away tomorrow, I'm not sure there'd be much of a significant impact on the industry or the competitive landscape. Suffice it to say I think many independent eye care practitioners have figured out that there are workarounds out there to UPP. And maybe it's not all that it was cracked up to be when it first came out as a novel new idea. So as long as the eye care practitioners are being taken care of relative to servicing those that write the script, I think nothing major will have changed. And life would go on if it went away, and I'd applaud that if it happened actually.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Roman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, and good evening, everybody. I wanted just to start back on the competitive dynamic. You talked about in your prepared remarks some of the traction J&J has gained, but right now, it does look like the other large competitor is facing some fairly significant headwind. Could you maybe give us some perspective on how you expect the landscape to unfold as we pace through 2016 particularly as Alcon undertakes the sort of market recovery plan?","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're correct. The competitive landscape is pretty jumpy right now, if you will, a lot of changes within all of the competitors, if you will. Alcon's undergoing a major restructuring within Novartis, and they're pulling things out of what we used to call Alcon and will probably be in the future won't \u2013 I don't know how they'll deal with the names. But that certainly is not a handicap to us. J&J's going through another assignment of executives in some of their key areas, which is kind of a training ground for J&J in the contact lens space. So there is a change there.","They of course have put a lot of muscle, or the executive that was transitioning out put a lot of muscle over the last two months \u2013 the last two quarters in rolling out OASYS 1-Day. And other thoughts are in the works there. We like change in that sense. We like some of what J&J did by way of trying to accelerate the death, if you will, of the two-week space in the U.S., which they happen to own well north of 80% of. So anytime they put their own franchise in play, I think all the competitors like that. And whether it goes into what the so-called one-week, so-called 1-Day or to go into the one-month, that's putting it all in play, that's fine from our perspective.","So, we still think we're the one to be caught up with relative to complete portfolio of silicone hydrogel 1-Day at both the mass market and having a silicone hydrogel entry into the 1-Day premium market. So we think we have the best deck of cards or hand of cards, if you will, and like the way the industry continues to perform in good times and in bad times. So, the growth of the industry is there. Everything we've said about the trading up into 1-Day as the driver of the industry, the fact that it's 4X to 6X or 400% to 600% more revenue for the same patient, all of that is continuing to come about.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Mishan of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good evening and thanks for taking my questions. I got two real quick. First, I was hoping you could talk about some of the Cooper-specific things that you're doing in the Americas in response to J&J and their resurgence that give us more confidence in a return to growth for you guys. And then just secondly an update on where you're at with the MyDay launch in Japan.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, first on what Cooper's doing. Cooper is continuing to execute its plan, which was to roll out MyDay as a premium 1-Day silicone hydrogel and clariti as a mass market 1-Day silicone hydrogel, with a complete family of toric, multifocal and sphere. Nothing is changing by way of our focus on executing that strategy. We still believe that silicone hydrogel belongs in the 1-Day space. And therefore, the fact that 77% of the non-1-Day space is already silicone hydrogel, we still believe we have the right product portfolio in the right space, and it will convert into silicone hydrogels as we go forward.","And nothing in any of the numbers we're looking at by ways of the growth of the 1-Day market or the growth of silicone hydrogels causes us to take pause in that view. The fact that J&J put up robust numbers, yes, they came out with a new product and yes, they distributed it widely and deeply. They had very easy comps from the prior year, so some of that growth is anomalous. And you may recall, in the prior year, they were going through that transition where they were the only one that did adopt UPP or Unilateral Pricing Policy for not only new products wherein we were dedicating a lot of time to the eye care professional to learn the new products, they decided to do it for the products they've had in the marketplace for 10 years.","So there was nothing new about it. There was no reason to think that the eye care professional had to dedicate a whole bunch of new time to learn the new technology. But it was easy comps. So nothing changes from the point of view of our expectation. As I pointed out, we had very tough comps in the first quarter. We do not have those same tough comps in the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter. So, our focus remains on execution.","As far as MyDay in Japan, we are rolling it out literally this month, which is March. And we're not doing, because of capacity limitations, anything like the J&J, OASYS 1-Day rollout where they hit everyone all over. So it will be a much more orderly rollout that I wouldn't go crazy because of our capital limitations or our capacity limitations on having high expectations for significantly moving the needle on the top line this fiscal year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone of Jefferies your line is now open.","Anthony Charles Petrone - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Two questions as well. Maybe, Bob, can you just review for us where silicone hydrogel daily as a category is today just from a market standpoint? And where do you think it can go over time? And then on the competitive front, there's been quite a bit of change going on at Valeant. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any changes in the presence of Bausch & Lomb in the marketplace due to these changes over the past six months or so. Thanks.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Well, first of all, silicone hydrogel 1-Day today is around a little north of $600 million. It's north of 20% of the 1-Day category, which is about $3 billion, little north of that. We expect that $3 billion of a $7.4 billion industry, if you will, to move to about 50% of a $10 billion industry constant currency provisional between now and 2020.","So of that $10 billion in 2020 at current exchange rates, we expect half of it to be or $5 billion to be in the 1-Day modality. And of that $5 billion, a lot more than 20%, suffice it to say, your barometer is someplace between that 20% which is rapidly going higher, and the 77% that is in the non-1-Day modality, it will be someplace in the middle. And one could easily take the middle of it and say about 50% of the $5 billion which is 50% of the $10 billion is not a bad gauge for 2020.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jon Block of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Let me just try to get in two upfront. First, can you elaborate, Bob, a little bit more on the Biofinity and Avaira? I think it was up 7% year-over-year in the quarter. It seems like a decent stepdown from the recent run rate. Is there some inventory fluctuations there? And then second, I know you guys want to sort of stay away from a specific 2016 SiHy number, but are you still in the same expectation that SiHy daily accelerates from sort of that mid-40% pro forma constant currency that you did in 2015. In other words, can you maintain this 50%-ish SiHy daily growth throughout 2016? Thanks, guys.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. I'll do the latter one first. The expectation on the SiHy daily is as you indicated, we expect higher growth in 2016 than 2015 and 2015 was mid-40%s. And this last quarter, in constant currency was 50%. So that we expect to hold \u2013 equal that or exceed it if you were going forward or at least exceed the 45% of last year for the entire fiscal year. So nothing has changed in our expectation on that and the rollout there. Relative to Biofinity and Avaira which dropped below double-digit for the first time in I think ever, at 7%, that 7% is basically anomalous relative to its concentration in \u2013 particularly Avaira's primarily a U.S. product and so that concentration in the Americas weights that down and we expect that to normalize going forward and be double-digit.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Can you hear me okay?","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I can hear you fine, Steve.","Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Hey, Bob. Bob, regarding the 1-Day silicone hydrogel market that you were just describing and going \u2013 looking out a few years, I was wondering if you could talk about particularly in light of you guys continuing to add capacity there, kind of where MyDay margins are today? Where do you expect MyDay margins to be once you have capacity and it's up and running? And just kind of from a big picture (44:49) perspective it's my understanding that other people's 1-Day silicone hydrogels don't have all that great of margins either. And so if effectively a quarter of the market moves to 1-Day silicone hydrogels over the next four years or so, does that negatively impact the overall margin profile of the industry?","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So on where is MyDay today, we indicated we expected it to move into the 20%s. It is in the 20%s as a gross margin. We longer term expect it to move into the 50%s which is more the traditional 1-Day modality, if you will, gross margin. We \u2013 relative to if all of silicone hydrogel moved deeply into the 1-Day modality or as my model was, $2.5 billion out of $5 billion out of $10 billion, $10 billion being total, $5 billion being 1-Day, $2.5 billion being silicone hydrogel in 2020. If that were to happen, given where we are with clariti as a mass market high gross margin 1-Day silicone hydrogel, we think we would be a big enough player that it wouldn't put an undue drain on the entire industry.","Having said that, there's no doubt that if we were comparing what the industry would be if it stayed and moved from two-week and 1-Day into the monthly modality, where margins would be going up, because by definition they're monthlies, compared to the 1-Day there's no doubt that a 1-Day modality is lower than a monthly modality. A two-week noncompliant market which defines or profiles the U.S. market, could only and should only do better no matter where it goes because a noncompliant two-week isn't an optimal gross margin. And the industry is focusing in on how to make compliance better and the best way do that is kill off the two-week, if you will.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just, Bob, two quick clarifications and then one real question. So on the sales concessions, you expect to accelerate in the second quarter, so I know it was asked earlier, but if you could give us some sense of how much that depressed growth, it would obviously help us understand the underlying trends a little bit better. The second, just on Joanne's question.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Larry, can you come back on? Larry, could you repeat that question?","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah.","Gregory W. Matz - Chief Financial Officer, Chief Risk Officer & Senior Vice President","You're a little hard to hear, Larry, a little light.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Sorry, guys. I'll try to speak up. The sales concessions, you're not giving us the number and how much it depressed sales in the quarter but it impacts our ability to understand the underlying trend. And I know you expect to improve in the second quarter. So if you would give that it'd be helpful. But anyway that was just a request. And then on Biofinity, Joanne asked about another new version. So just to be clear, you talked about extended ranges. So it sounds like you're not ready to come out with an aspheric version with UPP in 2016. And, sorry, guys. Just lastly for my real question; J&J, if they do come out with a monthly lens, Bob, how do you see that for Cooper? Obviously there's some rumors of that and we haven't confirmed it, but what would be the impact for Cooper if they came out with a monthly lens? Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. On the concessions, we indicated we were not going to disclose that. We said the same thing on the fourth quarter call. I think what \u2013 other than me pointing you at the EMEA growth of 8% as being fairly robust, meaning the factors that hit gross margin and I think Greg touched upon them, are multiple. And concessions is one, but they're clearly foreign exchange and the lag on that is another. And quite frankly, the ramping up of MyDay while it's still in a lower gross margin categories, all factors. So no one is driving our gross margin of 61%. And I think we indicated we're expecting to be in around 64% by the end of the year to give you some indication where direction that will go.","Relative to the new version Biofinity, I used the extended range as an example of things that we're doing, particularly in the area of torics where extended ranges, custom lenses matter. And one of Cooper's claims to fame and why we're so good in specialty lenses is, we're very capable of customizing lenses and addressing 100% of the audience instead of 80%. A lot of our competitors only worry about the bell curve, the 80%. So when we talk about making Biofinity even better, it's things like that. And whether or not we upgrade and add things that some of our competitors have done over the years when they have a product that's been around a long time, will there be some refreshing of different things? Perhaps, but we'll not go any further into that at this juncture. I was using the extended range because it is a broadening of the family and availability in the family.","As far as J&J, if they move into the monthly, that will only further exacerbate the death of the two-week. So who's to say, they own north of 80% of the wearer base in the two-week space. They know better than anyone how noncompliant it is. And they know if they can move people from the two-week space to the monthly space and charge 30%, 40%, 50% or 60% for a monthly higher than a two-week noncompliant, they are much better off even if they don't get the \u2013 well, they have to get the lion's share, but even if they don't get it all as they put people in play. So net-net-net, we view J&J activity putting the two-week market in play as a plus for Cooper, as a plus for the industry.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Bob Weiss for closing remarks.","Robert S. Weiss - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thank you. I want to thank everyone for joining us today. I hope you're as excited as I am about our start to the New Year, and our outlook for the New Year.

Welcome to the 2018 first quarter conference call. Before getting into the quarter, as we announced earlier today, I will retire as President and CEO on April 30 of this year while remaining on the Board of Directors. Al White, who most of you know as our CFO, Chief Strategy Officer, and CEO of Cooper Medical Holding Company and CooperSurgical, will become the new President and CEO effective May 1st. And I will work with him transitioning the role through the end of the calendar year.","After a fantastic 40 years plus, The Cooper Company -- at Cooper Companies, the last 10 years plus as CEO, it's time for me to spend more time with my family, along with traveling and trying to get a little better at golf. As many of you know, I spent a lot of time working on succession planning over the last 10 years.","My goal has been to train and prepare a deep leadership bench such that when the time came to step down, we would be able to promote highly trained executive from within. I'm happy to say that Al fits this description and I have complete confidence that he is the right leader for the future of the Cooper Companies.","Over the past 10 years, I've had the privilege of leading the best team in the medical device industry and building a great company. At CooperVision, we saw a trade-up to a new material called silicone hydrogel in all of our -- all three of our modalities and acquired a little company called Sauflon that help put us on the map as the only company with a low cost one-day silicone hydrogel family of products.","At CooperSurgical, we expanded outside the United States and became the largest IVF player globally through the acquisition of Origio and continue to grow our offerings from there with several acquisitions around the world. And we recently completed the Paragon acquisition -- PARAGARD acquisition.","I am proud of our accomplishments and the passion of our employees. So, I want to thank them for their dedication and hard work and for a fantastic 40-plus years. With that, let me turn to performance.","For the quarter, we reported $590 million in consolidated revenues, up 18% year-over-year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.79, up 45% year-over-year. CooperVision posted Q1 revenues of $445 million, up 14% as reported, up 8% pro forma. Daily silicone hydrogel lenses drove growth up 38% pro forma, as did Biofinity and Avaira combined up 9% pro forma.","CooperSurgical posted revenues of $145 million, up 32% as reported, down 6% pro forma. Moving to the details. This was a solid quarter for CooperVision with growth in all regions, including the Americas up 3%; EMEA, up 9%; and Asia-Pacific, up 15%, all pro forma.","As expected, growth in the Americas was in a low single-digits. However, we expect that to be stronger in Q2 and the remainder of the year. Regarding EMEA and Asia-Pac, both had very good quarters. So, we continue gaining share in all -- in both regions.","Overall, revenues continue to be driven by our silicone hydrogel lenses, led by our Clariti and MyDay in the dailies space and Biofinity in the monthly space. We are continuing to expand our offerings geographically, including the launch of MyDay Toric in the United States.","The feedback has been very positive, and we believe the launch will help accelerate one-day Toric growth while also helping drive further adoption of MyDay here. Our Clariti one-day products also continue to perform extremely well.","Moving to other products. Our Biofinity and Avaira family of lenses combined to grow 9% pro forma. Biofinity continue to perform very well with diversified growth around the world. Avaira declined slightly as our focus remained on transitioning where to our upgraded Avaira Vitality lenses, which we anticipate completing by the end of this year.","Turning to product categories. We remain global leader in Toric, which grew 9% pro forma, driven by Biofinity, MyDay, and Clariti. We continue to believe that the Toric market will grow faster than the overall market, and we will share in that growth given our strong portfolio and recent addition of MyDay Toric in the U.S. Multifocals grew 5% pro forma with strength coming from Biofinity and Clariti.","Turning to the global market -- soft contact lens market. For calendar Q4, we grew 5% with the market up 5%. This included growing faster than the market in Asia-Pac, up 15% versus the market of 7% -- up 7%; and EMEA, up 10% versus the market up 6%. The Americas declined 3% with the market up 4% on a very difficult 12% comp for CooperVision versus 5% for the Americas market.","By modality, CooperVision grew single-use lenses 11% versus the market, up 10%. And finally, CooperVision's non-single-use lenses grew 3% while the market grew 1%.","On a calendar year basis, we continue taking share up 7% versus the market come up 5%. Going forward, we are still targeting 4% to 6% market growth and we expect to continue growing faster than the market.","Moving to CooperSurgical, we reported revenue up growth of 32% with revenues hitting an all-time high of $145 million, driven by our acquisition of PARAGARD. On a pro forma basis, we declined 6%, mostly due to the expected year-over-year declines with PARAGARD, which we discussed last quarter.","As a reminder, we purchased PARAGARD on November 1st, 2017 and inherited significant channel inventory, which was built prior to our acquisition. Inventory levels return to normal during Q1, so future growth should now more closely follow the market demand.","Further on PARAGARD, as you may recall from our prior conversations or discussions, there was no direct salesforce supporting the product for approximately one year before we acquired it.","We began hiring sales reps soon after the acquisition and we will have roughly 40 new direct sales reps by the end of this month. Given this, we expect to see a full quarter of positive impact beginning in our fiscal third quarter.","So, overall, we remain very positive on PARAGARD. It's the only non-hormonal IUD or long-acting reversible form birth control on the U.S. market and we continue to believe it will be well -- we will do well as we communicate the product's benefits. Excluding PARAGARD, our office and surgical business grew 3% in line with expectations.","Regarding fertility, the fertility solutions part of our business, which includes products like median and medical devices, continued performing well up 8%, but our genetic testing business declined 35%. We entered the genetics testing market several years ago and business was performing really well until we began experiencing a significant competitive pricing pressure last year as discussed on our last earnings call regarding margins.","As you know we focus on sustainable business models, which has meant allowing some businesses to exit rather than matching highly unprofitable pricing. Having said that, genetic testing remains an important part of the genetic process -- fertility process and we plan to remain a participant as it ties to our fertility solutions.","Given our focus will remain on running a well-managed operation, our results in genetic testing will likely continue to drag on our fertility category through the end of this year. On the positive side, our fertility solutions continue to perform well and we believe our product portfolio combined with the market trends will continue to drive positive results.","In conclusion, I want to express my appreciation to our employees for their hard work and dedication. And with that, I'll turn it over to Al.","Albert White","Thank you, Bob and thanks for the comments earlier. Before getting into the numbers, I'd like to share a couple of thoughts on the CEO announcement. Needless to say, I'm extremely excited to take on this role. It's an extraordinary honor to succeed Bob and I'm grateful for the trust and confidence the Board of Directors has placed in me.","Regarding Bob, he has been an incredibly important part of the success of Cooper for an amazing 40 plus years and an amazing mentor to me. He became CEO a little over 10 years ago and since that time, our revenue has increased from slightly under $1 billion to our current guidance for this year exceeding $2.5 billion.","Our stock has responded accordingly with an annual return of roughly 18%. Those are obviously very impressive numbers and I'm also happy to add that Bob has built a very nice management team that I'm fortunate to inherit, so I look forward to continued success.","With that, let me turn to some numbers. Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis, so please refer to today's earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Bob covered revenues, so let me focus on the rest of the financials and guidance.","This was a very strong quarter for gross margins with our consolidated gross margins improving to 67.5%, up nicely from 62.9% last year. CooperVision's gross margin was a robust 67.1%, up from 63.1% last year with roughly half driven by currency and the other half favorable product mix and general manufacturing efficiency improvements.","CooperSurgical's gross margin also improved significantly to 68.8%, up from 62.2% last year, driven primarily by the addition of PARAGARD. Regarding expenses. Consolidated operating expenses grew 18% in the quarter, slightly less than revenue.","Expense growth was driven largely by the addition of PARAGARD along with sales and marketing investments throughout the company. We continue to enhance our salesforce by selectively hiring around the world within both CooperVision and CooperSurgical.","We also saw increased investments in distribution where we continue to upgrade our infrastructure along with higher investments in R&D within CooperSurgical as we look to upgrade and enhance certain legacy products.","Moving to operating income. We grew an impressive 42.9% with operating margins improving to 27.6% from 22.8% last year. Both businesses reported strong operating margin improvement driven by gross margin improvements.","Below operating income, we reported $16.7 million of interest expense, a $3.1 million FX gain, and an effective tax rate of 7.3%. Regarding taxes, note that our GAAP results include a $202 million net charge primarily related to the U.S. transition tax as part of the recent enactment of the new U.S. tax legislation. Although fully accrued in this quarter, any actual cash payment will be made over the next eight years with the backend-loaded payment schedule.","I should also add that we're very similar to most multinational companies in that we continue to analyze the new tax reform act and work through information such as the details around historical earnings, tax credits, and so forth to finalize our estimates. Please see our 10-K and upcoming 10-Q for more information.","Non-GAAP EPS was $2.79 with roughly 49.6 million average shares outstanding. We posted $25.2 million of negative free cash flow for the quarter with roughly $26.2 million of operating cash flow, offset by $51.4 million of CapEx.","Our cash flow was negatively impacted by $52.7 million from the PARAGARD acquisition, primarily associated with the initial build of receivables, which normalizes in Q2 and a payment to the U.K. taxing authority of $42 million associated with the ongoing dispute over the transfer valuation of certain intellectual property associated with the soft line acquisition.","Total debt increased roughly $1.23 billion to $2.403 billion, primarily due to acquisitions led by PARAGARD.","Moving to guidance. We're raising fiscal 2018 consolidated revenues to $2.51 billion to $2.56 billion. This includes increasing CooperVision's revenue guidance to $1.865 billion to $1.9 billion or roughly 6% to 8% pro forma growth to reflect our Q1 performance and currency.","CooperSurgical's revenue guidance is moving to $645 million to $660 million, which equates to roughly flat to 2% pro forma growth to reflect updated thinking on genetic testing, which Bob highlighted earlier.","Within office and surgical products, PARAGARD revenues were $33 million this past quarter, meeting expectations. Revenues would have been $34 million if not for a reclassification of certain distribution expenses against revenues. This was just a reclassification, and thus, did not impact operating profits, but it did reduce revenues and will do so going forward.","Updating our expectations with this in mind, we expect roughly $165 million in PARAGARD revenues for the year, which remains mid to upper single-digit revenue growth for Q2 to Q4, as driven by last year's price increase and our recent investments, including the new salesforce.","Consolidated operating margins are not expected to be around 28.5% for the year, supported by strength in both businesses along with a more positive impact from PARAGARD than initially forecasted.","Interest expense is expected to be much higher at around $80 million, which assumes three additional 25 basis point rate hikes by fiscal year end. Regarding taxes, we're forecasting a range of 9% to 10% for the year, reflecting our current analysis incorporating the recently enacted tax reform.","On FX, we have seen an overall favorable move in currencies since we last reported earnings. We're now forecasting a positive impact to revenues of roughly $72 million and a positive impact to non-GAAP EPS of $0.78, both on a year-over-year basis.","Incorporating all these items, we're raising our non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2018 to $11.70 to $11.90 based on 49.8 million shares outstanding. Within this guidance, regarding Q2, we expect strength in revenues to be offset by higher investment activity, especially with respect to PARAGARD at an effective tax rate in the 10% to 12% range resulting in Q2 non-GAAP EPS being just slightly higher than Q1.","Lastly, on guidance, we continue to expect strong free cash flow this year. As discussed, Q1 was low due to the U.K. tax payment and the one-time receivable build from PARAGARD, but we expect to hurdle the PARAGARD item and still expect free cash flow to be similar to last year excluding the tax item.","With that, let me conclude by saying we remain focused on expanding our businesses and gaining global market share while delivering consistent, solid financial results. This quarter was another step in that direction and we look forward to reporting results as we work through the rest of fiscal 2018.","With that, I'll hand it back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question is from the line of Larry Keusch of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Lawrence Keusch","Thanks. good evening everyone. And congratulations, Al and congratulations, Bob on your retirement.","Albert White","Thank you.","Robert Weiss","Thank you.","Lawrence Keusch","So, I guess, I just want to start, if we could, on Americas, and maybe Bob or Al, talk a little bit again about the dynamics that are impacting your business. And I guess, within that discussion, could you talk a little bit about sort of what you guys are seeing and doing within the independent optometrist channel versus the private label channel? And then I have a follow-up.","Robert Weiss","Sure Larry. It comes back to our -- we continue to be happy with the on eye performance in the U.S. business. We're in the middle of -- just starting the launch and rollout of MyDay Toric, which will serve to, if you will, build more momentum with MyDay and our one-day shell presence in the U.S.","And importantly, we had much tougher comps than the industry did in the quarter with 12% in the prior year, which -- so when we look at two-year stacking basis, we feel good when we look at trailing 12 months, we feel pretty good about that also, 3% versus 4% for the industry.","I'd be remiss to say that the gray market hasn't been a factor over the last couple of years, particularly as the dollar was stronger and stronger. And now with the dollars turning to go the other way, at least for the time being, it serves as a minimizer of those companies that do reach internationally or outside the bounds of the United States for a product. And I won't get into any more specifics.","But suffice it to say, that's been a key factor in the reconciliation between our revenue out the door into the Americas and our on eye performance. And therefore, we feel real good about them.","As far as the independents versus private label. Private label has done very well for us. Independents are doing well. We have something for both sides of the aisle. Private label, we would expect to do even better as we complete a couple of things. The halo effect of MyDay, so that there is a Toric to go along with the sphere. And the Avaira transition to Avaira Vitality, which we expect to pretty much wrap-up by the end of the calendar year. So, those will afford as better catalysts going forward.","Lawrence Keusch","Okay, perfect. And then second question and correct me if I'm doing the math wrong here. But I think FX at the last point in time was $0.38, now it's $0.78. So, that's a $0.40 delta. And EPS guidance went up about $0.30. So, A, is that correct? And is that really just a function of really investing more in the business? Just trying to figure out the sort of disconnect. I would have thought EPS would have been up more.","Albert White","Yes, Larry, I'll take that one. You're correct. So, it was $0.38 up to $0.78, so it's a positive $0.40. About $0.11 of that was in Q1. So, it was built into those numbers. When you look at the back half for the year, you're kind of reconciling past guidance to current guidance.","A couple of things to keep in mind there. As you know, FX is a positive. There's a little bit in the medical device tax as an example the tax rate because it was low in Q1, is kind of a neutral, if you will. Interest expense is one of the big negatives there.","So, if you look at -- we assume here three rate increases, three additional rate increases, if you will, occurring here in March, June, September. So, that had a pretty big negative impact taking our interest forecast guidance from $68 million up to $80 million. So, between that, it's investments in the business and so forth is where you kind of net out the new midpoint.","Lawrence Keusch","Okay, perfect. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you, And our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Larry Biegelsen","Hey good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. And I'll echo congratulations for both Bob and Al. Bob, we'll miss you. So, I guess, I'll ask two high-level questions. One, Bob, you and the Board knew, I think, or probably knew this was coming where you're named Al the CFO a year ago. So, the question is kind of why now the change?","And just second, Al, any early thoughts on how you might shape the strategic directions, your priorities? And just lastly, Al, your feeling on keeping CSI and CDI together. Thanks for taking the questions.","Robert Weiss","Well, Larry, to be honest, we probably the single biggest factor was I held my Executive meeting in Kona, Hawaii in January. I was not looking for a condo. When I came back from there, I owned a condo. And I kind of like Hawaii. I got married there almost 50 years ago.","So, we've always gone back and started reflecting on the fact that maybe it's time to take a victory lap and then enjoy a few places of the world. I like traveling. My golf game stinks. I probably can't do much about the latter part. But it's time to -- I've had a lot of fun developing a solid bench. And I'm highly confident that the players coming behind me are better than I am. So, why not upgrade?","Albert White","Sorry, Larry, a couple of things. You look at priorities. Obviously, I've sat next to Bob -- I've been here 12 years and sat next to Bob almost that entire time. So, a lot of the activity we've done over the years the two of us have done together, at least joined hip to hip.","When I look at where we're today and where we're going forward, we have a great company. We have a great culture here. Definitely want to keep that going. I'd like to get out and see the employees and spend time with employees and customers. I have more of a sales background than Bob has.","So, I'd like to get out and spend a little time with some of the customers and talk to people out there. So, I'll spend time doing there. I mean but at the end of the day, I want to make sure that we meet, beat the guidance that we provided today. We position ourselves for the strong 2019 and for the future and stay laser-focused on delivering long-term shareholder value because that's what we've done in the past and that's certainly what we're going to do in the future. So, that's the way I look at it.","With respect to CooperVision and CooperSurgical, two great businesses. I'm very fond of both of them, I spent a lot of time in both of the businesses and would certainly expect us to keep both businesses together and continue to drive consolidated success.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson of Baird. Your line is open.","Jeff Johnson","Thank you. Good afternoon guys. And I guess I'll just echo the same exact thoughts. But Bob, it's truly been a pleasure for the last 15 years and I've been in the business and the 10 years as CEO for you. It's been impressively you've accomplished and I wish you nothing but the best.","Robert Weiss","Thank you, Jeff.","Jeff Johnson","And maybe moving into just a couple of questions. Congratulations to you as well, Al. I didn\u2019t mean to leave you out on that. But when you look at the CVI growth, 6% to 8% guidance for the year, you do 8% in the first quarter, the comps do get easier throughout the year.","Just wondering kind of how you're thinking about CVI over the balance of the year. It seems like there could maybe even some upside that constant currency guidance. And the 8% you did this quarter, is that organic? I know you had a couple of small deals in there. I've been getting questions from people how much they contributed. But I think that less than 50 basis points. Any color you could provide there will be great.","Robert Weiss","Yes, that 8% is a pro forma, which is organic constant currency. And we came out of the gate very solid, exceeded our expectations. So, yes, there are some upside there. Of course, in our guidance, we've also, which is reflected of foreign exchange. We're happy with the direction we're taking with the rollout of MyDay Toric into the U.S. And we're also very happy with the progress we're making in the transition from Avaira to Avaira Vitality, which of course, is more a -- probably more a bottom-line play and a gross margin play than it is a topline. But we've been on the topline in a flat mode with that transition from Avaira to Avaira Vitality. So, we're optimistic that will get some momentum as we complete the transition post-2018, that will serve better in the post-2018 period.","Albert White","Yes, I'll just tackle on a couple of quick ones, Bob, 8% was a strong quarter. We did very well this quarter. The actual quarter was 7.6%, so rounded up to 8%. But Jeff, on your point on the acquisitions, too. We acquired PARAGARD at the beginning of December. So, if you look at our specialty lens business, if you will, which is comprised of those acquisitions you're referring to, it was only about $5.8 million in revenues this quarter. It did grow 13%, so low double-digits. But it had a very small impact on the overall CooperVision number. Those were very strong just kind of standalone organic growth numbers, if you will.","Jeff Johnson","All right. Thank you. That's helpful. And then maybe one follow-up, a high level. The FTC's workshop yesterday. Would love to get maybe just high level thoughts, good, bad, and anything you heard in there.","I did think one thing I heard on the private label side that was interesting with some of these retailers now using private label and what have been kind of as a way to lock in maybe prescriptions in their own offices, but now using it as a way to market a good product, a Kirkland brand or something looks good for the Kirkland brand for the Costco brand, things like that.","So, how important -- is the importance of your private label business actually going up? And should we look at the private label as a little bit of a risk to you guys or still as a nice, big opportunity over time? Thanks.","Robert Weiss","Yes, I think highly of our private label and it's not something you could replicate easily. It is incredibly complex by way of SKUs and how you manage that. So, it is barrier-to-entry.","As companies to become more global, we get tighter and tighter with partnership arrangements with large global players. So, it's extremely strategic. There's nothing that came through the FTC workshop at -- I see as up cyclically, negative of it with the same repeat on the Rx of that the patient has a right to and that debate continues between the retailer -- certain retailers, and the independents as much as anything.","As far as the large retailers, I think they love private label and they love the ability to put their own name on it. There's a lot of great names out there that are afforded because Cooper has a broad product line and is willing to private label of the product -- product line, whether it's not and it's tough name brand like Biofinity or Clariti or MyDay. It doesn't really matter. There's lots of retailer that entirely their own names in taking on a quality product into their own names. So, I think its great barrier-to-entry and a great key part of our story.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block of Stifel. Your line is open.","JonBlock","Great. Thanks guys. Good afternoon. I got two. Let me just have the first one. I guess, I just want to sort of focus on that confidence in the U.S. rebounding. I believe some of that easing comps, maybe a bit the MyDay Toric launch. But anything else that you guys see out there in front of you which would have placed in your comp, but instead that CVI Americas growth rate accelerates in the coming quarters? And then I've got a quick follow-up.","Robert Weiss","Yes, there's no doubt that the comps, particularly after the second quarter, is still some degree of a top in the second quarter. But post second quarter, the comps are very neutralized. There's also no doubt that the -- some of the green market activity will create anomaly.","So, we -- part of my reason for being pretty bullish is we're going to have some pretty easy comps in the Americas in certain of the quarters post the second quarter. And so they are anomalously easy, if you will, compared to anomalously hard over the last two quarters. So, that plays into it.","But I think a combination of the transition from Avaira Vitality which has been a sticking point particularly in the middle of the retailers -- the private label part of the business, the combination of the halo effect of MyDay and MyDay Toric rolling into the market and the skewing or evening out of the bumpiness brought about by the gray market, those three leave us a lot more confident about the future.","Jon Block","Got it. Very helpful. And then the second one just to shift over to PARAGARD. Al, $165 million in revs, now $170 million, I understand that's accounting, but still lower. And you also talked to investments with direct reps yet you do allude to a more favorable, I believe, margin profile relative to initial expectations. So, what's allowing you to achieve that? In other words, is that more favorable margin profile in light of the slightly lower revs and the investments you guys are making?","Albert White","Yes, on the revenue side, you're right. It's literally just an accounting adjustment. So, there were certain distribution expenses that were being accounted for historically within operating expenses. Those moved to revenue account and they reduced the revenues. So, that did not affect the operating profits.","So from that perspective, if you kind of look at it on the same basis from when we talked beforehand, very, very similar. At the end of the day, the profits on that business are very strong, and we talked about that. We guided to certain numbers. We guided conservatively is what we did in retrospect.","So, running that business as a business that we're going to invest in, that we're going to look to grow and so forth, was part of our plans all along. So, there's nothing additional there. We have done a nice job in terms of hiring people. We have 40 reps by the end of this month on the street selling. Probably two-thirds of those reps are old PARAGARD reps. So, they are going to be able to get going fairly quickly. So, anticipating an okay second quarter, some acceleration improvement as we get Q3 and Q4 and that helping to drive additional bottom-line profitability.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Your line is open.","Brian Weinstein","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. First, maybe we can start on APAC. Can you talk about the strong growth there? Maybe break that down by geography and products, obviously, you had some new product launches? But can you give us a little bit of context around that and what we should be expecting from APAC for the rest of the year?","Robert Weiss","Yes, APAC has continued and will continue to perform well. A lot of that is we're hitting on all fours there -- or all cylinders there. In Japan, we're doing well with the whole MyDay family as well as some of our existing franchise products, Biofinity and specialty Torics, if you will. I probably shouldn't use the word specialty when I talk about Torics and multifocal anymore. But basically, compared to sphere, they're also viewed as specialty lens, soft lenses.","The rest of Asia-Pac, particularly China, where we have a lot of momentum now, is a process of getting products through the registration process that are coming on to that market with a lot of force behind them.","So, we're putting up -- the Chinese market is a stellar market, growing north of 16%. And we're growing much faster than the market by multiples, if you will. So, that's a catalyst. And then private label, as we reach around the world, there are certain large global retailers that are also moving into the Asia-Pac theater. So, a lot of good things going on in. So, I would expect solid numbers to continue.","Brian Weinstein","Okay, great. And then a follow-up. You talked about the positive dynamics in the back half of the year in the Americas. But can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape? Bausch seems like they've launched a new product recently. Alcon stabilizing. Both those companies appear to be poised to launch additional products later on this year. So, can you give us just your thoughts on what that competitive situation looks like and how that factored into how you think about Americas' growth for the rest of the year. Thanks.","Robert Weiss","Yes, I think the numbers that I saw from Bausch were underwhelming. Clearly, they showed three of their lead products totaling up to $139 million this year and last year. And so that seemed to be a flat number to me.","The -- they've been working ULTRA for a long time. I think there is a [Indiscernible] of come up with a whole new manufacturing platform, which I'm not aware of. I don't know how effectively you can take an ULTRA, put a new name on it or do what J&J did, which is just be honest and say it's OASYS, now it's OASYS one-day. ULTRA now is ULTRA one-day.","I don't know that they have the cost structure to do anything meaningful given the expensive equipment they're manufacturing product on with ULTRA. So, I think that's a major barrier they will continue to have to deal with.","Alcon is, yes, kind of tweaking a couple of things. But they have a lot of mature products. They're immensely exposed in the one-day mass market with DAILIES AquaComfort Plus.","And if they do in fact bring a silicone hydrogel one-day into the mass market, we would love it. So, I'm hoping they do it because that will put a $1 billion product in play and they'll have to start talking about the benefits of oxygen, which we're firm believers in. And then we won't be the only one trying to talk up the need for oxygen in the one-day silicone -- in the one-day market, if you will.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joanne Wuensch","Good evening. And I will also congratulate both Bob and Al on their future endeavors. Al, you're stuck with us a while longer.","Robert Weiss","Thank you so much.","Joanne Wuensch","Anyway, can we spend a minute on gross margins, please? Because there is a -- it was a nice, strong gross margin quarter. What are the puts and takes that brought you to that number? And could you give us a sense of how you see the remainder of the year rolling out particularly with the shift in the British pound?","Albert White","Yes. So, I'll comment a few things, Joanne. I mean, obviously, we'd take the easy ones first. CooperSurgical is driven heavily by PARAGARD. If we exclude PARAGARD the gross margins for surgical, we're around 60%. So, pretty similar to what they were last year. PARAGARD's pulling that business up as gross margins at the 90s.","If we look at CooperVision, the pound definitely helped. I mean, so we had, in that range, we have a 400 basis point improvement, about half of that coming from the pound. And then you look at the remaining portion, about two-thirds of that was coming from product mix and that's a combination of things. It's obviously Biofinity, which is a great product, continues to grow and has high margins for us.","The Avaira to Avaira Vitality transition, we've talked about that in the past and the magnitude that, that delivers to gross margins. We're starting to see that starting to come through the P&L and there's more of that to come.","And then general manufacturing efficiency improvements is what I call them. We spent some quarters over the last few years talking about things like inventory write-outs, or asset write-outs, idle equipment and so forth. Some of those charges that go into our other cost of goods. And we talked about how we were going to move through those, and it was going to result in improved gross margins in the future. Well, we're seeing that.","So, it's kind of this stuff that we've laid out in the past. So, a very nice quarter. We're anticipating gross margins continuing to be strong. As a matter of fact, we're looking at somewhere around 68% for this full year. So, we'll get our usual kind of ups and downs, but the trend is pretty good for gross margins in both vision and surgical.","Robert Weiss","I would just add one thing. As a reminder, as we transition from Avaira to Avaira Vitality, that was a gross margin play and that was a substantial gross margin play. So, as each quarter goes by, we get more the benefits of that.","And a year ago, you may also recall that Brexit timing played a little into Q1, particularly November and December, which finally anniversaried post six month, if you will, in the end of December. So, a lot of where we are today is sustainable and that conversion to Avaira Vitality will continue to show positive effects.","Joanne Wuensch","As my follow-up question, CSI, the problem in the genetics business, how do you anticipate that being resolved? And do you anticipate that the core business turns positive at any stage during the fiscal year? Thank you.","Albert White","Yes, so within fertility, there's really two pieces to that. There is the fertility solutions business, if you will, which is medical device products, media, a variety of other products that would be kind of more your traditional medical device products. That part of the business has been doing well for many years. It did well again in this quarter. The future certainly looks bright when it comes to that part of the business. And all the demographics, the trends and so forth from a geographic perspective, things look good. So, feel good about that, feel good about the growth and the margins and so forth, that piece of the business.","If we look at the genetic testing piece of the business, we started seeing some very significant competitive pricing pressure last summer and it continued and it even became more aggressive. And I scratch my head over some of it, to be completely honest with you, and I don't really understand the thinking behind working to just increase testing volume. It's kind of like the old days of the Internet of just trying to get more people to come to your website. But that's a direction that's gone.","Now, when we look at it, that's an important part of fertility. It's used within IVF clinics. We're going to maintain our genetic testing business. It's great with our fertility solutions piece.","Having said that, we are not going to sit here and run unprofitable businesses where we're looking at negative gross margins and so forth. So, we're going to run a good, intelligent business. I think that's going to result -- assuming everything holds true from a competitive perspective, it's going to result in some challenging numbers and that will be -- Q2 will probably be the worst of it and then bad in Q3 and then kind of better in Q4 because we started seeing some of that genetic pricing pressure in Q4, then it annualizes and will move back to much better fertility numbers.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line with Matthew O'Brien of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Matthew O'Brien","Afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions and best of luck, Bob, in the retirement. Just as far as the commentary, I think maybe, Al, you were talking about it or maybe it's Bob, as far as the rate changes potentially easing some of the ordering OUS and then brought back to the U.S., did I understand that correctly?","And then in the future, is there a way to kind of close that loop, so that your distributors can't be buying OUS then bringing it back to the U.S. and potentially having a little bit of a margin headwind for you?","Robert Weiss","Yes. The real world is as long as we have foreign currency moving, you can't eliminate all of it. Having said that, we've spent a lot of time and energy building systems that quickly identify those outlets that are buying to basically support a retailer that's buying outside the U.S. So, the sooner you close that off, the more you minimize that.","So, our systems have gotten much better. The dollar's headed the right way. So, that will affect minimization to begin with even if you did nothing. And I'm optimistic it will be a little bit more stable even if foreign exchange rates move erratically in the future. But I'd prefer a nice stable exchange rate than one that goes all over the map, quite frankly.","Matthew O'Brien","Fair enough. And then as the follow-up, just talking about the MyDay Toric launch. I'd love to hear a little bit more about how that went, how many of your customers have access to that at this point?","And then there should be somewhat of a halo effect as you have the Toric, just opportunities to maybe open some new accounts now that you have sphere and Toric with MyDay.","Robert Weiss","Yes. Yes, I won't get into all the specifics of how many accounts we've rolled out to. But we're really1 month into it in January. And you're right, we're expecting and we're starting to see the halo effect ripple from the -- into the MyDay sphere and particularly as we get into the premium part of the market since we're two-tiered, that is showing its effects. So, we're very optimistic. I would say we're in the -- we're early in the first inning is where we are.","Matthew O'Brien","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Pasquale of Guggenheim. Your line is open.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks and congrats, Al and Bob. So, one question on PARAGARD and another bigger picture topic. So, first, can you talk a bit about the go-to-market strategy for PARAGARD? I understand it's a large product. But I would have thought that part of the appeal of adding it to your existing portfolio would have been leveraging some of your existing sales resources and call points. So, why build out a separate salesforce dedicated just to that product? And how big does that team ultimately need to be?","Albert White","That's a great question, Chris. Yes, you're absolutely right. We acquired that product and we took a look at it and said we could sell that through our existing sales force, which sells a lot of EndoSee, our disposable hysteroscope and some other products we have. It looked like a pretty good natural fit. And we went down that path initially.","The -- you remember The New England Journal of Medicine came out with a big study on hormonal contraceptive. There's some moves in direction that certainly indicated that if we take the right moves and we invest properly and take the right actions, that we can improve our market share within the IUD space, and that's a very profitable product, obviously. So, anything we can do to drive growth there is very advantageous for us.","So, what we've done is we've taken a look at the market. We've added about the 40 salespeople we talked about. That does not cover the entire market. It covers -- let's just call it, half of the market roughly. We're going to take a look and see how they do and what kind of performance, what kind of return we get from the salespeople. And hopefully, it's very strong. And hopefully, communicating the message is going to result in higher sales.","And if it does, we could look to add salespeople to that and I don't know if we'll add another 20 or 30 or something like that, but that's possible. So, we'll look at that. And if it doesn't pan out, then maybe we won't.","So, I think from that perspective, some of its changing dynamics since we acquired that business. It's looking better than -- the opportunities are looking better than we first acquired it. So, we're not going to skimp on dollars here early. We're going to try to take advantage of that.","Chris Pasquale","Does that change at all the original accretion estimate and what you thought it could contribute this year?","Albert White","No, I would say from the estimates that we provided to you, the $0.70 to $0.75, we were looking to exceed those even with the investments.","Chris Pasquale","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then you highlighted rising rates as a bit of an offset to some of the earnings tailwinds you have today versus when you first guided. Given what we're seeing with rates broadly, any thought about capital structure and whether floating rate debt is in the right place for Cooper to be?","Albert White","Yes, we go back and forth on that. We've had fixed rate debt in the past and we've had floating rate debt. Right now, and actually, for many years now, we've had floating rate debt. So, our strategy right now is to continue to keep it floating. We generate a lot of cash as a company. We look to invest that if we can in different opportunities.","If not, then we always go to our default position, which is to pay back debt. And so we have a lot of cash to be able to pay that debt. So, the plan right now, continue to let it flow and see if we can start knocking it down.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Matt Mishan of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys. This is Brett standing in for Matt. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. First, I was hoping if you could give us a little bit more color on the investment you made in the salesforce last year? Specifically, how the investment was allocated geographically and if you're getting the kind of payback you expected so far from the U.S. reps?","And then if I could ask one more. If you could give us a sense of the size of LensFerry at this point. We found a sales figure and maybe just the number of eye care professionals that you're currently working with here. Thanks very much.","Robert Weiss","Sure. The -- we started about 18 months ago, the process of expanding our feet on the street. And it -- prior to that, we had already started with some of our international locations like Asia-Pac, where we've been getting a good return. We continue down that path on a global basis. So, it's not only the U.S., it's also the European market as well as continuing in the Asian market. And we believe the payback is solid. Overall, we look at -- at it on a global basis when we see the 7% trailing 12 months versus the 5%. The fact that we've been growing much faster than the market.","Relative to the U.S., the U.S. is distorted in terms of results, in terms of the revenue reported for the reasons I just articulated on gray market and some of the tougher comps. But when we look through that, we're happy with the return we're getting. I'm not going to get into exact numbers other than say that we've grown our sales force about 24% since we started the activity in July of 2016. So, a substantial investment has been put in and we're happy with the return we're getting and we expect to continue to get that return going forward.","As far as LensFerry, I won't get into the details other than to say we are making good progress with that. There are a lot of independents that see the value of having a better alliance with our customer base. There are obviously are a lot of consumers that like the concept. So, it's built a lot of momentum.","And with LensFerry, we're offering it to even our competitors. So, it isn't all about us locking in only our own business. It's something that we're sponsoring the -- our alliance with the independent eye care professional and all professionals. It's certainly available to retailers also.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Robbie Marcus","Thanks and Al, Bob, I'll add the congratulations on your next chapters. Maybe -- just maybe picking at the numbers a bit. But if I look at Americas' pro forma growth, up 3% and then down 3% on a calendar basis, is there anything to read into that with maybe stronger trends in the January month?","Robert Weiss","The -- let's put it this way. A combination of the trend line and the sorting through gray market activity in the year-over-year comps. You're right, January was pretty robust. And therefore, deleting up -- deleting October and adding January was a real plus on a year-over-year basis.","Robbie Marcus","Okay. And then Al as I think about the increased FX, can you help us maybe as it flows through the gross margin and then the EPS, the cadence through the year and anything that we should be aware of in terms of anomalies? Thanks.","Albert White","Yes, probably not too much. When you kind of look at the model, it's kind of interesting how it's spread. From what it was when we initially gave guidance to where it is today, the improvement in currency kind of flows through on a consistent basis, Q2, Q3, Q4. So, not a lot of change from the kind of cadence we talked about at December, interestingly enough.","So, I wouldn't particularly highlight an anomaly associated with that necessarily. I did kind of make the comment on Q2 being a little bit closer to Q1 from an EPS perspective for a couple of different factors, maybe a little bit of strength on the EPS side in Q3 off that, but nothing too major to highlight off that.","Robbie Marcus","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Anthony Petrone of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks. And congratulations, Bob, and good luck with golf going forward and good luck, Al, on your new role. I wish you best success. Two quick questions. Just on monthlies. Just an update there. The Biofinity family specifically, you sort of expanded that with Energys and XR. And then of course, you had competition from Vita. So, anything just on monthly as it looks to us that actually, sequentially, it improved from the levels in fiscal 4Q.","And then the follow-up question would be on the overall operating margin. And so the presentation that you have out there, the investor presentation, still calls for 28% by fiscal 2021, and we're sort of approaching that in the first fiscal quarter of 2018. So, maybe just how do we think about margins kind of over the next three years just given where we are today. Thanks again.","Robert Weiss","So, I'll do the Biofinity a little and let Al defend the operating margin outlook. Biofinity, you're absolutely right. We've gotten momentum going on a global basis. Energys has afforded a door opener, extended range, afforded more of a door opener. So, it's clear, a lot of people were kind of being left out of a good product. So, as you expand the Toric range, it really enhances what you have to offer and you then approach something Cooper used to do a lot of in the past, which is flat out custom making a lens for a consumer, which a lot of eye care professionals love the ability to service a much broader or their entire customer base.","So, that's why Biofinity is doing great. It's a great lens. The designs, particularly the multifocal and the Toric designs are terrific. It's a great material. So, it has a lot going for us. Relative to operating margins, Al, you want to talk about them?","Albert White","Yes, I mean, operating margins, as you continue to improve. We're obviously guiding this year to that kind of 28.5% range and we anticipate continuing to have operating margin expansion for a number of different reasons.","So, if I had to look at that and maybe we will fine-tune some of this as we move forward here. But if I roll that out five years to kind of the 2022 time frame that we talk about, for us to be in that 32% range, somewhere in there, it's probably a pretty good way to look at it. We look at pretty solid, consistent operating margin improvements on an annual basis. So, I would anticipate that to continue.","Anthony Petrone","Thanks again. And congratulations to you both.","Robert Weiss","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Steve Willoughby","Hi good evening guys. Bob, I just want to say it's been a pleasure working with you over the years. And Al, I wish you good luck in your new role.","Robert Weiss","Thank you.","Steve Willoughby","Sure. Two questions for you. First, I look at the numbers you provide as it relate to your growth in the market on a calendar basis. It looks like your overall contact lens business has grown in line with the market for two quarters in a row now. Just wondering if you could comment on that? Any thoughts on that?","And then secondly, Al, how much did FX benefit EPS here in the first quarter? Just trying to think through your guidance now of, I think, $0.78 for the full year. Just curious on how much that helped during the first quarter and maybe how that compared to what you're expecting coming into the quarter?","Albert White","Yes, I'll answer that one and I'll let Bob take the other question on the market growth. So, Steve, on FX, it helped incremental $0.11 roughly from when we gave guidance. So, of the Q1, when we look at it, it was about $0.33 in Q1 positive on a year-over-year basis. It's finished about $0.44 positive. So that was the pick-up, if you will, within Q1.","If you look at it for the full year, we kind of talked about the $0.40 pick-up, which would mean $0.29 in Q2 to Q4, kind of spread evenly through those quarters.","Steve Willoughby","Perfect. Thank you.","Robert Weiss","Yes. And in terms of the five versus five and the seven versus seven, if you will, the last two quarters. One is, last quarter, seven was a pretty robust number for good reasons being led by J&J and some of what they're doing. So they've kind of stepped up the industry growth there.","We've always emphasized that you should look at it on a trailing 12-month basis. On a one-quarter basis, we have some pretty tough comps with having put up double-digits for two quarters in a row last year. In the fourth quarter of 2016 and in the first quarter of 2017 were double-digit growth for Cooper. So, our comp is a little tougher there and why the trailing 12 months is a more meaningful figure than the one quarter.","Steve Willoughby","Okay. Thanks Bob.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, this does conclude the Q&A session. I'd like to turn the conference over to Robert Weiss for closing remarks.","Robert Weiss","Well, I want to thank everyone for their thoughts and certainly support all of the expectations we have for the new incoming CEO. No pressure, Al. And we look forward to updating you on our second quarter results in June, I think, Kim -- I look at Kim because I just forgot -- the date is June 8th, I'm sorry -- June, what did I say? June 7th. On June 7th, we'll update you -- see quickly we forget -- we'll update you on the second quarter results and look forward to it.","With that, that concludes the call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

Well we're back on track with another great quarter. We're executing our strategy that has been in place for the past five years. We're accomplishing our long-term objectives, taking market share, posting gross margin expansion, delivering double-digit earnings per share growth and delivering free cash flow.","For the quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 8%, 9% organic constant currency. For the quarter, we delivered GAAP earnings per share of $1.36, up 51% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.45, up 26% versus the prior year. Our non-GAAP trailing 12 months, earnings per share is now $5.15. For the quarter, we delivered free cash flow of $63 million and trailing 12-month free cash flow of $225 million.","For the quarter, we accomplished our long-term objective by acquiring Origio an IVF company, reaching out beyond the U.S. for CooperSurgical and achieving the number one position in worldwide IVF marketplace.","Some highlights and key events, during Q3 '12, we amended our credit agreement increasing it to a $1 billion line of credit, lowering our borrowing grid, eliminating our term loans and extending our line of credit to May of 2017 for an additional 16 months.","We closed on the acquisition of Origio, an IVF or in-vitro fertilization company, which adds $60 million-plus in annualized revenue to CooperSurgical. We re-launched Avaira Toric, initiated the limited launch of a one-day silicone hydrogel into Europe and rolled out a novel one-day multifocal Proclear 1 day multifocal.","Our silicone hydrogel continues to take significant share and now accounts for 38% of CooperVision's revenue achieving $118 million in revenue, and up 35% in constant currency versus the prior year.","Leveraging our free cash flow and a weak stock, we took the opportunity and bought 321,000 shares of stock using $25 million. This brought our fiscal year 2012 purchases to 984,000 shares using $71 million of free cash flow.","On sales results, our silicone hydrogel family is driving growth. During the third quarter, our silicone hydrogel family continued on its path of sponsoring our revenue growth. Silicone revenues were $118 million. Our silicone family grew 35% in constant currency. The family now reflects 38% of CooperVision sales, in July we launched Biofinity Multifocal in Japan recording our first sales.","Our Avaira Toric roll out constrained by capacity limitations is taking place over several months. It is progressing nicely. Avaira targets the U.S. so called two-week market owned by Johnson & Johnson's OASYS and ACUVUE ADVANCE. As a result, we expect the product family to be focused on gaining share as opposed to trading up. While we are excited about the re-launch, we are going to be cautious in not overextending our capacity limitations.","Geographically, foreign exchange has become a large headwind. Foreign exchange negatively impacted CooperVision's sales by 5% or approximately $14 million. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange essentially all the euro, our growth at CooperVision would have been 10% in constant currency. Regionally, we delivered solid results in constant currency, Americas was up 11% in constant currency, EMEA 6%, Asia-Pac 16%, overall 10%.","Our growth drivers were in the Americas trading up to Biofinity, including the success of Biofinity Multifocal as well as solid performance in the 1 Day category contributed by Proclear one-day Sphere. EMEA, same as the Americas. Biofinity, its entire line of Spheres, Toric and Multifocal as well as Proclear 1 Day Sphere. In Asia-Pac, primarily Biofinity Sphere, Proclear 1 Day and other 1 Day Spheres and 1 Day Toric.","The worldwide soft contact lens market in the calendar second quarter 2012 was up 5%, while CooperVision was up 9%. On a trailing 12-month basis, the market was up 5%. On a trailing 12-month basis, we were up 9% on the strength of Biofinity and Proclear 1 Day. For the calendar quarter, the market growth was sponsored by torics one-day and multifocal.","While the CLI data or Contact Lens Institute stopped reporting the growth of silicone hydrogel, mostly likely the trade up of material remains a high growth material area. We were up 34% in constant currency for the calendar quarter. The market continues to be a trade up market where geographic expansion is an accelerating contributor.","Trading up includes the premium products; silicone hydrogels, torics and multifocals. The trade up to silicone hydrogel is in the 20% to 40% range. More importantly a trade up to the 1 Day disposable expands per patient revenue by 400% to 600%. Importantly, the 1 Day, where it generates 300%, to 500% more profit.","Also, it's important to understand that torics and multifocals have a long way to go in capturing the market outside the United States. Geographically, the strength of the Americas was up 8% during the calendar quarter, led to an overall 5% market growth worldwide.","CooperSurgical, our women's healthcare franchise, had a solid quarter with $64 million in revenue. Revenue growth of 20% reflected the July acquisition of Origio, which contributed $5.6 million in revenue, excluding acquisitions CooperSurgical grew 6% during the quarter.","In addition to acquisitions, drivers of growth continue to be weighted toward surgical procedures, hospital and same-day surgery, where revenue was up 16%. As a result of the Origio acquisition, we will see a shift in our product mix and a shift in our geographic mix. Product mix will move to about 31%, surgical procedures 27% IVF, and 42% office.","Concurrently, CooperSurgical geographic mix outside the U.S. will about double to 29%. Suffice to say, we are excited to have closed on Origio. This makes us a clear number one in the in-vitro fertilization or IVF market. Origio is a very global business with 73% of its revenue outside the Americas. They have expanded their direct presence into Japan, China, India and Russia among others. The global phenomena of delaying child birthing until the age when pregnancy becomes a challenge makes us a very exiting quality of life add to our women's healthcare franchise.","Back to the quarterly results. CooperSurgical put up solid ratios, excluding a one-time time acquisition cost. On a non-GAAP basis, CooperSurgical's gross profit percent was 67%, while the operating income margin was solid 25%.","On guidance, while we have had to hurdle significant headwinds from foreign exchange or the euro, if you will, we have delivered solid growth numbers. Our original constant currency revenue has remained solid with CooperVision achieving 10% constant currency in the third quarter of 2012.","Our guidance range for CooperVision revenue for fiscal year 2012 has been narrowed and the guidance for CooperSurgical has been increased to reflect the original acquisition. As a result, overall revenue guidance for the fiscal year 2012 is now $1,439,000 to $1,449,000.","Given our strong operating results for the third quarter 2012, we have increased our non-GAAP earnings per share to $5.19 to $5.24. This guidance reflects tempered earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter given tough comps with the prior year for the hurdle of the ongoing euro headwinds for the next six months, increasing costs for the Avaira re-launch as well as the roll out cost of our single-use silicone hydrogel.","While it's a bit early given these factors as well as Origio as an early post-acquisition phase, to put too much color into 2013, we do expect continued momentum going forward with earnings per share growth in the low double-digit range. Keep in mind, in 2013, we also have the hurdle of the 2.3% tax on women's healthcare products in the United States.","Our strategy, we continue with our successful strategy. We believe it is solid and it has delivered results. CooperSurgical is putting up outstanding results and is leveraging its infrastructure. This franchise was built with the solid understanding of the value of critical mass in a women's healthcare market targeting the OB\/GYNs. We follow the professional wherever they go; the office, surgery center, hospital or IVF centers.","Although the call points are different for each, the leverage is considerable. CooperSurgical third quarter '12 gross margin was 67%, operating margins 25%. Due to minimal CapEx CooperSurgical is a significant contributor to our free cash flow. We are dedicated to the strategy and we'll continue to tuck into tuck-in acquisitions to leverage the CooperSurgical structure.","At CooperVision, the strategy is more complex and it is much more global in nature. The $7 billion soft contact lens industry, because of the uniqueness of our manufacturing platforms product portfolio, we are the only participant that aggressively promotes silicone hydrogel and non-silicone hydrogel products, that is the Proclear family, emphasis branded and non-branded products. No, private label does not mean lowered price. Actively promotes and specializes in custom lenses with a high gross profit of course, supports all modalities that eye care professionals prescribe one-day, two-week and monthly lenses and supports all types of lenses spheres, torics and multifocals.","With close to 30% share on the high growth specialty lens categories, torics and multifocal, it is acknowledged by eye care professionals that we are pretty good at specialty contact lenses. Few would challenge why the success of Biofinity Toric for astigmatism. Put a great design together with a great material and great things happen. We have seen similar successes for the same reason with Biofinity Multifocal, which hit the market in the middle of last year.","On the capacity front, with the exception of Avaira Toric, we are ahead of plan to deliver considerably more product where we had been previously supply constrained. The Biofinity family, Proclear one-day, our one-day Torics are all ramping up nicely. Our new challenge would be to ramp up one-day silicone hydrogel lenses.","On pricing, we, like the rest of the soft contact lens industry, have a trade up strategy. Our new wearers and existing wearers are targeted for silicone hydrogel lenses, the Proclear family and the one-day or single-use lenses. Each creates more revenue per wear. A one-day modality, for example, results in a four times to six times more revenue per wear.","While this strategy sacrifices the gross profit margin percent, it generates three times to five times more profit. Of course, this strategy competes head on with the lens care space, since we are shifting the wearers' resources from lens care to contact lenses only.","Competing for lens care dollars is more of problem for some of our competitors. In my opinion, we continue to be the most focused company in the industry lacking many of the distractions that some of our competitors are now going through. I might add with Biofinity, Avaira and Proclear, we have a lot to talk about with eye care professionals around the globe.","As we look down the road over the next several years, we expect to continue improving operating margins and delivering above average shareholder returns. We expect to continue to average double-digit earnings per share growth while investing in geographic expansion and new product development.","In today's market, we have a solid product portfolio to leverage in all modalities, multiple materials all men's types and we retain our expertise to emphasize customizing lenses for the 10% to 20% of those lens wearers requiring other than standard lens sizes or designs. We have a lot of work to do before we come anywhere close to having exploited our number one contact lens family Biofinity. This is particularly true when it comes to geographic expansion and fully developing the Biofinity family of torics and multifocals around the globe.","The same applies to Avaira, where the Avaira Sphere has been anxiously awaiting the re-launch of Avaira Toric. The combination will put us in much better position to exploit the U.S. two-week space owned by Johnson & Johnson and to also exploit our private label strategy more aggressively with this family.","While we already have pretty respectable gross profit and operating margins, from a cost perspective, we have considerable upside yet to be fully developed. Upsides include the elimination of the silicone hydrogel royalty with the expiration of patents in September 2014 in the United States and in March 2016 in the rest of the world.","The reduction of our manufacturing costs among other things, improving molding cycle times, increasing capacity utilization and improving yields in general. Each of these are key goals to us. Also, given the considerable amount of free cash flow we generate, we will continue to look for tuck-in acquisitions and geographic expansion opportunities like Origio in our two businesses. The requirements, however, is that they must exceed our minimum investment hurdle rates. Additionally, the market for both, women's healthcare and silicone hydrogel lenses are much less developed outside the U.S.","We generate a considerable amount of cash offshore due in part to our level of manufacturing outside the U.S. As such, we will continue to be aggressively invested in global expansion opportunities. With over 95% of the people on the planet outside the U.S., we believe we will find opportunities to invest in other countries for decades to come, thereby retaining our low effective tax rate indefinitely. Finally, as was the case in the first quarter and again in this quarter, when the stock was suppressed we even demonstrated, we are at times even willing to buy in some of our own stock.","In summary, before I turn it over to Greg, the third quarter of 2012 was another solid quarter. We continue to exceed market growth. Additionally, we put up solid revenue growth, improved our gross profit and operating margins versus the prior year, delivered solid free cash flow and even restructured and extended our now investment grade debt.","We hit some exciting milestones by launching Avaira Toric or re-launching Avaira Toric, and rolling out two new products Proclear 1 Day Mulifocal and 1 Day silicone hydrogel in Europe. CooperSurgical stepped up to about $300 million annualized run rate in revenue with its Origio acquisition and we now have a solid number one position in the $223 million worldwide IVF market, which grew 12% globally last calendar year.","We continue to make inroads in expanding into other geographic markets with good progress in China and its surrounding regions. In spite of an economy that remains sluggish, we remain as an industry recession-resistant and believe, consistent with the past 30-plus years, our industry will remain so into the future. Last, least I forget to remind you, our number one asset is our dedicated employees. They continue to deliver results even in poor economic times. To them, once again a big thank you.","With that, I will turn it over to Greg.","Greg Matz","Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Bob has given you a pretty thorough overview of our revenue picture. As he mentioned, Origio is included in our Q3 results. Looking at gross margins, in Q3 the consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins were 63.5%, compared with 58% for GAAP and 62% non-GAAP in Q3, last year.","Remember now, last year's third quarter gross margins were impacted by the Avaira Toric recall for $14.2 million, which included $13.7 million in cost of goods sold for inventory reserves and $500,000 for return provisions, which were excluded from the non-GAAP gross profit last year. As you can see, we had a solid gross margin quarter in line with our expectations.","CooperVision on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, reported a gross margin just under 63% versus 56% for GAAP, and 61% for non-GAAP in Q3, last year. As I just mentioned, the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP was the impact of the Avaira Toric recall.","CooperSurgical had a gross margin of 67%, which compares to Q3 '11 of 65%. The continued year-over-year improvements were mainly due to manufacturing efficiencies and favorable product mix, especially in the surgical space. Origio had about a negative 60-basis point impact on Q3 gross margins for CooperSurgical. From a guidance perspective, we are not changing our consolidated annual gross margin guidance of 63.5% to 64.5%, or 64%, but we would expect to be at the high end of the range.","Now, looking at operating expenses, our SG&A in Q3 on a GAAP basis, SG&A expenses increased by 8% from Q3 last year to $143.8 million and were 38% of revenue, same as prior year. On a non-GAAP basis after excluding acquisition cost, primarily investment banking and legal fees for the Origio deal, SG&A expenses increased 5% from Q3 last year to $139.8 million or 37% of revenue, down 100 basis points from last year.","Beginning in 2011, we have seen increased selling investment in both, CooperVision as well as CooperSurgical. Last year, we shared with you that we would be investing in this area. That investment resulted in some large year-over-year growth increases in the first half of 2012 due to our ramp up of spending which began in Q2 '11, which resulted in a run rate impact on Q1 and Q2 2012.","Now, in 2013, we start to see those 2011 investments in both years, which as you can see has reduced the year-over-year growth rates. As kind of a follow-on, SG&A on a non-GAAP basis increased only 2%, sequentially.","On the R&D front. In Q3, R&D increased by 12% year-over-year to $13.2 million, or up about 1.4 million and was 3.5% of revenue, up from 3.3% in Q3 '11. This increase is mainly attributable to additional staffing in both businesses as well as a variety of spending on new product development and clinicals. We would expect that R&D will grow faster than sales for the remainder of the year.","Total operating expenses were 43% of revenue, similar to Q3 '11 and grew at about 8%. We are starting to see leveraging in the second half, and we continue to expect operating expenses to finish the year in the range of 43% to 44% of revenue. Our depreciation and amortization in Q3, depreciation was $21.9 million, up $2.1 million or 10% year-over-year and amortization was $5.9 million, up 400 K or 7% year-over-year for total of $27.8 million. The current estimate for the annual impact of Origio on our amortization is approximately $8 million and we took about $643,000 into our Q3 amortization number.","Moving to operating margins, for Q3 consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $77.3 million, or 20% of revenue versus $52 million, or 15% of revenue in Q3 '11. This represents a 49% increase in operating income over Q3 '11. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the Origio acquisition costs in the current year and the $14.2 million impact of the Avaira Toric recall in Q3 '11, operating income and margin were $81.3 million, or 21.5% of revenue versus 19% in the prior year. Interest expense was $2.3 million and we were expecting or are expecting Q4 '12 to be approximately $2.5 million. This should bring in the year on a non-GAAP basis to be about $11.5 million to $12 million for the year.","As we mentioned last quarter, we amended our senior unsecured credit facility. You can read the details in our 8-K filed on May 31st. We took advantage of our S&P credit upgrade to investment grade to strengthen our capital structure. The amended facility is slightly larger, offers better pricing and maturity has been extended to May 31, 2017.","In Q3, on a GAAP basis, we wrote off $1.4 million in unamortized debt issuance costs from the prior refinancing, which can be seen in the loss on extinguishment of debt line. Included in the other expense income line is, approximately $2.3 million of FX losses. As you'll remember from a few months ago, we experienced relatively sizable currency moves especially with the euro. This resulted in some FX losses associated with our intercompany loans. We do our best to minimize these types of losses or gains through our balance sheet hedging program, but we do experience fluctuations every quarter, so we will always have some gains or losses. Last year's third quarter showed a gain of approximately $500,000.","On July 11, we announced that in conjunction with the voluntary public tender offer announced on June 4th of this year, that we completed the purchase of approximately 97% of the issued shares outstanding of Origio, a leading global in-vitro fertilization medical device company for an enterprise value of approximately $197 million, including $147.4 million in cash assumed $45.4 million of net debt, which was repaid shortly after the completion of the deal and approximately $4.5 million yet to be paid as of July 31st for the remaining shares. We are in the process of formally transferring all remaining shares to the company, which should happen by the end of the calendar year. As Bob mentioned, we are excited to strengthen our position in the IVF business. This deal provided an excellent opportunity to expand our women's healthcare franchise while using our significant offshore cash. For more details on this transaction, see our 8-K filed on July 11th.","Looking at our effective tax rate, in Q3, the GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate was 6.2% and 6.1%, respectively versus Q3 '11 GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate of 10% and 11.2%. As we've discussed before, the effective tax rate continues to be below the U.S. statutory rate as majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. We did see significant one-time benefits due to changes in the U.K. tax rate from 25% to 23%, which was enacted on July 17th this year, as well as other positive impacts to our deferred tax liabilities. Without these one-time items the effective tax rate would have been approximately 10% for the quarter.","We are expecting our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q4 in the range of 9.5% to 10.5%, and the year to be in the range of 9% to 10%. For those of you following the stock comp, our stock-option compensation in Q3 was $4.6 million. EPS, as Bob mentioned, our Q3 EPS on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis was $1.36 and the $1.45, respectively versus $0.90 and $1.15 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in Q3 '11.","On December 15, 2011, we announced that the company's board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program of up to 150 million. As of the end of the first quarter, the company purchased approximately 663,000 shares of the company's common stock for $46.1 million at an average purchase price of $69.58 per share.","In July, the company purchased an additional 321,000 shares of the company's stock for $25 million, at an average purchase price of $77.89 per share. This quarter's share repurchase due to the timing had no notable impact on EPS this quarter. The entire program is expected to have about $0.06 impact for the year.","Looking at the balance sheet, in Q3, we had cash provided by operations of $78.1 million. Our capital expenditures $24.1 million, insurance recovery of $1.9 million and excluding professional fees on the Origio acquisition of $7 million results in about $62.9 million of free cash flow.","Total debt increased within the quarter by $161 million to $480.1 million as a result of our purchase of Origio in July. Debt as a percent of the total capitalization is now 19%. This leaves us with approximately $546 million of total credit available at July 31st.","Inventories increased by $15.6 million from last quarter of which $9.3 million is directly related to Origio. For the quarter, we are seeing months on hand at 6.6 months, up from months on hand at 4.9 months in Q3 '11, or if you adjust it for the Avaira recall, it would have been 5.9 months on hand.","Excluding Origio, the majority of the inventory increase is primarily due to our single-use silicone lens ramp-up and our Biofinity Toric product. Accounts receivable continues to be closely monitored with DSOs at 52 days, down from 55 days, last year.","With that let me turn it back to Kim.","Kim Duncan","Operator, I think, we are ready for some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question today is from the line of Kim Gailun with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kim Gailun - JPMorgan","I guess if I am limited to one question, I'd like to pick up on the 2013 commentary that you made in your prepared comments Bob. You made a comment there expecting another year of low double-digit EPS growth and then you noted the Medtech Tax there for women's health, so I just wanted to clarify that you're talking about double-digit EPS growth despite the tax and currency headwinds.","Bob Weiss","That's correct.","Kim Gailun - JPMorgan","Okay. Great. If I could squeeze in a follow-up, just curious with the new product launches in the quarter, so silicone hydrogel daily and then re-launch of Avaira Toric. Could you guys quantify the impact of those two in the quarter?","Bob Weiss","Yes. New products was fairly de minimis in terms of impacting top line growth. By de minimis, I mean, we got them up. We got products out the door. The impact on our third quarter was less than 1% in aggregate. 1% in the quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Lawrence Keusch with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Lawrence Keusch - Raymond James","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess just quickly here. With the Origio deal now being closed, obviously, good strategic acquisition for you guys, you used OUS cash but I'd love to get any thoughts on how you are thinking about the EPS accretion for next year. Then the other quick one is, just given all the startup expenses for Avaira, getting that out and the one-day silicone, I'm just curious how that impacted your gross margin. I'm just trying to understand what sort of underlying gross margin level you are going at right now.","Bob Weiss","Yes. As far as the impact of the Origio acquisition on 2013, we are still expecting it to be marginally accretive next year and near a breakeven this year as far as its impact on this year. Relative to Avaira Toric re-launch and the single-use silicone given the revenue so small on the quarter had marginal impact our margins for this period of time.","In the fourth quarter guidance as well as in our outlook for next year, assume that the re-launch of Avaira Toric, and the rollout of single-use silicone is going to be more certainly a negative in terms of margins since we are investing behind both, products. Since you may recall that Avaira Toric when we fixed the problem that led to the recall, it did result in a step back of efficiency of making that product ballpark 30%, so we do have to hurdle some of that going forward.","Longer term, we expect like anything else, we'll get more and more efficient yet getting some of those costs back, but short-term meaning over the next year, year-and-a-half, we are going to have some waitings on that which is built into our 2012 guidance and built into the comments I made about expecting a low double-digit growth in earnings per share next year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Thanks. Can you please comment on the competitive landscape? There is a lot of noise into quarter regarding some of your competitor product launches?","Bob Weiss","Yes. The competitor product launches, I would say, one of our competitors came out with a non-silicone hydrogel lens that thus far we haven't heard any catching momentum in the marketplace. Silicone hydrogel lenses in the one-day modality still are what I would call [nichey], while they are getting a lot of our noise it is more noise than results in terms of how it's impacting the entire market, so I think we have collectively more going on with the Proclear 1 Day Multifocal, which is getting a fair amount of positive reviews and we certainly can see some of its impact on our multifocal numbers. While it's early with our rollout of Biofinity, I mentioned Biofinity Multifocal, I should have said Biofinity Toric going into the Japanese market, so we have a plenty of new product activity out there more so than any of our competitors.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","If I can squeeze one in please? Origio, how much did that contributed in the quarter?","Bob Weiss","$5.6 million on the top line and negligible impact on the bottom line.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird. Please go ahead.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Two quick questions here. One on the Biofinity product line, 35% constant currency growth for this quarter. If I back out the Avaira side of that business, what did Biofinity itself grow, or can you at least ballpark? It's still up in the good 20%-plus range? Two, is the blended margin on that product, on the Biofinity family, if I try to roll all that together, is that north of 65% at this point?","Bob Weiss","Relative to gross margins for Biofinity, which is a monthly and is in the premium category, suffice it to say north of 65%. Relative to the growth of Biofinity, when compared to the overall growth of the silicone hydrogel family which is 35% worldwide, suffice it to say Biofinity's growing a lot faster than 35%.","Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird","Okay. Great. Then, last question just on your daily disposables business was up 13% constant currency this quarter. Obviously, the competitive daily silicone lenses have been out in Europe for at least nine months at this point from CIBA. Obviously, a couple of years for J&J, so that's at least some proxy. I would think, the European daily market, some proxy for what we could expect a year or two from now in the U.S, so what was your daily disposable business in Europe? How did it do this quarter against some of those competitive products?","Bob Weiss","Daily disposables in Europe certainly performed and held there. See, before I jump on that one. We held our own group. Well, I know what I need to do. I was almost going to give you the fact that it was fairly flat year-over-year, but that was only a result of foreign exchange, the euro. In constant currency, we certainly had the same growth rate in, let's say, double-digit growth in Europe in constant currency, so it held its own, meaning Proclear 1 Day is doing well in the one-day market, not only rest of the world but also in Europe.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Willoughby, Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Given the softer results you saw last quarter, I know you guys made the comments that you are going to tighten up expenses a little bit, which it looks like you guys did a good job of this quarter. I was just wondering what your thoughts were now that the revenue and organic growth came back this quarter. How are you guys are managing and how tight are you managing SG&A expenses?","Bob Weiss","We certainly, as the euro did its thing to our second quarter results, tightened our belt. To some degree, we tightened our belt, because we had been rapidly expanding our operating expenses investing in feet on the street, if you will, investing in R&D and investing in geographic expansion. Some of that we will continue to do.","The things that we went slower on were those that were easier things to do that didn't impact the business such as, instead of always getting on a plane and flying and having a face-to-face meeting, more conference calls. When you have lot of people crisscrossing the globe, if you put a cap on what's crucial to be face-to-face and what's not you can save fair amount of money.","Ultimately, you want people in front of people because they form better bonding and all that, so it is not you don't do forever, but you do that in short-term matters, if you will. I would say the things we did in the quarter by way of holding back expenses were easy to do as opposed to tough decisions in any reduction in force, if you will.","Going forward, there are areas that we clearly are intent on putting resources behind. I would say we are building some momentum in, for example, China, where we've hired a few key critical people to manage that process, so that will lead in more investment opportunity in China as we've started to build the infrastructure. That's been going on all along. We did not slow that up, we in fact hired the key people we needed over the last six months. That will continue to allow us to grow more in that area and invest more in that area.","We didn't want to get the carts in front of the horse and start hiring a bunch of people on feet on the street without having the management oversight. Relative to investment in new products and the re-launch of Avaira Toric, suffice it to say we will be over the next 12, 15 months investing fairly substantially in some of those areas, behind the new products.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matthew O'Brien, William Blair. Please go ahead.","Matthew O'Brien - William Blair","Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I was curious on the CVI guidance for Q4. When I look at the high end of the range, it imply the growth rate of around 5.5% which is basically what you just put up in fiscal Q3, even though the comparison gets a little bit easier here in Q4. I'm just curious why the caution into Q4 given the strong momentum you are seeing in the business?","Bob Weiss","Well, in our guidance obviously we had a fair amount of impact of foreign exchange in the third quarter $14 million and we expect substantially the same amount in the fourth quarter given year-over-year comp, so in organic constant currency, I think our guidance fits that range what we just delivered at the top end.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","On daily products, can you tell us a little bit about where the margins are? How the manufacturing is going? Is it still a drag on the margin? When you will get to stable margin there, and are you still capacity constrained for one-day. Then just lastly, for the Analyst Meeting next week, Bob, can you talk little bit about whether you give long-term financial goals and any other flavor? What we can expect from the meeting? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","As far as the gross margin of one-day's, in general, we've been doing a pretty good job of getting cost out. Keep in mind that the bulk of one-day product is essentially all non-silicone hydrogel, and that's a lot of Proclear 1 Day as well as some in Japan, for example, some products other than the Proclear material.","In both cases, both materials, Proclear and non-Proclear, we've done a good job of offsetting which has led to what I would call improvingly respectable one-day margins, but keep in mind those margins will still have a hard time of ever achieving that of a two-week or monthly. There is no expectation they'll get that high. There will always be, I think I used 50s, 60s, 70s example. Typically the one-day will be in the 50s, some place and you're doing good if you're in the top half of the 50s. Some of our products there in the two-weeks, you should be in the 60s-some place, and in the monthly you should be in the upper 60s, into the 70s usually.","In our case, Biofinity is the lead product, and we expect it to stay well north of the 70s, so the answer to that one-day, while it's becoming a bigger part of the overall mix, that's a negative on the positive. It is getting a better gross margin. We will step back relative to the rollout of the one-day silicone hydrogel. That is just not going to be a high gross margin product for the near future, if you will.","Analyst Meeting, we will give some flavor where we are going directionally, but we will not get into giving more color on, let's say, guidance on 2013. Directionally, we will talk about why we expect operating ratios to continue to improve into the future and put some color behind that, but a lot of it we will focusing on putting a lot more meat and color behind what we talk about our businesses, what they look like in more greater detail.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Cooley with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Chris Cooley - Stephens","Thank you and good evening for taking the questions. If you could Bob, could you tell us a little bit about the new product pipeline for Origio, products like EmbryoGen and EmbryoSure. Is that included in your guidance when you are thinking about the modest accretion for next year?","Then just for clarification if I can squeeze two in like everybody else? You said in your prepared comments that you were ahead of plan in terms of your manufacturing capacity on all, but one product now. Could you maybe just remind us again where you are in terms of production capabilities? Thanks so much.","Bob Weiss","Yes. On the Origio, of course, we haven't given revenue guidance for next year. We did indicate that from a accretion point of view it's accretive. There is no change to that and there is, in our underlying assumptions, no major product launches in 2013, but of course Origio is actively working on to have a R&D pipeline, if you will, that anticipate some new products coming through it. We will add a little bit of color to not only Origio, but rest of surgical at the Analyst Presentation, so that may lend some more thoughts in that line of questioning.","As far as the capacity, we are in good shape with capacity relative to most of our one-day line, axe silicone hydrogel. Meaning, the Proclear family as well as the other hydrogel families are not capacity constrained, Biofinity continues to ramp up nicely. We are not capacity constrained with Biofinity and we continue to endeavor to keep up with the growth curve, so when you have a business growing north of 35% constant currency, and you have lead capital requirements of 12 months-plus, then we stay on top of it from a CapEx point of view, which we are doing, so I don't anticipate that would, at this juncture catch us by surprise off of our product line with our silicone hydrogels doing north of $118 million, so now at a run rate of close to $500 million annualized. Assume that is predominately Biofinity gives you some gauge at the capacity we in that arena already.","The products where we are constrained is, the Avaira line not only constrained on the Toric, but somewhat on the sphere side, partly because we stepped back and gave up some productivity when we had the recall episode. Aside from that, we are ramping up in those areas and we are ramping up in the one-day silicone hydrogel modality.","I would assume both, Avaira Toric and the one-day silicone hydrogels will be somewhat constraint for at least the next 12 months in terms of our ability to sell all we can make, would be the case of the one-day silicone hydrogel more than 12 months.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Anthony Petrone with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Anthony Petrone - Jefferies","Thanks for taking my question. Just going to sneak a couple in there. One quick for Greg. The 9% to 10% tax rate guided for the fourth quarter. Is that reflective of noticeable benefits from Origio given their overseas revenues, and is that sort of the rate we should be thinking about for '13? I think it's down from 10% to 11%.","Then for Bob, just multifocals is a smaller portion of the overall business, but it's growing double the market based on the latest statistics of your businesses, is that mostly Biofinity related or Proclear related within the multifocal category? Thanks.","Greg Matz","Yes. For the tax rate, one, we're not giving guidance for next year at this point for the effective tax rate. Origio, we obviously just purchased Origio, we are evaluating their structure. They do have a lot offshore, but at this point we don't see a strong difference or strong impact to our tax rate. Again, we still are looking and evaluating that with our tax professionals and their rates to what extent is included in the 9.5% to 10.5% for the fourth quarter guidance that Bob mentioned or I mentioned earlier.","Bob Weiss","As far as the multifocal growth of course the market for the quarter was 11%, in the calendar quarter we were 31%. On a trailing 12-month basis the market growth for multi-focal was 10%. We grew 21%, 2x. The driver clearly is Biofinity Multifocal, and we are just starting to build momentum in our rollout of Proclear 1 Day Multifocal. That would have had insignificant impact given fairly small size in the last quarter on any of those numbers, so assume that essentially the trailing 12-month number is essentially all the Biofinity impact driving.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi. Please go ahead.","Amit Bhalla - Citi","Hi. Bob, I just had two quick ones. First on Origio. With the deal closing on July 11th, you booked $5.6 million in the last two weeks, so can you just explain how you booked that much in just two weeks?","Second on fiscal '13, since you indicated that you probably won't be talking much about guidance at the analyst meeting. Can you at least put some context around how you are thinking about the top line growth for '13, either relative to the market or in absolute terms? Thanks.","Greg Matz","Amit, I'll jump in and take the Origio question. This is Greg. The $5.6 million was booked for the entire month of July. We looked that, because of the fact that we were closing so quickly, their ability to be able to breakout the revenue for from the 11th forward, we ended up taking the whole month.","Now in evaluating, we did an analysis evaluating the amount of difference in that seven business days, because they are more back-end loaded, so the 5.6 even though it's the whole month, we believe that there wasn't a whole lot. In fact, we were thinking of something around $1 million, $1.5 million difference between a whole month and that's the cutoff period.","Bob Weiss","As far as 2013 and going forward, how are we thinking about the market from a conceptual point of view is, we expect the market to continue to grow modestly in that range of 4% to 6%, still in a sluggish economy.","Someday, I clearly expect that to accelerate beyond the recession. While we say we are recession-resistant, we are still somewhat impacted and when the global economy improves, I would expect the 4% to 6% to uptick higher than a midpoint of 5.","In terms of how to think about our performance within the market, we'll continue to expect to gain share with the new products we offer with geographic expansion in our general existing portfolio products such as Biofinity, we will gain share. In the past, we've been gaining at 1.8 to 1.9, the market growth. Essentially all we are saying in the future is, we will gain share. Whether or not we achieve the same level, we're not going to, if you will, refine that thinking other than to say we'll continue to uptick and gain share in our view.","I would emphasize that as a trailing 12-month basis as opposed to where we gain share in each and every quarter. One quarter a trend does not make, so I wouldn't get too hung upon any one quarter. I would get hung up, if we were losing share on a trailing 12-month basis.","As far as surgical, CooperSurgical will be impacted by the annualization of Origio, which brings with it north of $60 million in revenue and we expect that to grow organically as well as contribute from the acquisition. Surgical has been growing axe Origio general in that 6% to 8% range, and we would expect it to continue to be mid to upper single-digit growth going forward.","Operator","With that we'll conclude today's Q&A session, and I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bob Weiss for some closing remarks.","Bob Weiss","Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us on this call, and we look forward to seeing many of you in New York, next week, and also reporting in December, on our year-end financial results. The year is certainly flying by. We're excited about the conclusion of the year and the execution this year and looking forward optimistically to 2013, so on that, have a good evening.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference.

A solid quarter with continued momentum, top line growth with 7% with revenues of $412 million, this was 9% in constant currency and excluding Aime from prior year results. CooperVision grew 9% in constant currency and excluding Aime, while CooperSurgical was up 9%. GAAP earnings per share of $1.62 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.64, excluding certain acquisition related cost. Free cash flow was $65 million bringing our 12-month trailing free cash flow to $217 million.","Within CooperVision, we continued making progress with MyDay, our single-use silicone hydrogel lens. We ramped up our production and continued to grow sales and I am happy to say everything is progressing well. Additionally, our traditional hydrogel one-day business led by Proclear continued growing nicely resulting in total one-day growth of 21% for the quarter in constant currency and excluding Aime. Outside of one-days, our growth was driven primarily by Biofinity and Avaira, which both grew in the mid to upper teens.","Regarding CooperSurgical, our fertility business was strong again, up 17%. This drove 9% overall growth in surgical, which was very nice. From a gross margin perspective, we were at 65.1%, which met expectations especially given the strength of our one-day portfolio, including ramp up costs from MyDay.","From an operating margin perspective, we leveraged our operating expenses to grow our non-GAAP operating margin to a very nice 21.8%, up from 21.2%. This all led us to solid earnings per share and to us again raising the low end of our earnings per share guidance. Regarding guidance, I should also mention we maintained our revenue and continued to be comfortable with the drivers of our one-day lenses driven by MyDay and Proclear and our Biofinity and Avaira product families.","Now before I get into the specifics on vision and surgical I wanted briefly to touch on the soft contact lens market in calendar Q1 and our related performance. As you know we have been taking market share for years at around two times the market. In the first quarter the market grew 8% and we grew 9%. It\u2019s important to know there was an anomaly in the quarter as Japan raised their sales tax effective March 31. And this resulted in a significant channel fill in Japan. I believe J&J and Alcon have mentioned it.","To net everything out we believe the best way to look at the market is on a trailing 12 month basis where we grew 11% and the market grew 6%. Final point on this the Japan event did not impact our fiscal second quarter as it netted it self out within the fiscal quarter between March and April. We are under indexed in Japan and Asia-Pacific and we don\u2019t have any impacts on our third fiscal quarter.","Now turning to CooperVision details, on the sales side we had ($331) million at CooperVision which put up solid top line results in the second quarter. And excluding the effects of the divestiture of Aime, a rigid cast permeable business in Japan, our CooperVision sales were up 9% in constant currency versus the second quarter of 2013. Our silicone hydrogel family continued to drive our top line with revenues of $161 million our silicone hydrogels were up 20% in constant currency. Our silicone hydrogel family is now very deep with monthly Biofinity, two weeks the Avaira line and now one day with just MyDay. And with the Proclear family we continued to gain share in hydrogels also during the second quarter. The Proclear family was up 8% in constant currency on the strength of one days. The overall family accounts for 26% of CooperVision revenues.","By lens type, there are also \u2013 we also kept our momentum with torics accounting for 32% of CooperVision and revenues up 8% in constant currency. And our multifocal is now 11% of CooperVision revenues, up 18% above the prior year. We continued to lead the market in these specialized categories. When it comes to the fastest growing model, modality, one day disposables or single use if you will, we put up stellar numbers with one day spheres up 15% in constant currency and overall one day use up 21% in constant currency ex-Aime.","Now, one very important point to understand about our product mix and the industry strategy of trading up 20% to 40% of silicone hydrogel lenses. It may appear that Cooper has caught up with the industry in trading up silicone hydrogel, CVI, our CooperVision is at 49% of its revenue in silicone hydrogels while the market is at 50% in dollars. In fact our mix masks how much room we still have to grow. For one day the silicone hydrogel market is at 13% and we are at 6%. For our other modalities the market is at 71% and we are at only 64%. Also our one day market share is still one half our overall all other products.","Geographically CooperVision foreign exchange headwinds have moderated on the top line with zero impact worldwide, although it took a strong pound and euro to offset year-over-year weaker yen and the Canadian dollar. From a revenues perspective we had put up solid constant currency growth in all regions. Our growth drivers are in the Americas continued strong affinity performance with the halo effect of Biofinity multifocal and the strong one day lead of Proclear sphere. In Europe our success in constant currency includes the MyDay rollout, including Biofinity multifocal halo effect as well as Avaira.","In Asia-Pacific, adjusting for the exclusion of Aime divestiture at year end or October 31, last year and for foreign exchange rates, Asia-Pacific was up 20% in constant currencies. Drivers include the Proclear family led by one-days and the Biofinity momentum. The sales increase in Japan effective or the sales tax increase in Japan effective April 1, which impacted calendar quarter one 2014 market data, was considerably flushed out in April when we have a decline year-over-year.","Looking at contact lens market, the worldwide market in the calendar first quarter was up 8% in constant currency, while CooperVision was up 9%. The soft contact lens market is now $7.4 billion. The market grew 6% on a constant currency basis the past 12 months. CooperVision was up 11% during the same period in constant currency. CooperVision\u2019s market share gains were broad-based similar to past results. All modalities, all regions, all materials and all lens types.","For the calendar first quarter, the market growth was sponsored again by the one-day modality, up 16% and is now 41% of the soft contact lens market in dollars. Also sponsoring growth is the silicone hydrogel material, which grew 14% and now accounts for 50% of the soft contact lens market. For the calendar first quarter, CooperVision one-day was up 23% and silicone hydrogel was up 20% in constant currency. The soft contact lens market remains a trade-up market with the trade-up to one-days about 400% to 600% and a trade-up to silicone hydrogels about 20% to 40%. Also, it\u2019s important to note that torics and multifocals have a long way to go in capturing the market opportunity, especially outside the United States.","Here CooperVision is the number one player worldwide. Geographically, Asia-Pac has done best, up 18% sponsored by the value-added tax or sales tax if you will increase that took effect on March 31. In calendar first quarter, CooperVision had offsetting events, the value-added tax and calendar period being flushed out in Asia-Pac, which did bring up the revenue on a calendar basis up 29%. Offsetting this was the impact of a January 1, 2014 price increase in the United States and some first quarter retail order delays in the United States, this net out to 9% growth for the calendar quarter for CooperVision as well as 9% in the fiscal quarter.","CooperSurgical, our women\u2019s healthcare franchise turned in the solid top line performance. We were pleased with continued strength of top line growth in infertility which was up 17% above the prior year\u2019s second quarter. Our fertility business now accounts for 36% of CooperVision franchise, our office in surgical business rebounded somewhat putting up a positive growth of 4% above last year\u2019s quarters.","Little bit about guidance, we again slightly increased our earnings per share by raising the lower end of our previous guidance. This guidance reflects our successes in the second quarter in managing SG&A cost in spite of ongoing investment in the rollout of our MyDay, our new one-day silicone hydrogel product. Our MyDay plans remains intact starting Europe in 2014, expand into the U.S. in 2015, and then in Japan in 2016. We continue making progress with the ramp up of capacity and are on target for around $25 million in revenue this fiscal year. Our outlook for 2015 remains around $75 million as we continue to ramp up and to expand in Europe and expand in the developing into the United States markets.","Few comments about strategy, we continue with our successful strategy which I have frequently articulated in the past. We believe it is solid and it has delivered results. CooperSurgical is putting up solid results and is leveraging its infrastructure. The franchise was built with solid understanding of the value of critical math in a women\u2019s healthcare market targeting the OB\/GYNs. We follow the professional wherever they go, office, surgery center, hospital, or IVF center. Although the call points are different for reach, the leverage is considerable.","CooperSurgical\u2019s second quarter 2014 gross margin was 65%. Operating margins were over 22%. And due to minimal capital expenditure requirements, CooperSurgical is a significant contributor to our free cash flow. We are dedicated to the strategy and will continue to do tuck-ins and non-U.S. acquisitions to leverage the CooperSurgical structure and products. At CooperVision, the strategy is more complex and is much more global in nature and the $7.4 billion soft contact lens industry, because of the uniqueness of our manufacturing platforms, we are the only company that participates with a very broad and very deep product portfolio.","Just to crystallize this point CooperVision aggressively promotes silicone hydrogel and non-silicone hydrogel that is the Proclear family. We emphasize branded and non-branded products. Note, private label does not mean lower operating margins. Actively, we promote and specialize in custom lenses with the high gross margin. And I might add that our gross margin on the private label and extended range lenses is good. We support all modalities that eye care professionals prescribe one-day, two-week, and monthly and we support all types of lenses: spheres, torics, and multifocals. With over 30% share in the high growth specialty lens categories, torics and multifocals, it is acknowledged by eye care professionals that we are pretty good at specialty contact lenses. For few eye care professionals, we challenge why the success of Biofinity toric for astigmatism. Put a great design together with a great material and great things can happen. You have seen similar success for the same reason with Biofinity multifocal, which first hit the market in the middle of calendar year 2011, almost three years ago.","On the capacity front, we are capable of delivering considerable more products where we had been previously supplied constraint. The Biofinity family Proclear one-day or one-day toric and are all in good capacity shape. Our newest endeavor is now ramping up MyDay or one-day silicone hydrogel. On pricing, we like the rest of the soft contact lens industry have a trade up strategy. Our new wears and existing wears are targeted for silicone hydrogels, the Proclear family and the one-day or single use lenses. Each creates more revenue per wearer, a one-day modality for example results in 4X to 6X for revenue per wearer. While this strategy sacrifices the gross profit margin that is the percent, it generally creates three to five times more profit per wearer. Of course, the strategy competes head on with the lens care space, since we are shifting the wearer revenue resources from lens care to contact lenses only.","Competing for lens care dollars is more of a problem for some of our competitors. In my opinion, we continue to be the most focused company in the industry lacking many of the distractions that some of our competitors have and are now going through. And by that with Biofinity, Avaira, Proclear and MyDay, we have a lot to talk about with eye care professionals all over the globe. As we look down the road over the next several years, we expect to continue improving our operating margins and deliver above average shareholder returns. We expect to continue to average double-digit earnings per share growth, while investing in geographic expansion and new product development.","In today\u2019s market, we have a solid product portfolio to leverage all modalities, multiple materials, all lens types and we retained our expertise to emphasize customizing lenses for the 10% to 20% of those lens wearers that require other than standard sizes and\/or designs. We have a lot of work to do before we come anywhere close to having exploited our number one contact lens family Biofinity. This is particularly true when it comes to geographic expansion and fully developing the Biofinity family of torics and multifocals around the globe. The same applies to Avaira, where the Avaira sphere was anxiously awaiting the relaunch of the Avaira toric. This combination has now put us in a much better position to exploit the U.S. two-week space owned by J&J and to also exploit our private label strategy more aggressively with this family.","While we already have a pretty respectable gross profit and operating margins, from a cost perspective, we have considerable upside yet to be fully developed. Upsides include the elimination of silicone hydrogel royalty with the expiration of the patents, a reduction of our manufacturing costs, among other things, improving molding cycle times, increasing capacity utilization and improving yields in general. Each of these are key goals for us. And as previously mentioned, our expansion plans include a lower cost labor location in Costa Rica that is now being built. This is a multi-year project that will further help us manage down our cost.","Also, given the considerable amount of free cash flow we generate, we will continue to look for tuck-in acquisitions and geographic expansion opportunities like Origio in our two businesses. The key requirement, however, is that each acquisitions must exceed our minimum investment rate. Each must achieve, over time, a hurdle rate that exceeds 10% return on investment capital.","Additionally, the markets for both women\u2019s healthcare and soft contact lenses are much less developed outside the United States, and we generate a considerable amount of cash offshore due in part to our level of manufacturing outside the United States. As such, we will continue to aggressively invest in global expansion opportunities. With over 95% of the people on the planet outside the United States, we believe we will find opportunities to invest in other countries for decades to come, thereby sustaining a low effective tax rate indefinitely.","And finally, we again, this year demonstrated we are opportunistically willing to buy in some of our stock to maximize total shareholder return. We will however, keep everyone guessing as to the timing. In summary, before I turn it over to Greg, let me say how happy I am with the quarter operating results. Operationally we continue to outperform the market being almost two times on the trialing 12 month basis and 1.2 times an inflated calendar first quarter. Our trailing 12 months market share gains are deep covering all geographies, all modalities, all lens types, all lens materials in both branded and private label. Our family of products like Biofinity, Avaira, Proclear, one day, MyDay as well as fertility in women\u2019s healthcare are very promising \u2013 each promising continued growth not only in the United States throughout the rest of the world. And we believe our optimism is with good reason.","Because of our solid gross profit percent performance, we have been able to continue investing in geographic expansion, sales force expansion and R&D in the past the five years. Our improving operating income ratios have been cost of goods driven, leaving room to invest. Our balance sheet and our free cash flow are strong which is allowing us greater flexibility in acquisition activities and to continue select operational investing such as the BRIC expansion and focusing on our commitment to capital expenditures to support one day expansion strategy. Today\u2019s one day market is over $3 billion and growing more than five times that of the rest of the soft contact lens market.","Not everyone will play, we have the products, the manufacturing platforms and the financial strength to move this needle and given the four times to six times trading up of the more compliant one-day wear, we are more than willing to trade-off our gross profit percent for the added profits from a one-day wear. And we remain committed to our 2018 objective of a 25% operating income target and related earnings per share growth impact. We have remained keenly focused on delivering improving results, mindful of our desire to invest and leverage prudently thereby delivering optimized long-term total shareholder return. While we did not purchase more shares of stock this past quarter leveraging our financial strength, this remains a viable use of free cash flow generation that we will continue to selectively use in the future.","With that, as always, a reminder that at Cooper our number one asset is our employees. To them, I express my appreciation for their dedication to creating value and delivering results.","And now, I will turn it over to Greg to cover some of our solid financial results.","Greg Matz - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Bob and good afternoon, everyone. Bob shared with you a pretty thorough review of the market and our revenue picture.","Now, let me start with gross margins. Looking at gross margins, in Q2, consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins met our expectations of 65.1% compared with 66.2% for GAAP and non-GAAP in Q2 last year. The vast majority of this difference was due to the mix impact and startup cost associated with MyDay. As we have discussed in the past, these costs are expected during a startup phase, where you are building capacity. We still expect this product to exit the year in the high single-digit margin range.","Looking at FX, the impact of FX on gross margins was negligible this quarter. In addition also for this year, we still expect gross margins in the range of 65%. CooperVision on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis reported gross margin of 55.2% versus 66.6% for GAAP and non-GAAP in Q2 last year. As I just mentioned, this was mainly due to the cost associated with MyDay.","CooperSurgical had a GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin of 64.7%, which compares to 64.5% in Q2 \u201813. We saw some positive impact as the higher margin base business grew. Fertility with lower margins will continue to put pressure on our gross margin, as that part of the business continues to become a larger part of their mix.","Now, looking at operating expenses, SG&A in the quarter on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, SG&A expenses increased by approximately 3% from Q2 last year to $155.8 million for GAAP and $154.8 million for non-GAAP and both were 38% of revenue, down from 39% in the prior year. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP was about $1 million in acquisition-related costs, which were included in our GAAP numbers. SG&A on a non-GAAP basis declined 2% sequentially.","Now, looking at R&D. In Q2, R&D increased by approximately 12% year-over-year to $16.3 million, or up $1.8 million. R&D was 4% of revenue, up from 3.8% in Q2 \u201813 and 3.9% sequentially. We continue to expect R&D to grow faster than sales in fiscal 2014.","Now, looking at depreciation and amortization. In Q2, depreciation was $24.3 million, up $854,000 or 4% year-over-year and amortization was $7.5 million, down slightly or negative 1% year-over-year for a total of $31.8 million.","Moving to operating margins. For Q2, consolidated GAAP operating income and margin were $88.9 million and 21.6% of revenue versus $81.5 million and 21.2% of revenue for GAAP in Q2 last year. Non-GAAP operating income and margin were $89.9 million and 21.8% of revenue versus $81.5 million and 21.2% of revenue for the prior year. This represents a 9% increase in operating income over the prior year GAAP numbers.","In Q2, CooperVision had GAAP operating income and margin of $82.6 million and 25% of revenue versus $79.3 million and 25.6% of revenue for GAAP and non-GAAP in Q2 of the prior year. Q2 \u201814 non-GAAP operating income and margin were $82.8 million and 25% of revenue. This year-over-year slight reduction in margin comes from a reduction in gross margins partially offset by leverage in SG&A.","CooperSurgical had GAAP operating income and margin of $18.1 million and 22.3% of revenue versus $12.4 million and 16.6% of revenue for GAAP and non-GAAP in the second quarter last year. Q2 \u201914 non-GAAP operating income and margin were $18.2 million and 22.5% of revenue. Operating income grew approximately 46% year-over-year on a GAAP basis. This improvement is largely due to an increase in gross profit and improved SG&A leverage.","Interest expense for the quarter was $1.6 million, down 36% year-over-year. Looking at the effective tax rate in Q2 the GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate was 9.3% versus Q2 \u201913 GAAP effective tax rate of 4.4% and non-GAAP effective tax rate of 5.5%. As we have mentioned before the effective tax rate continues to be below the U.S. statutory rate as the majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates. As a reminder in Q2 \u201913 we saw the favorable settlement of a multi-year foreign tax authority audit which reduced our quarterly effective tax rate by about 400 basis points.","Now moving on to EPS, our earnings per share on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis was $1.62 and $1.64 respectively versus $1.52 and $1.50 on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in Q2 \u201913 respectively. Excuse me, current quarter GAAP EPS does include the impact of acquisition related costs of approximately $1 million or $0.02 per share. There were no share repurchases in Q2, the impact on EPS for Q2 due to our Q1 share repurchases was approximately $0.02 per share and the impact for the year will be approximately $0.04.","Regarding foreign exchange, currency continues to have an impact on our business, but the net impact year-over-year especially on revenue is much less in Q2. From a year-over-year perspective for Q2, currency negatively impacted us by $0.02 and this was mainly driven by the yen, which was down 7.5% year-over-year. At the current FX rates, we now expect an approximate $0.25 negative FX impact on earnings per share in 2014, with the majority of the remaining impact actually hitting in fiscal Q4. This is reflecting the impact of the strengthening of the pound in our UK production cost and the impact to our P&L based on our inventory turns which we have discussed in the past. We expect a smaller production impact in Q3 but this should be offset with a favorable FX revenue impact. Net-net this yearly currency impact is close to the $0.21 impact we mentioned we gave our initial annual guidance in December. For today\u2019s guidance we use today\u2019s rates of the dollar of $1.36 for the euro, ($103) for the yen and $1.67 for the pound.","Moving on to balance sheet and liquidity, in Q2, we had cash provided by operations of $126.3 million, capital expenditures of $61.2 million resulting in $55.1 million of free cash flow. Total debt decreased within the quarter by $10.3 million to $335.4 million. We now have approximately $1 billion of total credit available as of April 30. Inventories increased approximately $6 million to $345.8 million from last quarter. For the quarter, we are seeing months on hand at 7.2 months, down from months on hand at 7.8 months last year and flat to last quarter. Accounts receivable continues to be well managed with DSOs at 51 days, down from 53 days in the prior quarter and down from 54 days last year.","For guidance as Bob mentioned we moved the bottom of GAAP EPS range up to $6.78 and left the top of the range at $7. On a non-GAAP basis we have increased the bottom of the range to $6.80 and have left the top of the range at $7.","With that let me turn it back to Kim for the Q&A session.","Kim Duncan - Senior Director, Investor Relations","Operator we are ready to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Alright. (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Hi guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just two for me, first is a clarification, Bob I don\u2019t understand the 8% when you look calendar first quarter 2014, the 8% for the market and 9% for CooperVision, why that isn\u2019t a fair comparison because your Asia-Pacific business was up 29% and did benefit from the buy-in from Japan? And second, can you talk about it wasn\u2019t clear to me why the Americas was flat in calendar Q1. I know I think you are up 5% for fiscal Q2, but could you talk about what you saw in April and May? Thanks.","Bob Weiss","Okay, the 9% versus the 8%, 9% for us and 8% for the market, of course the market is inflated and keep in mind that Japan is a big part of the market. So, that inflation that occurred in March, the end of the calendar quarter is reflected in that. And your large players, if you will, in the Japanese market by far the largest player is J&J. So, it had a profound impact on J&J. It had a profound impact on the market relative to Cooper. While that percent is big, 29%, we are hugely under index. Our market share is about just a little above half the market share in Asia-Pac as it is in the rest of the world. So, the percentages don\u2019t always add up with equal weighting if you will. Secondarily and that\u2019s where Asia-Pac for the entire market, which is around 30% of the world matters a lot when it\u2019s only half that for us, it matters a lot less.","Relative to the Americas, the Americas is coming off of a calendar quarter that was 15% for Cooper and it dropped from 15 to 0 in the next calendar quarter. We had our price increase, select price increase effective January 1, which had the impact of bringing revenues from January into December. And therefore, the calendar fourth quarter is inflated that flushes out considerably in January. Therefore, it doesn\u2019t show up in the fiscal period like it does in the calendar period. So, we were artificially high on a calendar basis in that fourth quarter. And this is somewhat neutralizing that. Relative to the flush-out in April and May, most of the flush-out occurs in April with people buying forward into March in Japan and it had a minimal effect on our May results. And that has contracted into the guidance we are giving going forward.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Thanks for taking the question.","Operator","Alright. Our next question comes from line of Larry Keusch with Raymond James. Please proceed.","Larry Keusch - Raymond James","Thank you. I know Bob you talked a little bit about MyDay being on plan and gave some sense of where you expect the margins to be, but could you dig in a little bit and then perhaps talk a little bit about the experience with the yields? And I was under the impression that there was an opportunity to actually exit fiscal \u201814 at an operating margin that was north of single-digits. So, if you could talk about that? And then I didn\u2019t see any update for free cash flow and CapEx for the year in terms of guidance? So, that will be a question for Greg.","Bob Weiss","Okay. On the operating outlook for MyDay, I think we have been pretty clear on operating margin that we are not expecting operating margin in 2014 into \u201815 and we maybe investing into 2016 as we hope from Europe to the U.S. to Asia-Pac. Relative to gross margin, we indicated that we had a negative gross margin in the first quarter. It would move into a \u2013 I think upper single-digit mode the second half of this year and then move into teens in 2015. We are, I would say, on track or ahead of schedule a little in those areas. So, we are pleased with the progress we are making on moving the needle on profitability there. It would still be our intent however to invest in the rollout and not expect to make operating profit even in 2015 on MyDay.","Greg Matz","Yes. Larry, on the guidance, the guidance hasn\u2019t changed. We still see free cash flow and CapEx above $200 million.","Larry Keusch - Raymond James","Okay. And just on that CapEx, sort of just help us all, how much above $200 million are we thinking, is it really closer to $250 million?","Bob Weiss","We are at a modal \u2013 we just came off $61 million quarter. Year-to-date, I want to say we are approaching $120 million. So we are running at $240 million. I would not be surprised if it\u2019s north of $220 million by the end of the year, but we will kind of leave it in that, plus $202 million as high as $240 million range.","Larry Keusch - Raymond James","Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Alright. And our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Hi, thank you so much for taking my questions. Can we spend little bit of time on SG&A? That seems to be particularly well-managed. And I am curious how we should think about that as a go-forward metric?","Bob Weiss","Yes. As far as the SG&A is concerned, we are in the mode of moving into more leverage. We have been investing heavily over the last four, five years in the brick expansion as well as sales force expansion and R&D. And we would expect to over the next several years start really getting some meaningful leverage out of those areas. Particularly, where we have invested several years in certain countries we have been in the brick area, if you will, losing a fair amount of operating income in the startup mode. That\u2019s been kind of masking the total P&L that you see worldwide. And now it\u2019s time with revenue generation to get some leverage out of that. And that will continue over the next period while we say we are going from 22% OI to 25% OI that is more about SG&A leverage and it is about change in the gross profit margin. One thing noteworthy to put here in your thought process, however, is during the next three years we will continue to reduce cost of goods in terms of manufacturing. That will not necessarily show up in gross margin and in reduction of cost of goods, it will be masked by product mix as we shift into the one-day modality. The one-day modality will have basically a lower gross margin, but also lower operating expense ratio. So, there will be some \u2013 there should be through mix some improvement in operating cost over that timeframe also.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. As a follow-up question, while you have us all here together, could you comment on the FDA warning letter that hit the website about three weeks ago? Thank you.","Bob Weiss","Yes. I am not going to say too much about it other than like any warning letter or 483, which preceded it we take FDA observation seriously and rest assured it\u2019s getting our full attention. It was in Puerto Rico. I think some people have asked whether or not it was connected to anything that happened in the past, the recall of Avaira toric, the answer to that is no, it is not connected with any previous activity. It was more a result of inspection done that led to 483 that happened in December and January timeframe. And a lot of it had to do with CAPA\u2019s and in documentation, which we are as I indicated taking seriously. At some point in time, the FDA and we would expect by the end of calendar year to come in and confirm the actions that we have taken. I don\u2019t have anymore color on it than that at this juncture.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Alright. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Brien with William Blair. Please proceed.","Matthew O\u2019Brien - William Blair","Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. Bob, I was hoping first just to start with a clarification point and then get into my actual question after that if that\u2019s okay, but on the clarification side I think what you are saying is with what went on in Asia-Pac and especially Japan giving your under-indexing there plus the strong comp you had in the Americas this time last year. The market growth rate is probably something around 5%, you guys did 9%, but on a rolling average basis you are probably a little bit higher than that. So you are still taking share roughly at about double the market rate and you anticipate that type of trend will continue going forward, is that the way that we should characterize the quarterly results?","Bob Weiss","That\u2019s a pretty good summary. I would say we have never kind of said we think we can keep taking double or 2X indefinitely. So it\u2019s nice that for the last three years we have done two. And if we look at it over a five year perspective, I think we average maybe about 1.8. So anything in the range we are talking about the 9% to 10%, we are happy with that obviously we want to beat it. And the market I do think has moved from the 4% to 5% now to the 5% to 6%, but you are correct the 8% is probably more like 5% to 6% and it is much about that.","Matthew O\u2019Brien - William Blair","Okay, and then for my actual question. We are getting closer to the roll off of the U.S. component of the royalty to CIBA and you got a pretty big headwind right now with MyDay on the gross margin side of things, as we start to think about fiscal \u201915, is it fair to think I know you don\u2019t want to give too much in terms of numbers here, but is it fair to think we can get maybe 25% even up to probably not quite as high, but maybe 50% of the headwind from the MyDay product on the gross margin side offset by the royalty rolling off?","Bob Weiss","I am not going to put enough color on that. We have gone out of our way not to put too much color on how it weighs other than to make one point, which is some of the royalty savings we will invest. And it is factored into our model which is basically saying we are going to go from at one point in time with 20% to 25%. We now are more like 21% to 22%, 22% to 25% operating income between now and 2018. So that is still our objective and the royalties are factored in there and the MyDay is a weighting factor in that model over the next several years. And relative to gross margin, in concept you are right that one day, MyDay is taking it one way and the royalty will help minimize that, but I am not going to put more color on it than that.","Matthew O\u2019Brien - William Blair","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Please proceed.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question and a follow-up to something \u2013 somebody else already asked. I guess first on the follow-up question, I am just wondering you mentioned the January might have been impacted by the price increases you put into effect January 1, I am just wondering do your competitors not also put in price increases at the beginning of the year and I am just wondering why they may not have seen the same buy ahead impact. And then my second question Bob is in your prepared remarks, if I understood you correctly backing into it, it sounds like MyDay generated maybe a little over $4 million in revenue, so I am wondering if you could confirm that and also maybe provide any commentary on how Biofinity growth was in the quarter?","Bob Weiss","Alright. Several things, the competitors still have price increases while we do and they are not across the board, some products get more and some products get none. Relative to, did the market show up, the market in the Americas in the fourth calendar quarter was 8%, so that was fairly robust compared to a trailing 12 months of six. So it was the strong quarter for the marketplace in the Americas. So that could be a factor, it certainly was a factor for Cooper. Relative to the question on MyDay you are not too far off with the $4 million to $5 million relative to where it is. We are at a $5 million. So, let\u2019s say, a $20 million run-rate now, your math would not be too far off. Biofinity and Avaira, I think I indicated were mid to upper teens, both family of products were mid to upper teens. So that was a comment from my \u2013 I made that in my remarks.","Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research","Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","Alright. And our next question comes from the line of Jon Block from Stifel. Please proceed.","Jon Block - Stifel","Great. Good afternoon guys. I was hoping you can hear me okay. I think two questions. Bob, just on the first one, I know there is a lot of moving parts with the market data due to the value-added tax, but I am guessing Europe should be pretty clean. The market was up 3% in 1Q, you guys were up 12% or sort of 4X. It\u2019s a big number. And can you speak to what led to sort of 4X the market in Europe? And to what extent MyDay played a role there? And then I will go ahead and ask a follow-up.","Bob Weiss","So, you are totally right that we did very well in Europe, 4X the market and MyDay is certainly a contributor there. And we continue to do well with Biofinity and Avaira in Europe as well as really the migration of torics and multifocals. So both as to modality, it\u2019s a factor, lens type, it\u2019s a factor and product rollout is the factor, and all three kind of play well.","Jon Block - Stifel","Okay, great. And then maybe my second one has two parts if possible. The first one is just channel across the different markets again you mentioned a lot of moving parts. Are we normalized in the channel? You mentioned APAC did, but is that the case in the U.S.? And actually I will save the rest of my questions for offline. Thanks guys.","Bob Weiss","Relative to normalized in the channel, certainly we are normalized in the channel now as we have kind of gone through April-May. Relative to the channel, we look at calendar quarters there is no doubt that the second calendar quarter is going to be weak relative to the first calendar quarter, because of the size of that value-added tax or sales tax, if you will in Japan. So, that will no doubt influence the total market what came into the first quarter will come out of the second quarter and then it will be normalized on that front. I think the U.S. is by the end of the first quarter, calendar quarter is pretty normalized from any implications of price increases. And so I think most everything else is normalized.","Jon Block - Stifel","Okay, perfect. Thanks for your time.","Operator","Alright. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird","Thank you. Good evening guys,","Bob Weiss","Good evening.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird","Bob, wondered if I could maybe ask one follow-up and then my real question I guess from there? But on the MyDay revenues of around $5 million or so, I mean, can you talk maybe sequentially how that is trending and just maybe qualitatively how the rollout is going? I know you said well, but maybe any color about what you are seeing in some of your European markets where you have now launched the product? And some background maybe on how those plus powers are maybe or maybe not helping the uptake of that product?","Bob Weiss","Well, the product is going as fast as we can make it. So, it\u2019s only looking to the market other than say the market likes what they see in Europe, that\u2019s very plus, very good. Relative to our ability to continue to ramp up, we basically planned on more than doubling capacity during short window primarily in the second quarter, we were successful in that. So, when we say our rollout is proceeding to plan, starts with the capacity and the capacity is doing quite well. So that\u2019s not an inhibitor as we continue to rollout. At some point in time, we will be \u2013 before we know, we will be gearing towards the best market, but there is no real expectation that we will have any meaningful going forward from 2015 into 2014 relative to the Americas or the U.S. market. So, things are going to plan. And we are, I mentioned, $25 million that we are targeting this year, we are now at $20 million run rate. And we would expect to have a decent shot at approaching that $75 million objective for next year.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird","Alright, that\u2019s helpful. And then just on my other question, as I think through the next couple of quarters, obviously, you have got some of the pound headwinds on the gross margin. I think the market is somewhat worried about competition and just general gross margin impacts from MyDay. Your operating margin in the second half of last year was actually about 100, 150 basis points higher than in your first half of the margin comp. If you think about it that way, it gets a little tougher. And I put all that together and yet you are guiding to kind of an acceleration in EPS growth, the 15% to 21%, if I take kind of the range that\u2019s out there now for the second half in your guidance. So, what gives you the confidence that I guess EPS accelerates from here, it was 13%, 14% in the first half and now you are talking about kind of mid to upper teens, is that 20% in the second half? How do you grow that fast EPS in with all the other kind of issues there I just mentioned?","Bob Weiss","Well, obviously one of the factors we mentioned that we are \u2013 we have been investing heavily in MyDay in the fourth quarter last year, invested heavy in MyDay in the first half of this year, while and that\u2019s even at the gross margin line. So, as we move into a positive territory on gross margin that\u2019s a big shift and we will start minimizing the size of the losses. So, that\u2019s one thing is leverage. Our comp in the fourth quarter will be easier brought about by a couple of events that took place last year and certainly one of those was just the fact that we were accelerating MyDay forward with fittings that cost as well as conversion of equipment, which cost just a fair amount of money. So the comp is somewhat easier in the fourth quarter. And I think when you factor those two things together you will see that there is some logic to acceleration. We also had I think some degree of a \u2013 well, we had foreign exchange headwinds in the first quarter, but I think we are also anticipating more in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter is more cost of goods related to lag of the strengthening of the pound getting to the P&L. That of course puts a little pressure on the gross profit line in that quarter. So that will serve somewhat as a headwind against the positive trends on MyDay in terms of cost of goods if you will.","Greg Matz","Yes. Jeff, if you look at the model, I think you will see the second half obviously you have a revenue increase second half over first half you got good control on gross margins. Bob mentioned some of the opportunities, also good control over OpEx, Joanne talked about the SG&A leverage. So, you put all that together. I think we are trying to manage this very, very tightly and that execution I think will deliver results that we have guided to.","Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird","Fair enough. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Alright. (Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Mishan from KeyBanc.","Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc","Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions.","Bob Weiss","Good afternoon.","Greg Matz","Yes, good afternoon.","Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc","Yes. Can you talk a little bit about CooperSurgical, what you are seeing in the marketplace, I think last quarter, you said that some orders got pushed out of 1Q into 2Q. Are you seeing improvement here or is this just timing or?","Bob Weiss","I would say modest improvement, but at certainly 4%, we were pleased with in the context of the market and some of the shifting going on there. I would say the surgical outpatient side is still tough. So we don\u2019t want to minimize that idea. Fertility has been doing a good job. We are very pleased with that, those results. And some of the products that we worked on last year in terms of second generation product, we are starting to see some modest benefits of that. So, those three variables still leave us feeling pretty good about the range we gave for guidance, which is still quite frankly, if you were to strip out idea, still pretty anemic expectation on the surgical and the office space in the U.S.","Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc","Okay. And it\u2019s been two years since Origio, how would you describe the pipeline?","Bob Weiss","Well, Origio is a lot more about geographic expansion and certainly taking their product portfolio much more into the outside the U.S. world. The U.S. world is a little bit more mature right now. The pipeline there is \u2013 been some plus factors in the pipeline within Origio and the marketplace. And the other thing we are trying to do over time is shift the mindset a little from \u2013 away from less equipment more disposable which will lead to improving gross margins within that space. That space is a little, still somewhat a gross profit drag within the CooperSurgical mix, but improving if you will.","Operator","Alright. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s call due to running out of time. And I will now turn the call back over to Bob Weiss for closing remarks.","Bob Weiss - Chief Executive Officer","Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We look forward to updating you again in September on our quarterly progress and particularly on MyDay and the continued ramp up and rollout. And with that, I want to thank everyone for participating.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation and you may all now disconnect. Have a wonderful day."]}}
