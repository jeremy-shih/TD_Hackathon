My name is Shannon and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kelsey DeBriyn, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Kelsey DeBriyn","Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our second quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.","With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby, and then move onto questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the Company's future plans, objectives and expected performance and the proposed merger with UTC constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings. And with respect to the proposed merger and related matters in the registration statement on Form S-4 filed by UTC with the SEC on July 17th 2019.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Kennedy","Thank you, Kelsey. Good morning, everyone.","Raytheon delivered very strong operating performance in the second quarter; sales increased 8.1% and our bookings, sales, operating margin, EPS and operating cash flow all exceeded our expectations. We continue to see strong global demand for advanced solutions.","Our book-to-bill ratio in the second quarter was 1.32, this drove an increase in backlog of $3.3 billion year-over-year to a new record backlog of over $43 billion. Given these strong results, the opportunities we see in the second half of the year and the strength of our domestic bookings we are increasing our bookings outlook for the year by $1.5 billion.","Our 2019 bookings performance positions us well for continued growth in the future. Also, we are increasing our outlook for sales, operating income, EPS and operating cash flow for the year. Toby will discuss additional details and that our second quarter performance and increases the guidance in a few minutes.","This strong quarter with a healthy book-to-bill ratio and record backlog is clear evidence that we are making the right investments, in the right innovative technologies to position the Company for strong growth in the future.","Additionally, I want to take a few minutes to discuss the breadth of Raytheon's franchises and the strength of our advanced and innovative technologies that are positioning the Company for this future growth.","As we think about our franchises, we not only extend them by refreshing their technology, we also seek to take them internationally to broaden our markets. This has been our strategy with our combat proven Patriot franchise were during the quarter, we continue to make progress on international opportunities.","In May, we booked almost $500 million on our next phase award with Romania to purchase Patriot. Additional follow-on awards to complete the program are expected to be booked in 2020 and 2021.","We continue to see the total Raytheon Romania Patriot opportunity to be around $2 billion. And in June, we booked, almost $400 million on an award with the State of Qatar, the current member of the Patriot 16 country coalition to purchase additional Patriot capabilities.","In July, we received an award from Germany for over $100 million to upgrade 14 Patriot fire units to the current configuration three plus. As you can see nations want to protect their sovereignty in demand signal for proven defensive systems like Patriot is strong in global.","Demand for our integrated air and missile defense solutions is also driving growth in another key franchise. Over the last few months, we've added two new countries to the NASAMS family, a mid-range solution jointly manufactured by Raytheon and Kongsberg.","In May, we booked over $500 million to provide NASAMS for Australia. And in early July, after the quarter close, we received the $1.8 billion award to provide Qatar with NASAMS. Qatar is 11th country to procure NASAMS, which uses a Raytheon radar and a fires multiple interceptors; including our AMRAAM, AMRAAM extended range and AIM-9X Missiles. As a result, NASAMS helps us expand two more of our franchises AMRAAM and AIM-9X.","For AMRAAM, Raytheon is continuing to expand capability with the development of the AMRAAM extended range and expansion of capability to support land-based applications. As part of Qatar's procurement on the NASAMS system, we will also be the launch customer of the AMRAAM ER surface to air missile, which significantly extends both the range in the market on the NASAMS system. We expect the foreign military sales contract award from Qatar for AMRAAM ER next year.","Given the current and projected domestic and SMS orders, we have line of sight to a production pipeline for AMRAAM for at least the next 15 years. In May, Raytheon launched an AIM-9X Sidewinder Block II missile for the first time from NASAMS, and engaged and destroyed a target during a flight test supported by the Royal Norwegian Air Force.","This flight test opens the door for NASAMS customers to add a vital, short range layer to the ground based air defense to give them complementary interceptors to better engage and destroy threats.","In the Airborne radar market, for innovating to extend franchises with our advanced Active Electronically Scanned Array or AESA solutions. In July, Raytheon was selected as a radar supplier for the B-52 bomber radar modernization program. Displacing the incumbent and extending our Airborne radar franchise.","Under the contract Raytheon will design, develop, produce and sustain AESA radar systems for the entire US Air Force B-52 fleet. With improved navigation, reliability, mapping and detection range, the advanced radar upgrade will ensure the aircraft remains mission ready through 2050 and beyond.","Technology is the backbone of Raytheon, and we had many accomplishments in the quarter that highlighted our capabilities. For example, during the quarter we announced that IIS is working with the US Military's V-22 Joint Program Office to test a new artificial intelligence tool to provide prognostic to better determine when repairs are needed for the multi-mode radar installed on the US Air Force CV-22 Ospreys.","By using performance data we're already collecting on CV-22 radars, an AI tool can tell us exactly when the radar may need to be repaired or replaced, keeping the plane in service longer and saving money for the government. Raytheon and the Air Force are working on this pilot program with benefits expected as early as 2020.","In June, our StormBreaker weapon completed operational testing moving a closer to initial operational capability and bringing this new capability to our domestic and international markets. This smart weapon is packed with innovative technology and has a trial mode seeker and data linked with embedded machine learning.","As a result the seeker can detect, classify and track targets even in adverse weather conditions from stand-off ranges, and can eliminate a wide range of targets with fewer aircraft reducing the pilots time in harm's way.","And in May, Raytheon successfully completed technical testing at White Sands Missile Range in support of the Sense-Off for the US Army's Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor. A two week missile defense demonstration highlighted Raytheon's readiness to deliver mission critical LTAMDS capability to the US Army.","Our clean sheet approach and decades long investments in gallium nitride technology allowed us to demonstrate and deliver a mature solution that will meet the Army's initial operational capability. Our solution also showcased advanced capabilities and ease of maintenance and sustainment to soldiers.","Earlier this month, we submitted a written proposal on LTAMDS addressing the Army's key evaluation criteria, and we are confident that we have the right advanced solution for our customer. In July, we completed a successful test of our Solid Rocket Motor for DeepStrike. Raytheon's offering for the US Army's Precision Strike Missile or PRISM program.","PRISM will replace the ATACMS missile. Whether it be from our record backlog, breadth or franchises that we continue to refresh and take internationally. Our innovative technology solutions for our customers. The company is focused in firing on all cylinders.","Our competitive win rates for Raytheon are around 70%, up from 50% a few years ago. We have a strong outlook for our business for the next five years, 10 years and beyond. In addition, we are also optimistic about the strength of the defense market, both domestically and internationally. For the US Defense market, the DoD budget environment continues to be strong with modernization accounts demonstrating healthy growth over the last few years.","And internationally, the dynamic and unpredictable geopolitical environment continues to generate strong demand for advanced solutions across the regions of Europe, MENA and Asia Pacific. We begin the second half with continued confidence in our growth outlook and operating performance.","It is from this position of strength and strong outlook that we agreed to combined with United Technologies Aerospace businesses and a merger of equals transaction. It was a little over a year ago when we also had a strong outlook for Raytheon and in defense market that I approach Greg Hayes.","I did so because I was excited about what Raytheon and UTC could accomplish together by combining our technology to both further strengthen our current franchises and create new ones. Given the growth in the DoD research and development spending and the broad shift to new technologies to provide solutions to counter peer threats.","In 2018 and 2019, the growth rates for the R&D accounts were higher than the growth rates of the base budget in overall modernization accounts. This growth trend is expected to continue in 2020 and beyond to support the National Defense Strategy. And plays to the strength of the combined company and as well aligned to the NDS priorities.","By combining our technologies with UTCs complementary technologies, we can go after and win an increased number of these franchise opportunities. These revenue synergy opportunities from a combined technologies will turn into franchises and continue to be value generators for decades to come. Positioning the combined company to increase market share and outgrow the aerospace and defense markets.","There are numerous examples of these revenue synergies; including, improved directed weapons by having an enhanced power source; opportunities to incorporate our new expeditionary landing system on military aircraft by changing software in a cockpit; using air traffic control experience to better position us to participate in upcoming air traffic control modernization competitions.","And using engine signature management technology to better position us on a multi-billion dollar franchise opportunity. These are the few of the many revenue synergy examples that we expect to achieve as a combined company.","The bottom line is we can start creating these revenue synergies immediately. On day one of becoming a combined company. These potential revenue synergies from our complementary technologies are sizable and in a multi-billions of dollars. In short, we are convinced of the merits of the transaction with UTC, and are confident about the benefits it will bring to our shareholders, customers and employees.","Let me close by thanking all the members of the Raytheon team worldwide. They are the ones and we're developing the solutions to grow our franchises; meeting customer needs and delivering the performance; it gives us such a strong outlook. Thank you for helping us continue to create the trusted innovative solutions; we're known for around the world; and for helping us meet our commitments to our customers and shareholders.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Toby.","Toby O'Brien","Thanks Tom.","I have a few opening remarks. Starting with the second quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.","If everyone would please turn to Page 2. We are pleased with the very strong performance the team delivered in the second quarter with bookings, sales, operating margin, EPS and operating cash flow all better than our expectations. We had record bookings in the second quarter of $9.5 billion resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.32, and ended the quarter with a record backlog of $43.1 billion.","Sales were $7.2 billion in the quarter, up 8.1% with growth across all of our businesses. Our EPS from continuing operations was $2.92 better than our guidance and an increase of 5% year-over-year. I'll give a little more color on this in just a moment. We generated strong operating cash flow of over $800 million in the second quarter, which was also better than our prior guidance primarily due to favorable collections.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock for $300 million bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 4.4 million shares for $800 million. I want to point out that under the merger agreement with United Technologies, we are restricted from repurchasing shares, I will discuss this further a little later.","At a high level, we are increasing our full-year 2019 outlook for sales, operating income, EPS and operating cash flow, as well as making other updates. I'll provide more color on guidance in a few minutes. And as Tom mentioned earlier, we are raising our bookings outlook by $1.5 billion for the full-year.","Turning now to Page 3. Let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Company bookings for the second quarter were $9.5 billion, approximately $800 million or 9% higher than the same period last year. And on a year-to-date basis, bookings were $14.8 billion, which were essentially in line with the comparable period last year.","As Tom mentioned, the strong bookings positioned the company well for future growth. For the quarter, international was 33% of our total company bookings. Again, backlog at the end of the second quarter was a record $43.1 billion, up over $3 billion or 8%, compared to last year's second quarter. Approximately 38% of our backlog is comprised of international programs.","If you now move to Page 4. For the second quarter of 2019, sales were above the high-end of the guidance we set in April. Primarily due to better-than-expected performance at our IIS missiles and SAS businesses. For the second quarter, our international sales were approximately 30% of total sales.","Looking now at sales by business. IDS had second quarter 2019 net sales of $1.6 billion, up 8%, compared with the same quarter last year. The increase from Q2 2018 was primarily driven by higher sales on international Patriot programs.","In the second quarter 2019, IIS had net sales of $1.8 billion, the 5% increase, compared with Q2 2018 was primarily due to higher net sales on classified programs in both cyber and space. And as we've previously discussed, we expect IISs growth rate to moderate in the back half of the year, due to the planned ramp down and transition on the Warfighter FOCUS program.","Missile Systems had second quarter 2019 net sales of $2.2 billion, up 8%, compared with the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher net sales on classified programs, the high-speed anti-radiation Missile Program and the Phalanx program. SAS had net sales of $1.8 billion, an increase of 13%, compared with last year's second quarter.","The increase in net sales for the quarter included higher net sales on classified programs; the Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared program and an international tactical radar systems program. And for Forcepoint, sales, were up 5%, compared with the same quarter last year. Overall, we're pleased with our strong total company sales, which grew 8.1% in the quarter.","Moving ahead to Page 5. We delivered strong operational performance in the quarter. Our operating margin was 16.4% for the total company and 12% on a business segment basis. Our business segment margins were up 30 basis points versus last year's second quarter and better than our expectations at all the businesses.","It's important to note that the company incurred $23 million of merger-related expenses in the second quarter of 2019, which was not included in the prior guidance and had an unfavorable impact of approximately 30 basis points in the quarter for the total company operating margin. Without these expenses, total company operating margin would have been up versus last year's second quarter.","So looking now at margins by business. IDSs second quarter 2019 operating margin was 16.1% better than our expectations. You may recall, last year's second quarter benefited from improved productivity. IISs operating margin was particularly strong at 9.1%, up 150 basis points, compared to last year's second quarter, driven by higher net program efficiencies in the quarter. Missile's operating margin was 11.4% in the quarter, up 10 basis points, compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by a favorable change in program mix. SAS margin was essentially in line in the quarter, compared with the same period last year.","And at Forcepoint, as we discussed on past calls, operating income was negative for the quarter, due to the seasonality of their business. We expect Forcepoint's operating income to be positive in both the third quarter and fourth quarters of 2019.","From a total company point of view, we remain focused on operating profit and margin improvement going forward, and continue to see our business segment margins in the 12.1% to 12.3% range for the full-year. However, we now expect operating profit dollars in total to be higher due to sales and margin improvement at IIS. We see our segment margin improving in the back half of the year, driven by favorable program mix and productivity improvements.","Turning now to Page six. Second quarter 2019 EPS was $2.92, 5% higher than last year's second quarter and was better than our expectations. Operating performance drove strong Q2 EPS, due to higher sales volume, higher margins and pension related items.","As I previously mentioned, the merger-related expenses incurred in the second quarter of 2019 were not included in the prior guidance and had an unfavorable EPS impact of $0.06 in the quarter. Also as a reminder, last year's second quarter included a favorable tax related EPS impact of $0.33 related to a discretionary pension plan contribution.","On Page 7, we've provided you with a 2019 financial outlook walk to bridge our prior view in April to our current guidance. I want to point out that we are now providing business segment and total operating income to show the progress we are making.","As I mentioned earlier, we are increasing full year 2019 outlook for sales, operating income, EPS and operating cash flow to reflect our improved operating performance, as well as for lower corporate interest and other non-operating expenses.","Let me take you through each of these items. In operations, we increased the sales range by $200 million, driven by higher domestic orders at IIS. We now expect our company sales to be up approximately 6.5% to 0.5% for the full year.","This sales increase attributable to the IIS along with their margin improvement contributes about $30 million of operating income or $0.09 to 2019 full-year EPS. We're also increasing the operating cash flow outlook by $100 million to reflect higher anticipated collections in the year.","Next, we've lowered corporate expenses by approximately $25 million improving EPS for the full-year by about $0.07. We are improving our net interest expense and other non-operating expenses, which in total is worth about $0.08 to EPS, compared to our prior guidance.","Taken together, before accounting for merger-related items, we're improving 2019 full-year EPS by $0.24. These improvements to operating income and EPS are partially offset by merger-related expenses, which were not included in our prior guidance.","We expect to incur approximately $40 million or $0.11 of expenses related to the merger in 2019, of which $23 million was incurred in the second quarter. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier as a result of the pending merger, we are restricted from repurchasing shares. This has an unfavorable $0.03 impact to our prior full-year 2019 EPS guidance.","To summarize, we increased the sales range by $200 million and now expect our full-year 2019 guidance for net sales to be in the range of between $28.8 billion and $29.3 billion, up approximately 6.5% to 8.5% from 2018. The year-over-year increase was driven by growth in both our domestic and international business.","We've increased our full-year 2019 outlook for segment operating income by $30 million and full-year 2019 EPS by $0.10 from our prior guidance, and now expect it to be in a range of $11.50 to $11.70. As discussed, the increase is driven by our improved operational performance in the second quarter, as well as expectations for the back half of the year.","Moving to operating cash flow from continuing operations. As a result of the improved collections to-date discussed earlier, and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are updating our 2019 operating cash flow outlook to be between $4 billion and $4.2 billion.","Similar to last year, our cash flow profile was more heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter, due to the timing of program milestones and collections on some of our larger contracts.","On Page 8, we've provided you with our standard updated 2019 financial outlook, most of which I just discussed. Before moving on, I want to point out that we now see an improvement to net interest expense of approximately $10 million, and now expect it to be approximately $145 million for the full-year, reflecting higher average cash balances. And we have updated our diluted share count to be approximately 281 million shares for 2019.","On Page 9, we've included guidance by business. We've increased the full-year sales outlook at IIS and for the total company to reflect the combination of stronger bookings and sales to-date and second half expectations.","Now turning to margin, we've increased the range and expect higher full-year operating margin performance for IIS. The strong year-to-date results exceeded our prior estimates. And as I discussed earlier, for the full-year 2019 we increased operating income dollars at the business segment level by $30 million.","Before moving on to Page 10, as I mentioned earlier, we are now raising our full-year 2019 bookings outlook to a range of between $31 billion to $32 billion, this reflects a $1.5 billion increase from the prior range and is driven by increased strong demand from our domestic customers.","On Page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see the third quarter of 2019. We expect our third quarter sales to be in a range of $7.2 billion to $7.3 billion, and we expect EPS from continuing operations for Q3 to be in a range of $2.78 to $2.83. And for operating cash flow, we expect Q3 to be in a range of $800 million to $1 billion.","Before concluding, the collaborative merger efforts and integration planning between Raytheon and United Technologies are under way and progressing well, including the recent S-4 filing last week. We look forward to the next steps in the process; including the definitive proxy filing and the shareholder vote later this year.","And post closing, we look forward to Raytheon Technologies delivering strong free cash flow growth and deploying a significant amount of free cash flow to its shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.","In summary, we had strong performance in the quarter, our bookings, sales, operating margin, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all higher-than-expected. We increased our full-year 2019 outlook for bookings, sales, operating income, EPS and operating cash flow. We remain well positioned for continued growth.","With that, Tom and I will open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Your line is open.","David Strauss","Tom, could you touch on Missiles the performance here in the quarter and the changes that you've put in place there? Did those things, kind of, take hold faster than you thought. Just an overall update on the progress there? Thanks.","Tom Kennedy","So David. Thanks for the question. I think number one is the issues that Missiles are not as significant as I think some folks think. But we did put, we did change out some leadership, we put in our team to and we have some of the call program management, best practices. We went in and audited all their programs relative to those.","Made some, I would call it, was more tune ups across the board, but we think Missiles is a strong company we think it has a lot of upside potential in the future and we were just putting our normal, I would call it best practices in place on program management.","We've done and we did some deep dive and some of the programs that had some of the issues and put corrective actions in on those. And the other thing we have a lot of development activities going on, we're really trying to accelerate those development activities and get those into production as soon as possible, the main reason is to drive higher margin positions.","And the other big area and this is a future thing for another uplift for Missiles is, they are right now, they are in the midst of negotiating two five-year multi-years; one is on the Standard Missile-6 and the other is on the SM-3 and that'll be a big plus to and obviously increased - significantly increasing the factory base for over about a period of seven years.","So we're very upbeat about Missiles, I think they have a lot of upside to go, we're going to continue to press and driving them in that direction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies & Company. Your line is open.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Tom, I just wanted to follow-up on your remarks at the Paris Air Show with regards to the state of the business, you touched on it a little bit. But over the next decade, maybe if you could expand on how you see that going above and just given the S-4, it seems like you have a very robust business profile on a stand-alone basis. So it didn't quite jive with those comments?","Tom Kennedy","Yes, so let me clarify the comments in Paris. First, as you saw from the strong performance this quarter, and also obviously defined in the S-4. We grew over 8% and achieved record backlog levels, and so bottom line is, Raytheon is very well positioned even as a stand-alone company, and we are well positioned for the next 10 years, 20 years and 50 years and beyond.","At Paris, I was trying to convey something and that was really, it was really about the fact that, if we were to stop and I mean stop investing in IRAD and stop our CapEx efforts at Raytheon, it would eventually limit our growth potential and it was really under the auspices that we're in, and the environment we are today that it's a time where the DoD customers increasing its research development budgets and the spending of those budgets to support next generation systems.","So as, you know, over the years - several years we have increased our internal investing in research and development, and also our CapEx to position the company for this future growth. And as a result, Raytheon is very well positioned even as a stand-alone company; for example, over the last few years, we won numerous franchises and accelerated our sales growth.","And so bottom line is, let me be very clear here on this one, we are very confident about the proposed merger with United Technologies and how that combination will even further enhance value for our shareholders, customers and employees. But even as a stand-alone company Raytheon is very well positioned for the next 20 years and beyond.","Operator","Our next question comes from Myles Walton with UBS. Your line is open.","Myles Walton","I was hoping you could comment on two things; one, is just update us on the export licenses for the precision weapons. I imagine, you probably have them by now; and the second would be on the lower tier Air Missile Defense Sensor. The contract structure there is a rapid acquisition, and I guess the contractor is expected to self-fund about a third of it. Is that accomplished in your R&D profile and is that allowable expense back to the customer. Thanks.","Toby O'Brien","I'll start on the first one around the PGMs. So you're right, we recently did receive approved licenses from the State Department for about $1.2 billion worth of the PGMs that were previously awarded, but not - had not yet received our export approval, and we're now in the process of coordinating delivery of the completed product with our Mid-East customers. So some good progress there over the last couple of months.","Tom Kennedy","And on the lower tier system, I think it's really - and you probably know we are significantly pursuing that system, and we've been spending in several years developing the technologies for the - let me call it the way LTAMDS system. We believe we're very well positioned for that capability and to provide it the Army and so that they can be able to defend the most challenging complex in the integrated attacks.","As I mentioned in my remarks, we did participate in the sense-off, I believe we put our best foot forward on that and provided the degree capability and actually demonstrated it at the sense-off. It was a wildfire environment, so we had a track life targets, we are able to demonstrate our unique technology that we brought to the game here at White Sands, and it was over a two-week demonstration period.","And we have delivered our proposal you're right, the contract structure is something called it another transactional and it's a OTA and it does have a requirement for 30%, the content that can be provided by non-traditional contractors.","And so, and that's the - there is, so there's two elements to that and we are working with non-traditional contractors and having them involved in helping us on that program. Bottom line, we're confident that solution that we provided for LTAMDS and - sometime in the September timeframe the Army said that they're going to make that final selection.","Operator","The next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Seth Seifman","I wanted to ask a quick question about the S-4 and so we look at the data in there we're kind of looking at 5-ish percent growth out in 2022 and 2023. And when we look at the investment account budget for fiscal '20 that's been submitted, and probably consistent with the budget deal announced this week, it's flat to slightly up in the investment account maybe something kind of similar in '21. Based on your visibility and your programs domestically and internationally, would that kind of flat to slightly up investment accounts in '20 and '21 be consistent with that 5% growth in '22 and '23?","Toby O'Brien","Yes, Seth. It's Toby. Let me take a crack at that here. So I think if you step back from the S-4, while we hadn't previously quantified anything we've been pretty consistent in saying that based upon at many points in time where our backlog was, our bookings outlook, the alignment with both domestic and international customer needs. We saw that we were going to be able to continue to grow the company beyond in this case 2019 for the next three or four years, right?","So S-4 is directionally consistent with that type of commentary that we provided in the past. The other thing, I would point out here, right? We have been continuing to make our investments, both from an R&D point of view or capital point of view in ways that aligned with customer priorities as dictated by the NDS and clearly as have been funded through the last few budget cycles, especially in the RDT&E account.","I think, you know, more importantly, it's worth noting that since the date of the projections in the Form S-4, right? We are increasing our 2019 sales guidance that we just talked about this morning, as well as because of the increase in our bookings, the expected backlog that would have entering 2020, which gives us a high degree of confidence in our ability to continue to grow the company at or beyond levels that we - that you see in the S-4.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Cai von Rumohr","So, one of your competitors mentioned that they have 3.5 billion of orders for hypersonic missiles about five or six programs. Could you update us on your position in hypersonics and your backlog with respect to both offensive and defensive hypersonics. Thanks so much.","Tom Kennedy","Yes, Cai, let me, cover that. I mean as we've discussed in the past, both hypersonics and counter hypersonics are the areas we continue to invest in for future growth and participate in DoD programs in that area.","And we're actively working multiple hypersonics, encounter hypersonics programs, for example, we have the Hawk system, the Tactical Boost Glide, and we're also participating in the Navy's Conventional Prompt Strike and also the Army's long range hypersonic weapons programs, and also some other classified hypersonic and also counter hypersonic program.","So it is becoming a big part of our portfolio moving forward, and there's really three main categories including the air breathing hypersonics weapons and that's the Hawk program and as we discussed on past calls, this program is successfully executing, it did complete a free jet two testing at NASA's Langley 8 foot in a high temperature tunnel, and then final analysis though show a great comparison between the predictions and test results, and so it's substantiating our system range performance predictions and putting us toward on the next step.","And you probably saw in the press, we have signed agreement with Northrop, we are working with them on developing and producing the next generation Scramjet combustors and to help power the Raytheon's air breathing hypersonic weapons.","The second category is the hypersonic boost glide weapons they call them TBGs or Tactical Boost Glide and ground-launched hypersonic boost glide weapons back in February of this year. DARPA did award Raytheon and TBG contract and so we're off and working on effort.","And we're also developing several counter hypersonic weapons and also the entire integrated counter hypersonic kill chain; including the sensors and as I mentioned, on the calls, we really believe that the counter hypersonic market is actually larger than the hypersonic market for multiple reasons; one, is it not only doesn't include the weapons to counter the hypersonic weapons, but it also includes the entire kill chain communications and sensors.","And so Raytheon continues to build this presence in both the hypersonic encounter hypersonic market, we're continuously and strategically investing in some of these top technology areas to make sure that we have the right solutions to bring forward to in the future competitions in both the hypersonic and counter hypersonic area.","And as we mentioned, there are multiple potential revenue synergies also with the proposed merger with the UTC from some of their complementary technologies relative to hot areas of engines in the materials required to it use in those areas. And so we see those complementary technology solutions helping us even further in our hypersonic areas.","Toby O'Brien","And Cai, let me just add a little bit on the financial side of things, right? So, especially in the area of, kind of, hypersonics right, that gets across all elements of our company. Okay, not just our missiles business and as you can imagine there are parts of that, that are classified or highly classified.","So we're a little constrained on what we can, kind of, put out there. What I can tell you as it relates to our missiles business only right, relative to the work that they're doing on the vehicles and related to hypersonics. We'd expect revenue in the aggregate about $300 million this year and for a growing backlog. Their backlog grew here in the second quarter, compared to first and would expect that to continue, certainly for the next 12 months to 18 months.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George Shapiro","I noticed that operations in the quarter by year-end numbers were up $0.23 by mine, and I had above estimates guide $0.15, Toby. But for the year, you're only raising it by $0.09. So I assume, it means the second half you're expecting somewhat weaker performance in this quarter took some from the second half. And the other quick questions I have is the missile margin guide still requires north of 12% in Q3 and Q4. So just want to comment on that. And on the other side that requires a sharp reduction on the IIS margin in the second half? Thanks.","Toby O'Brien","So let me start with the overall company level EPS. I mean as I said earlier, we're pleased with the increase of the $0.24, prior to the merger related impacts, right, that were offset by $0.11 of expenses and $0.03 from a higher share count that netted to the $10 and we're extremely pleased with our performance in the quarter.","We had several of the business is outperforming our expectations. Some of this is timing as you alluded to, I think timing between Q3 and Q2 and it does give us confidence in the overall guidance in the outlook for the year.","As I said at IIS with their strong performance in Q2 and their expected performance in the back half combined with their volume and margin that's where they - the flow-through of that $0.10 to the total year is primarily driven by, in addition to the improvements we saw in corporate, and some of the non-operating items.","So overall, we're pleased with it, but timing is really the way to think of it right, that we saw some strong performance in the quarter from a margin point of view, some improvements we expected in the second half primarily Q3 moving into the second quarter. So missile specifically again, we're pleased with the 11.4% margin that they delivered here in Q2, it was ahead of what we were expecting.","As you pointed out, you're right, we continue to see their margins increasing and improving in the back half of the year. The combination of some new and anticipated production awards will be ramping up from a total year basis, we expect better productivity and overall missile's margins about in line with 2018 at the midpoint of the range - in the midpoint of the range of 11.5% to 11.9%.","So from an IIS point of view, clearly, they've had a outstanding start to the year with their performance, including in Q2. We did raise their guidance by another 20 basis points to the 8.2% to 8.4% of the range. And yes, we do expect the margin in the back half is going to be a little bit lower driven by mix and again the timing of some of the performance improvements they saw accelerated into Q2 versus Q3.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ronald Epstein","Can you talk to a bit, how you think about kind of two - how does BBN fit-in, in your view given the combined or it seems like that [indiscernible] how do you guys had? And then two, commercial offset so when you're doing your international work and your offsets all of a sudden you have a much larger portfolio of things that you could offset with? How do you think about that?","Tom Kennedy","Let me talk about the first thing is, you're right, Ron, yes we between the two companies, we have a powerhouse of technology. One of the areas with some of our technology concentrated is BBN, which is kind of our research on does a significant amount of work with DARPA, and a lot of technology, I would call futuristic technology development has been kind of our leader in artificial intelligence and machine learning for us, and in several other key areas.","Right now that system is connected directly into our four businesses and their advanced programs area as a very tight coupling. So we try to do it, even though we're developing advanced technology, we try to tie that back directly to our mission areas, so that we can accelerate the development of that technology into the solutions that we provide for our customers.","And that is a model that we are going to take forward into the merger as we move forward, we're going to ensure that we don't break that and moving forward. We have some organizational construct works that we're doing, because United Technology is also has a research group that does work and it's also connected into their businesses.","So the end game is to essentially try to drive the synergies with all this technology that we're developing. In a way that we can actually make this kind of technology one plus one equals three, and we're looking at accelerants by combining this technology in these different areas.","But the bottom line is, there is a significant amount of opportunity in the technology area, and then the technology is complementary and where we're trying to work that organizational construct, so we make sure we maximize the benefits of that to both companies in the merger.","Toby O'Brien","And I think Ron, on your second comment and Tom can jump in here and add some color, that's another synergy opportunity around the offsets clearly having more capability to put forward to satisfy what our international customers are looking to do relative to localization and developing indigenous capability is an key area that will be working some planning around, and then post merger figuring out how to take full advantage of the capabilities that United Technologies Aerospace businesses will bring to the table, and give us more avenues to satisfy and fulfill offsets.","Operator","And your next question comes from Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is open.","Peter Arment","Toby, if I just circle back on ISS margins, it wasn't clear to me why is it just all related to the Warfighter ramp down that why you're seeing margins come down pretty significantly in the second half. I know you've - that's a very strong performance in the first half, but what exactly are we seeing there? Thanks.","Toby O'Brien","Yes, you know, it's two or three things, right? The Warfighter volume reduction is part of it and that is definitely more pronounced in the back half of the year, significantly more pronounced in the back half of the year than it was in the first half. And part of the strength of their margin here in the quarter at the 9.1% was their productivity improvements and they were able to accelerate some from the second half into the second quarter from Q3 to Q2.","And then to a lesser degree, they do have some general mix with other programs that have a lower margin and a heavier revenue contribution in the second half. But that all said overall, they are performing well, hitting on all cylinders, we raised their margin again, we're more than confident in their margins going forward.","And I know it wasn't a specific part of your question, but I would tell you and we've touched on this at times on past calls, when folks have asked. Based upon the portfolio in IIS and depending upon mix of their business, including as they work to capture more international work at especially around cyber. This is a business that could approach 9% margins, depending upon how things line up. So the team there is doing a great job and we're very pleased with their performance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland","Just kind of quick two part are on and just to follow-up on the hypersonics discussion. I wondered from what's increasingly in the public domain on the hypersonics versus counter hypersonics it looks there's a lot more funding and effort on the counter on the hypersonics front and counter hypersonics, and I wondered if that's consistent with what you've seen in your portfolio or if there is a classified dynamic there that makes those a lot more equal in size. And then I know on prior calls, Tom you've emphasized counter hypersonics is a - perhaps the bigger of the two opportunities for you.","And I just wondered when you think about the elements of that, whether it's traditional radars and traditional air missile defense, things of that nature, which are really kind of core capabilities of your company today. How the UTC transaction helps in the counter hypersonics realm or if sort of off on that, any color there would be great?","Tom Kennedy","Yes. So, number one, let me set this straight. I mean, the hypersonics is a big element for the Department of Defense and are pushing that forward. But I can also tell you that they are fairly a very large effort relative to counter hypersonics and there's activities going on there a lot of that is in the classified areas. I can't get into a lot of details, but what I can tell you is the counter hypersonics efforts across every one of our four businesses. IIS, SAS, missiles and even IDS.","And then reason is, it requires a solution for the entire fire control chain to be able to go detect the threat and then make your decision on what you're going to do with that threat, and then track that threat, all the way through its flight path and then interdict somehow to destroy that threat.","And the elements to go through the counter hypersonics, it just more parts and therefore more parts ones that being more things to develop and integrate, and so that's why it's really a bigger and that's why I use the word that it's a larger market for us relative to our entire business. In any case bottom line is we are heavily participating in both and we believe the future will help us even further.","And then relative to UTC, I mean, they're helping us and they will take - will be able to help us once we close relative to their technology especially into high temperature materials into inlets or hypersonic engines in that area, and they will also do have some high-end sensors that we don't have and we don't participate in areas that potentially could help us in that fire control chain.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Robert Stallard","Tom a quick question for you on the merger. Have you been surprised by the sort of feedback that you've been getting from investors?","Tom Kennedy","Well, we've - it depends on the - interest on the investors, I've been getting a lot of positives from investors across the board. I think so lot of our investors do see exactly the benefits of the merger moving forward. And I think the area - whole area of technology and being able to combine the - I would call the power - powerhouse companies relative to their technology areas, and bring it to bear on an entire front moving forward has been very, very well taken by our investors, who understand the details of the companies and the technologies that they are developing. So we - most of the stuff we've been hearing is pretty positive.","Robert Stallard","Go ahead.","Toby O'Brien","And Rob, would just add in going back to the original announcement and I think we've talked about this. So this wasn't a combination that was rumored, right? So clearly people were not expecting it, we continue to engage with our investors as they have more questions about the deal, and I think what people are, from a financial point of view, starting to really understand the long-term cash flow generation potential for this business.","The incremental free cash flow growth we talked about the $18 billion to $20 billion of capital being returned to shareholders in the first three years. We put a number out there of about $8 billion in 2021, which would kind of be the first full year based upon a mid 2020 close.","We've also put a little more color around that, that's conservative by plus or minus $1 billion, so I think people are getting their head around it, right. It's got something for everybody, it's not that long-term strategic play underpinned by the complementary technologies, the revenue synergies that, as Tom mentioned in his opening remarks - we believe we're going to be measured in the billions. It's got the synergies that would provide shareholders to benefit that from the near-term and then all the elements, I won't repeat them from a financial perspective around the cash flow generation of the Raytheon Technologies Company.","Kelsey DeBriyn","Shannon, we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Your line is open.","Pete Skibitski","Tom, could you talk about some of these smaller programs at missiles that you have going on. I hate to get too far into the weeds, but I think they're interesting and kind of emerging - this scenarios for the military. One is just Coyote, do you announced a contract here this quarter for, not huge, but not small either. In this FEAVR radar and this Hawk whole program, could you give us some color on some of those and maybe you can talk about the market size. They just sound pretty interesting.","Tom Kennedy","Yes, I'll talk about the Coyote first, actually that's a bright - really bright super bright star for missiles, that was an - did an acquisition of a small company back in 2015, and it had a - this UAV on it. And then the reason is we went into the acquisition, I think was about $7 million. Today there is some technology in swarming - UAV swarming technology.","And so we were able to take that system and integrated into some of our other solutions that we're doing to co-create, we call it now Coyote system. And then integrated that with one of our radars are kind of call it our KuRFS radars to create a new system called Hauler, Hauler that was just IOC by the United States Army, and the Army is buying these systems for counter-UAS, so this UAS actually goes off in attacks other UAS and kill them and it's been, it's actually, it's very - it's a lower cost systems.","So it's a way of killing lower cost the UAS, and it's in - and I think the Army is going off and going to be buying quite a few of those. So it's a very, very great program there.","The other I would call a contract that I would like to bring up that in the area of missiles, is they are pursuing a program called Precision Strike Missile and that is a new system for then really a brand new franchise for us moving forward.","We're very positive on that system, it's a system that is required by the Army to replace their attack him system and move that up to a longer range, but within the INF treaty, which may end, and on August 2nd, so if that happens, there will be more activity in this area and more upside and potential for the missile company in that arena.","Kelsey DeBriyn","That's all the time we have.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Todd Ernst","Thank you, Chantilly. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning on our first quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we\u2019ll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning\u2019s call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.","With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Toby O\u2019Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby and then we\u2019ll move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I\u2019d like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company\u2019s future plans, objectives and expected performance constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas Kennedy","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to welcome Toby O\u2019Brien to his first earnings conference call as CFO, a role which he officially assumed on March 2nd. Toby will walk you through additional details regarding our first quarter financial results in just a moment.","I\u2019m pleased to report that the company delivered solid operating results in the quarter with sales, EPS and cash flow that were all either in line or ahead of our expectations. Our international business continues to grow in the quarter and represent a 28% of total revenue. International also represented 34% of our total bookings in the quarter. And our international backlog was 41% of total backlog at quarter\u2019s end. This backlog percentage will go higher with the $2 billion international Patriot award we announced last week, which was from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.","I will note that we continue to see strong demand signals beyond our recent bookings activity for our solutions from our global customers. In the quarter and the weeks immediately following, you will see important parts of our global growth strategy play out.","We\u2019ve announced significant recent bookings across our portfolio, particularly in the international Patriot that position the company for future growth. And we announced the strategic investment and partnership to harness rapid growth in the global cybersecurity market.","Overall, we\u2019ve made a considerable progress on these weak [ph] fronts and continue to move forward with our growth strategy. During the quarter, we always raised our dividend by 10.7%, the 11th consecutive annual increase, and will remain on track to reduce our shares outstanding for the year. This reflects our long term trend of returning cash to shareholders, something we will continue to do in line with our balanced capital deployment strategy.","We\u2019ve come out of the gate strong after the close of the first quarter with approximately $3 billion in bookings within the initial weeks of the second quarter, including the $2 billion Patriot booking from Saudi Arabia and a $507 million booking to upgrade the evolved Sea Sparrow Missile, a premier ship defense missile for the U.S. Navy and international customers.","I\u2019d like to take a moment to talk about our Patriot Integrated Air and Missile Defense franchise. Over the past 15 months, we have received nearly $7 billion in bookings for Patriot production and support services from a range of customers. This includes the recent Saudi $2 billion award as well as the Kuwait, Qatar, South Korea, and the U.S. Army. This provides the company with years of production work and backlog, and predictability to the manufacturing outlook and the opportunity to achieve higher production efficiencies.","Looking forward, we continue to see significant opportunities for Patriot. Earlier this week, we were notified that the Patriot was selected by Poland for their medium range Integrated Air and Missile Defense system. We\u2019ll be working with our Polish customer on the final offering and anticipate receiving a booking in 2016. Additionally, we\u2019re in the final down select process in Germany. If selected, we anticipate that this will also translate into a booking opportunity in 2016.","Patriot continues to evolve, ensuring that it will be capable of meeting next generation threats. Over the next few years, you\u2019ll see us in collaboration with our current and future customers and new capabilities, including a 360-degree AESA radar capability and other enhancements. These capabilities will position Patriot to be the leading Integrated Air and Missile Defense solution for the next several decades.","But as you know, Raytheon is much more than just Patriot. And to that point, we\u2019ve seen considerable recent order activity domestically and internationally across a wide range of our systems and products, particularly in our missiles business. Demand for missiles is being driven by the evolving threats as well as our incorporation of technological advances into our products. One example of this is AMRAAM where we received a $539 million award in the first quarter for the latest version of the missile. We received a similar size award in December of last year. So within the past six months alone, we have received more than $1 billion in orders for AMRAAM.","We continue to make important progress on many other key programs that will drive future growth. For example, on Small Diameter Bomb II, a premier precision weapon for both current and next generation platforms, we completed systems verification review in early April. This sets the stage for Milestone C which will be complete, the development phase, allowing the program to move into low rates initial production.","Our Next Generation Jammer program remains a significant part of our electronic warfare initiative. The program continues to execute on or ahead of schedule and cost, and also completed key testing milestones in the quarter.","Turning to a broader market perspective, domestically, I\u2019m encouraged by recent developments on the fiscal year \u201816 defense budget process that both the administration and Congress have presented initial budget proposals that could exceed previously established budget caps. Many of our leaders agree that the cap levels are not sufficient to contend with today\u2019s dynamic threat environment and are therefore seeking ways to add more resources.","Well, we won\u2019t speculate on what the final funding level for DoD will be in 2016. Even if the budget control caps are not raised at all, the DoD base budget funding will be several billion dollars higher in 2016 than 2015. Bottom line is the trajectory of the DoD base budget is finally starting to trend upward.","Late in the first quarter, we announced the settlement with the U.K. Home Office relating to Raytheon Systems Limited eBorders contract. Under the settlement, we received a cash payment equal to approximately $226 million in exchange for the resolution of all claims and counter claims of both parties. Toby will walk you through the details in his remarks.","As we announced earlier this week, consistent with our strategy to position Raytheon for global growth, we are now entering into a partnership with Vista Equity Partners, combining their premier commercial cybersecurity business, Websense, with Raytheon\u2019s cyber products to form a new company. This new company will provide a broad set of integrated defense grade cybersecurity products and services to the global marketplace. We are very excited about this opportunity. We see significant revenue synergies and look forward to closing sometime late in the second quarter.","In conclusion, I\u2019m pleased with our performance in the first quarter, the progress in setting the foundation for future global growth. And I\u2019d like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication for this great start to the year.","With that, let me turn it over to Toby.","Toby O\u2019Brien","Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks starting with the first quarter highlights and then we\u2019ll move on to questions. During my remarks, I\u2019ll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.","If everyone would turn to Page 3. We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the first quarter. All app [ph] are better than our expectations. It\u2019s a good start to the year and we\u2019re positioned well for achieving our full-year outlook. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.78. And on an adjusted basis, EPS was $1.26. I\u2019ll discuss this in more detail in just a moment.","Operating margin was solid at 15.9% and included the previously announced eBorders settlement with the U.K. Home Office. And on an adjusted basis, our operating margin was 11.5%. Sales of $5.3 billion were slightly higher than our guidance.","During the quarter, the company bought back 2.8 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program for $300 million. And we announced last month that we increased our dividend by 10.7%. We have now raised our annual dividend every year for the past 11 years.","I also want to point out that we\u2019re raising the guidance that we\u2019ve provided in January to include the eBorders settlement. I\u2019ll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.","Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our first quarter results.","Company bookings for the first quarter were $4.5 billion. International awards represented 34% of the total. And on a trailing four-quarter basis, the book-to-bill ratio is 1.07. A couple of key bookings in the first quarter included a $769 million award for Patriot from the Republic of Korea and a $539 million award for AMRAAM for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and international customers.","And as Todd mentioned a few minutes ago, just after the end of the first quarter, we received significant orders from both domestic and international customers. We\u2019re off to a strong start in the second quarter and the year-to-date bookings will help drive our second half performance.","Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $32.5 billion and on a funded basis was $23.7 billion, an increase of almost $1 billion compared to the first quarter of 2014. It\u2019s worth noting that we ended the first quarter of 2015 with approximately 41% of our backlog now comprised of international programs.","If you\u2019d now move to Page 5. As I just mentioned, for the first quarter of 2015, sales were slightly higher than the guidance we set in January. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2015 had one less work day than the first quarter of 2014 and this equates to about $100 million in sales overall.","As we said in January, we expected the first quarter to be the most challenging. We still expect sales to ramp up throughout the year.","Looking now at sales by business. IDS at first quarter of 2015 net sales of $1.4 billion. The change from Q1 2014 was primarily due to the plan completion of certain production phases on international Patriot programs. We expect IDS sales to increase as we move through the year as the recently awarded Patriot international programs begin to ramp up.","In the first quarter of 2015, IIS had net sales of $1.4 billion. Compared with the same quarter last year, the change is primarily due to our training programs. Missile systems at first quarter of 2015 net sales of $1.5 billion. The change from the first quarter of 2014 was primarily due to both the Tomahawk and SM-3 programs.","And SAS had net sales of $1.4 billion. Secure communication systems programs contributed to the change versus last year.","Moving ahead to Page 6, we were pleased by our overall company margins. Our operating margin was 15.9% and on an adjusted basis was 11.5%.","As a reminder, our first quarter of 2015 adjusted margin excludes both the favorable FAS\/CAS adjustment which was worth 90 basis points or $0.10 per share and 340 basis points or $0.42 per share for the eBorders settlement.","And as we discussed on the last earnings call in January, compared to 2014, we expect our margins for 2015 will be impacted by a change in program mix as well as higher R&D [ph] and program investments. We continue to invest in ourselves with the objective of positioning the company for future growth.","So looking at the business margins, the change in margin at IDS was primarily driven by a change in program mix on international Patriot programs nearing completion. IES margin in the first quarter 2015 benefited from the eBorders settlement that I previously discussed which contributed $181 million to operating income. Without the settlement, IES margins would be 7.5% or in line with our expectations.","Missiles margin was up in the quarter compared to the same period last year. This year\u2019s first quarter benefited from a $25 million or approximately 170 basis point favorable resolution of a contractual issue which was previously expected later in the year.","And SAS margin of 12.7% was down compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies in the first quarter of 2014. Overall, the company continues to perform well.","Turning now to Page 7. First quarter 2015 EPS was $1.78 and on an adjusted basis was $1.26. EPS for the first quarter of 2015 was better than expected, primarily due to the eBorders settlement and from timing at Missiles.","On Page 8, we are updating the company\u2019s financial outlook for 2015 which now includes the impact of the eBorders settlement.","As Tom mentioned, earlier in the week we announced the Websense transaction. We expect this transaction to close late in the second quarter and we will update our financial guidance subsequent to the closing.","We still expect our full-year 2015 net sales to be in the range of between $22.3 billion and $22.8 billion. We have raised our full-year 2015 EPS which is now expected to be in a range of between $6.67 and $6.82. We expect adjusted EPS to be within a range of between $5.49 and $5.64 which is unchanged from our prior guidance.","As a reminder, we have not included the possible extension of the R&D tax credit in our 2015 guidance. If the legislation passes, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 110 basis points and our EPS by about $0.10.","As I mentioned earlier, we re-purchased 2.8 million shares of common stock for $300 million in the quarter and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 305 million and 307 million shares for 2015, a 2% reduction at the midpoint of the range.","Operating cash flow in the quarter was in line with our prior guidance. As a result of the eBorders settlement, we now see our 2015 guidance for operating cash flow to be between $2.4 billion and $2.7 billion. We received the settlement payment in the second quarter.","And as you can see on Page 9, we\u2019ve included guidance by business which is unchanged from our prior outlook except for IIS and total company margin, which now include the eBorders settlement.","On Page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, EPS and operating cash flow for the balance of 2015.","As we discussed on the call in January, sales are expected to ramp up throughout the year. In the first half of 2015, we still expect sales to be down on a percentage basis. Sales in the back half of the year are expected to be in line to slightly up versus 2014. And if you compare second half sales to first half sales, we expect to see mid single-digit growth.","As you may recall, our 2014 bookings finished strong, particularly with respect to international. This, taken together with the combined first quarter and early second quarter 2015 bookings, are all key drivers of our second half sales expectations.","And as we discussed on the January call, our effective tax rate in the second quarter is expected to be impacted by a favorable non-cash tax settlement of $88 million or $0.29 per diluted share.","Before concluding, I\u2019d like to spend a minute to talk about our capital deployment strategy. We expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet going forward. We will remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders, including internal investments to support our growth plans as well as share buybacks and dividend increases that are subject to board approval. And as we sit here today, possibly smaller targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs.","In summary, we saw a good performance in the first quarter. We continue to execute well. Our bookings were ahead of last year\u2019s first quarter and sales EPS and operating cash flow from operations were all in line or higher than the guidance we set in January.","We remain well positioned with our domestic customers\u2019 priority areas and continue to be aligned with the evolving priorities of our international customers. Our objective is to drive the business, to maximize value for our customers and shareholders.","With that, Tom and I will now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Please proceed.","Howard Rubel","Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you.","Thomas Kennedy","Good morning, Howard.","Howard Rubel","Toby, just as an observation first, I was thinking with this 20% margin now that Dave is not here to respond to it, thinking about maybe - if you know where I\u2019m going - setting that as his incentive target goals for the balance of the year.","Toby O\u2019Brien","That\u2019s good input, Howard. We\u2019ll definitely take that into consideration.","Howard Rubel","But in all seriousness, I asked sort of as a collection of businesses that have some interesting opportunities. And when we looked at the growth profile, it seems to be challenged relative to the overall environment. Can you explain and elaborate a little bit upon, not only what Websense is going to do, but where your initiatives are there to enhance that business?","Thomas Kennedy","Yes, hey, Howard, this is Tom. Let me take that. Number one, one of the strategies that IAS is actually executing very well is to expand its cyber capabilities in core competencies into both the international and now the commercial market space.","And as we discussed on prior calls, we have had some significant wins on the international marketplace. And so we\u2019re showing that we\u2019re globally competitive in the cyber arena. And so we\u2019re seeing expansion in that area.","We\u2019re also seeing them expand in their training worldwide. And some of it is under the Warfighter FOCUS program. But we\u2019re also expanding into other areas of training into international markets. We\u2019re direct with international governments. So that\u2019s another big area that they\u2019re moving out on.","The other play is essentially upgrading a lot of the systems that are out there in terms of adding in information assurance capability taking the knowledge that they\u2019ve gained from the GPS OCX program and leveraging that into other programs.","And then the last one is - hopefully you\u2019ve been watching and noticing that they\u2019ve been winning quite a few programs out there. And for example, they won the LISC program. They\u2019ve also just recently won the NISSC program. So they\u2019ve been winning more than their fair shares of programs. And we\u2019re very, I would say, upbeat relative to IAS in their ability to continue to grow and exceed the industry in their area in terms of growth.","Howard Rubel","And then just one other follow-up question in a slightly different area. You\u2019ve also expanded missile systems beyond just Patriot. And for a moment, could you just address how the NASAMS offerings are? I think you still have some opportunities there in Poland and elsewhere.","Thomas Kennedy","Yes, it\u2019s a great question. And a lot of people - the NASAM system or sometimes called SL-AMRAAM, gets overshadowed by the Patriot. But our last big win on the NASAMS was in Oman. That was back in 2013. And that was about $1.3 billion for the system itself and then there was another $300 million worth of AMRAAM activities [indiscernible] FMS contract for a total deal of $1.6 billion.","That system is deployed now or being deployed in six countries. I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s a very great system. And the other area that we are pursuing right now and we should learn in 2017 is a pursuit in Poland. This is a - we already got selected for the Patriot system for their, I would call, their medium integrated air and missile system. This is the lower tier missile defense system below Patriot. And we\u2019re in a competition for that. Again, 2017 they\u2019re going to make their selection.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much for your time.","Thomas Kennedy","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Thomas Kennedy","Hey, Rob. Good morning.","Robert Stallard","Tom, first one, you mentioned OCD, the Poland decision, but also that Germany is moving towards the DAMs. So like do you think this is a sign that European defense spending might finally be stabilizing? And do you see other opportunities in the region?","Thomas Kennedy","Number one, we do see other opportunities in the region. It is being driven by the geopolitics that are going on right now especially in the Eastern Europe. Poland is building up their defenses and making a major play in that area, again, under the auspices of a strong defense is a strong deterrence. And we\u2019re also seeing that in other Eastern European countries also. Germany is in need to upgrade their systems. So I think you\u2019re right. There is a little bit of maybe sense of urgency. But this was in their plan to do this upgrade for several years.","Robert Stallard","Okay. And just a quick follow-up on Websense. I don\u2019t think you mentioned it on the call the other day. When do you expect it to actually be accretive on a GAAP EPS basis?","Thomas Kennedy","I\u2019ll turn that over to Toby.","Toby O'Brien","Yes. So on a GAAP basis, Rob, we\u2019re probably looking about three to four years down the road before it would be accretive. And that\u2019s due really to the amortization of two non-cash items. One would be the intangibles associated with the transaction.","Then also we\u2019d be amortizing some deferred revenue. They have a subscription model where the revenues are recognized ratably over the life of the contract. But the payments are all upfront. And we\u2019re going to fair value that. And that amortization tells a lot, a bit shorter, that\u2019s about a two to three years. Whereas the intangibles will go out over seven years.","That said, we do think the best way to look at this business is more akin to a cash basis. And adjusting the results for the impacts of these two items, the deferred revenue and the amortization of the intangibles. And on that basis, it would be immediately accretive to earnings.","Robert Stallard","Okay. Thanks, Toby.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes. Thank you very much. So the competition claims that Germany wants to have 360-degree capability. In open architecture, neither of which Patriot provides. And yet you guys are the incumbent. Tell us about the factors you think are going to be important to Germany\u2019s decision and when they might reach it.","Thomas Kennedy","Well, I don\u2019t know exactly how they\u2019re going to make their decision. I do know that they will be making the decision in the next year. And what they are looking for is they need a strong system to provide deterrence. And so we believe Patriot provides that, number one.","And two is we believe the system that we can get in their hands the soonest. In other words, we\u2019re in production. We can deliver right out of the factory and [indiscernible] the quickest time possible.","The other element is the fact that they have a lot of their already trained on using the Patriot. And so even though we\u2019ve upgraded the Patriot, put in modern man stations, a lot of the maintenance and training is already behind them. So they already have that in place. So we think the Patriot provides the most economical but yet strongest deterrence capability for them moving forward.","Cai von Rumohr","Okay, terrific. And then your R&D was up from 2% of sales to 2.7% of sales. Could you tell us where did you spend it, what did you spend it on and how much of that is covered by IR&D?","Thomas Kennedy","Okay. So that is all IR&D, number one, I\u2019ll answer that. But we\u2019re continuing to invest in technologies. That\u2019s been crucial to our recent competitive success. I\u2019ll give you an example. On the GaN technology, we started investing in 10 years ago when folks thought you couldn\u2019t make GaN work. And we continued to invest in over the years and essentially we proved them wrong, that it can work and it can provide a great capability. And that put us in a great position on multiple wins, AMDR, Next Generation Jammer, 3DELRR. And there\u2019s actually a few radar competitions coming out now.","So we do invest to essentially establish discriminators for us to go win in the future. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re putting our efforts moving forward. And areas - and this is actually part of our strategy is to invest in what we call new emerging areas. So we are investing in next generation radars, high energy lasers, hypersonics. In fact, we just recently won a major hypersonics contract from DARPA. It\u2019s called the Tactical Boost Glide program. That was for the development and demonstration of technologies to enable air-launched, tactical range hypersonic boost glide systems.","And so we\u2019ve been investing in that area. And that gave us the technologies to go win this advanced DARPA program. We also were investing in undersea capabilities. We believe the undersea offers a lot of significant opportunities moving forward based on the arena of anti-access\/area denial. EW, that\u2019s part of our strategy to continue to invest in EW and grow our business in that area.","That\u2019s kind of a few of the areas that we\u2019re investing in. We believe we have already or establishing discriminators in each of those areas and based on where the roadmap is for our customers. We believe that these are right places for us to invest in.","Toby O\u2019Brien","Yes. And Cai, this is Toby. I would just add to the level of spend of the 2.7%. That\u2019s pretty much in line with what we talked about in the January call of 2.7%, 2.8% of revenue this year for the reasons Tom just described.","Cai von Rumohr","Great. Thank you and congrats on the Patriot wins.","Thomas Kennedy","Well, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Please proceed.","Carter Copeland","Hi. Yes. Hi, good morning, guys.","Thomas Kennedy","Good morning, Carter. How are you doing today?","Carter Copeland","Doing great. Great, thanks, Tom. So just a question. I wondered if you might expand a little bit more specifically on GaN and some of the prior comments about upgrades. And really, when you look at the approval of the exportability of that technology, can you talk to specifically what sort of upgrade opportunities that may enable and what sort of kind of size we should be thinking about those or timing? What does that mean for that franchise longer term?","Thomas Kennedy","Well, I\u2019ll start with the AMDR. We are working with the navy to ensure that the AMDR will be exportable to our coalition partners who use those types of radars for their ships. We are also - the 3DELRR program was a model program for OSD for exportability. And so we won that program. It is in protest right now but that program uses GaN. So that\u2019s number two.","We are also, and I mentioned in my script, that we are working on a 360 AESA radar for the Patriot. And that is a GaN based radar. And we are working to ensure that that is exportable also. So in terms of who would buy these systems, with Poland coming onboard, there are now 14 countries that have the Patriot system.","And you said if you had to go off and you wanted to have an opportunity to replace those radars, the existing radars on those, it would be 200-plus radars. And that would be up for grabs to replace to more with these 360 AESA radars, our AESAs for Patriot.","And this is, I think, a great opportunity for us taking forth these new advanced radar systems to both our domestic and international customers. But we see significant opportunities in the future for taking this GaN technology into the radars and into the international marketplace.","Carter Copeland","How do you think about the timeline and the timing of those kinds of opportunities as you look across the base of Patriot customers? And when they get around to that kind of upgrade, is this a three- to five-year kind of opportunity for the market, the 200 radars? How do you think about that?","Thomas Kennedy","I\u2019ll only answer one. On the Patriot, we have customers knocking on our door today. So it\u2019s a matter of getting to a development and then transition to production and then putting it forward. And we\u2019re also working with our U.S. customer on that timing to ensure that we have essentially all the licenses and everything else to be able to do that.","So I think bottom line, there is pent up demand for those AESA radars. And we\u2019re looking to fill that demand.","Carter Copeland","And just another one to switch gears quickly, I think at one point we were expecting a recompete of Warfighter FOCUS. Where does that stand these days in terms of an RFP on that and maybe just remind us of what to expect on that front?","Thomas Kennedy","Well, right now, for those who don\u2019t know, the Warfighter FOCUS is an IDIQ program that Raytheon runs for the United States Army. That is a program that we are actively engaging today. It\u2019s running very well. And I think it\u2019s serving the army and also the international customers very well. So I think they\u2019re very pleased with it.","We believe that that program will continue. The army is looking at some acquisition changes in terms of what\u2019s the follow-on to Warfighter FOCUS. That has gone through several changes recently. And I don\u2019t think right now has settled down in terms of what the final arrangements will be.","Carter Copeland","Okay, so just stay tuned.","Thomas Kennedy","I think stay tuned and - but in - and from Raytheon\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s met more stable work relative to Warfighter FOCUS since that change has not occurred.","Carter Copeland","Great. Congrats on a big leap, guys.","Thomas Kennedy","Yes, thank you.","Toby O\u2019Brien","Thanks, Carter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Robert Spingarn","Good morning.","Thomas Kennedy","Good morning, Rob.","Robert Spingarn","Hi, guys. Couple of questions, two different topics. The first is on the - Toby, on your sales guidance, which is essentially down 2% to flat at the ends - the range there, what are the relative growth rates you now see for domestic versus international within that?","Toby O\u2019Brien","Yes, so for the total year, what we\u2019d be looking at for domestic is to be down in the low single-digits. And for international, up in the low to mid single-digits.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. And it sounds like the international again may be a little backend weighted given the recent awards.","Toby O\u2019Brien","Yes, definitely --","Robert Spingarn","Or the growth accelerates?","Toby O\u2019Brien","Yes, you got that exactly right. I mean, I think if you want to think about the cadence throughout the year, and obviously with international growing versus domestic declining, we\u2019d see second quarter sales flat to up from Q1 from a sequential point of view and then sequentially growth in the back half of the year. And it\u2019s exactly as you said, Rob. It\u2019s driven by the new awards from the end of 2014 plus what we\u2019re seeing here in the first three-plus months of this year and their natural ramp as they start up.","Robert Spingarn","Okay. And then just with respect to the comment on European demands stabilizing and growing here, is there any currency impact on margins that we should start to contemplate?","Thomas Kennedy","So that question came up on a prior call. I\u2019ll give you what we\u2019re seeing. Number one is most of our business is tied to the U.S. dollar. For example, all the FMS contracts we had, the Foreign Military Sales contracts are all in U.S. dollars. And then a lot of our customers, especially in the Middle East, their currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar.","So even on direct commercial sales there we don\u2019t have any impact. And we do have two landed companies. We have Raytheon Australia and Raytheon Systems Limited. They tend to work with their own working capital and essentially our sales in British pound sterling and then the Raytheon Australia it\u2019s the Australian dollar. They tend to work --","Robert Spingarn","I was going to say, I understand that it\u2019s conducted in U.S. dollars but to the extent that these guys are based for example in euros, the European guys, they\u2019ve got to translate. So does that maybe adjust their demand, their pricing appetite?","Thomas Kennedy","Toby is going to give you the exact numbers, right. Toby, why don\u2019t you just give them the numbers?","Toby O\u2019Brien","Yes, so I think from a - the two type of potential exposures we have is around where we - if we have a mismatch between U.S. dollar and a different denominated currency. As Tom said, that\u2019s very minimal because most of our contracts are matched to the dollar. In the cases when we have that, we hedge it using foreign exchange contracts. And that\u2019s the little to no - minimal exposure there.","And in the cases where we have these foreign entities like in the U.K. and Australia where they do operate in a non-U.S. dollar functional currency, again, they\u2019re generally getting paid in that same currency. So in Australia, they operate in the Aussie dollar. They get paid from their customer in the Aussie dollar.","And we do have some translation risk, right, when we convert those foreign denominated financial results back to U.S. dollars. But again, historically, that has been pretty minimal.","Robert Spingarn","Okay, thank you. I\u2019ll jump back in.","Thomas Kennedy","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Hunter Keay","Thanks, everybody. I appreciate it. A little bit more on IRAD, a follow-up maybe to Cai\u2019s question, a little bit of a different angle, though. You guys said the long term IRAD should still be in the high 2% range of sales. If global defense budgets continue to improve, does that go higher or does it go lower? I mean, my gut would say it will go lower but threats are very dynamic. The competitive environment is still very difficult. So I would think there\u2019d be some level of sort of elevated investment on an ongoing basis that may be needed.","But assuming the backdrop of better defense spending on a global basis, where should that long term IRAD go?","Thomas Kennedy","Only to kind of back you up into - and tying this to our strategy, so we go - often we look at our strategy, we look at what the demand needs are from the customers and then we go look at what gas we have in terms of technology that\u2019s required to go fulfill them over a period of a three-year window, a five-year window and then a 10-year window.","And then based on that, we look at what technologies need to be developed and then what we will look at in terms of funding those technologies and to be ready at the time that they need to be ready at for us to be competitive in the marketplace. And it\u2019s all driven by the strategy and by what we - the capability needs of the customer.","It\u2019s not driven by sales and some exact percentage of sales. That\u2019s just how we do it. Essentially, it\u2019s a bottoms-up buildup based on the demand cycle from the customer and also what our technology gaps are.","Toby O\u2019Brien","And I\u2019d just throw in there, and it plays exactly into what Tom was saying. When we make these decisions on how to invest, where and what level, it\u2019s all with an eye towards returning value to shareholders, increasing value to shareholders, driving growth, profitable growth. So it\u2019s a little difficult to generalize looking forward whether that relationship, that percentage would go up or down for all the previous reasons.","Hunter Keay","Okay, great. Thanks a lot for that. And let\u2019s talk about Next Gen Jammer for a minute, if you would. Can you help us understand how it\u2019s going to kind of slew [ph] up over the long term and give us an idea how to think of some of the follow-on increments? What are some of the pacing items for those? What\u2019s sort of the competitive set and maybe help us think about, in a best case scenario, the potential opportunity for you guys longer term? Thanks a lot.","Thomas Kennedy","Yes. So, our Next Generation Jammer, for those who don\u2019t know, that\u2019s a electronic warfare - essentially, it\u2019s a self-contained pod, generates its own power. That gets converted into electrical energy to drive jammers within the pod. There\u2019s two of those pods per Growler. That\u2019s the F-18G which is the electronic warfare platform for the United States Navy.","And so we won a major contract for that a couple years back. And it actually uses a GaN technology. So there is a technology that we had invested in 10 years ago that helped us win that program. And we see that program having quite long legs. Number one, we\u2019re going into the development phase now and then they\u2019ll eventually get into transition to production and then enter production.","As I mentioned, it\u2019s on schedule. It\u2019s on cost and it\u2019s hitting all of its milestones. And we think that\u2019s going to be a very successful franchise program for Raytheon in the future.","Hunter Keay","Thank you.","Thomas Kennedy","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning.","Thomas Kennedy","Good morning, Sam. How are you doing?","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. Couple little questions. First is, why is cash flow from operations up only about $100 million when I thought the eBorders settlement was GBP150 million?","Thomas Kennedy","Yes, so the eBorders settlement, you got the number right, it\u2019s about $226 million. But the payment came in on the first day of the second quarter.","Sam Pearlstein","Right. But I\u2019m just saying, for the full-year outlook, you\u2019re only increasing $100 million.","Thomas Kennedy","Yes, not - yes, sure, Sam. So fist I\u2019ll start and, as you said, we increased the year by $100 million. We\u2019re also going up $100 million in the second quarter as part of that. It is attributable to the eBorders settlement. But it has been partially offset - this is getting at the crux of your question - by some changes in program milestone collections as a result of some later timing on awards within the year.","So the cash isn\u2019t gone. It\u2019s just - it\u2019s a timing issue for that $100 million, if you will, between 2015 and in \u201816. We do have a range of $300 million in our outlook or our guidance there. So our expectations are to be within this range.","Overall, we continue to see strong operating cash flow in 2015. The range now expected to be between $2.4 billion and $2.7 billion. We do see still the majority of the cash flow being weighted in the second half of the year really driven by the timing of significant program milestones.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. That\u2019s great. And then can you talk a little bit about the IDS segment, just looking at the margins this quarter and how do you get them to 50% this year? Are there other certain milestone of contractual resolutions or some of it is the direct foreign sale of the recent award, what is it that drives that margin up?","Thomas Kennedy","Yes, sure. So in Q1, as you pointed out, right, the margins were down. That was as expected. And consistent with what we said in January, that was driven by the mix due to - unfavorable mix due to the plan ramp-down on certain of our international Patriot programs. So looking forward, clearly, we see the margins at IDS improving primarily in the second half of the year.","That overall business mix will improve just as you said, as these new international programs from the end of 2014 and the awards here in the early part of 2015 start to ramp up and move through the production cycle so that the mix gets more favorable, but not until the second half of the year.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. And if I can add one more. I just want to summarize in terms of some of the commentary about the acquisitions. Is it fair to say that we\u2019ll see more balanced after the deployment in that $1 billion plus type of acquisitions from here on out now that Websense has been announced?","Thomas Kennedy","As we sit today, and we\u2019ll continue to look for valuated target acquisitions that do position the company for future growth. But we don\u2019t see as I sit here today a large acquisition of the size of Websense. But there could potentially be some smaller acquisitions to fit some technology areas that we need to be successful in that market space.","Sam Pearlstein","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment of Sterne Agee, CRT. Please proceed.","Peter Arment","Yes, good morning, Tom and Toby.","Thomas Kennedy","Good morning.","Peter Arment","A question on - I guess a clarification back to Rob\u2019s comment on kind of domestic versus international. Clarification, Toby, on you said the domestic being down a little bit, low single-digit, international, up.","Does that continue at that same pace in the \u201916 or do we see domestic improve kind of given Tom\u2019s comments about the \u201916 budget?","Toby O\u2019Brien","Yes. So let me answer it this way. Clearly, with the awards that we\u2019ve seen, again, coming out of the end of last year and into \u201914, we\u2019d expect to see strong performance into \u201916 on the international front. On the domestic side of it, Todd, back to the comments that Tom made earlier relative to where the domestic budgets are going, we\u2019d probably see our domestic profile start to flatten out towards the end of the year. And we could start to see some improvement going forward.","Peter Arment","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just lastly - and congratulations on all these Patriot wins. Tom, you mentioned kind of 14 countries that now they\u2019re deployed. I mean how do we think about that long-term? I mean we ask this I think every quarter about what inning are we in in terms of missile defense orders out in the Middle East and Asia but how do we think about the opportunity longer term outside of kind of you just mentioned, Poland, Germany, et cetera?","Thomas Kennedy","So outside of the bringing on a whole brand new country like we\u2019ve done with Poland, we hope to do with Germany, that we did do with Qatar, there are also the upgrade capabilities with each of the partner countries that have the Patriot system. And right now we\u2019ve been doing something called Configuration-3 plus. You may have heard us talk about them on some of the calls. That\u2019s a major upgrade to the Patriot system that we\u2019re off and working with the Archon.","And as of today, there is 72 fire units that are still there for upgrade potential. And we are working with those customers to upgrade those systems. And then I also mentioned previously the upgrade for the 360 AESA radar. That will be a new upgrade for all the Patriot systems. And there\u2019s over 200 of those radars to be upgraded.","So I think the way of looking at it is that these 14 countries are a market of surrounded around Patriot. And so we are working with those customers to continually to upgrade those systems to counter the evolving threat. So there\u2019s a base program that the software upgrades and other things as the threat changes. And that we work across those countries. And then also as new technology comes on board to improve the capability of the system, we then insert that technology across those 14 countries\u2019 Patriot systems.","So essentially, it\u2019s a market on its own that we look to continually to upgrade and provide a support activity. So it\u2019s a great franchise business. And it also does, for the customers, it allows them to share in the cost for any software upgrades for the evolving threat and then also to share in the cost of the development of new technology. So it\u2019s a great win-win situation for both sides.","Peter Arment","That\u2019s great color. Thanks, Tom.","Toby O\u2019Brien","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed.","Pete Skibitski","Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Thomas Kennedy","Good morning, Pete. How are you doing?","Pete Skibitski","Good, good. Hey, on Poland Patriots, I was wondering if you could give us some more color on maybe ballpark some of the characteristics of the contract. There\u2019s a lot of numbers falling out there. Some of them are talking about more than $5 billion. Can you give us a sense of how many batteries it\u2019s going to be maybe ballpark the size and length and then when you talk about the 2016 booking, are you talking early in the year or later in the year?","Thomas Kennedy","So just real quick. So right as of today, actually Tuesday, we were down - we were selected by Poland to provide the Patriot solution for their integrated air and missile defense system. And then as part of that activity, we have provided various, I would call it options, for the Polish government, variants of Patriot and quantities of fire units and how to set them up in their country. So we have been working with them.","But now some additional work is required to move forward to definitize what that exact configuration will be for the Polish government. As part of that effort, we also have been working with Polish industry. We have 25 plus agreements with Polish industry in terms of doing coproduction and potential codevelopment activities all in support of the Patriot system.","So the bottom line is we\u2019ll be in negotiations with the Polish government to act to define exactly what this configuration is. And as we get that information and get more clarity on that, we\u2019ll be providing that to you guys to ensure you understand where that program is going.","Toby O\u2019Brien","And I think, Pete, given all that Tom said, while we can\u2019t exactly predict when the award would come, think back out of 2016 because there is some work to be done to work through all those steps.","Pete Skibitski","Okay. I got it. I got it. And then just on the streak [ph] you guys on with Patriot, is it fair to say that the IDS being your highest margin business that that maybe has the best kind of midrange growth outlook for the firm?","Thomas Kennedy","I\u2019ll take it out first and then I\u2019ll let Toby come in and he can put some numbers on some things. But the bottom line is in IDS, with all these Patriots coming in, in some cases bumper-to-bumper and some case coming in on top of each other. What that\u2019s doing and that\u2019s allowing us to stack all this up in the factory to gain significant, I would call, production efficiencies and getting IDS margins back to what we\u2019ve traditionally have had in that business.","So essentially, it\u2019s replenishing the backlog for that factory and allowing us to gain those efficiencies as you move forward. That\u2019s a good news on IDS. But don\u2019t forget, IDS is also once a major program. For example, the air and missile defense radar program that they have that are off and running. They also won the 3DELRR, which is in protest.","So in addition to the Patriot franchise getting reinvented to a certain extent and all the upgrade potential for it, they also have some brand new franchises that are on the horizon that they have in hand. And that the AMDR is in development. That\u2019s going to be transitioning into production. That\u2019s going to go into both the U.S. domestic and also international coalition partners. And then we have the 3DELRR which is in protest right now. But when that comes out of protest, assuming Raytheon is on the right side of that, that is another program that has a significant, actually was set up by OST to be an international program on day one. So a brand new franchise for them there.","So bottom line is IDS is much more than just Patriot moving forward. And I have that same - I can give you that same play for each of the other businesses. All the businesses are coming up with I would call it new franchises. And they\u2019re also reinventing their existing franchises.","We talked about AMRAAM. AMRAAM has gone through a whole new upgrade program. It\u2019s called the AIM-120D. It\u2019s a brand new missile. Great capabilities. And so it\u2019s essentially been reinvented. And just in the last year, over a $1 billion worth of AMRAAM orders.","So this is going on all throughout the company across all our product lines and across all our pursuits.","Toby O\u2019Brien","And I would - Pete, I\u2019d just add that specific to IDS when we talk about mix, that\u2019s probably the one business within the company that can have the biggest swing or the most impact because of mix, in part, given the nature of the beast with the large $1 billion plus contracts that drive that within IDS.","So that combined with loading up the factory here, does give us confidence that we will be seeing improvement over time in the IDS margin as we had previously talked about.","Pete Skibitski","That\u2019s great. Thanks, guys.","Thomas Kennedy","Thank you.","Todd Ernst","All right. Chantilly, we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Okay. Your final question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.","Doug Harned","Good morning. Thank you.","Thomas Kennedy","Good morning, Doug. How are you doing today?","Doug Harned","Good, good. I wanted to ask on IDS because if we go back historically, the business could be doing 16%, even 17% type margins. So I know today, on the positive side, you\u2019ve got more international work, higher percentage of that there, which should be good.","And the negative side in the near-term, a lot of new programs, which you probably are looking at lower margin. When you talk about what the percentage of international is and then can we expect this to go back over time to those 16%, 17% type margin levels that we used to see?","Thomas Kennedy","So, Doug, you\u2019re asking a very interesting question to two individuals who used to actually run that business. I don\u2019t know if you remember that or not. But we have a deep domain understanding of what it takes to drive the margins in that business. So Toby is going to walk you through this. And you couldn\u2019t have asked the two people that are more familiar with our business.","Toby O\u2019Brien","So IDS does have the largest international content of our four businesses. It has been running close to about 50%, 50-50 domestic-international. And obviously that mix in and of itself, putting time in the side, does help to drive the margin profile.","As you pointed out, we have run going back last year 16%; in 2013, a little over 17%. And depending upon the timing of some of these other programs that you alluded to, which they are development programs, they are being booked at lower margins, things like AMDR. Tom mentioned 3DELRR. As those move ultimately through production, they\u2019ll help lift the margin.","But it is possible to see margins start overtime. But it will take a couple of years once this backlog really gets into kind of full steam on this international Patriot awards before we would potentially see them climbing back up to those past historical levels.","Thomas Kennedy","I think, Doug, one thing that really has - two guys that run that business, very excited about what we\u2019re seeing is the, I would call it the bumper-to-bumper work, and we mentioned just over the last 18 months close to $7 billion worth of new bookings. And that doesn\u2019t include Poland. And if you lay in or layer in Poland on top of these others, that you have essentially a full factory going up almost to 2022.","So that allows us to really work the efficiencies, productivity, really allows us to work with our suppliers across the board, gives us levers that you don\u2019t have when you just have one contract.","And so we\u2019re very upbeat about IDS here over the next several year. Both and I will be definitely probing to ensure that they meet our expectations. Having run the business, we know which levers they are. And if they don\u2019t have their hands on those levers, we\u2019ll make sure those hands get on those levers very quickly.","Doug Harned","And then shifting gears a little bit. Two technologies that have become an increasingly high priority in the Pentagon have been directed energy weapons and rail guns, two things that you all have been working on for quite a few years.","Could you talk about the outlook for those technologies? Are these something that you see - and what timeframe contributing materially to your revenues?","Thomas Kennedy","Well, number one is we\u2019re - you\u2019re absolutely correct. We have been investing in these technologies for many years, especially the high energy laser. We see that as core to our business. We have great domain expertise in that area. We believe we have a great new technology in that area that will allow us to gain market share. We are working with the U.S. government on several programs relative to high energy lasers.","I think the bottom line is going to be, Doug, is when is the U.S. government ready to move forward into a major EMD program on one of these systems. The power levels have to get up to be something that you\u2019d actually want to, I would call it, put into service. And the technology that we have allows us to get to those power levels.","But again, you do need in this marketplace, you need essentially a customer sponsor who\u2019s willing to work with you and take you into EMD program and then transition the production also to go through all the testing required to get one of these systems into the hands of our war fighters. But I think we\u2019re in the cost of moving in that direction.","Doug Harned","But it sounds like it\u2019s a few years off. Is that --","Thomas Kennedy","Yes, a few years off I would say. But we\u2019re not talking decades.","Doug Harned","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas Kennedy","Okay.","Todd Ernst","All right. We\u2019re going to have to leave it there. Thank you for joining us this morning. We look forward to speak with you again on our second quarter conference call on July. Chantilly.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day."],"18167":["Raytheon Co.

My name is Mark and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Todd Ernst - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our first quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.","With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby and then we'll move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon has had a good start out of the gates in 2016. Total company bookings increased 39% in the first quarter and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.08, driven in part by a large year-over-year increase in demand in the Middle East\/North Africa region as well as strong domestic bookings. Our first quarter sales were well above our expectation, with strong growth in our Missiles business. Cash flow and EPS were also better than expected. This good start gives us continued confidence in our full year outlook. Toby will cover the financial details with you in a few moments.","Across our global markets, demand for precision munitions, command and control, including C5I solutions, force protection, integrated air and missile defense and missionized ISR platforms continues to be strong. As we've seen in prior quarters, our Middle East and North Africa customers are continuing to look past near-term volatility in oil prices and are investing in high priority solutions to address an immediate and rapidly evolving threat environment.","I visited the region earlier this month to celebrate our 50th anniversary in Saudi Arabia and met with customers. While there, I received first-hand feedback about the successful performance of our products and how they are helping protect citizens and critical infrastructure every day. I can tell you from these discussions that the interest level across the entire MENA region remains high for the types of advanced solutions we offer.","One of the more significant upcoming MENA opportunities includes an early-warning radar system for Qatar at IDS which we expect to be awarded later this year. This program, which will significantly increase the air and missile defense sensing capabilities for Qatar has a value approaching $1 billion and has already been through the congressional notification process.","As I mentioned earlier, our bookings in the quarter were strong. When looking across the businesses, a key driver was Space and Airborne Systems, which had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.7 in the quarter, driven by domestic space-based sensor solutions in both domestic and international classified. This was the second consecutive quarter of strong bookings at SAS. And building on this, after the close of the first quarter, we announced that SAS had received a $1 billion booking for the engineering and manufacturing development phase for the next-generation Jammer franchise. These awards provide a solid foundation from which SAS will ramp sales growth into the second half of this year.","In addition to SAS, we also saw a strong year-over-year increase in bookings in Missile Systems, driven by a number of products, including AMRAAM and SM-6. Before moving on, I would also like to point out that our overall domestic classified business, which experienced a significant increase in full year 2015 bookings, continued to see strong demand into the first quarter of 2016. Book-to-bill for the total company domestic classified was 1.3 in the quarter.","First quarter sales for the company increased 9% year-over-year. Our international revenue was up 17% and represented 30% of total sales. Domestic sales were up 6%, with domestic classified sales increasing 12%. As I mentioned earlier, one of the key drivers of the company's first quarter sales was Missile Systems. Let me take a few moments to talk a little bit more about what is driving activity in missiles.","As many of you know, our Missile business includes a number of franchise programs. Our global customers look to us to ensure that these programs continue to offer the most advanced capabilities so that they can stay ahead of evolving threats. A great example of this in the quarter was solid growth from AMRAAM, where we are ramping up production on the latest most advanced version of the missile, the AIM-120D. While this missile shares the AMRAAM name with earlier versions, it is vastly more capable. Across our program portfolio at Missiles, there are many other examples where we create value by upgrading the system's technology, including programs such as the Evolved Seasparrow Missile, a premier ship defense missile for our global customers.","Also, we are seeing opportunities to adapt existing technology to new missions, such as in the case of SM-6 in Tomahawk which are now expanding into the anti-ship domain. Finally, we are developing new capabilities that are on the cutting edge of innovation including hypersonic and directed energy. In addition to this, another growth driver in Missile Systems has been the increase in operating tempo of our U.S. and international customers. As we sit here today, we see this continuing to be a revenue tailwind for the company at least through next year.","But taking a step back, when you look at Raytheon over the past several quarters, it reinforces the value of our diverse portfolio of advanced solutions for our global customers. The recent bookings strength at SAS and Missile Systems, the significant bookings in longer cycle programs at IDS over the past couple of years as well as upcoming opportunities and the competitive position of IIS and Forcepoint in global cybersecurity markets provide a strong foundation for future growth and margin expansion.","We were encouraged by the U.S. fiscal year 2017 defense budget and fight up (7:16) request which was released in February. The overall top line for the fiscal year 2017 budget is consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, with key focus areas including electronic warfare, ISR, missile defense, cyber and long-range strike, all areas that play to our strengths. The Department of Defense is focused on high end capabilities through its Third Offset Strategy aligns well with the high end capabilities Raytheon is known for. And we are actively working with the DoD in this area. We continue to see broad-based support for funding a robust national defense.","Turning now to Forcepoint. We have made considerable progress toward completing the integration of recent acquisitions. Operating performance in the quarter was solid and above our expectations. Further, the business remains on track to meet the growth objectives we've outlined for you on prior calls. With much of the integration behind us, yesterday we announced a change in leadership at Forcepoint. Matthew Moynahan, who was previously at Arbor Networks, will take over as Forcepoint's CEO on May 9.","This change is designed to build on the growth capabilities of the integrated businesses. Matt has a deep background of managing technology companies and has a proven track record of driving growth. John McCormack, who did an outstanding job managing Forcepoint, both when it was private and during the integration with Raytheon, is staying on through the end of the year as an advisor. We thank John for all his hard work and help in positioning Forcepoint to move to the next level. Forcepoint remains well-positioned for the future.","During the first quarter, we continued to execute our balanced capital deployment strategy. In March, we raised our dividend by 9.3%. This is the 12th consecutive annual increase to our dividend and reflects our view that a sustainable competitive dividend is a key capital deployment priority. We also repurchased $400 million of stock through our share repurchase program. And as we said on the call in January, we expect the full year 2016 share buyback to approximately 2015 levels, market conditions permitting.","Before concluding, I'd like to touch on a topic that we don't often talk about on earnings calls, which is of the utmost importance to our shareholders, and that is corporate governance. The company is committed to being a leader in contemporary corporate governance and we believe that good governance enhances shareholder value. In recent years, we have adopted a number of policies, processes and practices to ensure effective governance.","To this end, in March, the Board of Directors voted to amend the company's bylaws to implement proxy access, providing shareholders with a process by which they can include nominees in the company's annual meeting proxy materials. The implementation of proxy access follows on our previous adoption of shareholder action by written consent in 2014 and a special meeting measure in 2010 and further demonstrates Raytheon's commitment to world-class governance practices.","In summary, we had a good overall quarter of solid bookings, revenue growth and EPS performance. We continue to execute our growth strategy while at the same time placing a high priority on driving shareholder value. So thank you to the entire Raytheon team for the good start to 2016. Together, we have built on the momentum generated by our 2015 return to growth by delivering a strong quarter for our company, customers and shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Toby.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the first quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, if everyone would turn to page three.","We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the first quarter with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all better than our expectations. It's a good start to the year and we're positioned well for achieving our full year outlook. We had solid bookings in the first quarter of $6.2 billion resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.08. Sales were $5.8 billion in the quarter, up 9% led by our Missiles, SAS and Forcepoint businesses. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.43, which I'll give a little more color on in just a moment. We generated strong operating cash flow of $325 million in the first quarter primarily due to the timing of collections and tax payments.","During the quarter, the company bought back 3.2 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program for $400 million. And we announced last month that we increased our dividend by 9.3%. We have now raised our annual dividend every year for the past 12 years. I also want to point out that we're raising the EPS guidance that we provided in January. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.","Turning now to page four. Let me start by providing some detail on our first quarter results. Company bookings for the first quarter were $6.2 billion, an increase of approximately $1.7 billion over the same period last year. International awards represented 27% of the total bookings, and on a trailing four-quarter basis, the book-to-bill ratio was 1.14.","A few key bookings in the first quarter included $646 million on AMRAAM at Missiles, and at SAS, over $650 million on an international classified contract and a $553 million award on the Joint Polar Satellite System program. And shortly after the close of the quarter, the U.S. Navy awarded SAS a $1 billion contract on the next-generation jammer program for engineering and manufacturing development.","Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $34.8 billion and on a funded basis was $26.2 billion, an increase of approximately $2.4 billion in funded backlog compared to the first quarter 2015. It's worth noting that we ended the first quarter of 2016 with approximately 42% of our backlog comprised of international programs.","If you now move to page five. As I just mentioned, for the first quarter 2016, sales were higher than the guidance we set in January. Sales were particularly strong at both Missiles and at SAS. We still expect sales for the company to ramp up throughout the year, with the strong second half driven by our bookings over the past several quarters and the duration of our programs.","Looking now at sales by business. IDS had first quarter 2016 net sales of $1.3 billion. The increase from Q1 2015 was primarily driven by higher sales on certain international Patriot programs. We expect IDS sales to increase as we move through the year as some of our international Patriot programs continue to ramp up. In the first quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.5 billion. Compared with the same quarter last year, the increase was primarily due to our cyber security and special mission programs.","Missile Systems had first quarter 2016 net sales of $1.7 billion. The 17% increase from the first quarter 2015 was primarily due to both the Paveway and AMRAAM programs. SAS had net sales of $1.5 billion. Higher sales on classified programs, including an international program, contributed to the 7% increase versus last year. And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of Websense, which we completed in the second quarter of 2015 and Stonesoft, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2016. As a reminder, first quarter 2015 included the results for only Raytheon Cyber Products.","Moving ahead to page six. Let me spend a few minutes talking about our margins. Our operating margin was 10.6% for the total company and 10.2% on a business segment basis. We did have two programs with some unique circumstances that impacted our margins in the quarter. One at IDS for $36 million that because it's in a joint venture, about half was offset through the non-controlling interest line on the income statement. And one at Missiles for $22 million. We don't see any significant remaining financial exposure on these programs. If you exclude the two adjustments I just mentioned, our segment margins would be about 100 basis points higher than reported.","In addition, as we talked about on last year's first quarter call, it's also important to note that in the first quarter of 2015, Missiles recorded a $25 million, or approximately 170-basis point, favorable resolution of a contractual issue related to a supplier settlement. As expected, IIS and SAS margins were both down compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by a change in program mix.","Also, IIS first quarter 2015 margin included the favorable eBorders settlement worth about 340 basis points or $0.42 per share on a total company basis. And at Forcepoint, the first quarter 2016 operating margin was slightly above our expectations for the quarter, driven by strong operating performance. We remain focused on margin improvement going forward and see our base business segment margins in the 12.4% to 12.6% range for the full year, consistent with the guidance we laid out in January.","We also see our margin cadence improving as we move throughout the year. As we have discussed on past calls, we are continuously looking for more ways to lower our costs, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers. A few examples include executing our strategic sourcing strategy to reduce cost in our supply chain, factory automation, complexity reduction initiatives and reducing our footprint. Given these efforts, our strong backlog and as we progress through the life cycle of some of our production programs, we continue to see opportunities for margin expansion.","Turning now to page seven. First quarter 2016 EPS of $1.43 was better than expected, driven largely by higher volume and the recognized tax benefit associated with the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock compensation worth about $0.05.","On page eight, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2016. We still expect our full year 2016 net sales to be in the range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business. We have increased the full year deferred revenue adjustment by $10 million to $77 million to reflect the updated estimate of purchase accounting related to the Stonesoft acquisition we completed earlier in the year.","We have lowered our effective tax rate to reflect the tax benefit associated with the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock compensation that I just discussed which, in total, is worth about $0.13 for the full year, with the additional $0.08 expected in the second quarter. We now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 28.5%, and we have raised our full year 2016 EPS to reflect the tax benefit I just mentioned. We now expect our EPS to be in a range of between $6.93 and $7.13. As I discussed earlier, we repurchased 3.2 million shares of common stock for $400 million in the quarter and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 296 and 298 million shares for 2016, a 3% reduction at the midpoint of the range.","Operating cash flow in the first quarter was strong and we continue to see our full year 2016 operating cash flow outlook between $2.7 billion and $3 billion. And as you can see on page nine, we've included guidance by business, which is unchanged from our prior outlook. I want to reiterate that at IDS, we still see margins in the 15.9% to 16.1% range. As I said on the January call, our full year 2016 guidance includes positive operating income at IDS related to an expected exit from certain business ventures later in 2016, which you can now think of in the $125 million to $150 million range. This is subject to the finalization of the transaction, which we expect to close in the second half of the year.","And as a reminder, when thinking about our 2017 company margin, we see opportunity for upside from 2016 levels, excluding the impact of this gain at IDS that I just discussed, which is expected to be worth about 50 to 60 basis points at the company level in 2016. Before moving on to page 10, as I mentioned on the January call, we still see our 2016 bookings to be between $25 billion and $26 billion, driven by demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. The first quarter was a good step to meeting this target.","On page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, EPS and operating cash flow for the balance of 2016. Here, you can see the ramp we have been referring to in the second half of the year. I want to point out that we now expect the second quarter sales to be in the range of just under $5.7 billion to $5.8 billion, lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of volume that occurred in Q1 that I talked about earlier. And EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in a range of $1.51 to $1.56, slightly higher than our prior guidance due to the adoption of the new accounting standard for stock compensation, worth about $0.08 in the second quarter.","Before concluding, I'd like to spend a minute to talk about our balanced capital deployment strategy. We repurchased $400 million of stock in the quarter, and as we said on the January call, we expect the full year 2016 share buyback to approximate 2015's levels. We raised the dividend by 9.3%, our 12th consecutive annual increase. We continue to expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year and target returning 80% to 90% of free cash flow to shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet.","In summary, we saw good performance in the first quarter. Our bookings were ahead of last year's first quarter and sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all higher than the guidance we set in January. We remain well-positioned for the year with our domestic customers' priority areas and continue to be aligned with the evolving priorities of our international customers. Our objective is to drive the business to maximize value for our customers and shareholders.","With that, Tom and I will now open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Please proceed.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Good morning. Thank you.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning, Howard.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Howard.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Tom, Toby. The \u2013 you've \u2013 how shall I call it? I used to not have to footnote odd items, and of late there's been a couple of adjustments in some of the periods, and they've been a little bit more adverse than one would have expected out of Raytheon. Tom, what are you doing, or Toby, to sort of eliminate some of these variabilities with respect to operational challenges?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","First of all, there was two programs I think you're alluding to that did impact us on the Q1 results. They do have unique circumstances. One of them was a program, essentially complete and we are having some, I would call it warranty issues on some shelters from a supplier. We are working through that with the supplier. We did take a charge this quarter due to that. However, we are working with that supplier to essentially recover those costs. Very similar to, if you look at last year at Missiles, we had an issue with a supplier and we recovered the cost from that supplier last year. This is unfortunately in some cases part of the business when a supplier doesn't perform or has issues, we have to take the charge, but then we go back and recover those costs, and that's where we're at on that one.","The other one was a little bit of a stranger deal with a customer relative to some changes in scope and defining whose responsibility the scope was and also some other issues relative to the structure of the contract. So it's more of a \u2013 to us it's kind of a one-time type of an issue. We don't see that as systemic across the business. And so I am looking at these two as one-off and we are disappointed in the fact that they are one-offs, that they even exist, but we don't see them as being systemic across the business. I hope that helps.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","And I think the other thing Howard, on these two, as I mentioned, I'll reiterate, we don't see any significant financial exposure going forward on either one of these two programs. We think this captures it and bounds it. And I'd also just augment a little bit; we do have a lot of programs as we talk about historically across our portfolio. We feel very confident in the processes that \u2013 by which we use to manage those programs and monitor their progress, and as we said, unfortunately, here there were just some unique circumstances on these two that did impact us here in the quarter and we're going to work to try to at least on the first one at IDS, as Tom said, get some of the impact that we sustained during the quarter recovered through the supplier.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","No \u2013 thank you. That makes a lot of sense. And just as a follow-up, the R&D's up again and what we're seeing is \u2013 I'll call it a change or an evolution in the threat. Tom, could you address a little bit some of the opportunities that you see incrementally in air defense? I think, again, going back to the HASC, there's clearly more need for the U.S. to work on some improvements and I know you are positioning Patriot to take advantage of some of that.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So I think one of the areas that we're \u2013 besides the demand for the Patriot upgrade to configuration 3+ on the existing systems, there also has been a demand for new fire units from several countries that are facing significant issues. As I mentioned, I just came back \u2013 I've actually been in the Middle East twice in the \u2013 since the beginning of the year already. The last one was to celebrate our 50th anniversary in Saudi. And I got first-hand information from the folks that are using the Patriot systems in both \u2013 over that period of time from both the UAE and from Saudi, and I can tell you that the success has been just tremendous relative to them preventing damages due to tactical ballistic missiles landing in their cities and villages. So there's a strong \u2013 they're seeing the success of that system which is \u2013 I would say kind of unleashing a lot of other demand within the region to have the capability. So that's the basic element.","What we're seeing beyond that is a demand on the Patriot system for an advanced AESA radar with 360 capability, and that demand is essentially \u2013 the primary part of that demand is coming from international. We also are seeing it from the U.S. Army. That's their roadmap to add a 360-degree AESA capability to the Patriot system. So we have invested in that technology. I mean it goes all the way back to the GaN work that we'd done almost going 15, 20 years ago, but leading up to how we won the AMDR program using that technology, but now it's transitioning into the Patriot system.","We're also seeing high demand for, I would call it, Third Offset Strategy concepts, and in there is obviously hypersonics, undersea, you saw Secretary Ash Carter talk about something called distributed lethality and he referenced the work that's being done on Tomahawk and the SM-6 relative to that anti-ship capability. So we're seeing quite a bit of opportunities for either enhancements to our existing systems or new systems that \u2013 to ensure that we're positioned to go win those. We are doing IRAT (30:14) activities to support those. I don't know if that answers your question?","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","No. Thank you. That's great.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","And Howard, just from a numbers point of view, so the increase in the first quarter were about 3.5% of sales there's, call it, just under $60 million in absolute dollars of increase and that delta is split roughly 50\/50, half being related to Forcepoint, right, which because of the timing of the acquisitions, wasn't in the first quarter of last year, and the other half primarily driven by our Missiles business for a lot of the reasons Tom just talked about. And as a reminder, for the full year, we're looking at about 3.2% of sales across the business. That's up from last year; but 80%-plus of that increase again is related to Forcepoint and the balance to the spending across the rest of the defense business.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","I appreciate the color. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Howard.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Rob.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","In Missiles, you noted you had a very strong quarter for revenues but you didn't raise the revenue guidance for the full year. Does that suggest this is a relatively short-term demand and you don't expect it to be sustained through the full year?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I think we \u2013 on my discussions I did talk about the fact that we believe that this volume is sustainable through this year and into next, so we feel fairly solid about the 2016 and 2017 in terms of growth, and Toby'll take you into some of the details.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, I think Rob \u2013 some of what you saw in the first quarter at Missiles was timing within the year, not just for Missiles, but for the total company. As I mentioned, we do have a ramp through the year, especially into the back half. So we still see Missiles, to your point in the high single digits from a growth point of view with the cadence improving through the second half of the year as we ramp up on some of our recent international production and development programs. So we feel we still have it pegged with the current guidance, and really, Q1 was more timing than anything else.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And Rob, one thing we're seeing is a little different this year at Missiles is we're seeing the demand across the entire portfolio of Missiles, all of our franchises, the Paveways, the TOWs, AMRAAMs, the 89Xs the CRAMs, the Griffins, and even a resurgence on our Gen T missiles for Patriot. So it's not like it's in one area. It's across the whole portfolio.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then maybe a second one. On Forcepoint, I wondering if you could give us an idea of how the older legacy firewall business did in the quarter relative to the more modern products in that division? Thank you.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So the legacy filtering business from the legacy Websense was down in the quarter by about a third. Okay? That said, excluding the acquisition of Stonesoft that we had in the first quarter \u2013 even taking that into account Forcepoint sales on a normalized basis did grow 9%, so the TRITON product and the Federal business that came over from RCP more than offset the decrease in the legacy web filtering business.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Hi, Sam.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess, Toby, can you talk as to whether the \u2013 since the margins are unchanged, especially IDS and MS, were these charges anticipated when you provided the guidance, or is it something that I guess when you're unwinding this joint venture now it looks like that amount at least is higher than the $90 million it was in the 10-K, so did that change? I'm just trying to think about what the offset to these unfavorable changes are.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah. No, that's a fair question Sam. So no, we did not consider these in the guidance that we gave; either the one at IDS or the one at Missiles. Now just remember the $90 million in the K that you're referring to would be the cost to us to exit the venture, not necessarily the P&L impact but the cash impact. But as far as how we expect to see things improving or recovering this, we do expect to see margins get better or expand in Q2 and beyond that into the second half of 2016. And as I mentioned before, even looking out into 2017, we still see opportunity for margin expansion. And again, as a reminder, that's excluding the $125 million to $150 million impact from the business venture exit in 2016.","That said, if you think about Q2 for a minute, we do expect it to be in line with Q1 when you adjust Q1 for the impact of the two programs that I talked about, that I mentioned had about a 100 basis point impact. If you look over the last couple years, from a total company point of view, we typically see our higher margins in the back half and even more towards Q4. We still see it playing out the same this year, and it was set up that way in the initial guidance we gave even before these charges. We also have the gain in Q3 from the venture exit that we talked about, and then we do expect the improved performance in Q4 as we ramp up on some of our production programs, both through the retirement of risk and benefit from the combination of strong volume and driving efficiencies.","So there is a ramp, Sam. The increase in the gain on the venture accounts for part of the way that this is offset, combined with generally speaking, driving more efficiencies through the business in the back half of the year. And again, other than those adjustments in the first quarter, not much has really changed relative to the cadence as to how we see things ramping up through the year.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about the Mid East, just in terms of the pace of activity? I know you don't have any big binary orders, other than the Qatar, but are customers making decisions at the pace you expect them? Or are you seeing the timing of them stretch out?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think number one is, as you know, we've been in the Middle East a long time. And I just mentioned on earlier the 50-year celebration in Saudi. So we've been working a lot of these projects for many years already, so there's several that are coming to fruition. You mentioned one, which is the early warning radaring in Qatar. And we also have other activities that we're seeing, I want to say strength in, and that is the area of C5ISR across the region. And one of the big areas is integrating all of these missile defense capabilities that a nation has and tying them together and providing a common operating picture for those, tying that together with an interoperating center and then providing an overall joint operating center for the entire country. So we're seeing a demand signal for that kind of capability across the region. And then outside of the radar I mentioned, there's just a replenishment of \u2013 essentially of effectors that have been either used or are now kind of off the shelf, the expiration dates that they need to replenish. And that's just happening, so we're not seeing anything that's slipping to the right in those elements in the Middle East right now.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, and good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning Seth.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I wanted to ask another question about Missiles, and for, let's say, for the four years ended 2015, and this was fairly consistently a $6.5 billion business. Now we're going to $7 billion and then maybe a bit higher than that, and I heard what you said about the sustainability of demand through 2017 and also the fact that OPTEMPO is a factor, is a driver of the growth that we're seeing. So just when you think \u2013 I don't know if it's possible, but when you think about what's driven the growth in 2016 and maybe some additional growth in 2017, if you could sort of in maybe a couple of large buckets quantify what the drivers are in terms how much is OPTEMPO versus how much is anti-ship versus any other categories?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think there's really three \u2013 I'll hit it in three kind of big buckets. One is \u2013 you're obviously correct, is the OPTEMPO. I would say the other one is just the \u2013 actually call it the Third Offset Strategy type efforts that we're seeing in terms of enhancing missile capabilities. And I think I already talked about \u2013 I did talk about the SM-6 and the Tomahawk and adding in the anti-ship capabilities. And we're also seeing on the \u2013 essentially in the missile defense area, our whole SM-3 product line and the enhancements there relative to missile defense. And if you marry those to what you're seeing out in the world today, relative to the tempo efforts that are going on in the Middle East, the stuff from North Korea relative to the missile defense required for that, it ties in. And then the overall Third Offset Strategy bringing in the improvements in our Missiles across the board, including looking at hypersonics. I think those three things are driving it. So as I mentioned before, we're not seeing just one of the franchises, or a couple of the programs increasing in volume and increasing demand, it's across the whole portfolio. I think that's what's different.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. And if you \u2013 would you say that in those three buckets, are they roughly equal contributors to the overall growth of the business over the 2016, 2017 timeframe? Or is it much more weighted toward one or the other?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say, and I don't have the details in front of me, but the tempo is driving up at a faster rate than the other two. But the other two, the rates on those are increasing over prior years. How's that?","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Very good. Very good. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays. Please proceed.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Carter.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I wanted to ask quickly about Forcepoint and the leadership change there and just if that signals anything about the company's direction or strategy or opportunities, challenges. I know that clearly the growth was pretty impressive on the ex-Stonesoft and ex-the legacy filtering stuff. So just wondered if you could speak to that and what you're seeing and what it means in terms of the change there?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, Carter, I'll just give you a quick, from a financial perspective, and then let Tom weigh in on it from a balance of the question there. But we didn't change the outlook for the year. So things are on track financially, both from a growth and a margin point of view. And we've been talking beyond this year that we would expect to see beyond the high single-digit growth rate this year, moving into the teens with some margin expansion. So all that still remains on track, and Tom can add to that as well.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So let me step back because we're going on one year since we acquired the Websense company and then integrated it in with our Raytheon Cyber Products group. And then with the recent acquisition of Stonesoft created a, I would call it a commercial cyber security products company that has about a $600 million revenue, which puts it right up there in terms of the largest cyber security commercial software companies in the world. And what we're seeing is the demand for those products across, essentially across each one of their major areas, the TRITON product, the Stonesoft next-generation firewalls, and the SureView product line that came out of RCP. And we're really looking at how do we go to the next level relative to the growth of that business. And one of the areas that we see as a big opportunity is in the large enterprises. The Websense company came across as a very strong, solid foundation in the SME area, small to medium-sized enterprises, with some large enterprises. But we see significant opportunity in expanding into the large enterprise area.","And Matt Moynahan has significant experience in that area, his work all the way back in Symantec, Veracode and also at Arbor Networks. And so we needed to bring in a leader with that kind of experience to go drive the expansion and the market segmentation into those two groups. That's really the \u2013 he's the right guy to now come in and then take the steed. (44:19) J-Mac, John McCormack did an excellent job for us in the integration and making sure that we had a solid foundation, but we believe now it's time to bring in somebody who can take us into the next markets, especially in the large enterprises.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then just two quick follow-ups for Toby. One, on the adjustment in IDS, have you assumed any recovery whatsoever, a partial recovery of those costs? Or would that all be a reversal on upside? And then if you could remind us what the pension funding requirement stands at for 2017 and 2018?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Sure. On the IDS question, we've not assumed any additional recovery in our outlook beyond the charge we took, but as I mentioned and Tom mentioned, we are going to work to pursue that from our subcontractors going forward.","On the pension requirement, next year \u2013 this year we're looking at about $165 million. Next year it's about $933 million, and as a reminder, that increase is due to the fact that the plan comes out of full funding from a PPA point of view. We now have to fund the annual service cost and obviously, given the market performance last year, we would be needing to recover and fund the \u2013 or amortize over a few years the shortfall that we had. When you look out beyond, in 2017 and beyond, I think the best way to think of it is from a net cash perspective, a net funding perspective. While it's not as much as this year, right, which is around a positive $1.3 billion, think of it as about $700 million based upon current assumptions per year in 2017 and beyond as a run rate going forward.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So it kind of flattens out from that 2017 level?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah. 2016 is a little bit of an anomaly given how CAF harmonization kicks in. We're still in full funding from a PPA point of view. So we have the spike up to the $1.3 billion. Last year, as a reminder, we were about $800 million, but the $700 million plus or minus would \u2013 based upon our current assumptions, would be a run rate.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you very much.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","So, you guys mentioned the term evolving priorities of your international customers in your prepared remarks and presumably, and you touched on this a little bit earlier, but presumably you're talking about the dynamics of an evolving battlefield. But is it also a comment embedded in there on an increasing focus on price or value for the money that they're spending as their needs evolve?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well I think there's always a concern on their part that they're getting value for their money. And I think that's one of the areas is does the system work. Can they operate the system? And I think my last trip in, seeing the fact that they are operating the systems that we provide and that they are seeing success is ensuring them at least the value that they're getting from our solution set that we offer. So I didn't see any issues relative to any of my visits in country, relative to any concerns in terms of value for what they're getting from us. Because they're getting the results.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Yep. And then you guys mentioned long-range strike as a funding priority, so I'll just bring it up. Is there any color you guys can provide us on your potential role on B-21 either whether it's radar or something else. I think a lot of people assumed you were part of the Boeing Lockheed team. Do you see yourselves possessing a role on that program going forward? Really anything you would be willing to provide on that would be great. Thanks for the time.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, unfortunately, we can't talk about it. So...","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Okay. Thought I'd ask. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Safran from Buckingham Research. Please proceed.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning, Rich.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Tom, I wanted to ask you a question. You had a release about an ATACMS replacement that you're offering a new missile design, long-range for a precision fire. So I had a bit of a multi-part question on that. So you've been talking about the demand for your current missile products. What's the interest level at the Pentagon right now for a new missile program? Has the Army decided to move ahead with a new missile program rather than just extend ATACMS? And I was wondering if you could give us any sense about the size and timing of the program, about any opportunity?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well it's definitely at its infancy right now. We are working with the Army, also with some of our competitors, to help them define what this program is moving forward. Obviously we feel that a new missile can provide the best capability with the best cost and being able to integrate as much of the new technology that's out there as possible. So that's really our position moving forward on it. It's at its infancy. And as we get more information relative to the Army, we'll be glad to share that with you over time.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then also on another program you were talking about, the next-generation Jammer and the $1 billion dollar award and the 15 engineering development pods. Could you discuss a little bit about how that contract will play out, period of performance there for the $1 billion reward? And if the Navy moves to the next phase, how big of an award could that be?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well again, this is \u2013 this award is to go complete the engineering, manufacturing and development phase of the program. And so the assets or the pods, 15 pods that are going to be developed are essentially EEMS assets, (50:23) assets that'll be used for qualification in terms of flight tests and also environmental tests that will be done on the pods to ensure that they meet the overall requirement needs of the United States Navy. So that's what that program is. Following that program, there'll be a transition to production, LRIP and then a full-on \u2013 you asked about a period of performance. It's approximately four years for that $1 billion-dollar program.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much for that. Appreciate it.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Strauss of UBS. Please proceed.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning, David.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Just a quick housekeeping. Toby, on the IDS gain that you're expecting, is that \u2013 I think you said $125 million to $150 million before. I think you were talking about $100 million to $125 million. Is that correct?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","That's correct.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Going back to margins, obviously, moving around a fair amount at this point. I guess maybe Tom or Toby, could you maybe talk about what \u2013 by business, what you kind of see as a normalized margin level? I know margins are supposed to pick up in the back half of the year and into 2017. But you've got IDS looking like it's running below normal, SAS below, but Missiles may be a little bit above. So any color you could give around kind of what we should expect for normalized margins by business? Thanks.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","So I \u2013 David, I think that's a little tough to do, to really define normalized given the mix of development and production programs and the timing of completions and starts move around and it's not consistent business-by-business. What I can maybe give you a little bit of color on, I'll just go real quick by the businesses is maybe give you an indication on how we see things playing out through the balance of this year, right. So we talked about IDS and what happened in the quarter with the $36 million impact. But we do see the margin improving through the year, partly driven by improvement in business mix as some of our larger international programs move through the production cycle. And then you mentioned it a minute ago, we do have in the second half, in the third quarter, the gain from the exit of the venture, which is $125 million to $150 million, and that's about 210 to 250 basis points at the IDS level.","For IIS we're expecting total year 7.4 to 7.6 (53:16). That would be roughly in line with 2015 after adjusting for the Q1 eBorders. What we see happening, compared to Q1 there, is improved mix moving going forward within IIS. Some improved productivity as we move through the year, and also some improvement coming from expected award fees for IIS. From a Missiles point of view, we talked about the impact in the first quarter with the $22 million adjustment, but if we look forward for the balance of the year, we still see Missiles getting to the 13% to 13.2% range with margins starting to improve or expand in Q2 and in the second half of the year. Really driven by mix and the timing and the ramp up of programs and some expected efficiencies that we would see at Missiles.","At SAS, they were down year over year in Q1 as we expected really, driven by some mix, but they were a little bit ahead of our expectations for the quarter. And then, when we think about SAS moving forward, again we're still in the 12.9% to 13.1% range and we do expect the margin to improve throughout the year driven by more favorable mix and therefore the timing of some program improvements.","At Forcepoint, real quick, margin improved in the quarter because of the addition of Websense the acquisition last year. It's still on track for the total year of 11.5% to 12.5% range. Really with a little bit more of a ramp or expansion in the second half of the year driven by two things, the completion of integration activities related to the Stonesoft acquisition and also as the sales ramp up in the back half of the year. So overall, we do see the cadence improving in Q2 as well as the second half, primarily as we progress through program lifecycles on some of our more recent awards and due to the timing of expected program improvements as well.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for the color.","Todd Ernst - Vice President-Investor Relations","Sure. And Mark, we have time for one more call or one more question.","Operator","Your last question comes from Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. I wanted to ask on SAS, it does look like the backlog trends there are turning around pretty good after a few years of in decline. The 1Q is good and then the Jammer drops through. I'm not sure of the duration of the ones you booked in the quarter and then obviously the Jammer is a bit of a longer duration, but is SAS going vie for \u2013 start to vie for growing at or above company trends in 2017 and 2018 given the book of business you're getting?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean so the \u2013 you're absolutely correct on the Jammer. That's about a four-year period of performance. The other big contract, the classified one, is another four-year period of performance. So I would say it's going to have sustainable growth definitely over the next two years, just based on the bookings that they've received here in the last quarter, and obviously last year in 2015.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And Toby, just a quick one. As you look at this tax rate impact for this year, is this something that would be recurring as you have the three-year vest? So now we're building into the model for 2017 and 2018, 100 basis points lower tax rates.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","So there's the potential for it to be recurring, Myles. We have our shares that vest, some of them vest in Q1, and some of them vest in Q2. And the determination as to whether there'd be an impact is driven by where the market price of the stock is on the date they vest compared to the price at issuance, the strike price at issuance. So there could be volatility, but it could be negative volatility as well if our stock price were to go down. So we're going to have to assess that on an annual basis based upon the market and what's happening out there. So I wouldn't necessarily jump to the conclusion that the 100 basis point adjustment is the right thing. It will be really something that we'll have to look at on a year to year basis.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks so much.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Sure.","Todd Ernst - Vice President-Investor Relations","Okay. Thank you for joining us this morning.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kelsey DeBriyn, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Kelsey Ann DeBriyn - Raytheon Co.","Thank you, Joyce. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our first quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com.","Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website. With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Thank you, Kelsey. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to take a minute before getting into the details of the first quarter to welcome Kelsey DeBriyn, our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Some of you may already know Kelsey from her time in the investment community. She joined the company in October and we're pleased to have her on the Raytheon team. Welcome, Kelsey.","Now turning to our results, Raytheon is off to a strong start in 2018 as we've continued to build on our growth momentum from last year. In the first quarter, sales increased 4.5% and our sales, EPS, and operating cash flow were all better than expected. Bookings were solid and our backlog was up over $2 billion year-over-year. Overall, our growth strategy continues to be well-aligned with the needs of our global customers and we are increasing our sales and EPS guidance for the year.","Toby will take you through the quarter's financials in a few minutes. You can see the strong global demand for our integrated air and missile defense systems in our recent progress on international opportunities. At the end of March, Poland signed LOA for Phase 1 with the U.S. government to purchase our combat-proven Patriot air and missile defense system. This paves the way for the U.S. government to begin contract negotiations with Raytheon.","We still expect booking for Phase 1 in 2019 and Phase 2 in 2020, making Poland a partner that depends on Patriot to protect its citizens and armed forces. The Phase 1 opportunity for Raytheon is expected to be over $1 billion with the total Raytheon Poland Patriot opportunity to be around $5 billion.","And we continue to make progress on an opportunity to provide Qatar additional integrated air and missile defense capabilities. Last week, after the quarter, we signed an MoU with Qatar for a NASAMS system and we expect to receive a booking later this year. Total Raytheon opportunity is expected to be over $2 billion and have direct commercial and foreign military sales components.","In the first quarter, we also booked over $550 million on our air-to-air missile, AMRAAM, for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and international customers. AMRAAM is one of our many franchise missile programs. And within the last six months, we have booked over $1.2 billion in orders for AMRAAM. We expect demand to continue for this advanced capability.","In the first quarter, we saw our classified bookings up 18.5%, driven by both domestic and international orders. And our customer-funded research and development or CRAD bookings were up 38% in the quarter. This is important because CRAD, along with our internal research and development or IRAD, funds technology development that is integral to the long-term growth of our new franchises and production awards.","Beyond CRAD, we continue to prioritize investing in ourselves to support our long-term growth through CapEx and IRAD. Given our increased spending on both of these in 2018, I thought it would be helpful to take a few minutes to talk about our investments in these areas. In 2018, Raytheon's capital investment is expected to be up more than 50% versus 2017 to support our future growth and productivity initiatives.","One area of investment is for demonstration capabilities to position us to win new future franchises and opportunities. A second area of investment is for high technology facilities. For example, to support growth in new classified programs at missiles, we are expanding operations by adding new facilities for people and testing. A final area of investment is for more automation and test equipment to drive efficiencies at our businesses.","In 2018, our IRAD is expected to be up 15% versus 2017 as we refresh current franchises and develop new capabilities to ensure that we are well-positioned to win new opportunities. We are prioritizing our investments in areas that are key priorities for our customers such as high energy lasers, high power microwaves, hypersonics, next-generation sensors, and cybersecurity, among others. Drawing on our decades of technology innovation, Raytheon continues to invest in high energy lasers and high power microwaves to develop the most advanced solutions for our customers.","In March, during a U.S. Army exercise, 45 unmanned aerial vehicles and drones were engaged and destroyed by Raytheon's advanced high-power microwave and laser. Our solution provides a short-range air defense capability with a low cost per engagement that is much needed by our customer. Another technology we are investing in is hypersonics which is a primary focus area for our customer to address pure threats. Hypersonic systems travel beyond Mach 5 making them harder to hit and this is the next wave of technology relative to advanced missile systems.","As a result, we are executing several activities in the areas of hypersonics and counter-hypersonics and we're positioning ourselves to fully capture this growing opportunity. We also continue to invest in next-generation sensor technologies. Over the last few years, we have seen a number of radar wins from our past investments in GaN such as the Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar for the U.S. Air Force and the Air and Missile Defense Radar for the U.S. Navy.","Both of these represent multibillion dollar franchise opportunities for Raytheon. We're also helping the U.S. Army develop third-generation electro-optical capabilities for combat vehicles. With this technology, soldiers will be able to identify targets with much greater clarity and engage at significantly longer ranges. The investments we are making in our cybersecurity capabilities helped us in last year's DOMino win, one of the largest single cybersecurity contracts.","Through this program, Raytheon is working with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to provide cybersecurity for over 100 agencies within the .gov domain. The DOMino win establishes our credibility as the leading cybersecurity company to provide nation-scale technologies in a global market. As you may have seen, we are in the early stages of working with Saudi Aramco and others to provide cybersecurity services and to cyber secure infrastructure throughout the Middle East region.","Beyond these technologies, we also continue to invest in several other areas, which include machine learning, undersea capabilities, electronic warfare, space, and C5ISR. Our investments are completely aligned with the priorities identified in the National Defense Strategy which is important given that the new Defense Strategy is already driving the allocation of resources within the Defense Department.","The National Defense Strategy seeks to build a more lethal force, strengthen alliances, and reform DoD for greater performance and affordability. As a company, we are committed to helping the Defense Department implement the National Defense Strategy, so that U.S. forces and allies can secure a competitive military advantage. We will do everything we can to help the DoD in its pursuit of urgent change at significant scale.","Turning to the U.S. defense budget, we're very encouraged by defense spending growth and pleased as we continue to see bipartisan support for higher spending levels. In March, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 significantly amended upward the BCA caps in fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019 to accommodate the defense budget. And this smooths the path to the fiscal year 2019 appropriations bill.","Now only two years remain, fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2021, until the effects of the BCA on defense are over. We are confident these caps will again be revised upward. And at the end of March, we were pleased to see Congress pass the fiscal year 2018 defense appropriations bill which included a double-digit increase in modernization funding versus the fiscal year 2017 level. We continue to see Congressional support in areas where Raytheon has strong core capabilities. And starting in 2019, we expect to see meaningful impact from the budget increase.","I'd like to close today by recognizing the Raytheon team for all of their hard work and dedication. Together, we successfully navigated a sustained period of budget headwinds in a manner that increased our competitive posture, differentiated our solutions and enabled customer success. Now, with a prospect of budget tailwinds, we stand ready to secure opportunities for future growth by leveraging investments we've made in the company and deploying new transformational technologies. With the team's continued focus and commitment, we plan to take our success and that of our customers to new levels.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Toby.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the first quarter highlights and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.","If everyone would turn to page 3. We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the first quarter with sales, EPS and operating cash flow better than our expectations. As a result, we're raising our full year outlook for sales and EPS which I'll discuss further in a few minutes. Our sales in the quarter were $6.3 billion, up 4.5%, led by our IDS, IIS and missiles business.","Our EPS from continuing operations was $2.20, better than our guidance, and an increase of 27.2% year-over-year. I'll give a little more color on this in just a moment. We generated solid operating cash flow of $283 million in the first quarter. Operating cash flow was higher than last year's first quarter, primarily due to favorable collections and lower net cash taxes.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $400 million. I would add that last month we announced an 8.8% increase in our dividend. This marks the 14th consecutive year of increasing dividends at Raytheon.","Turning now to page 4, let me start by providing some detail on our first quarter results. Company bookings for the first quarter were $6.3 billion, which were 11% higher than the same period last year. And on a trailing four-quarter basis, our total book-to-bill ratio was 1.11. International awards represented 45% of the total bookings, an increase of approximately 50% over last year's first quarter, primarily due to the $1.6 billion Patriot booking that we previously discussed in January. Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $38.1 billion, an increase of over $2 billion or 5.8% compared to the first quarter 2017. It's worth noting that approximately 42% of our backlog is comprised of international programs.","If you now move to page 5, for the first quarter 2018, sales were higher than the high end of the guidance we set in January. Sales were especially strong in IDS. We expect sales for the company to increase throughout the year with the strong second half, driven by our bookings over the past several quarters.","Looking now at sales by business. IDS had first quarter net sales of $1.5 billion, up 6.5% compared with the same period last year. The increase from Q1 2017 was primarily driven by higher sales on an international Patriot program that was awarded in the first quarter of 2018. In the first quarter, IIS had net sales of $1.6 billion. Compared with the same quarter last year, the 5% increase was primarily due to higher net sales on classified and training programs.","As we've previously discussed, we expect IIS's growth rate to moderate in the back half of the year due to the planned ramp down and transition of the Warfighter FOCUS program. Missile Systems had net sales of $1.8 billion, up 5% compared with the same period last year. The increase here was also driven by higher net sales on classified programs.","We expect the growth rate to be stronger for the balance of the year, starting in the second quarter. SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2018, up slightly compared to last year's first quarter. And at Forcepoint, sales were down slightly in the quarter compared with last year's first quarter. Overall, we're pleased with our total company sales which grew 4.5% in the quarter.","Moving ahead to page 6. First, as a reminder, in the first quarter of 2018, we adopted the new retirement benefit standard. As a result, all components of FAS pension and postretirement benefit expense, other than service costs, were reclassified from operating income to non-operating income with no impact to net income. The 2017 total company operating margins have been recast to reflect this change.","Now let me spend a few minutes talking about our margins in the quarter. We delivered solid margin performance. Our operating margin was 16.6% for the total company, up 80 basis points, and 11.9% on a business segment basis, an increase of 10 basis points. The margin improvement on a segment basis in the first quarter was driven by IDS which benefited from the timing of productivity improvements that were expected later in the year as well as favorable mix versus Q1 2017.","Missiles margins were down in the first quarter, as expected, due to a change in program mix. We continue to see improvement in their margin in the back half of the year and for 2018 still expect their margin to be in the 13.1% to 13.3% range. And at Forcepoint, as we discussed on the January call, operating income was negative for the quarter. This is due to an increase in operating cost to support Forcepoint's long-term growth.","From a total company point of view, we remain focused on margin improvement going forward and see our business segment margins in the 12.5% to 12.7% range for the full year, consistent with the guidance we laid out in January. We see our margin improving in the back half of the year, driven by favorable program mix and productivity improvements.","Turning now to page 7, first quarter 2018 EPF of $2.20 was up 27.2% from last year's first quarter and was better than our expectations. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by higher volume, margin expansion and lower taxes. On page 8, as I mentioned earlier, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2018 to reflect our improved performance today as well as the further refinement of our estimated tax rate under current tax law.","We're increasing our full year 2018 net sales range by $100 million which favorably impacts EPS by about $0.05. This increase is driven by higher expected sales at our IDS business. We now expect total company net sales to be in the range of between $26.5 billion and $27 billion, an increase of 4.5% to 6.5% from 2017. We updated our effective tax rate to reflect revised estimates related to the new tax law and various other items which in total is worth about $0.10 to EPS for the full year.","We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Looking at our EPS guidance, we exceeded the high end of our guidance in the first quarter by $0.19. For the year, due to the first quarter operating performance, as well as the lower tax rate, we are raising our guidance by $0.15. As a result, we now expect our full year EPS to be in a range of $9.70 to $9.90.","As I discussed earlier, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $400 million in the quarter and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 287 million and 289 million shares for 2018, driven by the continuation of our share repurchase program. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was slightly higher than our prior expectations, primarily due to the timing of collections that we had originally expected in the second quarter.","We continue to see our full year 2018 operating cash flow outlook to be between $3.6 billion and $4 billion. And although not on the page, it is worth noting that we continue to see our full year 2018 bookings outlook to be between $27.5 billion and $28.5 billion.","Turning now to page 9, as you can see, we've included guidance by business which reflects the higher net sales in IDS and for the total company that I mentioned earlier. On page 10, we provided you with our outlook for the second quarter of 2018. As we mentioned on our last call, excluding the impact of tax reform in the fourth quarter of 2017, we still expect the cadence for the balance of 2018 to play out similar to 2017.","We see sales, EPS and operating cash flow ramping up in the second half of the year. I want to point out that we expect second quarter sales to be in a range of approximately $6.4 billion to $6.5 billion and EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in a range of $2.23 to $2.28. We expect operating cash flow to be in a range of $350 million to $550 million.","Before concluding, I'd like to spend a minute on our capital deployment strategy. As we said on the call in January, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet that provides us with financial flexibility. We remain focused on deploying capital in ways that create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth, paying a sustainable and competitive dividend, reducing our share count, making targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs, and making discretionary contributions to the pension.","In summary, our performance in the first quarter provides a solid foundation for the balance of 2018. Our bookings were strong. Sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all higher than the guidance we set in January and we increased our full year 2018 outlook for sales and EPS. We remain well-positioned for continued growth.","With that, Tom and I will now open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question will come from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please proceed.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Carter. Thank you.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Carter. Thanks.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Tom, I wondered if you could give us an update a little bit on hypersonics. I know you mentioned it in your prepared remarks but clearly this is getting a lot more emphasis inside the building. And I noted one of your competitors got a big award last week and just wondered if you could just give us an update on the handful of initiatives or programs you've got there and what the opportunity is and how that's unfolding. Just an update would be really helpful. Thanks.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. Thank you, Carter. As we discussed in the past and as I talked about a little bit in my script today, hypersonics is an area that we continue to invest in for future growth. Now we are working multiple hypersonic programs today both \u2013 I would call them CRAD type contracts. Hypersonic area right now is really focused on demonstrating advanced technologies that will then be used to go into engineering, manufacturing and development programs in the future. And I can tell you we're heavily involved in many of these type of programs all the way from the hypersonic air-breathing weapons type concept which is with the DARPA program and also in several other areas, including some ground-based hypersonic systems.","The other area of the hypersonic equation is the counter hypersonics which is also a big area and we are involved with that with several of our existing systems, improvements to those, but also in some new advanced counter hypersonic missiles. So bottom line is we continue to make solid progress in our hypersonic pursuits and we will continue to invest in that technology and invest to continue to put assets in place to support the contracts we have in those areas.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Rob.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I just wanted to get a clarification from Toby. And then I had a question on IDS margins. Toby, just curious why the cash flow guidance didn't rise at all here with the fundamental improvement in sales, et cetera. We've seen this trend all week from some of your peers. Just wondering if there's something at play there. And then on the IDS margins, for the back end of the year, what are the headwinds that we see there? Why didn't this translate \u2013 this strength in the first quarter translate into slightly higher guide on those margins?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Sure. So I'll start with your first question on cash flow. And I'll point to maybe two or three things here to maybe help folks understand, right. So we're pleased with the performance in the quarter, right, about $83 million above the high end of our guidance. We had some favorable timing of collections moving from Q2 to Q1. Keep in mind this performance in the first quarter is on top of our record-setting cash flow performance in 2017 where in Q4 we beat our expectations by about $800 million.","And then coming off of that, we set guidance this year. Last year we were \u2013 prior to our discretionary pension, our cash flow was a little over $3.7 billion and the range we set this year was $3.6 billion to $4 billion, right. So we didn't drop it down, if you will, for the $800 million improvement we saw late last year.","And then the other thing I'll just bring back here. In January on our fourth quarter call, we showed a three-year look at cash flow that rough numbers was about $2 billion better than our previous expectations. And we're still on track for that. So, overall, the cash flow remains very strong. As I mentioned earlier, it's a little more biased, as we've seen in the past, towards the back half of the year.","And then the last point I'll make. If you look at the sales improvement, the flow-through of the margin on that and the change in the tax rate, all else equal, that's plus or minus $40 million and we have a pretty significant range of $3.6 billion to $4 billion. So the other way to think of it is it's considered in that range already. But I would tell you the takeaway here. Cash flow remains a key focus and we're really pleased with our Q1 performance and the outlook for the year.","Shifting to IDS and IDS's margins, obviously, they had a real strong quarter and a great start to the year. Rob, to your point, they were at 18.3% which quite frankly was about 200 basis points higher than our expectations. What we saw in Q1 was some favorable timing of program improvements. And I think, as everybody knows, we've discussed in the past, programs retire risk. We take the benefit in the quarter when that occurs and there is the retroactive adjustments. And IDS did retire risks on a couple of programs earlier than expected, increasing the Q1 margin and reducing the expected margin for the balance of the year compared to what we were looking at back in January.","We do still see IDS margins, to your point, of 16.4% to 16.6% on $100 million in higher volume as we showed in the updated guidance. And because of that, the IDS margins for the balance of the year will probably be in the range of around 16%, give or take. So 18.3% is a pretty strong quarter across the industry, never mind within the company. We're pleased with it and we're pleased with the outlook for the year at IDS.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Seth.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Tom, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about sort of the longer-term outlook and the big plus-up in the budget that we got, especially for the investment account, should be fueling very healthy outlay growth for the next three years or so. And so probably coming into the year, you guys grew about 5% in 2017. You're forecasting 5% to 6% this year. When we put the domestic together with the international, can we think about acceleration in the out-years?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Let me take your first question first. Bottom line is the fiscal year 2018 appropriations bill did get several plus ups to many of our programs. I'll give you some examples. Patriot program had a plus-up of $40 million. The SM-3 IB program had a plus-up of $108 million. SM-3 Block IIA was about $111 million. The Javelin was up $142 million, Excalibur $150 million. I can go on and on, but significant plus-ups across many of our programs out of that appropriations bill. We expect to see some of those bookings in 2018 and we expect to see the impact of sales in 2019 and beyond. So some very good clear projections out in terms of transparency into our ability to grow in 2019 and beyond, just based on what we're seeing in plus ups on the FY 2018 appropriations bill.","So the other one is this overall modernization surge and where it's going. And I think the bottom line is we can see continued uptick in the defense budget. The fight-up associated with the fiscal year 2018 budget shows growth beyond 2018, obviously, into 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022. So we're seeing some clear demand signals from the customer. I think the biggest area that we're seeing the uptick in, because \u2013 and it's actually called out in the National Defense Strategy and the Department is putting money behind the National Defense Strategy, is in the area of coming up with new technologies to be able to counter what they're calling the peer threat.","The fact that we've been in 17 years head down fighting wars of counterinsurgency and had not really been pushing new advanced technology areas. So we're \u2013 for example, our classified bookings were 16% of our total Q1 2018 bookings and that was up 18% from Q1 2017 and our classified sales were 19% of our Q1 2018 sales, and that was up 9.6% from Q1 2017. So we're getting strong signals from the Department that this is an important area. We are fully behind it. I talked about it in my script relative to the investments we're making. We're seeing these growth activities across all of those technology areas. We're in the right place at the right time. So bottom line is we have a good projection and transparency here over the next several years for growth.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Hi, Doug.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I wanted to turn to IIS. This is a business that's had \u2013 I mean, it's had virtually no growth for the last three years. And if we take the midpoint of your guidance for 2018, it's still the case in 2018. And I understand the Warfighter FOCUS Program decline, that's an important part. But the Q1 backlog \u2013 it's about where it was in each of the last two years for Q1. So given that this is a short cycle business, I would think it can turn very quickly, and we're certainly seeing interest in the space, such as the GD CSRA deal. So my question is, are we in a turning point where we should expect to see growth in IIS at a rate comparable to the budget growth rate, or should we expect the mix here to just be a slower growth business? How do you look at this over the next few years?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Doug, let me start and then if Tom has anything to add, he can jump in and maybe address your question in a couple points because you raised a few things that are \u2013 you are spot on, and I'll elaborate a little bit. So you mentioned IIS generally a book in turn type of business and reference where their backlog is.","So one thing that I'll point out here is towards the middle of last year we started to see some shifts \u2013 I think they're somewhat temporary, but we have seen some shifts in the mix of programs at IIS moving away from that quick turn work that you referred to, and in a couple cases, to some longer duration programs that were rather large, especially for IIS. So, the backlog has grown, but with a little bit of a higher percentage of that towards the longer duration mix and that is affecting the conversion cycle here in the near-term in 2018.","Your other point, you're right and we have talked about it with Warfighter FOCUS between the competitions and just the natural program plan where there was going to be a natural ramp down in that in the back half of this year. That, as we've said before, is a couple hundred to $0.25 billion impact in IIS revenue in the quarter. And excluding that, because of their efforts in other areas around classified, cyberspace, et cetera, excluding Warfighter, we would be seeing growth this year in the 3% to 5% range. So I think you are seeing some benefit from the focus on services that IDS has seen and it's being masked a bit by the Warfighter conversion as well as a mix change in their backlog.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yes. Doug, just to jump in on that. Two areas that we're seeing a strong pipeline for IIS in the coming year is one of them is ground-based space control really being driven by the issue relative to contested space. And the other area for a strong pipeline is government cybersecurity and then also including strong government international cybersecurity business. And we are seeing those two areas starting to pick up and assume that they will be seeing growth here in the out-years in those two big areas.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi. Please proceed.","Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Jon.","Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Can you talk us through a little bit just on the Missile Systems margin and IDS margin? I'm just trying to think about those in the context of \u2013 we know IDS went through some mix shifts a few years ago and we're now ramping up there. Can you describe a little bit more is MS in a similar spot right now where there is this opportunity to pick up on mix going forward from your \u2013 as implied by guidance, but also out into the future?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yes. So, if you have \u2013 and I understand the comparison to IDS. I think maybe a little bit of a follow on to Rob's question, I would point out that IDS \u2013 the margin profile there is playing out, I think, pretty much as we had expected or predicted over the last couple years, given the shift that you referred to when we talked about and again strong start for the year for IDS and real pleased with their outlook for the year as well.","What I would tell you on Missile's margins, I think, as I alluded to briefly, their Q1 margin lower than last year's Q1 but we were expecting that and the mix is what's driving it. We do expect this year that Missile's margins will grow sequentially, a bit more pronounced in the second half, aligned with some higher production volumes and the timing of expected program efficiencies related to risk reduction and risk retirement.","On the prior call, we had talked about higher CRAD in classified sales in 2018 impacting Missile's margins. And this is what we're really seeing early on in Q1. We've also talked about Missiles has, I think, within the company, from my perspective, the broadest and most balanced portfolio with programs at all end of the spectrum from early-stage CRAD-type of work into TMRR phases, into EMD low rate production, mature production, some international. And really, it's going to be the ebb and flow between those categories that drives it.","But, again, we expect improved margins this year. And keep in mind that this mix that in Q1 was a margin headwind because of the nature of it, the CRAD work, that's the type of programs that lead to future franchises, ties back to some of Tom's comments around hypersonics as example. So, overall, we're pleased with the Missile's portfolio and, again, would expect to see margins improving through the balance of the year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes, a couple of quick ones, Toby. I try and pin you down in IDS, so was there EAC benefit of $20 million to $30 million because of retirement of risk on some prior ending programs as you've alluded to?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","We did see some EAC benefits that we were expecting later in the year, George, right, where we did retire risk and that risk was retired in the first quarter versus beyond that. And, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, they had some favorable mix due to the international component of their business that also contributed to the margin performance in the quarter, so a combination of both.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.

Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Tom, can you update us on the status of the Navy over-the-horizon missile program. I think you guys were waiting to get an approved budget to maybe begin an award announcement there. So maybe just an update and maybe quantify it.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yes, just to make sure just to quantify for everyone who is listening. This is a program where, Raytheon and Kongsberg, as a team, we submitted a proposal for something what's called \u2013 we called The Naval Strike Missile, which is the Navy's over-the-horizon weapon system that they need to put on the LCS, but turns out they're also going to put them on all the Future Frigates. We think we're in a very good position there. We have a system that requires minimum development essentially to develop systems, some small changes we'll make, but can go into production very quickly, which is something the United States Navy needs. We are anticipating an award here in Q2 with significant more funds placed against it in the fiscal year 2019 budget to move forward with that program.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Sam.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the investments you said you were making. You talked about the IRAD growth of 15% this year, but it looks relatively flat this year. So I'm just wondering can you play off CRAD versus IRAD and shift it around as one growth and move it as that part of the timing as we go through the year. And related, the CapEx seemed relatively high in the quarter, just given that you usually have a back-end loaded CapEx. So I just want to make sure you're still on track for the same level of CapEx.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yes. Sam, let me give you kind of the top level here. The IRAD \u2013 and, obviously, we'll use the IRAD to give us the technologies to go capture the CRAD. We'll use the CRAD to go capture the development programs and we capture development programs, so we can have the production programs. So the IRAD is kind of the initial fuel for the engine to kind of get us going. And you're absolutely correct. Once we win the CRAD we'll redirect the IRAD to other opportunities, to be able to pick up more CRAD in other areas. And that's just the nature of the game that we play to win with.","The bottom line is, is we are focusing and we have been focusing on several years in what I would consider the key areas, especially that are being called out in the National Defense Strategy. And, again, what's key about that is that's where the Department is going to be focusing its money relative to next-generation capabilities. And I can tell you we are 100% aligned with those areas. We are again using the IRAD to give us the start to fuel in our engines to go capture CRAD and so forth up the line.","In area of the capital, we are up this year in capital. We did mention that in the discussions, up about 50%. Those areas \u2013 again, there are some demand signals based on new work at missile companies to be able to support that in terms of facilities and test equipment, which is going meaningful but also in other areas that support our overall growth. And I'll hand it over to Toby for some more details.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. So I'll address, Sam, I guess, the cadence of both the IR&D and the capital. So, on the IR&D, we haven't changed our outlook. We still expect roughly that 15% growth. You're right. The spend in Q1 was a little light from a linear point of view. But we do expect that to ramp up sequentially through the balance of the year.","Similarly, on the CapEx and software spend, still same outlook, $910 million to $950 million for the year. I think the CapEx was about $220 million, $221 million and another $10 million or $12 million in software in Q1, so 230-ish million. So not linear but think of it as equal for the balance of the year maybe with a little bit of a bias towards a little bit higher spending in the back half relative to the capital.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please proceed.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Hey, Rob.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Rob. How are you doing?","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good. Thanks. Tom, I guess, a question for you. The administration has been changing up the export rules. And I was wondering if there might be some benefit here for Raytheon, particularly as it seems to be shifting a little bit away from FMS towards more commercial sales and whether some of your products could benefit from that? Thank you.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Rob, thanks for that. By the way, any effort by the administration to improve this regulatory process relative to foreign sales on defense items is very welcome, obviously, by us and also by our industry. I can tell you it has been extremely helpful. This administration from day one has been very supportive of international weapon sales, which has helped us. And you can see our international has been up here over the last year, and a lot of it's driven by the support of the administration.","I think this is a next step by the administration to even press forward to support more weapon sales internationally. And one of the key areas here is not just to support sales for jobs to improve industry, but it's also being used by the Department of Defense to gain collaboration with different countries. So when they go and have to go to fight, they're able to be interoperable with these other countries.","So they want these other countries to be using \u2013 our coalition partners to be using U.S.-based weapon systems, so, again, that they can be interoperable and support. And the administration is behind that now. This is one way of doing it. They just reduced some of the fees they charge on FMS but are also leaning forward on direct commercial sales, which obviously is our preferred approach, especially relative to margin perspective.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Sheila. How are you doing?","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Good. Thank you. You mentioned contested space earlier. Maybe if you could discuss some of the larger pursuits and opportunities in space and some of the investments you're making in that arena.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","I'll cover that pretty lightly. And the reason is, once I get beyond the words contested space, things get classified pretty quickly. We are supporting in all elements of space relative to topic. I mentioned IIS heavily involved in the area of space control, especially in ground stations and ensuring our ability to have a resilient and reliable space control capability.","And then also, obviously, in space arena itself, our ability to have very good sensors that go on these satellites to help again support resiliency and also getting those sensors down to a size where we don't lose the performance, but we still have the capability, so that they can go on smaller satellites, small sats and also medium-sized satellites, so there's a lot of our work in that area. And that's about as far as I can go relative to the area of contested space.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.

And I imagine with the Army TADSS piece being protested, I guess you're not losing any of that out of 2018. But in the scenario where that goes against you, what happens to Warfighter from that in 2019? And then I guess any commentary on what you expect from the other two pieces.","And then a question on a different program going the other way. The EO DAS on F-35 win that you had, can you walk us through what happened, what transpired on that win and what the terms of trade are like with the customer there?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","So, Noah, this is Toby. I'll start with the Warfighter question. So I think you alluded to this, but within the current guidance for 2018 \u2013 and I think I mentioned this a little bit in the prepared remarks, right. We always assumed a decline in the Warfighter related activities because of the program plan and the transition in the second half to the new contract vehicles regardless of whether we were to win them or somebody else was. So to that point, the current situation on ATMP doesn't change the outlook for IIS for the year.","It is being broken, to your point, into separate contract vehicles, one of them, ATMP, being the first one in the queue. Over the longer-term, the ATMP effort only represents a part of the scope being performed under the Warfighter contract vehicle. And we do still feel good about our competitive position on the other pursuits, both of which, ETSC and HTSC, are going through the procurement process. And the current customer's outlook is for award midyear in June-ish timeframe.","As you said on ATMP, it's in protest. We feel we provided very competitively priced bid there. But at the same time, we weren't willing to make any type of significant investments ourselves to participate in that program. And I talked about this earlier, but I think it's important to reinforce it, advance of this, right. The IIS business has been working on growth in a number of other areas, including cyberspace as well as international, which we believe will allow them to continue to grow into the future regardless of the outcome of the Warfighter program.","And keep in mind Warfighter, right, it's been about a $10 billion, $11 billion program, call it, $1 billion a year. As we mentioned, we saw about a 25% ramp down in the plan for 2018. And these follow-on efforts in total are only about half the size of the current Warfighter program albeit over a little bit shorter period of performance, about seven years on average. So, anyway you look at it Warfighter was going to ramp down and that's why we've been working with the \u2013 the IIS business has been working to look to grow in other areas.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","And, Noah, then on your second question on F-35 EO DAS, unfortunately, I'm going to have to refer you to Lockheed for any discussions on that topic. I can tell you though that EO DAS is a product line that we have. It's a great product line, especially for the rotorcraft market as well as aircraft like the F-35. So it is a technology that we have been developing over the years and have multiple contracts in that area.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.

Please proceed.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Tom, Toby, Kelsey, good morning. How are you?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Richard. How are you doing?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good.","Kelsey Ann DeBriyn - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Very well, thanks. Okay. You know what I'm going to try again on asking about cash flow here, but a little bit of a different perspective here. Tom, in your remarks, you commented about a few programs being plused up, your munitions programs again focused on 2018. What I'd like to ask is more of a long-term trend here because for some time the Pentagon has been talking about a dire need for munitions restocking which goes right to the core of your business. And I would think that the recent op tempo, that might be getting some renewed focus.","So I thought maybe you could discuss a bit more about your longer-term acquisition transfer munitions programs, beyond just AMRAAM, (54:02), Sidewinder, TLAM, et cetera. And is this plus-up more part of a longer-term trend than just a plus up in 2018? And if we factor that in with the better-than-expected numbers in the FY 2019 appropriations, does this imply possibly upside to your $7 billion to $8 billion long-term cash guide for 2019 to 2020. Or at the very least, does it cause you to lean towards the high end of the range?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. So, Richard, it's a good question. So let me start with I would call the missiles or munitions tempo. And the missile has seen some significant growth here leading up to 2018. I did mention all the plus ups that are in the FY 2018 appropriations. Again, a lot of them relative to missiles, so you see the uptick there but from all the words from Secretary Mattis is that 2019 will just be a start relative to the readiness refreshment area relative to munitions. So 2019 will be the start. And now you can see we've been having significant uptick here in 2017, 2018, but he's calling 2019 as the start with the majority of the uptick occurring in 2020, so fiscal year 2020.","And then obviously our cycle on weapons and munitions is normally 18 months to two years, so that's going to take us 2019, 2020, 2021, again, providing a strong base of production and that the missile company there. And then, obviously, beyond that, the goal of the military is not to fall back into the problems they had before by not keeping themselves in a readiness state. So we see the missile business as being a very strong business relative to production. Toby just talked all about all of the CRAD, new activities we're getting, the fact that we've had to hire over 1,000 folks here in the last year or so, put buildings in place. There's a ton of work going on in the missile company and we see that as being a strong company here over the next five years. And then Toby will talk a little bit more about the cash...","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Sure.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Relative to cash.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. I think \u2013 and you mentioned it, Richard, right, we gave a three-year look, 2017 through 2019. And I think you just heard Tom say in his current remarks in a little bit earlier, everything is pointing directionally good news, more spending. The timing is really what's going to dictate \u2013 the timing of those awards coming in is going to dictate how it's going to affect our top and bottom line. So I am not saying no to your question about, is there more upside? It's just too early to tell depending upon the timing as the money works its way through the system here in 2018 and then as the appropriations are done on 2019 how that will affect us. So we'll provide an update, obviously, later in the year or going into 2019, a new look out going forward.","Kelsey Ann DeBriyn - Raytheon Co.","Joyce, we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.

Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Tom, just a quick one on just \u2013 congrats on the Small Diameter II progress you have made. Can you remind us just how to think about the production profile of that program? It seems like that's another nice growth opportunity for you.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Well, I mean, it is. And we just had some successful testing throughout 2017 (57:32), so we just completed the development testing and not it's running into operational testing. But we also have in addition our Small Diameter Bomb II Lot 1 production assets have been completed and they've been delivered. And our Lot 2 is on track to complete all its deliveries on schedule some time here in late \u2013 the summer of 2018. Bottom line is this is a great new capability and the one main reason is that they can do \u2013 it's not only precision munitions, but it can also attack moving targets. So it's a very unique capability.","It has something called a tri-mode seeker on it \u2013 technology, but that technology, tri-mode seeker, even though it's a very sophisticated technology, it's also at a very affordable price. And we see this Small Diameter Bomb as the future in terms of munitions. Number one, the reason for the small diameter aspect of it is you can fit multiple of them inside carriage, which is a requirement for stealth on an aircraft like the F-35. And so we see this as being a very attractive munition for the future and we already have a foreign military sales into Australia for the system, obviously, compatible on day one with the F-35.

I'd like to advise all parties, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. And now I'd like to hand over to Todd.","Todd Ernst - Raytheon Co.","Thanks, Steve. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our fourth quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning and the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website. With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby, and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives, and expected performance constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Thank you, Todd. Good morning everyone. We had another great year in 2016, as we continue to execute our growth strategy and delivered solid program performance.","Let me start by touching on some of our financial highlights. Our bookings were up over 10% year over year and reached a new company record of $27.8 billion. Our total backlog was up 6%, a key metric to consider as you think about our future growth. Sales increased 3.5% for the year driven by both domestic and international. I would also add that this is the company's best sales growth rate since 2009.","EPS exceeded our expectations for the quarter and the year, and cash flow was much better than we had expected. This allowed us to make a significant discretionary pension contribution in the fourth quarter, while retaining continued flexibility for our balanced capital deployment strategy. Toby will review additional details about the quarter and 2017 guidance in a few minutes.","In 2016, demand from our global customers was strong throughout the year. The main drivers continue to be the three key areas that we've mentioned on prior calls: number one, counterinsurgency, counterterrorism; number two, deterrence; and number three, the need for our customers to respond to increasingly sophisticated and rapidly evolving threats.","Our diversified and resilient portfolio of advanced solutions positions us well to help our global customers address threats in these areas. Further, we continue to invest in developing new and updating existing technologies to ensure we remain well aligned with the future requirements of our domestic and international customers.","As I mentioned, our bookings were up 10% during 2016. The key driver behind this was primarily growth within our domestic business. Domestic bookings were broad based and increased 18% over 2015 levels, which drove a domestic book-to-bill ratio of 1.19 for the year.","It's worth mentioning two key areas where we saw notable increases: classified and customer funded R&D, also known as CRAD. Our domestic classified bookings in 2016 increased 28% compared to 2015 and reached an all-time company record level. And for the year, domestic classified represented 17% of total company bookings. This was driven in a large part by the need of our domestic customers to address advanced threats.","And for CRAD, we saw a nearly 50% increase in bookings in 2016. This is important because CRAD, along with our internal research and development funds technology development that is integral to our long-term growth. To that end, I'd like to point out one of the more significant CRAD bookings we received last year.","In the fourth quarter, DARPA awarded us a $170 million contract for Phase 2 of the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept, also known as HAWC. This award is for the design, development and flight test of a Mach 5 plus capable system that is affordable and more survivable than existing systems in an increasingly complex threat environment. The HAWC opportunity is a great example of how we leverage our capabilities to compete for early stage development programs that position us well in long-term growth markets.","In our international business, bookings were $8.2 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.08 for the full year. At year end, international backlog was 41% of our total backlog. We continue to see demand signals from customers in the MENA, Asia-Pacific and European regions for a broad range of our capabilities, including missile defense solutions, precision munitions, and sensors.","For example, international bookings for our Patriot Integrated Air and Missile Defense solutions reached approximately $1 billion in the fourth quarter alone and approximately $2 billion for the year. This was driven by several of our customers either upgrading their existing capabilities or adding new capabilities to deter threats.","Beyond Patriot, we had bookings for precision munitions in missiles such as Paveway, AMRAAM, SM-3 and AIM-9X. And for sensors, bookings for both airborne ISR capabilities and tactical airborne AESA radars were strong in 2016.","Our 2016 sales growth of 3.5% was driven by a 2.6% increase in domestic and a 5.6% increase in international. I would also add that this was the 13th consecutive year of international sales growth and reflects the continued successful evolution and execution of our international strategy. For the full year, international reached just over 31% of our total revenue.","As we look to the future, we see a number of our key opportunities across the company in both domestic and international markets which should drive another year with a book-to-bill ratio above 1. Some key domestic opportunities include missile defense systems, training, Standard Missile, AMRAAM and TOW, as well as continued strong domestic classified. On the international front, Qatar signed an LOA for a $1 billion early warning radar system in December and we now expect a booking within the next couple of months at IDS.","Further, we see additional demand for a range of weapon systems, including AMRAAM, Paveway, and Phalanx, as well as additional opportunities for airborne sensors. We also see a potential booking for Poland Patriot as well as an additional Patriot opportunity for another customer in the European region either late this year or in early 2018.","Providing additional longer-term opportunities for our Missile Systems business, you may have seen the announcement earlier this month that the U.S. Department of Defense approved the release of the Standard Missile-6 to several international customers. The SM-6 is an attractive option for many of these customers as it provides over-the-horizon protection against fixed and rotary wing aircraft, UAVs, cruise missiles, as well as ballistic missiles in the terminal phase of flight.","Furthermore, last year the missile was also successfully tested for anti-ship capability, demonstrating multifunction capabilities of the missile. The growing domestic base supported by a hot production line and now the opportunity to expand internationally, SM-6 is a great example of one of our many franchise programs at the company.","Turning now to our 2017 outlook. We are expecting sales growth of 3% to 5% and solid margin performance. We remain focused on reducing our costs and improving efficiencies so we can provide our global customers with affordable solutions, while at the same time creating value for our shareholders.","Further, our cash flow outlook remains strong and this gives us flexibility to continue to support a balanced capital deployment strategy. Within this strategy, our number one priority remains investing in ourselves. Last year our internal investments in capital expenditures increased over 2015 levels in order to support our future growth and productivity initiatives across the company.","We expect capital expenditures to also be higher in 2017, as we expand our Arizona operations by adding new high technology production facilities to meet the growth demands and Missile Systems. This expansion will support the addition of nearly 2,000 jobs over a five year period.","On this last point, the company plans to hire workers at all skill levels with an emphasis on manufacturing, engineering and other higher wage technical positions. This is just one example where our solid position in growth markets drives local investment and high value job creation. After investing in ourselves, we have been and will continue to return capital to our shareholders through a competitive and sustainable dividend and a reduction in our shares outstanding, market conditions permitting.","So in conclusion, we had another great year. Our global team built on Raytheon's return to growth in 2015 by continuing our momentum, which resulted in an even stronger growth year in 2016. I want to thank all of our employees for their commitment, focus and performance. Their outstanding work on behalf of our customers, company and shareholders positions us well for continued growth and the opportunities ahead.","With that, I'll turn it over to Toby.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and full-year results, then I'll discuss our outlook for 2017. After that, we'll open up the call for questions.","During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning which are posted on our website. Okay. Would everyone please moved to page three. We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in both the fourth quarter and the full year, with bookings, EPS, and operating cash flow all better than our expectations.","We had strong bookings in the fourth quarter at $7.6 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.21. And for the year, we had record bookings of $27.8 billion, resulting in a 6% growth to our year-end 2016 backlog. This sets the stage for continued growth in 2017, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a few minutes.","Sales were $6.2 billion in the quarter, down slightly from last year. As we pointed out on our third quarter conference call, the fourth quarter of 2016 had four fewer workdays than the comparable period in 2015 which had an impact to sales of approximately $100 million per day. For the year, sales were up 3.5%, ending at $24.1 billion.","Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.84 for the quarter and $7.44 for the full year, which I will give a little more color on in a few minutes. We also generated strong operating cash flow of $1.1 billion for the quarter and $2.9 billion for the year, which included a $500 million pre-tax discretionary pension contribution that was not in our prior guidance.","Additionally, during the quarter the company repurchased 700,000 shares of common stock for $100 million, bringing the full-year 2016 repurchases to 6.9 million shares for about $900 million. We reduced our share count in 2016 by 3%.","Would also like to point out that in addition to the $900 million I just mentioned, the company also repurchased an additional $96 million of shares surrendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligation in connection with stock awards. The company ended the year with a solid balance sheet and net debt of approximately $1.9 billion.","Turning now to page four, let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full-year results. As I mentioned earlier, we had strong bookings of $7.6 billion in the quarter and a record $27.8 billion for the full year, resulting in a year-end backlog of $36.9 billion. This is an increase of $2.2 billion over year-end 2015 and provides us with a solid foundation for 2017. It's worth noting that both Missile Systems and SAS had outstanding bookings performance for the full-year 2016.","For the quarter, international orders represented 38% of our total company bookings and for the full year were 29% of total bookings. And as Tom mentioned earlier, at the end of 2016, approximately 41% of our total backlog was international.","Turning now to page five, we had fourth quarter sales of $6.2 billion, lower than our prior expectations, primarily due to the timing on some large international awards at IDS. It's worth noting that international sales continue to be strong, representing 31% of our total sales for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2016.","So looking at the businesses, IDS had net sales of $1.4 billion in the quarter, down from the same period last year, primarily due to lower net sales on an international communications program and on the Air Warfare Destroyer program. And again, it's important to point out that the timing of some international awards that we had expected in the back end of 2016 unfavorably impacted IDS sales in the quarter.","Net sales at both IIS and Missile Systems in the fourth quarter were relatively flat compared with the same period last year. SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion in Q4. The increase was primarily driven by higher net sales on an electronic warfare systems contract and classified programs. And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Stonesoft, which was completed in the first quarter of 2016.","For the full year, the company's sales were $24.1 billion, up approximately 3.5% over full-year 2015. Both our international and domestic businesses contributed to this sales growth.","Moving ahead to page six, we delivered solid operational performance in the quarter and for the full year. Looking at business margins in the quarter, IDS had solid margins of 15.6% in the quarter but had a tough comparison. As a reminder, IDS had $53 million of operating income from a favorable contract modification to restructure the Air Warfare Destroyer program in the fourth quarter of 2015. IDS, IIS, Missile Systems, and SAS margins all met or exceeded the guidance that we provided back in October.","Turning to page seven. We had solid operating margin performance for the year. Total company segment margins were 12.7%, which was consistent with our expectations. On page eight, you'll see both the fourth quarter and full year EPS. In the fourth quarter 2016 our EPS was $1.84 and for the full year was $7.44. EPS for the quarter was strong and above the guidance we provided you in October. It's worth noting that as a result of the $500 million pre-tax discretionary pension plan contribution that we made in the fourth quarter of 2016, there was an unfavorable tax related impact of $0.04 because the contribution lowered the benefit of our domestic manufacturing tax deduction. This lowered EPS and was not included in our prior guidance.","Now turning to page nine. Before moving on to our 2017 guidance, it's important to note as we discussed on our prior earnings conference call, that effective January 1, 2017, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard. And although the impact of adopting the new standard on our 2015 and 2016 net sales and operating income was not material, to assist you with your modelling and for comparison purposes, we provided the recast data in the attachments at the end of the earnings release. And just to be clear, as I discuss our 2017 guidance going forward, I will be comparing to the recast 2016 amounts, which reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.","Now moving to our 2017 guidance. We see sales in the range of between $24.8 billion and $25.3 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2016. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international businesses. Our 2017 outlook for the deferred revenue adjustment is $33 million and for the amortization of acquired intangibles is $127 million. As for pension, we see the 2017 FAS\/CAS adjustment at a positive $428 million, which I'll discuss in just a minute.","We expect net interest expense to be between $216 million and $221 million. We see our average diluted shares outstanding to be between 291 million and 293 million on a full-year basis, a reduction of approximately 2%, driven by the continuation of our share repurchase program. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 31.5%, which I'll cover in a little more detail in just a moment.","In 2017, we see our EPS to be in the range of $7.20 to $7.35, which is up when you compare to 2016, excluding the TRS transaction, which added $0.53 to 2016 results. Our operating cash flow from continuing operations for 2017 is expected to be between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion compared to $2.9 billion in 2016.","As we sit here today, we don't anticipate making a discretionary contribution to our pension plans in 2017. As we previously mentioned, we did make a $500 million discretionary contribution in 2016. When you look at our cash flow before this contribution, our overall operating cash flow is about $400 million better than our prior expectations for 2016 and 2017 combined.","Before moving on to page 10, I would like to mention that we expect our 2017 bookings to be between $25 billion and $26 million, driven by demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. And we expect stronger bookings in the second half of the year, similar to prior years.","On page 10, I want to spend a minute talking about our 2017 effective tax rate. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 31.5% in 2017. Our tax rate in 2017 is higher than 2016 primarily due to the tax-free gain on the TRS transaction that we completed in 2016, worth about 180 basis points, and a reduction in the expected excess tax deduction from stock-based compensation, which is worth about 80 basis points.","So if you move to page 11, here we have provided our initial 2017 guidance by business. At the midpoint of the sales range, we expect to see growth in our IDS, Missile Systems, SAS, and Forcepoint businesses in 2017. We expect IIS sales to decline slightly in 2017 compared with 2016. As we've discussed before, this is driven by the planned ramp down on the Warfighter FOCUS program. Excluding Warfighter FOCUS, we expect IIS to grow in the low single digit range, driven by domestic cyber security and special mission programs.","With respect to segment margins, consistent with our prior comments, we expect 2017 margins to continue to be solid, in the 12.4% to 12.6% range. This is up when you compare to 2016 excluding the TRS transaction, which was worth about 70 basis points.","At IDS we see margins in the 15.5% to 15.7% range, which is also up from 2016 excluding the impact of the TRS transaction. This change from 2016 is driven by favorable program mix as we ramp up on some recently awarded programs and increase productivity, driven by efficiencies from our investments in factory automation and equipment upgrades.","We expect IIS margins of 7.4% to 7.6%. This is in line year over year. We see missiles margins in the 13.1% to 13.3% range, up slightly compared with 2016. SAS margins are also expected to be in the 13.1% to 13.3% range, consistent with 2016. And at Forcepoint, we expect margins to be in the 10% to 11% range. This is a decrease from 2016 due to an expected $25 million internal investment to support Forcepoint's long-term growth.","If you now move to page 12, we've provided you with our outlook for the first quarter of 2017. We expect the cadence for the balance of 2017 to play out similar to 2016 with sales and operating cash flow ramping up in the second half of the year. We expect EPS to follow a similar cadence when you exclude the impact from the tax free gain from the second quarter 2016 TRS transaction.","And on page 13, as we have done in the past, we've provided a summary of the financial impact from pensions in 2016 as well as the projected impact for 2017 through 2019, holding all assumptions constant. As I mentioned earlier, we see the 2017 FAS\/CAS adjustment at a positive $428 million, which reflects our investment returns in 2016 of 6% on our U.S. pension assets, the December 31 discount rate of 4.4% and the long-term return on asset assumption of 7.5%.","As you know, after our third quarter earnings call, market conditions led to a sharp increase to the discount rate, which ended down just 10 basis points from year-end 2015. Looking beyond 2017, keep in mind that each 25 basis points change in the discount rate at December 31, 2017, drives a $70 million to $80 million change in FAS\/CAS for 2018. And as we discussed on the call in October, we reduced our long-term return on asset assumption from 8% to 7.5%, driven by recent capital market expectations.","And finally on page 14, we have provided an updated three-year outlook of the acquisition accounting adjustments to help you with your long-term modeling. Please note that you will see a significant decline in the deferred revenue adjustment over the period, as expected.","Before concluding, as we discussed on past earning calls, with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet at our current credit rating going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, making small targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs, and from time to time making discretionary contributions to our pension plans.","Let me conclude by saying that in 2016 Raytheon again delivered strong operating performance with bookings, earnings and operating cash flow all ahead of expectations. Sales grew 3.5% and our backlog was up significantly. We have a solid balance sheet, which gives us flexibility and options to continue to drive shareholder value, and we are well positioned to grow in 2017 and beyond, both in our international and domestic business.","So with that, we'll open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And your first question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes. Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, George.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Toby, I want to pursue a little bit the same thing I had last quarter. If I look at your bookings, they're $3.77 billion above sales. Yet if I look at total backlog, it's only up $2.2 billion. So, why shouldn't I conclude that either some of these bookings haven't made it into backlog or some have been cancelled, which would explain the continued miss in the IDS revenues?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. So first I can tell you anything that we reported as a booking has made it into our backlog, so that's part one. Regarding the rest of the question, as I mentioned in my comments, we're pleased with the backlog growth, up 6% over 2015. We saw a 3% increase at the end of 2015 as well. What is happening or what you're seeing, and we've talked about this before, is the effect of backlog adjustments. We did see $300 million of backlog adjustments in this quarter. The majority of these or most of these are the results of cost underruns on domestic cost type programs. From time to time we also see some smaller impacts related to scope changes and currency fluctuations. And if you look at it from a total year point of view, as you did, that difference or that gap that you're trying to bridge is all related to the backlog adjustments.","I can also tell you none of it relates to cancellations including any international orders. So we don't have a concern there. The sales miss, just to kind of play towards the rest of your question, the sales miss at IDS had nothing to do with anything that was canceled. It's purely timing. Nothing went away. Some of the larger orders, like the Qatar EWR that was mentioned earlier, that just moved from the fourth quarter into here over the award expected over the next couple months, and it's nothing more than that.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes, but still, Toby, if I look at IDS revenue guidance for this year, it's actually lower than the revenue guidance you had for IDS in 2016. So it's not like you are making up on these deferrals. There's something that's missing there.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","So you got to keep in mind, right, when a program moves to the right, the whole program moves, right. And so just use the EWR as an example, right, we'd expected that award here in at the end of, back at the end of 2016. Would have had a few months worth of revenue recorded in 2016. And then in 2017 you would have been into make it up months three through 15 on the program. Now we're only going to be recording months one through 10, let's say, or one through nine. So it's just that everything is shifting to the right.","Regarding IDS, we are showing, if you look at the range of the revenue guidance for 2017, somewhere between a 3% to 7% growth or up in the mid to single digits. It is driven by international as we continue to ramp up on some of the larger awards, the international radar awards and Patriot programs, as well as Qatar EWR. And we do have some programs that, as planned, would be ramping down, but we feel good about the mid single digit growth for IDS. And again, nothing has gone away or been lost. It's just a matter of timing.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jason Gursky from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, good morning everyone.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Jason.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Tom, I was wondering if you could just spend a few minutes talking a little bit about Forcepoint and the dynamics going on there. Looks like sales growth going into 2017 is maybe decelerating a little bit, maybe a bit behind your long-term growth rate for the business. And you just mentioned a $25 million investment that you want to make in the business for long-term growth. So, just some updated thoughts on Forcepoint, both for the near term and the long-term story there. Thanks, guys.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Well, let me just start off. I'll start it off and I'll hand it off to Toby for some additional color. Forcepoint in our mind is meeting our expectations. In fact, I was just at their sales kickoff. We have restructured that business after the acquisitions. We have a solid strategy in place for the business. We have brought in a new CEO last year, Matt Moynahan, along with a strong CFO for that business. And so I believe we're off to a great start in 2017.","One of the key elements that we were working on in 2016 was the transfer from mostly I would call it a small to medium enterprise type customer base, to a large enterprise, a very large enterprise customer base. And we had some significant uptick in being able to achieve bookings and sales with large enterprises and very large enterprises last year. And that looks like that's continuing into 2017. So it's following our strategy there to essentially take Forcepoint to the next level relative to its market area.","The other element is we've also improved several of its products and solution sets in the marketplace. As you probably know, cyber threat is not getting less. It's getting more. And we've developed some new products, especially relative to behavioral analytics, that we believe will be very unique to the marketplace, but also something that can help sustain businesses in terms of their attacks against the whole cyber threat area.","I'll -- then I'll turn it over to Toby. We are making investment next year. One of the things, the struggles that we had is the business has gone from \u2013 to about $250 million a year revenue, and we ended this 2016 at about close to $600 million in revenue. So we're doing some infrastructure upgrades to be able to support that size of a business.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, so, Jason, and just on the, translate a little bit what Tom said from the results for the year end and looking ahead. So, the sales for the fourth quarter and there for the year, they were a little bit below our expectations. The good news is that the business hit our expectations from a bookings point of view, and they just had some mix issues, right, where it flowed through and resulted in lower profit within the quarter based upon fewer perpetual contracts and more subscription contracts, okay. So it was just a mix issue where the year ended up.","Looking forward to 2017, low double digit top-line growth, 10% to 11% margin. The $25 million investment that Tom talked about is about 300, 350 basis points impact on margin. So normalized for that, maybe closer to 14%. That said, looking forward on a longer-term basis, we continue to expect double digit growth going forward. We believe the investment in the business in 2017 sets us up well for continued double digit growth and margins.","So, I think we're still on track. Recall we made this investment from the longer-term, right, about looking to the future and a growth perspective. And as Tom mentioned, in a couple years, this is becoming a $600 million plus cyber security business, and we're pleased with the performance and the outlook for the business.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. So, to get back to George's question, so your booking guidance of $25 billion to $26 billion, if I recall in the third quarter, I think you said you expected bookings in 2017 to at least equal sales, if I'm not mistaken. And now you've had a slip of $1 billion of Qatar in, and it looks like the book-to-bill is slightly positive. And that's before any of these backlog adjustments. So A, is there any slippage of some business you expected in 2017 that's moved out to the right, and B, should we look for the backlog adjustment to be a negative, therefore suggesting that backlog may be relatively stagnant over the year?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, Cai, so keep in mind, notwithstanding the early warning radar that moved into 2017, we did come in nearly $1 billion higher than the high end of our booking outlook for 2016, okay. And that resulted in the strong 1.16 book-to-bill. We said think of 2017 in roughly 1 to 1.05 book-to-bill. When you look at the two years together, obviously the simple average there, about 1.08. Very strong. Will we have some backlog adjustments in 2017? I'm sure we will. We don't anticipate they'd be at the level that they were here that we saw in 2016. And net-net we'd expect to see backlog growth in 2017.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Seth.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Morning. I wonder if you guys could talk a little bit and quantify the increase in the CapEx that you are expecting for 2017, and then talk about the trajectory in the out years.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, so we ended 2016 around $625 million in CapEx and software spending. As we talked about, it is going to go up in 2017. I think the way to think of it is in a range of maybe $650 million to $695 million for both capital and software combined. We're increasing our spending as the business grows with investments in our infrastructure and high technology production facilities, as Tom mentioned in his opening remarks.","We're also continuing to invest in demonstration capabilities and factory automation, again to position us for both growth and productivity improvements. We are seeing some of the results of that, those improvements from a productivity point of view in our factory automation. And we strongly believe we're making investments in the right places that will yield future benefit. Looking beyond 2017, to the other part of your question, I would expect the expenditure level to be in line with where we are in 2017.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, Good morning gentlemen.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning Carter.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Morning.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And go Falcons, huh? Maybe not.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Hey, hey, hey.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Hey.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I guess we'll see. I had a couple questions. Toby, first on the upside in the cash and where that came from. You highlighted a couple hundred million over the two-year period. I don't know if you could tell us what the elements were there that drove that.","And then the second one, there's clearly been some discussion around border adjustment for tax and export sales. And I don't know if you had a view on how that would impact international defense revenues, FMS versus DCS. Any views you have there or color you could share with us would be helpful? Thanks.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yes, so on the cash, what I said is if you take a look at 2016 and 2017 combined, prior to the discretionary, we're about $400 million better than what we had guided for 2016. And then the indications that we gave for 2017 back on the October call, that $400 million is all driven, primarily driven, by the timing of receipts and collections. Relative to 2016, a big chunk of it was related to advances that we received earlier than expected.","And in 2017, think of it just as typical receipts on programs. So from us this is a real strong point here. As we closed out 2016 and going to 2017, we were able to beat in 2016, and it wasn't at the expense of 2017. We backfilled that $300 million plus added another $100 million, really driven by the performances of the business. So we're really pleased with that and it helps reinforce our focus on cash flow and the strong balance sheet.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","So Carter, I'll jump in on the tax. Obviously we've been following this very closely. Unfortunately right now, there's not been a lot of specifics laid out in terms of how the new administration is going to approach the tax reform. I can tell you that 31% of our business is international and therefore export. So the question is how will that be looked at. Because as part of that, approximately 19% of that is direct commercial sale, which is a pure export, but then about 12% of that is FMS. So we're really trying to understand how the new administration is going to look at what the definition of export is.","In terms of any imports, that's less than 5% of our total costs. So in any case, if there is some type of tax effort or reform put out that has an advantage relative to exports, we'll more than likely get a significant tailwind from that.","Operator","So next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Tom, I wanted to go back to George's question a little bit. The book to bill, I think Toby, you just said 1.16, 1.15. The sales growth is 3% to 5% for this year. We're in an environment where we've got a consumables shortfall overseas. I guess readiness is the theme of the new administration. Is there scope to think of your guidance as somewhat conservative for this year, or do these factors really contribute next year? Could we see an acceleration of growth next year?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yeah Robert, I think it's a great question. And just make sure that you understand that our guidance, essentially assuming what we know about the fiscal year 2017 budget today, we did not put any windage on this relative to anything that the new administration is going to do relative to readiness in 2017. I think the picture right now is a little cloudy relative to how much of changes will occur in the 2017 budget. So what we've done is we've tried to base our guidance on what we know for sure, and that is essentially that a budget that has been worked in Congress to date. And so, if you think that's conservative, then that's conservative.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","I think, Tom, the other thing I would add just from our, the outlook we gave for the bookings, keep in mind, as we always have, our bookings are factored. Okay, so we try to take that into account when we give the guidance as well.","And then regarding going back to George's question and around the backlog adjustments, one thing I will point out, some of those do come back in the form of other new work, maybe not on the same program but other programs as well. So it's not always necessarily a one-for-one decrease to the backlog.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Rob.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Tom, I was wondering if you could give us an update on what you are seeing in Europe. It does seem like some of the defense spending trends there are improving, and how long it might take for some of this to flow through to you.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yes, so I think one of them is we are seeing several NATO countries I would say getting closer to the 2% of their GDP in terms of investments in defense. And so that obviously is healthy for us. We are seeing a significant interest in, I call it, the deterrence element of our three buckets sometimes I talk about. And really that is to be able to have systems that can deter a major threat from encroaching their borders. And so we are seeing that in Poland. We are obviously working through a major Patriot effort there.","Another European country is moving forward with a Patriot buy, and so we are obviously following that very closely. There is also a replenishment on weapons for the NATO countries. And so we are actively involved in working with several countries in that area. So it's all the way from missile defense all the way into integrated air and missile defense also and then even down to weapons replenishment. So we're seeing it across all those three product areas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.","Peter J. Arment - Baird Equity Research","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Tom, Toby.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Morning.","Peter J. Arment - Baird Equity Research","Hey, Tom, this one's for you. You mentioned that the approval on the SM-6 for international customers. Have you been able to kind of quantify what the available market or the TAM is for that particular product?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","I mean, over multiple years, it's in the billions.","Peter J. Arment - Baird Equity Research","I mean, is there any expectation that you'd start to see some of that fall into this year or is that too soon?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Well, we could potentially see some bookings, but we're not going to see significant revenue in 2017. That's going to start 2018 and out on the international. The domestic, we just received a major $250 million award just here in the last couple weeks from the United States Navy. So we're seeing obviously, the domestic side is significantly picking up. This is a system that just has come out of development here in the last year. It's already gone into production, and we're seeing demand signals in the international marketplace. The good news is we now have approval to sell into the international marketplace. So bottom line is, it's all upside moving forward on SM-6.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Sam.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Hi, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Wanted to talk a little bit about your cash flow and just how to think about the capital. And your guidance of 291 million to 293 million shares is certainly not a very big decrease from where you're ending the year. And so I'm trying to just understand: should we expect the pace of buyback to be materially different in 2017? Is it just a factor of the stock price being higher now versus a year ago? Just trying to think about how, if you've changed at all how you're thinking about the balance with your free cash.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah so, consistent with what we've talked about in the past, Sam, when we look at how we deploy our capital, we think of it from a balanced approach, and that hasn't changed. Share buyback is still a key component of that. Relative to your question on the cadence, I think the cadence is going to be, sitting here today, similar to what we saw in 2016. That said, the beauty of our balanced approach, it allows us to flex across the different elements of how we deploy capital, and we'll continue to evaluate that.","We do see incremental value in our stock for all the reasons we've talked about in the past, relative to our international position where our technology investments are and how aligned they are for the future with the DoD. I mentioned earlier Forcepoint continues to be a long-term growth and value creation play, and that hasn't changed. So we'll continue to evaluate that. We said it before. We're going to be prudent in our allocation of capital. And if we think accelerating from what we did from a cadence point of view on the buyback in 2016 makes sense in 2017, we won't be afraid to make that change.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thank you. Good morning, everybody.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. So the initiative to reduce the footprint by about 10% from a few years ago: I was curious where you are on that. And I'm wondering if it's still needed given the improving outlook on budgets. And can you give us a sense for how many points of margin that was expected to add at sort of a segment margin level, or was it all fully baked? Thank you.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, so when we embarked on the footprint reduction initiative several years ago, our focus was becoming more competitive, more efficient, and we have done that, right, along the way. We have reduced on a gross basis just about 8 million square feet. We reduced about 1.4 million gross in 2016. There are still some elements of that that are ongoing. Think of the reduction we have anticipated here in 2017 related to that of around 700,000 to 800,000 square feet.","So we're still focused on that. And again, we're finding ways to do things more efficiently, be more cost competitive, and at the same time continue to work and improve our margins. I'll be honest. I don't remember what the exact bogie was for how the impact of that was going to flow through, but we have seen an improvement. Just as a reminder, we get the instant year improvement that we flow through to the bottom line, but then in subsequent years, we update our rates and we price that into our future contracts. But we're definitely on target with that and seeing the benefits we expected.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. I want to go back to some of the accomplishments you have had in capturing some development programs. Tom, could you update us on the status of AMDR and when you expect that to start being inserted into the fleet? And the same applies to Next Gen Jammer and associated opportunities there as well.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Okay, so I'll start with AMDR. AMDR is in test at the Pacific Test Range out in Hawaii. It's having great results there. Obviously there is a lot of demand signals from the operational Navy side to get that into use as soon as possible. But initially, it goes onto DDG-51s in line and production, and then it goes into back-fit into the older DDG-51s. So we see a transition into, starting a transition into production in the late 2018. There is also, we've already been turned on to long lead for the AMDR and long lead material. And we see that picking up, essentially the production transition in 2018 and beyond. On Next Generation Jammer, Next Generation Jammer has entered into the main EMD phase of that program. So that will also be transitioning into production in the 2020 type range.","One other one you didn't mention, Howard, was we did win the Navy EASR program, which is a smaller radar than AMDR but essentially based on the AMDR architecture. So between AMDR and EASR, we have the majority of the radars that go on surface Navy ships. And as you know, one of the keys of the administration's efforts moving forward is to increase the number of ships, which then will drive the number of EASRs and AMDRs that are going to be required. So we have a lot of expectations for those two franchises to take off here in the next three to five years.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Yeah, good morning guys. Nice cash flow year.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Thanks, Pete.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Thanks, Pete.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey Tom, I wanted to talk about missiles for a minute, because every time I turn around it seems like there's a new competitive missile opportunity out there, whether it's PB (54:32) with their lethality or Third Offset type stuff, or I've seen an Australian announcement for a $1 billion AMRAAM order. And now you're talking about this Tucson expansions, I was just trying to put it all together and ask you, is missiles looking like it's going to be ex-Forcepoint, is it going to be your growthiest segment now going out through the midterm, given all that's going on and the fact that you are expanding Tucson?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Well, I think there is -- let me talk about the demand signals and how they're coming in. And I'll talk about them in terms of the three buckets again. One is the counterterrorism, counterinsurgency area there. So there is a heavy demand for precision weapons, munitions in that area to minimize collateral damage but yet be able to strike at the terrorists, in this case here, the ISIS. As you know, the new administration has also made I guess a statement here that they are going to go after ISIS. So we see a significant demand pull in terms of these precision munitions, obviously all coming out of missile company.","The second bucket is the deterrence, and that gets into missile defense. And again, with the near pure threats, also with some rogue nations, that's driving significant demand signals there, not only in the United States but also with our international coalition partners. So that's where the other strong demand area is.","And then in this third bucket is these future Third Offset strategy type systems, and that we're heavily involved in. We mentioned one brand new system called this HAWC, DARPA hypersonic weapons. So we're getting significant demand signals from each of those buckets and we're meeting those demand signals with the technology investments we made. And also now we are making investments in our factory to be able to expand, to be able to support the demand signals and the quantities that we're seeing come down the pike.","And obviously you're seeing this in AMRAAMs, which is our air-to-air missiles. You're seeing that in all the precision air-to-ground weapons, and then also in our missile defense, which I mentioned the SM-6. So bottom line is you are absolutely correct. Missiles will be a leader in the business in terms of revenue and also new bookings here over the next several years.","Todd Ernst - Raytheon Co.","Steve, we have time for one more question please.","Operator","That question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes hey, good morning, guys.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Ron.","Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","In your prepared remarks, you mentioned you're going to see a 50% -- you saw a 50% increase in your CRAD spending in 2016. How do we think about that for 2017? And then how do we think about CRAD materializing into a procurement program?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yes, let me take that on. Obviously, CRAD is important to us for several reasons. One obviously is that it develops new technology which makes us more competitive in the marketplace, but also gets us in up front working with customers. Since it is CRAD, since it is contracted, we are not just doing the IRAD on ourselves, building the field of dreams, we are working hand in glove with a customer, making sure that we're meeting their demand signals, we're meeting their needs, their capability needs.","So in that case, it's very focused technology development to meet a customer's needs, with the customer involved. So that's why it's really important. And that CRAD technology then rolls to the next part, which will then turn into EMD programs, engineering, manufacturing, development programs, which then will lead into production programs. So that's why the CRAD is so important. It gives us essentially a leg up in terms of new competitions coming online to win those competitions, get into these EMD programs, and then transition them into production, creating new franchises.","Todd Ernst - Raytheon Co.","Okay.

And welcome to the Raytheon Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ditamara and I will be your operator for today [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kelsey DeBriyn, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Kelsey DeBriyn","Thank you, Ditamara. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our third quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our Web site at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site.","With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby, and then move onto questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the Company's future plans, objectives and expected performance and the proposed merger with UTC, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings. And with respect to the proposed merger and related matters in the definitive merger proxy statement filed with the SEC on September 10, 2019.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Kennedy","Thank you, Kelsey. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon again delivered strong performance in the third quarter. We achieved record sales of $7.4 billion, up 9.4%. And our bookings, sales, operating income, EPS and operating cash flow, all exceeded our expectations. We continue to see strong global demand for innovative solutions. Book-to-bill in the third quarter was a healthy 1.27. And for the second time this year, we achieved record backlog, which rose to $44.6 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of $3 billion year-over-year.","Given our continued strong bookings and the opportunities we see in the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our bookings outlook for the year by another $1.5 billion. It is worth noting that since the beginning of this year, we've increased our bookings outlook by a total of $3 billion over our original expectation, and we expect a full year book-to-bill ratio of greater than 1.1.","We are pleased with our bookings performance this year, which positions us well for a strong growth in 2020. Additionally, we are also increasing our guidance for sales, operating income and EPS. Toby will discuss additional details about our third quarter performance along with our updated guidance and additional color on our 2020 outlook in a few minutes.","And let me update you on our proposed merger of equals with United Technologies Aerospace Businesses. Two weeks ago at our special meeting, we reached an important milestone. Raytheon shareholders overwhelmingly approved the merger with 96% of the voted shares in favor of the merger. I am pleased that both our shareholders and the shareholders of UTC voted in favor of our powerful strategic combination.","Shareholder approval reflects a significant step on our path to unite to world-class companies with complementary technologies, and it supports our view that this merger of equals will create additional growth opportunities while delivering benefits to our shareholders, customers and employees. Integration planning for the merger is progressing well, and the merger remains on track to close in the first half of 2020.","One of the strengths Raytheon will be bringing to the combined company is our diversified portfolio of advanced technologies that are well aligned with our customers' needs. So let me spend a few minutes discussing these innovative technologies and how we are able to turn them into compelling and advanced solutions and franchises for our customers.","The newest example of this is our clean sheet offering for the next generation air and missile defense radar competition. Last week, we were pleased to be selected by the U.S. Army to develop the lower tier air and missile defense sensor, which extends Raytheon's position as a world's premier air and missile defense radar capability provider for decades to come.","We expect LTAMDS to have a potential lifetime value around $20 billion from sales to domestic and international customers. LTAMDS will operate on the Army's integrated air and missile defense network. Our winning LTAMD solution is 360 degree active electronically scanned array radar powered by Raytheon manufactured gallium nitride, a substance that strengthens the radar single and enhances its sensitivity.","Over the years, we have invested significantly in the AESA GaN technology and advanced manufacturing capability, positioning the company as the global leader in advanced AESA technology and product development. Our innovative solution also showcased advanced abilities and ease of maintenance and sustainment for the end-user, the soldier.","Our Patriot franchise was also strengthened in August with the Kingdom of Bahrain, signing an agreement to purchase our Patriot system. This Letter of Offer and Acceptance allow the U.S. government to begin contract negotiations with our Patriot team. Bahrain will become the 17th nation to procure Patriot. With the U.S. Army's approval, all 17 of these Patriot partners will have the opportunity to add of our ESA 360 degree capability LTAMDS radar to each of their fire units. This will enhance the performance and extend the life of their systems for many decades.","In addition, the capabilities of the LTAMDS radar also opens up the market for standalone forward-deployed applications. Our leadership in radars was also extended with the completion of the first system-level test of the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar at Wallops Island test facility by the U.S. Navy and Raytheon in August.","EASR is the newest sensor in the Navy's SPY-6 family of radars for aircraft carriers and frigates. It provides simultaneous insight air and anti-surface warfare, electronic protection and air traffic control capabilities. The radar has a highly scalable design and the innovative technology allows it to deliver increased performance, higher reliability and sustainability and lower total ownership cost. Upon completion of the system-level testing by the end of the year, EASR will shift to low rate initial production. As a reminder, AMDR, our Navy radar franchise for the new DDG 51 destroyers recently transitioned into low rate initial production.","Another area where we are using our innovative technology to meet the needs of our global customers is in the area of counter UAS. Recently, our Coyote Block 2 counter drone unmanned aircraft system scored direct hits on multiple aerial targets in U.S. Army test flights. Coyote Block 2 is a new high-speed kinetic interceptor that will counter hostile drones. It is compatible with Raytheon's Ku-band Radio Frequency System or KuRFS radar. The Block 2 system is on track to be full rate production ready in 2020.","In the area hypersonics, we are also advancing technology to develop new capabilities for our customers. In September, we announced that Raytheon will build and deliver to control, actuation and power conditioning subassemblies that can control flight of the U.S. Army's new Common-Hypersonic Glide Body missile.","All of our businesses are at the forefront in developing new and updating existing technologies. And one in particular, SAS, has seen good advancements, both in terms of growth and in terms of innovative technology offerings. During the quarter, SAS had very strong performance, growing sales more than 14% year-over-year and exceeding margin expectations. Over the last few years, we have seen SAS capture a number of new franchise programs. And during the quarter, we made great progress on these new franchises. In the electronic warfare market, this past August, SAS delivered the first next-generation jammer mid-band engineering and manufacturing development pod to the U.S. Navy to begin ground and aircraft integration testing.","And in October, we delivered the second pod. Raytheon will deliver a total of 15 EMD pods for mission systems testing and qualification, as well as 14 pods for airworthiness certification. Beyond the good growth, we are seeing on our EW programs at SAS, we are also seeing strong growth in our space and ISR program, such as the NextGen OPIR and recent classified franchise program wins.","In July, SAS was selected as a radar supplier for the B-52 bomber radar modernization program, displacing the incumbent and extending our airborne radar franchise. Under the contract, Raytheon will design, develop and produce and sustain AESA radar systems for the entire U.S. Air Force B-52 fleet. With improved navigation reliability, mapping and detection range, the advanced radar upgrade will ensure the aircraft remains [Technical Difficulty] and beyond.","Finally, and as I thinking about my next few years, one of my key roles in the new Raytheon Technologies will be to work with Greg Hayes to driver our combined innovative technologies into business solutions for our customers. My focus has always been to make sure we are taking our best technology, accelerating it to the businesses and embedding it in our advanced products, while making these innovative solutions relevant to our customers. A key priority for me at the future Raytheon Technologies will be to deliver technology synergies and drive technology improvements across all of our businesses and products.","Before concluding, I'd like to take a moment to briefly touch on U.S. Defense Budget. As most of you know, we are again operating under a continuing resolution through November 21st, and our guidance has taken this into account. We encourage lawmakers to work swiftly to get the Defense Appropriations Bill enacted before the end of the calendar year. This is in the best interest of our customers and industry.","Bottom line, the company's performance is strong. We're well-aligned with the advanced technologies needs of our customers. And we have the opportunity to shape the future of aerospace and defense with our proposed merger. I want to thank the Raytheon team worldwide for helping secure the strong position for our company, customers and shareholders. And let me turn it over to Toby.","Toby O'Brien","Thanks Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with third quarter highlights, and then we'll move onto questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the Web slides that we issued earlier this morning.","Everyone would please turn to Page 2. We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the third quarter with bookings, sales, operating income, EPS and operating cash flow, all better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the third quarter of $9.4 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.27, and ended the quarter with a record backlog of $44.6 billion.","Sales for the quarter were also a record at $7.4 billion, up 9.4% with growth across all of our defense businesses. Business segment operating income of $901 million grew 6.9% in the quarter. Our EPS from continuing operations was $3.08, up 36.9%, which I'll give a little more color on in just a moment.","We had strong operating cash flow in the third quarter of $1.3 billion, which was better than our prior expectations. This was due to the timing of collections on some of our larger contracts, which were previously expected in the fourth quarter.","Operating cash flow was higher than last year's third quarter due to the $1.25 billion discretionary pension plan contribution we made in the third quarter 2018, and the timing of collections in the third quarter 2019. At a high level, we are increasing our full year 2019 outlook for sales, operating income and EPS, as well as making other updates. And we're raising our bookings outlook by $1.5 billion for the full year. I'll provide more color on guidance in a few minutes.","Turning now to Page 3. Let me start by providing some detail on our third quarter results. Company bookings continue to be strong. For the third quarter, bookings were $9.4 billion, which were approximately $700 million or 8% higher than the same period last year. These strong bookings position the company well for future growth.","For the quarter, international was 34% of our total company bookings. Again, backlog at the end of the third quarter was a record $44.6 billion, up $3 billion or 7% compared to last year's third quarter. Approximately 39% of our backlog is comprised of international programs.","We now move to Page 4. We had strong third quarter 2019 sales growth of 9.4%, higher than the guidance we set in July, primarily due to better-than-expected performance at our IDS, IIS and SAS businesses.","Looking now at sales by business. IDS had third quarter 2019 net sales of $1.8 billion, up 18% compared with the same quarter last year. The increase from Q3 2018 included sales associated with the recognition of previously deferred costs on an international air and missile defense system program awarded in the third quarter 2019.","IIS had net sales of $1.9 billion. The 6% increase compared to Q3 2018 was primarily due to higher net sales on classified programs in both cyber and space. And as we've previously discussed, we expect IIS's growth rate to continue to moderate in the fourth quarter of the year due to the planned ramp down and transition on the Warfighter FOCUS program.","Missile Systems had third quarter 2019 net sales of $2.2 billion. The 4% increase from the third quarter 2018 was primarily driven by higher net sales on classified programs. In the third quarter 2019, SAS had net sales of $1.9 billion, up 14% compared with the same quarter last year. The increase in net sales for the quarter included higher net sales on classified programs, Protected Communications Systems programs and the Next Gen OPIR program. Overall, we're very pleased with our total company sales growth for the quarter, which is up 9.4%.","Moving ahead to Page 5. We delivered strong operational performance in the quarter. Our operating margin was 16.2% for the total company and 12.1% on a business segment basis, better than our expectations. Total business segment operating income is up year-over-year for both the quarter and year-to-date.","So now looking at business margins. IDS third quarter 2019 operating margin was strong at 16.1%, better than our expectations and in line with last year's third quarter. IIS operating margin of 8.7% was up 10 basis points compared to last year's third quarter, better than expectations. The third quarter included a non-cash gain of $14 million on an investment.","Missiles' operating margin was 10.1% in the quarter with last year's third quarter benefiting from higher net program efficiencies. SAS's third quarter 2019 operating margin was strong at 14%, better than our expectations and 80 basis points higher than last year's third quarter. The improvement in operating margin was largely driven by a favorable change in program mix. We continue to expect both total business segment and total company operating income to increase in Q4.","Turning now to Page 6. Third quarter 2019 EPS was $3.08, better than expected, primarily driven by higher sales volume and the timing of productivity improvements. Third quarter 2019 EPS was higher than last year's third quarter, driven by operational improvements, primarily from higher sales volume, as well as pension related items. You may recall that last year's third quarter results included an unfavorable $0.80 per share impact related to the pension plan annuity transaction.","On Page 7, we've increased our full year 2019 net sales and narrowed the range. We are raising the low-end by $300 million and the high end by $100 million. And we now expect net sales to be between $29.1 billion and $29.4 billion, up 7.5% to 8.7% from 2018. The increase versus our prior guidance is driven by IDS, IIS and SAS.","We increased total business segment operating income, raising the low end by $45 million and the high end by $15 million from our prior guidance. We now expect our total business segment operating income to be in the range of $3,525 million to $3,615 million.","From a total company point of view, we remain focused on operating profit and margin improvement going forward. As we've done in prior years, during the quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of this update, the FAS\/CAS operating adjustment for the year was reduced by $9 million and the retirement benefits non-service expense for the year improved by $38 million. Taken together, they have a favorable total year impact of approximately $0.08 per share with $22 million or $0.06 per share recorded in the third quarter 2019 and $7 million or $0.02 per share expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter 2019.","We've increased our full year 2019 EPS, raising the low end by $0.20 and the high end by $0.10 from our prior guidance. We now expect our EPS to be in the range of $11.70 to $11.80. I'll discuss this in a little more detail in just a moment. We continue to see our 2019 operating cash flow outlook between $4 billion and $4.2 billion.","On Page 8, we've provided you with the 2019 financial outlook EPS walk to bridge our prior view in July to our current EPS guidance. At the midpoint, we are increasing our EPS outlook by $0.15 from July, driven by $0.09 from operations led by the higher sales volume we are seeing and $0.08 from improved pension. This increase is partially offset by higher merger-related expenses of $0.03 versus what we were expecting in July.","On Page 9, we've included guidance by business. We've increased the full-year sales outlook at IDS, IIS, SAS and for the total company to reflect a combination of stronger bookings to-date and fourth quarter expectations. And at Missiles, we continue to see strong growth. We see their full year 2019 sales growth in the 7% to 8% range.","Overall, we're pleased with the company's sales growth. The strong margin performance we saw at IIS and SAS in the third quarter and their improved margin outlook for the remainder of the year offset the margin performance of missiles. This reflects the strength of our balanced portfolio.","Before moving on to Page 10, given our year-to-date bookings strength and our expectations for a strong fourth quarter, we are now raising our full year 2019 bookings outlook by $1.5 billion to a range of between $32.5 billion to $33.5 billion. The increase is driven by strong demand from our global customers, and positions us well for continued growth in 2020.","On Page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see the fourth quarter for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations. We expect our fourth quarter sales to be in a range of $7.8 billion to $8.1 billion and EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in a range of $2.93 to $3.03. We expect operating cash flow to be in a range of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion.","Now turning to our initial outlook for 2020 on Page 11. As we sit here today, we currently see the book-to-bill ratio above 1, and would expect to achieve another record backlog year. We also see strong sales growth for 2020 for the underlying Raytheon business of 6% to 8% over our 2019 outlook. And while we expect growth across all of our businesses, we would expect IDS and SAS, our highest margin businesses, to have higher growth rates than the others.","Before concluding, I want to touch on two additional points. First, earlier this month, Vista Equity Partners, our joint venture partner in Forcepoint, exercised their put option to require Raytheon to purchase their interest in Forcepoint. As a result, the parties are currently engaged in the formal process under the joint venture agreement to determine the fair value of their interest. We will provide additional information after the transaction is completed.","And second, the collaborative merger efforts and integration planning between Raytheon and United Technologies are well underway and continuing to progress, including the affirmative shareholder votes two weeks ago. We look forward to the next steps in the process, including continuing to work closely with regulatory authorities in U.S. and other jurisdictions to secure the required clearances and approvals for the merger.","We continue to expect the merger to close in the first half of 2020. And post closing, we look forward to Raytheon Technologies delivering strong free cash flow growth and deploying a significant amount of its free cash flow to its shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.","In summary, we had another strong quarter. Our bookings, sales, operating income, EPS and operating cash flow, were all above our expectations. We remain well positioned with both our domestic and international customers' priority areas. We increased our full year 2019 outlook for bookings, operating income and EPS, increased the sales growth range to 7.5% to 8.7% and have a strong foundation for continued sales growth of 6% to 8% in 2020.","With that, Tom and I will open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Just on LTAMDS is so relevant at the moment. Tom, maybe could you provide some color on that program. How you expect this program, how it interacts with the core Patriot franchise just the opportunity internationally you mentioned $20 billion, and then maybe the radar offering how that plays into the missile option?","Tom Kennedy","Yes, it was a great win for the company and also for the future of the company moving through the years forward. This is the new radar. We'll replace all the radars for the Patriot system. It provides 360 degree capability. And so we're seeing threats that evolve that is in our requirement, I believe, by many countries, including the United States now. So this significantly changes the capability of the Patriot system, significantly enhancing it.","The radar does use our GaN technology and advanced GaN capability. It has a lot of great new capabilities beyond the radar operation, especially in the area of the ability to maintain this system. It's a lot easier to maintain than the prior system. And we were getting significant requests already from the international marketplace. So obviously we'll have to get released from the U.S. government. But the demand signal has been building up here for probably the last five years or more. And I think this gives us a great capability to meet that demand moving forward.","One point I would like to make is very similar to the THAAD program where have the TPY-2 radar. In addition to selling the TPY-2 as part of the THAAD system, we also sell the TPY-2 as a forward deployed radar. And we really believe based on the customer feedback that this LTAMDS radar will also meet that market and being able to provide forward deployed radars that are not necessarily part of the Patriot system itself. In other words, a standalone radar offering for a -- and demanding 360 degree market that's out there today.","Toby O'Brien","And Sheila, this is Toby. I'll just add a couple of things. I mean this, I think Tom this in his opening remarks. But this extends your question about how this plays with Patriot today. So this is an extension that's going to carry Patriot on for decades as a franchise for Raytheon and Raytheon Technologies. Tom mentioned the $20 billion opportunity. I think that's probably a little conservative. We're going to continue to execute all our existing Patriot backlog. And then as Tom mentioned, we see demand already from foreign sales. There's going to be about 250 radars that will be subject to this upgrade. Bahrain, that Tom mentioned in his opening remarks, that's the 17th nation that will have Patriot. And this is really the premier franchise for the company, and it's going to be here well past our time for sure.","Operator","Your next response is from David Strauss. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","You guys have had a, I think prior you'd given a 2020 operating cash flow forecast of $4.6 billion. The numbers in the S-4 would have implied something, I think, a little bit even higher than that. And you now have a sales number that looks like it's coming in well above the S-4. So could you talk about maybe what we're looking at potentially for 2020 operating cash flow relative to that prior forecast? Thanks.","Toby O'Brien","David, I'm not going to get into specific cash flow numbers for 2020, and I'll tell you why. So we provided some insights into the underlying business focused on, we look at strong book to bill next year, another record backlog in the sales growth. We didn't get into specifics around income or margin, or cash flow for that matter, really because with the pending merger, there's going to be a lot of things that are going to impact it compared to business as usual.","That said, what I can tell you -- and I'll go a little bit broader than cash flow. From a underlying operational point of view, nothing has changed as it relates to how we're thinking about margins, our operating profit, our underlying ability to generate cash flow in 2020 and beyond. We still see opportunities there to grow our operating profit, expand margins, deliver strong free cash flow. And I think in a relative to the $4.6 billion from confirmation or affirmation, it's still a number. We're not backing off of that. But we'll give more precise numbers obviously post merger closing.","Operator","Your next response is from Peter Arment.","Peter Arment","Congrats on LTAMDS, maybe I'd just come back to it. Toby, what was factored into the S-4 kind of forecast? And then maybe just thinking about the contract structure here where you're funding 30% development costs. How do we think about that? Thanks.","Toby O'Brien","Sure. Let me start with the second part of the question first. So you know the contract vehicle here, it is a OTA or an -- and other transaction authority, which doesn't work the same as a traditional contract in many ways. So essentially the way to think of it, we're performing R&D, research and development and customer will be reimbursing us for a portion of that effort. And there will also be some related capital to support it as well.","As far as the projections in the S-4, if you think about this initial effort, this $384 million under the OTA that goes out into 2022 and all of our projections are factored. So the majority of this, the comment Tom made and I reinforced around the $20 billion, the majority of that would be on beyond the five year window that you saw in the S-4.","Operator","Your next response is from the line of Robert Spingran. Please go ahead.","Robert Spingarn","Just a clarification on LTAMDS given those questions. But is this the kind of thing, Toby, you say beyond 2022 is a good number in 10 radars a year, just trying to size it, 20 a year. And then my primary question is just on Missile Systems, and the margins there have been under pressure for a while now. And I think we saw some charges there after the fact as we went through your 10-Qs. So Tom, could you dig into what's happening at Missile Systems and how you get back to I guess it's a 13% implied number for Q4.","Toby O'Brien","So Rob, I'll hit the LTAMDS question first. So it's kind of hard to put a number on number of radars a year. We still need to get approval for any international sale through the U.S. government once we get through the OTA and these initial production representative units. But again, I'd just remind everyone there's 250 units that are out there that would be eligible to upgrade.","And given the capabilities that these systems have, we would expect that if not all, the majority of those would be ultimately upgraded. And it may not be coming across -- I did say it's our premier franchise. We're really excited about this and the benefits that it brings to the company. And I'll let Tom start on the Missiles question and then I'll...","Tom Kennedy","Toby may be excited about it. But I can tell you I'm very, very excited about it. I mean, this radar has capability that has not been seen on a battlefield in any place in the world, and I think it's just going to change the entire dynamics relative to integrated air and missile defense for the U.S. forces and also its coalition partners.","And then let me switch over into missiles. You're right. We're not happy about where the margins are right now with missiles. You can imagine that both Toby and I are taking a lot of interest in this area. We have made some major changes in the leadership out at Missiles. And we're already starting to see improvements in certain areas.","And the fundamentals do remain strong. They have a strong business. We have two multi-years that were finalized the negotiations with, one is on the Standard Missile-6 and the other one is on the SM-3 Block 1B. And in addition to that we're negotiating kind of almost like a three lot but its three years of production on the SM-3 Block 2A. And in addition to that, we're in final negotiations on the SM-2. Like the whole Standard Missile family is being bought left and right. And so a lot of opportunity in the future in production.","The missile company has had some productivity issues on some programs, which we believe we're on a road to clean up. But they also have got a quite a bit of classified business on board, which is a lot of development business, which has inherently lower margins. So by getting these multi-years in and these other production programs in, we'll increase the base, the production base with the higher margin content, which we believe will help us moving forward.","In addition, we are significantly concentrated on the productivity improvements across all their programs, even their development programs. And so we're taking the best practices from across the company and applying them. One of my passions is program management excellence and we're all over that, and making sure that we're not missing anything in any of the areas.","We have done quite a bit of work in leaning out our manufacturing facilities and upgrading them, and bringing in robotics and automation across the board to drive productivity improvements. We have done and completed all deep dives on any of these problem programs and we have them on the road back to recovery, which means on the road back to higher margins.","So we do believe there is a solid path forward to getting back to the 13%-plus margins that this business traditionally has had. But we're going to drive beyond that and we're not going to be happy with what they achieved best in the past. We're going to continue to drive margins as high as possible. And I believe, looking at their business base in the out years and their mix starting to change relative to the heavy amount of production coming on board that we will attain that greater than 13% margins for that business.","Toby O'Brien","So Rob, let me just add a little bit specific here to Q4 part of your question. So I think you're right in sizing Q4, the high 12% into the 13% range. So given that, maybe a little bit of color on Q3 to try to help bridge to Q4. So as Tom said, below our expectations for the quarter, but we also acknowledge and recognize we're not going to turn things around overnight or within a quarter.","That said, I think it's important to note that within Q3, we did have about a 50 basis point impact to the margins from some investments in the quarter to position the Company on a couple of competitive awards, which were not previously contemplated in the guidance. So things came up in the quarter in a favorable way that led us to make these investments, number one, and again, about 50 basis points worth. If you back that out and you look at Q3, we probably would have been in the high 10% range.","And then the way I think about it, given that we're not going to solve things in a quarter. If I look at Q2, which admittedly was strong for the business compared to how they started the year, and you kind of take the average of Q2 and Q3, excluding the investments I referred to, they performed in the 11% range, give or take.","So bridging 11% to Q4, it's really about half and half between mix improvement and net productivity improvement. The mix improvement in part we expect to be driven by a couple awards, one international one domestic where we would see some inventory liquidation, and those are production type awards that would naturally carry higher margins with it, and then again as I said, the other half coming from improved productivity.","We do expect beyond the fourth quarter, Missiles margins to improve year over year into 2020. I won't repeat everything that Tom said. But we do believe there is a path over the next call it 12 months, 18 months to get this business performing back where we know it can.","Operator","You next response is from Seth Seifman.","Seth Seifman","Toby, I wondered if you could talk a little bit in the S-4 there's some really nice margin expansion, if you exclude the FAS\\\/CAS as we move from 2019 into '20. Should we be thinking about that same level of margin expansion with the higher sales base? And then you talked about the mix changing with IDS and SAS growing relatively fast. Is that the key driver or are there other things that we should focus on?","Toby O'Brien","So look, I'm not going to get into program details or specificity around that. But what I can tell you, just as a reminder, the S-4 information that was used to evaluate the merger, right, that's relatively dated. We've provided top line updates to how we're thinking of 2020. And again, that 6% to 8% is off of a higher outlook for 2019 than we were previously expecting.","We do intend, and we will continue on focusing on expanding both the absolute profit contribution the business has as well as working to expand margins. We went back and looked in the last couple, three years going back to '16 we've done a pretty good job at increasing that segment profit contribution to the Company. It's a 20%-plus increase, about 6.5% compound growth over the last three years.","So I think we have the formula there. I did mention that IDS and SAS are growing more relatively speaking than the other businesses next year, even though we expect growth across all of them and they are the highest margin businesses we have in the portfolio right now. So I think that bodes well for 2020 and beyond."," Operator","Your next response is from George Shapiro.","George Shapiro","Can you walk us through where you stand in terms of Warfighter sales? I know you were expecting them to come down all through the year, but the strength in the margin and the growth this quarter suggests that maybe they continued to lag. And then the second part, one for Tom. With Vista putting the option to you, would you probably wind up selling or getting rid of Forcepoint before the merger closes? Thanks.","Toby O'Brien","Sure, George. Let me start with the Warfighter. So for 2019 total year, we do expect Warfighter to be down about 40% year-over-year, which is about $400 million. A bit of a disproportionate amount of that coming in the fourth quarter I think in the $125 million to $150 million range, so maybe a third of that decrease. I think the IIS team has done a good job maximizing through the transition period the continuation of that effort.","And sitting here today looking at Warfighter and the related scope -- follow-on scope for next year, probably going to be down another third. So in absolute terms, I think maybe $400 million contribution to revenue next year, down $200 million or a third from the levels in '19. But again, as we've said, as expected, right, we knew what the transition looked like and how it was going to play out and things are continuing on that way.","IIS keeps performing well even unrelated to Warfighter, right. They're executing across the portfolio in a strong way. They've had a couple one-time type of events, but even without that their margin performance for the year is better than last year. So I'll kind of leave it with that and let Tom jump in on Forcepoint.","Tom Kennedy","On Forcepoint, as Toby mentioned in his opening remarks, Vista Equity Partners, did exercise their put option to require Raytheon to purchase their interest in Forcepoint. And so we soon will own 100% of Forcepoint. And our plans have not changed. From the day one, we still plan to expect to monetize Forcepoint to create value for our shareholders and then we saw some -- there's a lot of optionality relative to how we do monetize that. But it all remains in play in terms of monetizing the asset.","Operator","Your next response is from Cai Von Rumohr.","Cai Von Rumohr","So could you tell us how big classified was in terms of sales and bookings in the third quarter and expected for the year? And also Lockheed mentioned on their call that they expect counter-hypersonics awards to pick up, that they have been lower. And maybe be a little bit -- us some guidance in terms of what you expect in that area.","Tom Kennedy","For the third quarter, 21% of the total sales was classify and also 21% of the bookings was classified. And so it is a major part of the company. And just one note here is the classified work is -- we use the term here, it's the seed corn for our future. In other words, it's the funding that helps us develop that technology we have and take it forward.","And then in the area of the counter-hypersonics, it's an area that we have actually been getting contracts and a lot of it's been in the classified area for the last five years. So it is a big part of our business, and it's not just on the missile stuff. As I mentioned before, the hypersonics includes the complete fire control chain, including the sensors that are required to be able to detect the hypersonic missiles, the command and control that takes that information, determines what weapon to release to impact that hypersonic missile it's going after against.","And so it's distributed across the entire Raytheon company right now and across every one of our businesses has some type of counter hypersonic work that is going on. So it is a big part of our efforts here at Raytheon and growing, and thus also the whole hypersonic area by itself is growing for us.","Toby O'Brien","And I think, Cai, I think you asked about total year for classified too. And think of it very similar to Q3 right around call it 20% plus or minus a point one way or the other for both the bookings and sales, and based upon the outlook for the year we'll have a record year for classified sales this year as well.","Operator","Your next response is from Carter Copeland.","Carter Copeland","Just expansion a little bit on LTAMDS. I wondered if you could maybe dive into that whole self-funded R&D piece there and if that has any implications for IP or competition or lack thereof overtime, how does that compare long term to where you've been with Patriot.","Toby O'Brien","So I'll give you my answer and then Tom can jump in, right. So as part of the OTA, there is an arrangement around IP rights, for lack of a better way to say it. I feel very good about the deal that we ultimately struck here. I think it gives the government what they want and it gives us what we want. And I would say it this way, based upon what I know today, I feel really confident in our ability to achieve that $20 billion plus of opportunity to install LTAMDS as upgrades on the 250 fire units worldwide.","Tom Kennedy","And I think one of the other differences with this program, and I'll attribute it to the structure of the contract is we're going to be able to move much faster and in terms of getting a system through development and into production than we could on traditional contracts. And I think that's going to help us vis-\u00e0-vis our whole game here is to get through the development program, get it into production, into the hands of our customers which then creates additional demand, both domestically and internationally. So I think all over. I think we're in a very good track with the LTAMDS and having the right IP to be able to retain our position for the next several decades.","Operator","Your next response is from Ron Epstein. Please go ahead.","Ron Epstein","So one question, two parts, second part is related to the first. So in the post LTAMDS thing, we got that, right. So that's great. What's the next thing on the horizon that you're looking for? What are the next big prizes out there? And then the second question is just assuming everything goes through with RTX, what can you bid for that you couldn't bid for today with the new capabilities you'll have?","Toby O'Brien","Let me take that. There is a whole range of new advanced systems that we're pursuing, a lot of them under the umbrella of classified. So it's very hard for us to kind of go in and describe them, but I'll give you two very large ones. One is the Precision Strike Missile, the PrSM missile that replaces the existing ATACMS system that's out there today. That is a program that we're heavily engaged in. The Army has already down-selected to two contractors: one is Raytheon and the other one, Lockheed. So we're competing against the Lockheed on this.","And we believe we have a very solid offering that meets the Army's requirements. With the INF treaty going away, the Army is very, very interested in this program, and is actually expanding the range of the missile beyond the, I would call it, the initial solicitations range. Good news is we have a solution set that allows us to achieve that expansion.","So we feel we're very good position on that. And then the other one is the Long-Range Standoff missile for the Nuclear Triad which we have been heavily engaged and again another area where the government has down-selected to two contractors: one is Raytheon and one is a Lockheed. And we've already received like $900 million for our effort just to be in the competition and we've developed some great technologies. It's very highly classified program. So I can't really talk a lot about it, but it is very large dollar value moving forward. And so we're actively engaged in both of those programs on the missile side.","At IDS, the business that won the LTAMDS program, they have several radar programs that they're pursuing. And actually they just won a major one. We didn't really talk about it in our notes, but they won this called Solid State Module - Replacement win. Its value is up to about $2.3 billion, but it's to go back and replace and update all the way what's called the early-warning radars like PAVE PAWS and whatnot with new technology, GaN based radar technology.","And so we won that program and we'll be working with the Air Force to incrementally upgrade each one of their early warning radars over the next five to eight years. That's about a $2.3 billion win there. So there's just a ton of these new development programs out there. Our biggest job here is -- Toby and myself is to really look at that. And we have a very good process that we look at in terms of determining what we're going to go do relative to what we're going to go bid on because there's a tremendous amount of opportunities on it. We're looking at is the opportunity of strategic fit, do we have the core competencies to execute to that opportunity. And we talked a lot about margins.","We also look if we're going to get acceptable type margins out of the program. It's just a one-off program where it's all development and we essentially lead with one article and it has low margins. Several of those we haven't bid in the last couple years. And we've just let our competitors go off and develop systems that give low margins. And then the other one is do we have the right technical and cost discriminators, do we have the differentiators to go win. So we have a very well-defined process. All I can say is there's a lot of opportunities that were running through the process.","And we're having to make some pretty hard decisions here about what to pursue and not to pursue. It's a great time for the Company. We made the right bets back in 2004 relative to where we made some technology investments over the years and those technology investments have given us the differentiators and discriminates to better these next-generation capabilities that the Air Force, the Army, and the Navy need, and we're in a very great position to go after a lot of these opportunities.","Kelsey DeBriyn","Ditamara, we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Next response is from Peter Skibitski.","Peter Skibitski","Maybe your SAS kind of results and guidance already kind of addressed this, but how are you thinking about DOD's new space architecture that's kind of emerging and the opportunity set there, the market size, and as it relates to SAS?","Tom Kennedy","Well, it turns out, it relates to both SAS and IIS. IIS on the ground segment and SAS on the sensor side and also on part of that architecture, and we've been playing heavily into it. I think the area that has us very, very interested in because it's kind of new is the whole area of contested space and how that plays into this overall new space architecture. And as you can imagine, it's a new area. There's a lot of classified work. And if you look at SAS is probably the most classified business that we have and then you have IIS with I think the second the business with a lot of classified work in that area.","Toby O'Brien","And just to kind of put a wrapper around it for SAS. As we mentioned earlier, it's effectively neck and neck with IDS as our highest growing business this year. It's got the second highest margins. We're real pleased with what they've been doing, not only in space but in ISR as well. So they're having a real good year and positioned well to continue that into 2020.","Kelsey DeBriyn","That's all the time we have today. Thank you for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter conference call in January.","Operator","Thank you for calling us today. This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Candace and I'll be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kelsey DeBriyn, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Kelsey Ann DeBriyn - Raytheon Co.","Thank you, Candace. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our third quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slide will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.","With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby, and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Thank you, Kelsey. Good morning, everyone.","Raytheon once again delivered strong operating performance in the third quarter. Sales increased 8.3% and our bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow were all better than expected. We continue to see strong global demand for our advanced solutions. Book-to-bill in the third quarter was 1.28, driven equally by international and domestic. And, for the second time this year, we achieved record backlog, which rose to $41.6 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of nearly $5 billion year-over-year. Given this and the opportunities we see in the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our bookings outlook for the year by another $1 billion.","It's worth noting that since the beginning of this year, we have increased our bookings outlook by a total of $2 billion over our original expectation and we now expect a full-year book-to-bill ratio of over 1.1. We are pleased with our bookings performance this year, which positions us well for continued growth in 2019. Toby will discuss additional details about our initial 2019 outlook along with our third quarter performance and updates to guidance in a few minutes.","Given the growth of the DoD budget and upcoming competitions we see for advanced solutions, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our strategy to continuously innovate and refresh the technology in our current franchises and to use that expertise to create new franchises.","We try to be the disruptors of our own technology and make investments in order to keep our franchises relevant, so they continue to be value generators for decades to come. We demonstrated this in the innovative solutions we featured at AUSA earlier this month. First, we received positive feedback from our customer on the Lynx Infantry Fighting Vehicle. We are leveraging our strong international partnerships on Lynx just as we have done with our Naval Strike Missile and the NASAMS System. For this, we are collaborating with Rheinmetall on the Lynx vehicle to meet the U.S. Army's requirement for the next-generation combat vehicle.","Our global industry team will offer the Lynx paired with Raytheon's sensors, weapons and systems integration expertise to provide the army with a modern fighting vehicle that will keep U.S. soldiers far ahead of battlefield threats for decades to come.","Next, we featured our TOW system, which is the premier, long-range heavy assault, precision weapon system used throughout the world today. Raytheon and the U.S. Army have consistently upgraded TOW since it was first produced in 1970 to keep it relevant for today's fight and help our soldiers preserve their overmatched advantage on the battlefield.","Earlier this year, we were awarded a contract by the Army to develop a new propulsion system for the TOW missile. The improved system will increase range and deliver enhanced protection for ground troops while providing them with more capability. Also on display at AUSA was our upgraded Excalibur precision-guided projectile. This new variant, Excalibur Shaped Trajectory, or EST, represents a major leap forward in capability for this already advanced guided munition and enables soldiers to eliminate targets in hard-to-reach locations by offering a new angle of attack. In addition to EST, Raytheon has developed a laser-guided version in a five-inch sea-based variant of Excalibur.","The last product featured at AUSA, I'd like to highlight is our Stinger surface-to-air-missile. This missile has provided superior short-range air defense since the 1970s and has had many capability enhancements over the years. This combat-proven missile is deployed in more than 18 nations and with all the four U.S. military services. The latest update, the new proximity fuse enables the lightweight self-contained air defense system to destroy a wider array of battlefield threats including unmanned aircraft systems.","As we think about our franchises, we not only refresh the technology, we take the franchise international to broaden our marketplace. This has been our strategy with our combat proven Patriot franchise. During the quarter, we continue to make progress on international opportunities for Patriot.","In August, Sweden signed the LOA with the U.S. Government to purchase the Patriot integrated air missile defense system. As a result, Sweden became the 16th nation to rely on Patriot. The LOA paves the way for the U. S. Government to begin contract negotiations with Raytheon for booking in 2019.","Sweden Patriot opportunity for Raytheon is still expected to be around $1 billion and in September, we booked over $1.3 billion on our Phase I award with Poland to purchase Patriot. Under the Phase II award, Poland will purchase additional Patriot fire units and has expressed interest in our upgraded gallium nitride-based 360-degree AESA Radars. We still expect the Phase II booking for Poland Patriot in 2020 with a total Raytheon Poland Patriot opportunity to be around $5 billion.","For our Romania Patriot opportunity, our next booking is expected to be around $500 million in 2019. Additional follow-on awards to complete the program are expected to be booked in 2020 and 2021. We continue to see the total Raytheon Romania Patriot opportunity to be around $2 billion.","As you can see, nations want to protect their sovereignty and the demand signal for defense of systems like Patriot is strong and global. Collectively, these international Patriot bookings are worth around $8 billion and in addition, we see a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Patriot to upgrade to the latest configuration and 360-degree AESA Radar.","Turning to Cyber, this quarter we were awarded another multi-year contract with a new government customer in the MENA region to provide advance cybersecurity solutions and operational support. This adds to the strong cybersecurity portfolio we have at IIS, which includes our DOMino program for the Department of Homeland Security.","In the space domain, in early October, we were selected as one of two companies to compete for the opportunity to provide the mission payload for the next-generation overhead persistent infrared program. Next Gen OPIR is a new missile warning satellite system for the U.S. Air Force, aimed at countering emerging global threats. As part of the competition, we will complete the critical design review phase of our proposed payload.","Raytheon was selected based on its ability to meet stringent schedule, resiliency and technical capability requirements. We see space as an important market over the next several years.","Turning to Washington; we are pleased with the successful passage of the fiscal year 2019 Appropriations Bill for the Department of Defense, avoiding a continuing resolution for the first time in a decade. Modernization funding continue to be supported and aligned with Raytheon's core capabilities in areas such as radars, missiles, missile-defense and cybersecurity. The timely bill passage provides valuable stability and predictability which is beneficial for both our customers and our shareholders.","Let me close by thanking the members of the Raytheon team worldwide for another strong quarter. They are committed to providing the trusted innovative solutions our customers need and they are focused on the opportunities we have before us to finish the year strong and continue our growth into the years ahead.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Toby.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks starting with the third quarter highlights and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.","So everyone would please turn to page 3. We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the third quarter with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the third quarter of $8.7 billion resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.28.","Sales were $6.8 billion in the quarter, up 8.3% with growth across all of our businesses. Our EPS from continuing operations was $2.25, up 14.2%, which I'll give a little more color on in just a moment.","I'll discuss guidance further in a few minutes, but at a high level, we are updating our expected sales growth from the previous range of 5% to 7%, to a range of 6.5% to 7.5% and we are raising our full-year 2018 outlook for EPS as well as making other updates and as Tom mentioned earlier, we are raising our bookings outlook by $1 billion.","And although not on the slide, I want to point out that our operating cash flow in the third quarter was better than our prior expectations due to favorable collections on some of our larger contracts we previously expected in the fourth quarter.","Operating cash flow was lower than last year's third quarter as expected due to the previously announced $1.25 billion discretionary pension plan contribution we made in the third quarter 2018, partially offset by lower net cash taxes. Also during the quarter, the company repurchased just over 630,000 shares of common stock for $125 million bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 4.5 million shares for $925 million.","Turning now to page four. Let me start by providing some detail on our third quarter results. Company bookings continue to be strong. For the third quarter, bookings were $8.7 billion, which were approximately $1.7 billion or 25% higher than the same period last year. And on a year-to-date basis, bookings were $23.7 billion, which were $4.5 billion or 24% higher than the comparable period last year. As Tom mentioned, these strong bookings position the company well for continued growth in 2019. Backlog at the end of the third quarter was a record $41.6 billion, up $4.9 billion or 13.4% compared to last year's third quarter.","We now move to page five. Third quarter 2018 sales were higher than the guidance we set in July, primarily due to better-than-expected performance at our IIS business. Looking now at sales by business. IDS had third quarter 2018 net sales of $1.5 billion, up 7% compared with the same quarter last year. The increase from Q3, 2017 was primarily driven by higher sales on an international Patriot program that was awarded in the first quarter of 2018.","In the third quarter 2018, IIS had net sales of $1.7 billion. The 13% increase compared with Q3 2017 was primarily due to higher net sales on classified programs in both the cyber and space business areas; the DOMino cyber program and the Warfighter FOCUS program.","Missile Systems had third quarter 2018 net sales of $2.1 billion. The 7% increase from the third quarter 2017 was primarily driven by higher net sales on classified programs. In the third quarter 2018, SAS had net sales of $1.7 billion, up 6% compared with the same quarter last year. The increase from Q3, 2017 was primarily driven by higher sales on surveillance and targeting systems programs. Overall, we're pleased with our total company sales, which grew by over 8% in the quarter.","Moving ahead to page six; our operating margin in the quarter was 17.4% for the total company and 12.4% on a business segment basis, and as expected, lower than last year's third quarter, primarily due to mix and the timing of program improvements. Overall, the company continues to perform well.","So now looking at the business margins; IDS third quarter 2018 operating margin was strong at 16.1%, slightly lower than last year's third quarter, primarily due to higher productivity in Q3, 2017. The increase in operating margin at IIS in the quarter, compared with the same period last year, was primarily driven by higher net program improvements in this year's third quarter.","The decrease in margin at Missiles in the quarter compared with the same period last year was primarily driven by higher productivity improvements in Q3, 2017 and a change in program mix. As a reminder, Missiles third quarter 2017 results included large favorable adjustments on a couple of international contracts. SAS operating margin was largely in line with last year's third quarter and Forcepoint had positive operating income of $18 million in the third quarter 2018, with operating margin of 10.4%.","Additionally, I want to point out that our third quarter operating income was favorably impacted by $11 million for the actuarial update to our pension plans. I'll touch on this more in a minute.","Turning now to page 7; third quarter 2018 EPS was $2.25, better than expected, primarily driven by higher sales volume, the timing of productivity improvements, and other non-operational improvements. Third quarter 2018, EPS was higher than last year's third quarter, primarily driven by operational improvements from higher sales volume and lower taxes primarily associated with tax reform. This was partially offset by the unfavorable $0.80 EPS impact of the previously announced pension plan annuity transaction.","On page 8, as I mentioned earlier, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2018 to reflect the higher sales volumes that we are seeing offset by slight change in margin due to program mix that I'll discuss further in a few minutes. It's worth noting, this is the third time we have increased our sales and EPS guidance since January.","We have increased our full-year 2018 net sales and narrowed the range. We are raising the low end by $300 million and the high end by $100 million and we now expect net sales to be between $27 billion and $27.3 billion, up 6.5% to 7.5% from 2017. The increase versus our prior guidance is driven primarily by IIS.","As I just mentioned and as we have done in prior years, during the third quarter we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of this update the FAS\/CAS Operating Adjustment for the year improved by $14 million and the retirement benefits non-service expense for the year also improved by $14 million. Taken together, they had a favorable impact of approximately $0.08 per share, with $25 million or $0.07 per share recorded in the third quarter 2018 and $3 million or $0.01 per share expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018.","And as a reminder, the updated 2018 retirement benefits non-service expense includes the $288 million settlement charge for the third quarter pension plan annuity transaction. We are improving the range of our net interest expense by $15 million, which is worth about $0.03 to $0.04 to EPS compared to our prior guidance.","Turning to share count, we continue to see our average diluted shares outstanding at approximately 287 million shares for 2018, consistent with what we said in July, and we still see the effective tax rate for the full year to be approximately 10.5%. We've increased our full-year 2018 EPS, raising the low end by $0.24 and the high-end by $0.14 from our prior guidance. We now expect our EPS to be in the range of $10.01 to $10.11. We continue to see our 2018 operating cash flow outlook between $2.6 billion and $3 billion.","And on page nine, we've included guidance by business. We've increased the full-year sales outlook at IIS and for the total company. We've also increased the low end of the range at IDS and SAS to reflect the combination of stronger bookings performance to-date and fourth quarter expectations and at Missiles, we continue to see strong growth. We now see their full-year 2018 sales growth in the 8% to 9% range. We've updated the range due to the timing of international and domestic programs. Overall, we're pleased with the company's sales growth.","Turning to margins, both at the business segment and company level, we have updated margins to reflect the revised sales mix and related margin impact. Before moving on to page 10, as Tom mentioned earlier, given our year-to-date bookings strength and our expectation for a strong fourth quarter, we are now raising our full-year 2018 bookings outlook by $1 billion to a range of between $29.5 billion to $30.5 billion. The increase is driven by strong demand from our global customers and positions us well for continued growth in 2019.","On page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see the fourth quarter for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations. We expect our fourth quarter sales to be in a range of $7.3 billion to $7.6 billion, and EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in a range of $2.78 to $2.88. For modeling the fourth quarter EPS, we expect the effective tax rate to be about 17%. We expect operating cash flow to be in a range of $1.6 billion to $2 billion.","Now, turning to our initial outlook for 2019 on page 11; as we sit here today, we currently see the book-to-bill ratio above 1.0 and strong sales growth for 2019 of 6% to 8% over our 2018 outlook. We expect total business segment margin to be in line with 2018, our effective tax rate to be approximately 17% to 19% and our operating cash flow to continue to be strong in the range of $3.8 billion to $4 billion. This is our initial look at 2019, and as we have done in the past, we intend to provide detailed 2019 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January.","So if you could please move to page 12; we have provided a pension matrix for 2019. This chart indicates a range of possible outcomes based upon different 2018 asset return rates and discount rates that will be determined at year-end. Each box contains a possible outcome for the 2019 FAS\/CAS operating adjustment on the top left and the 2019 retirement benefits non-service expense non-operating on the bottom right.","As of September 30, 2018, the discount rate was around 4.25%, approximately 50 basis points higher than it was at the end of 2017, and our return on assets was roughly 2.5%. And just to be clear, the final discount rate and the actual asset returns won't be known until we close out 2018. We'll provide a more detailed pension outlook on our year-end call in January.","Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we continue to expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year and remain focused on deploying capital in ways that create value for our shareholders and customers while maintaining a strong balance sheet.","In summary, we had another strong quarter. Our bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow were all above our expectations. We remain well-positioned with both our domestic and international customers' priority areas, we increased our full-year 2018 outlook for bookings and EPS, increased the sales growth range to 6.5% to 7.5% and have a strong foundation for continued growth in 2019.","With that, Tom and I will open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Jon Raviv of Citi. Your line is now open.","Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Jon.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","In January, you guys issued some cumulative cash flow targets that implied or that talked about $7 billion to $8 billion in 2019 and 2020. Can you talk about some of the building blocks going from this year to next, given the operating cash flow guide in 2019? It just seems that since that January target was issued, sales are clearly better. So I'm just curious, what some of the changes are, and if you could also mention CapEx in the next year as well, that would be helpful too. Thank you.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, Jon, it's Toby. Let me take a crack at that. So you're right, we had talked about a $7 billion to $8 billion range over the next couple years. Since that time, we made a discretionary pension contribution that we talked about improving cash flow all else equal of about $1 billion over the 2019 to 2020 period. Our operating cash flow outlook for 2019, that I mentioned earlier in the $3.8 billion to $4 billion range is in line with that original range in additional pension benefits. So, things are continuing to track as we would expect there.","A little bit more color. We do expect to see some higher cash from operations, and pension as I just alluded to, but there is going to be a partial offset with higher cash taxes, if you want to think of it certainly compared to 2018. And then from a CapEx perspective, think of it for 2018 maybe slightly increased as a percentage of sales, 3% to 4%, as we continue to invest in the business compared to in the roughly 3% range that we are seeing for 2018.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Hey, Rob.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","On the margins for next year, given the higher sales, is there no opportunity for leverage there? Maybe you could talk about the upward and downward pressure on that; or are you simply being conservative? Is it mix, is it labor tightness or conservatism?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, Rob, let me take a crack at that. So, as we said, this is our initial look at 2019, and we did say in \u2013 margins in line next year with what we're seeing this year at the segment level. As we discussed before, the margins can be impacted by the timing of risk retirements as well as mix, especially as we start up new programs and \u2013 including development programs at lower margins. We are continuously focused on margins and we'll continue to do so through the balance of this year into 2019.","I think if you want a little bit of color on the mixed side of things, right now for the current mix we see is roughly 60% from fixed price contracts. Again, we've talked a lot about the mix that we're seeing in development versus production cost type versus fixed price higher classified and CRAD sales. I just mentioned \u2013 and not new news, but when we start programs up, we start them up at a lower-margin rate until we get to a point where we're comfortable that we can retire risk and move on the margins.","That said, as I mentioned, we're still in the planning process for 2019. There are these factors that are influencing margins. We see improvements in some areas right. So we got some puts and takes, but overall, we're pleased with the margin performance. We're early in our process and we're always focused on trying to improve our margins.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Harned of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Hi, Doug.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Morning Doug.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","On Missile Systems, you've had a couple of years here where you've had very strong growth in backlogs. You're continuing to get that and \u2013 can you talk a little bit about what's going on there? Obviously you've had some wins, but we are looking at, you took guidance down some on revenues and on margins for Missile Systems this year. What's the flow here? How should we look at this over the next year or so in terms of revenue and margins?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. Doug, I'll start here and I'll give you a little bit of color on what we did here relative to the outlook for this year. As far as sales go, we see a couple of changes from our prior guidance. We have been expecting an international order for production program that would have had a favorable impact on sales by \u2013 including by liquidating some inventory in the fourth quarter. The timing of that award has moved out of the year.","We also see a shift in the ramp-up on a couple domestic backlog programs that's moved into 2019. Overall, we're still growing at 8% to 9% and that's on top of 10% growth last year. So we're pleased with what Missiles is doing and how they're growing.","Relative to the margin, when you look at their year-to-date performance and we've discussed this on prior calls, we are seeing an increase in new development programs, right. Higher CRAD, higher classified work, and they all bode well for the future, but they have impacted margins in the short term and additionally, the latter \u2013 later timing of the international program award I just mentioned, impacts the mix in Q4 which has also impacted their margins.","We do expect margins at Missiles to improve in Q4 and in 13 \u2013 low- to mid-13% close to 14% range, really driven by the timing of potential program efficiencies. As far as 2019 \u2013 I'm not going to get into 2019 at this point, but I will say, as we said before, as I just mentioned what Rob talked, we continue to focus on margins in the business.","We continue to make capital investments to improve our productivity, especially in the factories and always look for ways to be more efficient to try to offset the impacts of mix. So, overall we expect to deliver solid margins next year on good growth and we'll be more specific as we get to January.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Hey Doug, its Tom. Just one thing to add relative to Missiles, which is a big plus for us, is the fiscal year 2019 budget had the funding in it for multi-years so we're not just one other franchises but for two. So it's a multi-year \u2013 five-year multiyear for SM-6 and then also another five-year multi-year for SM-3. So it's pretty clear for us, because that does give us insight into the factory and stability there for about eight years. So, again, five year is the last option awarded to carry out three, giving us eight years of factory stability. And the bottom line is, we see missiles as being a very healthy business for us here out in the future.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Rob.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Hi, Rob.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Tom, obviously, some issues in the Middle East at the moment and specifically Saudi Arabia; given your experience of the region, I was wondering if you could give us your perspectives on what could happen here and whether there could be any negative ramifications for your business?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. I'll start it off and then Toby, obviously, this is something that we've been watching very carefully, but as you know, and I think as you kind of alluded to upfront, we have supported the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in securing defense for more than 50 years and through that course of time, we have seen issues that have occurred at different periods of uncertainty. And we've always resolved them through the end and by doing this one thing, it's actually following the direction and position of the U.S. administration, which were right behind in making sure that we understand where they are going and that we're locked in step behind them.","Also our business and just to remind everyone, is not dependent on any one customer or one program or one franchise. We are a global company providing technology and security solutions for over 80 countries and we have numerous global franchises. So I'm pretty confident that we will weather this complexity, mainly it's kind of a geopolitical environment we have right now and then working through that. That said, we have looked at things and Toby can kind of give you some of the financial details of what this potentially could mean to us moving forward.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yes, so just given the events, to give you a little bit of color and sight to how we're thinking about Saudi; sitting here today, as Tom mentioned, we continue to be aligned with the administration's policies and we plan to honor our commitments. We don't usually get into customer-specific financials, but again, given all the events of late, I will tell you that our Saudi business represents nearly 5% of our year-to-date 2018 revenue. And looking ahead, we see it flattish year-over-year in 2019. This includes our backlog for both defensive and offensive weapons, as well as services and support programs.","As far as any new orders, we have an assumption in the fourth quarter of 2018 for a couple of follow-on support contracts and next year we have a major award assumed for the TPY-2 Radar program, which, as all of our bookings are, is factored. And as Tom said, and just to reinforce it as a reminder, our sales aren't dependent on any one contract or foreign country specifically, and again, it just goes to show the strength of our diverse portfolio. But that's a little color on how we're thinking of Saudi based on what we know today.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Your line is now open.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Tom, I just wanted to follow-up...","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, George.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","...a little bit with Doug's question on Missiles. I mean, if I compare your growth rate in Missiles this year, I mean you've kind of down-picked it through the year. Lockheed will have a faster growth rate and has upticked it. It's not directly comparable; I mean, they have Patriot and air missiles, you have it in IDS, but is there any competitive issues that you've lost that would suggest why they are raising their forecast while yours are coming down in that area?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","George, we don't \u2013 I don't see any issue there. I mean, we all started from different points. We've been on a ride here since 2015 with increases and actually have accelerated growth through that business here since that time. So we're very happy with where we're at relative to Missiles and where we are going. We just had a big \u2013 several being wins here. One is the Naval Strike Missile which will be a replacement to the Harpoon missile, which we believe is close to about an $8-billion franchise program and several others like that.","We are heavily participating in the hypersonic new missile work that's going on with DARPA with two programs, one is the HAWC and the other one is the TBG, Tactical Boost Glide. And we're also participating on the Army programs. The PRSM precision strike weapon which is replacement to ATAC, I know all of these are upside to us because we didn't have the Harpoon before and we didn't have the ATacMS before. So, we feel we're very competitive and then even on hypersonics, there's a whole other area nobody seems to be talking about, which is the counter-hypersonics, which we're heavily engaged in.","A lot of this activity is classified, so I can't go into a lot of details, but we're very positive about the missile company and its growth moving out here in the next several years.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","And George, I would just add on the financial side of it, the revised outlook, it's in line with where we started the year out with the original guide for missiles and I mentioned when \u2013 on Doug's question we did have an international order move out of the year where we would have had some inventory liquidation. That's the major driver for the change in the revenue guidance and that was not competitive, that was a sole-source order \u2013 it's a timing issue.","And I'd also tell you, quantitatively we've talked about before how the company \u2013 at the company level, we see our competitive win rate in the 70% range plus or minus. I'll tell you, Missiles is above that based on a year-to-date basis this year. So, really just timing is the way to think of it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Your line is now open.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Hey, good morning gentlemen.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Hey Carter.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Nice win last night, those Dodgers knocked my Braves out, so I'm counting on you guys.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","We are trying.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","We're going to be going to some warmer weather, so we'll see how that plays out.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Well, that's not in your favor, but hopefully you'll pull it out. Look I just wanted to talk about the, sort of, news of yesterday and the whole bidding environment, and obviously, the opportunity pipeline for everyone looks a little bit more robust, but we're seeing different levels of sort of strategic aggression, if you will, in terms of going after stuff that people deem vital to their franchise.","I just wonder maybe Tom, if you could kind of walk us through your thought process on what that means for you guys in terms of IRAD investment, cost structure, just in general, how you compete in that kind of environment?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yes, thanks for the question, Carter. Let me start with \u2013 first of all, Raytheon is not a platform company, and instead our innovative solutions and our franchise is across multiple platforms. So, I think that helps us relative to some of the rhetoric that you heard yesterday bouncing around.","So, we have not really seen those kind of impacts relative to our competitions', so it hasn't really been meaningful to us. But in the endgame, we feel that when the contracting environment is such that we have a level playing field, we do quite well and as Toby just mentioned a while ago, our win rates are in the 70% across the board for the company. So, we feel we're doing a very good job relative to winning new competitive business.","And the other element is we take that competitive business to the international marketplace relative to expanding these franchises globally, which has helped us out quite a bit. All that said, price is important and it's important to our customer, so we have to be cost-effective. So, one of the things that we have been doing is using our technology and technology we've been developing and bringing to these competitions, not just to enhance the performance of our solution, but also to take out the cost significantly.","And so we've been looking at cost on day one of every one of these competitions to figure out our overall strategy; who we're going to go team with, what type of technologies we're going to bring to the game, what we're going to have to do in our factories to get cost out, and I think the work that we have been doing seems to be paying off. And again, you have to look at our results, and our results are our win rates.","So we are very comfortable and now at the same time, we do understand that folks will do a return on investment relative to some of these major franchise programs, and we'll do long ball relative to those and try to determine what makes sense for them and where they can expand these franchises, both globally, and do a lateral exploitation of them into potentially other solutions for the customers. I will tell you we do that on a daily basis here and that's why we have a franchise strategy and we look \u2013 I think that's one of the reasons why our win rates are so high in this market.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","And I think just real quick relative to the investment, I mentioned CapEx on Jon's question for next year; from an R&D point of view, think of it similar to where we are this year, around 3% of sales.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Seth.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Tom, maybe just a follow-up on that last question from a little bit of a different angle, you mention Raytheon as not being a platform company and we just got news within the last couple of weeks and that Harris and L3 are planning to merge creating a more sizable defense contractor that also is kind of more not a platform company. Does that have any impact on the way that you view the competitive landscape and the way that you think about deploying cash?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Well, first of all, we don't see a direct impact relative to the merger of the two companies, L3 and Harris. We \u2013 turns out they are not our main competitors across our markets. We do run into them on certain competitions and we are definitely pleased with the portfolio of advanced solutions we have. We have been investing significantly here since about 2014. That was our roadmap that we laid out for our investors that we said that we were going to grow the company and we have been doing that year-over-year. So we essentially have accelerated growth through that time span. And again, I think those investments have been paying off relative to the competitions that we have been in and that's what's leading to this greater than 70% competitive win rate moving forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Hi. Good morning, Sam.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I wanted to go back and just look at the margin again. You talk about 2019 is overall flat and you have now reduced 2018 a little bit; so in terms of where you were after last quarter, it's a little bit down, but can you just talk directionally about the different segments where they may be up, where they may be down, because what you just said about Missile Systems would imply that that should be up. Last quarter there was a contractual matter that moved out of the year and now this other piece. So wouldn't that \u2013 that should be pushing Missile Systems at least up. So I am trying to just think about what might be down.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yes, Sam, so we are not going to give specific detail by business for 2019 really just because we are early on in the process. What I can tell you, to give you a little bit of color, we do see most of the business margins in line with 2018 and I'm just going to leave it at that for now and we'll go into the segment-by-segment detail and year-over-year flux on the January call.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Arment of Baird. Your line is now open.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Tom, Toby.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Hi, Peter.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, Tom, question I guess on the budget. It's nice to see the 2019 budget coming in on time; can't remember when the last one was on time, but thinking about 2020, there's been a lot of discussions around kind of a flatterer top line. Potentially, I assume investment accounts are more inflation oriented; how do you see that kind of the Raytheon portfolio setting up? You've obviously had a lot of wins and you're gaining share, but just maybe some commentary on that.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Let me just lay things out here. It's a great, great question. First of all, there was this \u2013 the administration talking about a potential 5% cut to the fiscal year 2020 budgets. Many of the agencies are in 5% cut from fiscal year 2019 and there's been some further discussions out there, some other information that says it's really for the defense budget. It's really they're looking at potentially 2.5% cut.","Now that was off of a number that included OCO so we're not positive; some of the 2.5% or majority of them could come right out of OCO and then \u2013 therefore have zero impact, but even if it's full 2.5% against the fiscal year 2019 budget, what that will do is take it back to the fiscal year 2018 budget and if you remember, the fiscal year 2018 budget was 19% increase over the fiscal year 2017 budget. So bottom-line, the fiscal 2018 pretty healthy Defense budget.","So we're on \u2013 based on the award that we received \u2013 will be receiving in 2018 and also 2019, we feel that we'll be in a really great shape for fiscal year 2020 and that's one of the reasons why we have given a fairly leading-forward guidance relative to revenue growth in 2020 \u2013 in 2019; 6% to 8% growth.","And so bottom line is, we think the budget process is right in the line where we need it to be, and we obviously will be watching on a day-to-day basis. The other one, I just mentioned earlier, which is helps us relative to some stability here over the next several years is the multi-year awards on SM-6 and then also on the SM-3 five-year multi-years on both of those taking us out giving us the stability in the factory for about eight years.","And bottom-line is that we still have a long process to go on a fiscal year 2020 budget before it's finalized. Congress has to weigh in on the Defense level standings and then \u2013 but do remember, the Congress did provide increases significantly above the Trump administration's request for the DoD top-line at fiscal year 2018 and a DoD modernization budget in fiscal year 2019.","So bottom line is it's not over until it's over. We got to go through a long process, but right now we believe that we are at a \u2013 even at the minimum, we're in a very good position moving forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Cai, your line is now open.","Kelsey Ann DeBriyn - Raytheon Co.","Cai, are you there? Cai, are you on mute?","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Excuse me...","Kelsey Ann DeBriyn - Raytheon Co.","Let's move to the next...","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","I was on...","Kelsey Ann DeBriyn - Raytheon Co.","There you are.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","So you've raised your bookings target by $1 billion for this year and look for book-to-bill over 1.0 next year; could you comment on the relative book-to-bill between foreign and domestic, both this year and kind of the trends going into next year?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. So Cai, for this year, based upon the $1-billion increase, the book-to-bill for both domestic, foreign and the total company are kind of sort of in the same ballpark. I think around 1.1 plus or minus is just a coincidence. Tom mentioned even in the quarter, we have 1.28 and that was \u2013 1.28 domestically and internationally. So, right around 1.1 for both the domestic, foreign and total company.","As far as next year, I think at this level, just at a high level we expect to see continued growth both domestically and internationally, and will quantify that more in January.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Morning, gentlemen.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Hi, Rajeev.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Tom, Toby, you touched on this a little bit before, but just on the under-levered balance sheet, I mean, with the sell-off that we've seen in the stock and maybe a declining number of M&A opportunities out there, is that pushing you to maybe change your stance maybe a bit more front-footed versus what we've seen over the last year or so?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Well, I will hit that real quick. Bottom line is, we are committed to a balance capital development strategy and you can see that we are continuing to investment in our selves; those investments are paying off and our win rates on competitive \u2013 we believe that's the right thing to continue to grow our top lines as you're making \u2013 continuing with those investment and obviously we're also supporting the pension and our dividend and ensuring we do drive total shareholders return relative to this capital deployment strategy that we have in place.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, I'll just add, I mean I wouldn't expect to see any dramatic shift or reallocation of capital around the framework, or within the framework Tom talked about. We do see value in our stock clearly and we are committed in \u2013 over time to continue to reduce our share count. The guidance we have for this year is about 1.5% reduction year-over-year and then \u2013 and again in January we'll give you some insight on to how we are thinking about the total aspect of capital deployment for 2019.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Myles Walton of UBS. Your line is now open.","Myles Alexander Walton - UBS","Thanks. One confirmation and then one question; so on the confirmation, Toby, is it 2019 and 2020 look still \u2013 or it's combined now, it's $8 billion to $9 billion of operating cash flow, and then secondly, on IIS, Tom or Toby, the IIS number look increasingly better. I'm just curious, is Warfighter FOCUS becoming less and less of a headwind? You mentioned some of the uppers, but I mean it's a short cycle business. Are you just seeing that short cycle business come through a lot quicker than I would have otherwise thought?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yes, Miles, let me take that one first. The Warfighter FOCUS is \u2013 bottom line is that program is rolling off a lot slower than we initially anticipated and we are picking up other similar work, both domestically and internationally, to fill the hole for Warfighter FOCUS. So bottom line is that team is been very successful with that but they've also been very successful in winning other awards and bringing other business on board. Competitive win rates are very high and they're actually making quite a bit of progress on the international front relative to their international cyber work. They just won a major deal in Oman, and so the business is doing really well.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. So I think \u2013 you're right on the cash, Myles, just to confirm, how you characterize the cash is correct.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Thank you, and good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Hi, Sheila.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Just touch upon (54:32) for a minute. There was an improvement in the quarter on a sequential basis. The performance overall has been weaker than expected. Maybe can you talk about what's going on in that business at the moment, and how you think about potential optimality from here?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. I think relative to Q3 in the quarter \u2013 let me start with bookings. There was 13% year-over-year growth and if you remember, they had a 29% year-over-year improvement in Q2, so the trend there is positive and encouraging. The Q3 sales growth was a little lower than our expectations, however, the team did do a good job in controlling cost in the quarter. And we were pleased with the return to profitability that you alluded to in Q3, with margins in line with our expectations.","Looking forward to Q4, we do expect to see continued bookings growth about in line with Q3's growth rate. We do expect stronger sales growth and another quarter of positive operating profit and margins about in line with Q3, 9%-10% give or take from that perspective there. As far as the optionality, everything remains in play. As we've talked about in the past, we did go into the commercial cyber business to unlock trapped value in the company, and over time, we expect to do that and all options are out there that we will consider at the right time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Richard Safran of Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Tom, Toby, Kelsey, good morning. How are you?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Rich. How you're doing?","Kelsey Ann DeBriyn - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Lot has been asked, so I wanted to just talk to you about productivity for a second if I could. Tom, Toby, I know you've been talking about productivity improvements for quite some time, and I wanted to get a sense from you about how much runway you think you have left here with productivity improvement initiatives? To the extent you can discuss it, could you talk about how productivity is factored into your 2019 margin guide, and if improvements are still having a meaningful impact?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, Rich. I mean, as I mentioned earlier and we do all the time, we're always looking for different ways to improve our productivity through capital investment, through initiatives to our supply chain, utilizing Six Sigma, more from an automation point of view, we talked about our shared services that we stood up several years back that we continue to try to maximize the benefit from there.","We continue to see productivity. We've got assumptions in the 2019 numbers that we talked about earlier and the way to think about it, we're getting more productivity and it's needed because right now when we set margins in line, we are seeing the headwinds from the mix within the business and that improved productivity is helping to mitigate the impact from a margin point of view of the improved mix \u2013 the negative mix from a margin point of view.","Kelsey Ann DeBriyn - Raytheon Co.","That's all the time we have today.

My name is Chantile and I will be your facilitator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Todd B. Ernst","Thank you, Chantile. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our first quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website.","With me today are Bill Swanson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dave Wajsgras, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Bill and Dave, and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filing.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill?","William H. Swanson","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our first quarter results, I wanted to say a few words about last week's tragedy at the Boston Marathon. Monday, April 15, wasn't just the day of the marathon, it was the day we celebrated Patriots' Day in Massachusetts. A holiday commemorating the first battles of the American Revolution in 1775 and made famous by the ride of Paul Revere. It's a day of immense civic pride and community, and the spirit and energy that pervade its many annual events are a unique part of what it is to be from Boston and Massachusetts. Raytheon's been part of this community here since our founding over 90 years ago. While our offices and operations were not impacted, we have more than 12,000 employees in the state, including some who participated in the Boston Marathon as runners, volunteers and spectators. In fact, one of our local employees was at the finish line and seriously injured in the attack. So for us, this hit very close to home. Our thoughts and prayers are with all the victims and their families and all of those who were affected.","I would like to thank the first responders for their swift and heroic efforts that saved many lives. I also want to thank our hospitals and medical professionals for their truly amazing work. The Boston area is blessed with some of the world's best hospitals, and this has never been more evident than the past few days. We are proud of Boston's Mayor Menino, Governor Patrick, local and state officials, as well as federal government for their leadership and efforts in the aftermath of this incident.","The events of last week had a profound impact on our state. But they brought out the best in our community. From our local leadership to our first responders, from the hundreds of volunteers to the thousands of people who have donated funding to the victims. We've never been prouder to call Massachusetts home.","Now turning to our first quarter performance.","I'm pleased to report that Raytheon had another good quarter, with sales, margin, EPS and cash flow all above our expectations. The Raytheon team delivered solid results during the quarter, continuing to lower our costs and improve our agility, as well as providing affordable solutions for our customers.","International continues to be a key differentiator for the company. In the first quarter, our international business represented 26% of our total sales. And after the close of the quarter, we announced that the Republic of Korea selected Raytheon's Advanced Combat Radar or RACR to modernize its fleet of F-16s. We expect a booking in the last half of this year. This is a key competitive win and a meaningful validation of our international strategy, as well as a confirmation of our leadership in AESA technology. Importantly, this win opens new opportunities domestically and international for our AESA products.","Our portfolio of international opportunities remains robust and includes Kuwait Patriot, the Oman ground-based air defense system, the Qatar [ph] air defense system, Air Traffic Management, as well as radars and missiles. We are making considerable progress on these opportunities.","With the evolving threat environment and our customers' desire to acquire the most advanced technologies in the world, we remain confident that international will continue to be strong for Raytheon.","The domestic market continues to evolve as well. We were encouraged by the passage of the fiscal '13 defense budget, as it averted a potentially harmful year-long CR and afforded our customers more flexibility. New starts such as Space Fence and Air and Missile Defense Radar, AMDR, for example, are important new opportunities for the company and will provide more advanced capabilities for our customers.","On April 10, the fiscal year '14 defense budget request was released. While it did not comply with sequestration and is likely to undergo modification over the coming months, it was a clear statement of DOD's priorities. The focus continues to be on rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific region and our key mission areas such as missile defense, EW and cyber, which play to our strengths. In addition, as a technology company with a broad program base, we benefit considerably from funding areas such as science and technology portion of the budget. And this area fared well in the fiscal year '14 budget request. We focus on growing small science and technology awards into substantial capabilities for our customers over time. This is another important strength of the company.","In a couple of minutes, Dave will talk about our updated guidance that now includes the effect of sequestration, which is consistent with the 1% to 2% impact on sales that we discussed on the January call. Importantly, we've raised both our earnings per share and our cash flow outlook for the year.","Over the past 10 years, we've been on a clear path to implement world-class processes and continuously improve our operation. We're pressing forward with a number of initiatives. In January, we established our Global Business Services group. GBS has given us the ability to more quickly integrate and streamline our processes and procedures across the company. Additionally, GBS is leveraging our innovative approach to common systems that enhance our working capital and operating profit performance. They are on track to deliver planned productivity savings for 2013.","I'd like to take a moment and mention our March 25 announcement regarding consolidation. The move is just another step on our path of continuous improvement. While our businesses have always collaborated to provide the best solutions for the customer, now we're aligned even better with our needs in future markets. It provides greater synergy within our products and services, and most of all, increases our speed in responding to our customers' future needs. For example, we're moving the Command and Control business to IDS. What we've seen are more of our international customers wanting an integrated solution, and given IDS' strong international presence, it's a natural fit. In addition, we're moving our commercial product lines -- or excuse me, our communications product lines to SAS, which has considerable expertise in the RF spectrum with its suite of radars.","For those of us who work in this area, our advanced radars have the ability to handle multiple functions, such as EW, radar and communications. We see the day when an AESA radar is just a multifunctional sensor.","Regarding our Land Combat Systems, we're moving our ground-based EO\/IR sensors to our missile business. This will allow us to maximize integration of the ground sensor with the missile. This combination consolidates the 2 capabilities and allows us to offer integrated solutions to our customers rather than individual products.","Lastly, we combined IIS and RTSC to leverage the synergies they share in providing services to our customers. This new business is structured to perform in a more competitive environment and better serve our customers going forward. To help implement and manage these initiatives, along with the day-to-day operating activities, we have established a new position, Chief Operating Officer, and named Tom Kennedy to that position, which was effective April 1. Many of you know Tom from his most recent position as President of Raytheon's Integrated Defense Systems where he delivered outstanding operating results. Tom's leadership skills and deep understanding of our technologies, our customers and our global markets, make him well qualified to fill this new important role.","Before concluding, I'd like to point out that during the first quarter, we announced a 10% increase in our dividend per share. This marks the ninth consecutive year we've raised the dividend. It remains an important component of our balanced capital deployment strategy and a reflection of the confidence in the financial strength and outlook for the company.","In conclusion, I want to say how proud I am of the Raytheon team. In a challenging environment, their dedication and hard work have made it possible for the company to deliver these solid results and provide for the continued success of our customers. With that, let me turn it over to Dave.","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks starting with the first quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I will be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. So if everyone would please turn to Page 3.","We're pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the first quarter. Our adjusted EPS of $1.56 was up 5%, and EPS from continuing operations of $1.49 was up 12%.","Adjusted operating margin was 13.2%, up 10 basis points compared to last year's first quarter.","Sales of $5.9 billion were roughly in line with last year's first quarter and exceeded the high end of our expectations, which I'll discuss further in just a moment.","Operating cash flow from continuing operations of $422 million was also better than our prior guidance, the result of working capital.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 4.2 million shares of common stock for $225 million.","We have updated our full year 2013 guidance, which I'll discuss in more detail in a few minutes.","As previously announced, effective April 1, 2013, the company's structure was consolidated from 6 businesses to 4. The company will report its financial results consistent with the new structure in the second quarter.","Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some color on our first quarter results.","Our total company bookings for the quarter were $3.6 billion, in line with our internal plans. As you may recall, we had strong bookings in the back half of 2012, so on a trailing 4-quarter basis, the book-to-bill is about 1.02. As I mentioned on the January call, we continue to see the order book back-end loaded for 2013 ramping up in mid-year, similar to 2012. From a cadence standpoint, we expect the book-to-bill ratio to expand as we move through the year.","Notable bookings in the first quarter included $208 million at IDS to provide Patriot air missile defense capability for an international customer, and $160 million to provide Patriot engineering services for the U.S. and international customers.","Missile Systems booked $156 million for the production of rolling airframe missiles for the German Navy and $85 million on MALD, a decoy program for the U.S. Air Force. NCS booked $126 million on the Wide Area Augmentation System program for the FAA.","Space and Airborne Systems booked $90 million for the production of AESA radars for the U.S. Air Force.","Technical Services booked $135 million for foreign training and $64 million for domestic training in support of the Warfighter FOCUS Program. In addition, IIS and SAS booked $266 million and $184 million, respectively, on a number of classified contracts.","Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $33.5 billion compared to $36.2 billion at the end of 2012. It's worth noting that approximately 36% of our backlog is comprised of international programs.","If you'd now move to Page 5.","Sales were essentially flat compared to the first quarter of 2012 and ahead of our first quarter guidance that we set in January. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2013 had 1 less workday than the first quarter of 2012, and this equates to about $100 million in sales.","Our domestic business declined by about 2%, partially offset by our international business, which grew approximately 2%.","Looking at sales by business.  All of our businesses had net sales that were at or above our expectations. IDS had first quarter 2000 (sic) [2013] net sales of $1.3 billion, an increase of 4% on a year-over-year basis. The increase was primarily due to higher sales on a TPY-2 radar program for an international customer.","Missile Systems had first quarter 2013 net sales of $1.5 billion, 8% -- up 8% from the comparable period last year. The increase from prior year was primarily due to higher sales on the SM-3 and Rolling Airframe Missile programs.","IIS had net sales of $743 million and SAS had net sales of $1.2 billion, both slightly lower than the same period last year, primarily due to the timing of classified programs.","NCS had first quarter 2013 net sales of $931 million. The expected decline in net sales was primarily driven by U.S. Army production programs.","And Technical Services had net sales of $755 million, down from the comparable period a year ago as a result of completing the Polar contract in the first quarter of last year.","Now moving ahead to Page 6. We're pleased by our overall company margins, once again showing a year-over-year increase driven by operational performance. Our adjusted margin was up 10 basis points to 13.2%. Our focus on execution, productivity and efficiency continues to be reflected in our financial results.","So looking at the business margins. IDS and SAS margins were up in the quarter compared with the same period last year. Solid overall program performance drove improvements at both businesses, as well as favorable mix. 13.3% margins at our Missiles business was in line with last year's first quarter. At NCS, the change in operating margin in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first quarter of 2012 was driven by higher volume and net production efficiencies last year primarily on U.S. Army programs. And IIS and Technical Services margins were down slightly compared to the same period last year.","I'd like to take a moment to highlight our ongoing cost reduction initiatives in a little more detail. We continue to move forward with a number of initiatives that are designed to improve efficiencies, streamline our operations and lower our costs. One of the earlier initiatives which I've spoken about on prior calls is strategic sourcing across our supply chain. About half of our spend is on materials and subcontracting, and since implementing this strategy, we've generated hundreds of millions of dollars in savings, much of which we've passed along to our customers. Additionally, over the last 2 years, we've driven well in excess of $500 million of indirect costs out of the business, including efficiencies in indirect labor, reduced travel, lower IT spending and reduced outside services.","We have also been aggressive with our core facility consolidation efforts. From 2009 to 2012, we have reduced our total core square footage before acquisitions by approximately 1.5 million square feet. Looking ahead, we are targeting an additional 5% to 10% reduction in our existing floor space over a 3- to 5-year period.","More recently, on January 17, we announced the formation of Global Business Services where we consolidated our shared services functions across the company. This is also expected to drive significant efficiencies over the next several years.","And the next step in our ongoing effort to further optimize our operations is to finalize the consolidation of our 6 businesses to 4. These are not isolated actions. Rather, they're part of a comprehensive plan to drive productivity across the company, and we are not done. These efforts are all working to drive increased affordability for our customers, and importantly, they benefit our shareholders as well by increasing our competitiveness and protecting or enhancing our financial returns.","If you'd move to Page 7.","First quarter 2013 adjusted EPS was $1.56, up 5%. Although the increase was primarily driven by capital deployment actions, specifically share repurchases, we continue to drive strong operating performance, which is reflected in our improved margins quarter-over-quarter. And EPS from continuing operations of $1.49 was up 12%, which includes the benefit of the full year 2012 R&D tax credit, as well as the first quarter impact of the 2013 credit.","If you would turn to Page 8, I'd like to briefly comment on our updated outlook for 2013, which now reflects our solid first quarter results, as well as our current expectations for the impact of sequestration. Although not on the page, in January, we mentioned our bookings outlook for 2013 was in the range of $24 billion plus or minus $500 million. And now, with sequestration, we see the outlook for the year in the range of $23.5 billion plus or minus $500 million. We now see full year 2013 net sales to be in the range of between $23.2 billion and $23.7 billion.  The change of our sales outlook is consistent with the additional 1% to 2% estimated impact from sequestration that we discussed on the last earnings call in January.","We have raised our full year 2013 EPS guidance by $0.10 to a range of between $5.26 and $5.41, and on an adjusted basis, to a range of between $5.75 and $5.90. I'd like to point out that the impact from lower expected sales volume for the balance of the year due to sequestration is more than offset by the solid results we achieved in the first quarter.","We repurchased 4.2 million shares of common stock for $225 million in the quarter. We continue to see our diluted share count to be in the range of between 324 million and 327 million shares for 2013.","As I mentioned earlier, we generated strong operating cash flow in the quarter. As a result, we've increased our 2013 guidance for operating cash flow from continuing operations by $100 million, and is now between $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion.","And as you can see on Page 9, we've included the change in our guidance by business. The increase in margin guidance reflects the results from our continued efforts on productivity and efficiency initiatives, as well as from our strong overall program execution. Importantly, we continue to pass back substantial savings to our customers.","On Page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations for the balance of this year.","In summary, we saw good performance in the first quarter compared to both Q1 2012 and also the initial outlook for Q1 2013 that we provided in January. While the environment remains challenging, we continue to execute well, driving solid operating performance.","We're in a good financial position with net debt of just over $700 million. We raised our dividend 10% in the first quarter, and are raising our EPS and cash flow guidance for 2013.  We remain well positioned with our domestic customers' priority areas and are well aligned with the evolving priorities of our global customers. And we'll continue to drive the business to maximize value for all of our customers and our shareholders.","With that, Bill and I will take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joe Nadol of JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'd like to drill down into the bookings a little bit and really focus on domestic. Of course, the international always bounce around and are usually strong at the end of the year. But in just in looking at the last 5 years of data at least, I don't see a quarter with below $5 billion of total bookings. Obviously, you're well below that level. And I heard what you said about the ramp-up throughout the year. I guess, really, the question is what gives you the confidence, given that sequester just happened, that you're going to see that sequential ramp on the domestic side?","David C. Wajsgras","Joe, bookings were always planned to ramp up throughout the year, and Q1 actually played out a little bit better than what we were expecting. We discussed on the January call that we had about $1 billion come in to last year's fourth quarter, particularly in Missiles and our Missile Defense businesses. So as I just said a moment ago, we do expect the cadence of both domestic and international bookings to increase throughout the year. If you look at the last 6 months, given some of this timing, our quarterly bookings averaged about $5.7 billion, and over the trailing 4-quarter basis, it was about $1.02 billion. The cadence for this year is not dramatically different from what we saw last year. I think with that, Bill may want to add a couple of things.","William H. Swanson","Yes. Joe, I think the easiest way is to go through our businesses. And IDS expects about half of their business to be international and those will be dominated by the Patriot awards. We've got Kuwait that's finished the -- all the military reviews and has gone over to their parliament for final signature, so we kind of see that in maybe the latter half of Q2, early part of Q3, we can touch it, not an issue. A little over $500 million. Decision in Turkey probably in Q2, award latter half of this year. At Qatar, [ph] also late this year, and that could be a couple billion. We see Oman. Oman has turned out nice for us. They've already placed an order for AMRAAM. So we see that tying together all the aero defense work there. And domestically, for them, they've got naval radars, some Aegis work and Zumwalt, and then missile defense work, and of course, as I mentioned, AMDR and Space Fence. If we go over to IIS, we don't see any composition change in their bookings. Our customers shifted from yearly funding to quarterly funding, now to monthly funding. So that's kind of reflected in how we look at things, and half of their awards are all driven by classified. Missiles expects international bookings probably here in the second quarter on AMRAAM, and Oman will be part of that. Of course, we see strong interest in RAM and Evolved Seasparrow. Paveway, Mideast, I think you're aware and others are aware that Secretary Hagel is over talking packages with those countries. So we expect Missiles to be in good shape. Referring to NCS, over 1\/3 of their bookings were international, and on the domestic side, a number of opportunities. In fact, this morning, the wire just announced that we won D-RAPCON, which is a mobile air traffic control system. Initial award $252 million, we'll get a $50 million development contract. And so that was planned probably in the first quarter. It happens in the second quarter. We all know bookings are lumpy, but we look at them on a total basis and Dave kind of gave you some insight there. SAS sees about 1\/3 of their bookings international, the biggest piece related to our tactical airborne radars, and South Korea gives us a good start on that one. And finally, our Technical Services, we see the range of training and logistics programs, about 25% of that is international. So that's a quick rundown in my mind going through the businesses. And I got to remind everybody that 30% of our -- 30 of our contracts represent 1\/4 of our business. 128 contracts represent the 50%. And then if you look, the last half of our sales are driven by 15,000 contracts that represent $1.5 million, $2 million worth of business. And that's this company and that's what makes it so strong, because we convert those smaller programs into bigger programs later on in time, and hopefully, that answers your question.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's very helpful. Just one more number, of the $23.5 billion this year, how much of that do you expect to be international, please?","William H. Swanson","About 29% to 31%. Of course, that could be bigger.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Bill, I wondered if you could speak briefly on the Hagel strategic review, and your views on -- I know it's tough to call likely findings, but when we look at the recent change in posture and the pivot to the Pacific, we've got -- a sort of recently redone defense strategy. When you take that in mind and say, what is it that Secretary Hagel is going to end up concluding? What do you think the focus of that review will be on? Does it -- is it more related to that strategy? Or is it more related to the realities of the budget and how we're going to prioritize spending? Any color you could provide would be really helpful.","William H. Swanson","Okay. Let me take a shot. I'm not in charge of the building so remember that when I give you my opinion. I think, having recently heard Deputy Secretary Dr. Ash Carter speak, clearly, the department is trying to make sure that they're leaner, they're more flexible, they're agile, they're going to be smaller, and they're going have to be able to adapt. And there is a focus on the Asia-Pacific region. There's been 60 years of peace there. And the United States wants to make sure our allies and our friends over there continue to enjoy another 60 years of peace. That doesn't mean from a standpoint that the threat is China. Some people predict it's more of, how do we make sure that North Korea and others don't threaten the well-being of our friends and allies over there. So I think part of the strategy is how do we do that. Probably more of a focus on naval. It'll be a repositioning of personnel, probably in places they haven't been before, but that's because they've been fighting a battle in Iraq or Afghanistan. And so from my standpoint, I think special ops are going to get more attention. They're quicker. I think companies are going to have to have technology and things they can put on the table rather than view graphs, which appeals to us. And I also see a real attention to cyber, and I break the cyber down into 3 areas. Those areas would be the network, they would be in cyberweapons and they'd be in infrastructure. And that's where part of the focus is going to be there. And of course, you all know that, that's what we've been doing for the last 4, 5 years here, getting ready for what we thought was coming. So I think there will be a strategy and then you tie your funds to your strategy, no different than what you do in a company, and I expect them to do that in a thoughtful way.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's very helpful. And one for Dave, just quickly. Dave, can you clarify what the difference in year-over-year, the contribution from net EAC cum catches was?","David C. Wajsgras","On a net basis, it was essentially flat. It's around $140 million last year's first quarter and roughly $140 million this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the reorganization. And I guess, in terms of what the savings are and when do you net them? Because I'm assuming there's some costs you're planning in 2013 to actually get those savings. And then when I project going forward, how are we going to actually see some of those savings just because if I look at your selling and administrative costs, or is it in cost of sales? Because selling and administrative costs seem to have stuck around 6.5% of sales or so for quite a while.","David C. Wajsgras","So Sam, the savings are being driven primarily by the reduction in personnel costs as we go through the consolidation from 6 to 4. And we streamline -- this is primarily around streamlining the leadership teams. And as we noted in the press release, we expect the action to affect about 200 employees. So it's important to note that the impact to 2014 and '15, frankly from a financial perspective, is de minimis because most of the savings are priced into our contracts and passed along to our customers. In 2013, you have to account for the costs to implement the program, the relocation, the severance and so forth, and that offsets the current year savings. So fundamentally, the restructuring is weighted, more so than you may realize, toward business leadership teams. But again, the driver here is primarily to more efficiently manage the operation and the business, and serve the customer going forward. Now with that said, we will continue to drive efficiencies through supply chain actions and through indirect or overhead cost reductions. I articulated some of that earlier during my comments.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And Dave, one more, if I can add in. Your capital spending was pretty light this quarter. Do you still think you're going to be up close to flat year-over-year?","David C. Wajsgras","We'll be flat to slightly down year-over-year. We have a lot of focus on all the areas of spending, and capital expenditures are not outside of the realm of what we're looking at.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Dave, question on NCS, understanding that as a segment, we won't necessarily see this play out this way. But you were down 7% in revs on the quarter and attributed that to the Army softness. But the guidance for this segment, which you provided, suggests that this is really the trough quarter. One, is that correct? And two, does that imply that we don't see further pressure in Army going forward here, rest of the year?","David C. Wajsgras","No. Rob, that's a good observation. The full year 2013 does include -- already includes lower business with the U.S. Army, particularly around the sensor production programs. This is offset, and we have talked about this in the past, and apparently you recall, this is offset by growth on the international side, particularly in the C4I area where we have substantial development work. NCS as a business, I would say Q1 could be viewed as the trough, it's a fair way to look at it. As we move through the year, we see those businesses, by and large, expanding. And I think equally important, we see expansion from a margin standpoint as well.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the other thing I wanted to ask you is just you talked about the buyback in the quarter and the share count that you're anticipating. I don't know exactly how you ended the quarter and what the creep would be. But given the range, you might be close to the high end of that share count, right? So we shouldn't infer from that, that you're done buying back stock?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, first of all, I wouldn't infer that we would end the year at the high end of the range. But let me address that in just a second. We do have a strong balance sheet, and we continue to pursue a balanced capital deployment strategy. And this guides our thinking about how we're returning value to shareholders. We're continuing to invest in the business. We're paying a strong dividend. We're pursuing targeted M&A. And as you noted, we're continuing to buy back shares. We mentioned earlier that we raised the dividend 10% this year and we did raise it, as a reminder, 16% last year. So importantly, we do remain cognizant of what's in the best interest of our shareholders when it comes to capital deployment in general and our share repurchase plans more specifically. And just to be clear, we'll continually review these plans.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm interested in the reorganization. You've been in this segment structure for quite some time, about 10 years. I'm curious, what was the catalyst that made you decide to make this change at this point?","William H. Swanson","I think, Doug, you know us, we have a strategy. We've stuck to it. We've tweaked a little bit here and there. And as you look to the future, clearly, at least my take, is that companies have to be more agile going forward. The environment's changed. Our customers need the ability to sit down with us at the table and work through things. We were most recently, in the Pentagon, we went through, some of us -- our programs. I can tell you, I really felt good having that meeting. Our programs are doing extremely well if you look at our performance on cost and schedule indices. It looks like a 12-gauge shotgun with a choke, it's right around the sweet spot. And I can't say everybody else is in the same position, but I sure was thankful of Raytheon's. So when you look at the organization, it's how do we respond quicker, how do we respond with affordable solutions, and how do we continue to have the productivity gains that we've had on a year-over-year basis. And we elected to make some changes and that was worked on by the senior leadership of the company. We probably spent the better part of 9 months going through that to make sure we got it right. Tom's on board watching it. I can tell you it has gone extremely quick, extremely well beyond my expectations. And you know me, I set some pretty high standards. And so, we're seeing things click and work in a way that is just what we want. And especially internationally, you've got to be able to go in and offer solutions. Selling products just doesn't work. And I think this new organization is going to help us do that. And by the way, sometimes change for change's sake is healthy.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then one competitive question. MEADS has new life, it appears. Do you see this as having any potential impact on the Patriot outlook?","William H. Swanson","Well, let me start off by saying MEADS is not a Raytheon program. The U.S. Army has decided not to procure MEADS. It made that decision some time ago and continues to state that decision. The continued performance of Patriot contrasted with MEADS' long-standing cost overruns and schedule delays were the primary reason most members of Congress thought the program should be terminated early. However, the Pentagon has told them they face cancellation fees, so the funds have been put in for the cancel -- for to finish the program so they don't have that particular thing. So I guess the way to answer your question is Patriot has a long installed base. It has numerous international customers, and I don't lose any sleep at night whatsoever over the other program.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Bill or Dave, I wanted to ask about margins long-term. On the one hand, you're doing a lot internally on the cost side that's proving successful; on the other hand, presumably, those cum catch numbers you talked about earlier don't sustain. We're seeing better buying power, version 2.0 come out of the Pentagon and it's unclear exactly what that means. How sustainable are current margins 2, 3 years out? And are there any segments specifically that look much different 2 or 3 years out?","David C. Wajsgras","So Noah, it's a good question. We've discussed this in the past. Frankly, I've been here 7.5 years and I think I've discussed this for 7.5 years. We...","William H. Swanson","I've been here 41. This has been going on for 41.","David C. Wajsgras","Okay, 41 years. But we have continued to perform well. We execute, I would say, best-in-class. We continue to satisfy all customer requirements, both domestically and internationally. We've talked about our focus on productivity and cost efficiency, and that's continuing to put us in a very good position from a competitive standpoint. I mentioned earlier we have about 36% of our backlog with international customers and we continue to see that expanding over time. The financial returns, from an international perspective as a result of the risk associated with international business are -- it's typically higher than domestic business. So I would say, as we look forward, we're continuing to see sustainability from a margin standpoint. And I would say there would be upward pressure at some level from an overall margin profile.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. If I could just ask about one other item. The Technical Services segment, just bigger picture. I mean, this had 3 or 4 years in a row of double-digit and a few well in excess of 10% organic revenue growth years towards the end of the defense spending upturn. It's been fairly resilient as spending has started to come down, a little weaker this quarter. Can you remind us or update us on what the handful of largest drivers are in that segment right now? And how do you think about when that one bottoms out?","William H. Swanson","Yes. It's -- first of all, our Technical Service business really leads in the, what I'll call the virtual, live and constructive training. They do that in a way that really leverages from our commercial side of the business there. Many people don't realize that we provide the training for GM and Chrysler and Opel. And if you dealt with the automobile industry, you know that they're continually looking for price and value. And so for us, we find a way to do compression and education or training so we can basically take a program -- and compression means that we can take 20% or 30% out, and increase the retention and deliver better results. We've taken that and got it into our army training. That training gets propagated into other areas, it's expanding internationally. But what we've all got to realize is that with sequestration, you've got the Secretary and the Deputy, they've got to worry about the budgets and how to make everything fit. And so from my standpoint, I think about it in a way that they look at personnel, which is off-limits, the President's decided that, that's not going to be touched. They're going to take care of mandatory things like nuclear deterrents and security concerns. They're going to make sure they protect new programs that they want to go through. And finally, you get to people. And so that department's going through some hard choices now with furloughs. I think they've decided that it's going to be around 13 days. In the next 3 or 4 weeks they got to decide if they're going to implement that or not. And then you finally get to O&M. And O&M, especially, if you're on the services side, provides quick savings to the building. And they're not canceling programs, so it puts the focus there. We think we've factored that correctly into our services business. And as you point out, it's resilient because they deliver good value and they're constantly realizing that we have to come up with savings to help our customers fit their budget. So from our standpoint, we're going over a speed bump right now that we think we forecasted correctly. And then as we go forward, we'll see where things go. It's unlikely there is going to be any change in sequester in the next few months. We assume it's going to take the full year. The fiscal year '14 budget gives them -- Congress and the administration a chance for maybe a grand bargain. We'll find out what happens here. But we continue to work with our customers to help them prepare what's in front of them. I hope that helps.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'll stick to just one. It sounded like the bookings target for the year was lower by about $500 million. The sales for this year is lower by about $400 million. So the year-end backlog projection really doesn't move very much. And I guess what I'm struggling with is, where does sequestration actually hit you for '14 if it doesn't hit you in your year-end backlog?","David C. Wajsgras","So as you -- as we go through this year, and I'm not sure we addressed this earlier, but it's primarily in our services businesses that backlog is impacted as a result of sequestration. It's primarily IIS, RTSC, as well as some of the classified business in SAS. By and large, it's our quick-turn type business. We've talked about the back half of the year being weighted from a booking cadence standpoint. It's also heavily weighted to international. So just to give you some additional perspective. From a first half standpoint, we expect to see a book-to-bill of under 1, say roughly about 0.9. As you go to the back half of the year, we see about 1.15. And as we close out the year, we see it just around 1 overall. From an international standpoint, we see the book-to-bill at about 1.05 to about 1.15. So you can see how the cadence sort of is back-end weighted and the cadence is also weighted toward international.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was just going to say, am I right that your year-end projected backlog, though, didn't -- doesn't move with sequestration?","David C. Wajsgras","The backlog is just about flat, even including sequestration. That's about right. I mean it's -- yes, that's the math.","William H. Swanson","Yes. What people also have to remember, some people expected the world to end with sequestration. It happens over time, it's a slow buildup. And for me, the world has changed, and the area you worry about or you focus on is where you don't deliver a product is the easiest place to go get money or it's fungible. So where you have programs or products or international, which will continue anyway, so you really worry about what I'll call the seats or positions you have on the service side. And we've looked through that, and we've got some strong programs, and we think we've taken that into account as Dave pointed out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just to go back for a moment and talk about outlook and sort of your forecast. If we look at the FY '13 budget and how it was constructed, and then we look at the language that was appropriated, it seems that in a number of cases, you got awards and program funding that will be far in excess of where the original proposals were. Could you sort of touch on that? It looks like it's in radar, it looks like it's in ballistic missile defense. And then I just have a follow-up related to that.","William H. Swanson","Howard, you're right. It's -- part of our philosophy here, the company -- or the strategy is that our products or our services have got to both be forward-looking but they've also got to be backward-compatible. So we look at what we do. And in this world, I think some of what we have is going to have to last longer. And so when you think about an F-16 aircraft and you can put a new AMRAAM D on it and you can put an AESA Radar on it, you have made that really a potent platform. The other thing we see on the naval side are Zumwalt program, what we've been able to do there with 11 or 12 new technologies that we put there. We've been able to go backward-fit those. And now, given the shipbuilding performance, the integration and where we see that going, it really reaffirms to people that you can go both directions here. So I think you've seen our existing product lines continue to grow. And the thing we feel excited about, and that's something I talked to Dr. Carter about, is that the Department is really going to worry about new starts. The thing you have with -- you know this as well as I do, old programs have many fathers and mothers. New programs are like plants with shallow root structure that people can pull up. But what leadership has to worry about is that those development programs are really the future. And I see the building trying to protect those programs going forward, which I think bodes well for the kind of work we do, if that helps.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then -- absolutely. And that's sort of the follow-up is that there are 3 big new starts that I can point to domestically: AMDR, whatever happens with AESA Radar and -- well, actually Space Fence, and 4 if I count the Jammer as well. How have you thought about factoring those? So if you win half of them, do you end up, in fact, exceeding your bookings forecast?","William H. Swanson","I think if we won half or more, it would be good for the home team. And of course, Tom Kennedy's looking at me, telling me it would be very good for the home team. So it's one of those where we don't play would've, could've, should've. And what that is, is when we submit our proposals, we give it our best shot and take into account everything we know. And what we realize is that our customers don't buy technology for technology's sake. They're really looking at what's the best value. And the best value includes a lot of different things now. One is energy consumption. And when I started in this business, nobody cared about energy consumption. And so now, when you look at some of these big radars or these systems is how much do you consume and how is that evaluated besides reliability, maintainability and the rest of the -ilities. So we feel good about where we're going. And even in the technology arena, for us, they're not big jobs, million dollars. We're worried about a hybrid dish where you can go out in the field and have a sterling engine to be able to generate energy to use 50% less power. Those are the kinds of things this company works on. And they come in here, we look at them, we get excited. And then the teams go off. And I could talk about others. We have a program that BBN's doing, which is developing script-independent technology where we can transcribe handwritten documents. We're the only ones in the country working on that from a DARPA point of view. I could go on all morning about some of the neat things we're working on, but that's how we see it. But to answer your question, yes, it would be a good thing to win more than half of them.","Operator","Okay. Your final question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Bill, I want to generalize a little bit here. I mean, if you look at the procurement and investment accounts for 2013, they're down about 15% from 2012. So I really want to push. I mean, history would show that somebody as big as Raytheon, even with the international exposure, that you might be able to do somewhat better than that 15% decline. It's hard to believe, too, that you'd be able to have a backlog flat at the end of the year with this year. So I just wanted to push you a little bit more on that.","William H. Swanson","Well, can I push back?","George Shapiro","Sure.","William H. Swanson","Okay. Well, George, I think the thing of it is, is you have to look at Raytheon's portfolio. Extremely strong internationally. And so that's growth, that's not a decrease. And then you look at, as I mentioned, 15,000 contracts make up half of our sales. Those are $1.5 million to $2 million contracts, and that's a real strength of what we do, and we're a technology company and we believe we can compete with anybody in the world in that area. And then you have to look at the budget that's going down. There's always -- those are the cold spots. You have to be able to look at the hot spots. And so for us, from a standpoint, we think we're in the hot spots, that's where we try to be. We didn't go into Fed IT,  we talked about cyber before anybody could spell it. And so part of what we have to do is make sure that we're at the forefront of that area. And so that's why we think we can be, as you say, a book to bill of 1, which means you'd be flat on backlog. And by the way, if the international comes in stronger, that's even better.","George Shapiro","Yes. I don't doubt that you can do better, I just question whether you could do that much better. And I would argue that 15,000 programs are a negative in the sense that, in aggregate, they've got to be subject to what's going on in the budget. They all can't be separate from what's going on [indiscernible]...","William H. Swanson","Well, that's part of the debate, George. And I guess we've given you our best guidance. And I've been around here for a long time and I think Raytheon's been pretty accurate, at least in my last 10 years, about predicting where things were going to go.","George Shapiro","Okay. One nitpick...","William H. Swanson","And what you got to realize is we model all our 18,000 contracts and our 8,000 programs. So we have a little bit of an advantage over you.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","Okay. Well, I guess we'll see where the year actually...","William H. Swanson","Yes. That's okay. We've been doing this for a long time, so it's a healthy debate. But I think what's really key here is you can detect no apprehension on what I'm telling you.","George Shapiro","Yes. And one for you, Dave. You continue to do better in the margins than I figure. But in NCS, anything unique in the first quarter where it was 9.6% and you're still guiding for the year to average up 200 bps from that?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. So the decrease in the margin is due to the timing and the extent of the program improvements last year, the mix of business, and I may not have mentioned this earlier, but it's important. We made a significant acquisition at the end of last year, and the acquisition costs associated with integrating that encryption technology business costs about 60 basis points in the first quarter and about 50 basis points on the year. Now, the mix does become more favorable as you go to the back half of the year, and the timing of the efficiency improvements is also weighted to the second through fourth quarters in that business.","George Shapiro","Okay. Well, that 60 bps gives me -- makes it certainly more feasible.","William H. Swanson","Thanks, George. And we'll just -- we'll talk at the end of the year.","Todd B. Ernst","Okay.

My name is Taheesha, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Todd B. Ernst","Thank you, Taheesha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our first quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website. With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Wajsgras, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Dave and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas A. Kennedy","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. During the first quarter of 2014, Raytheon delivered solid operating results. Our margins, cash flow and EPS were all ahead of expectations, and our bookings and sales were in line with our plan. I'm proud of the team as they continue to deliver strong program performance in a challenging environment. As our results show, we continue to build upon a strong foundation that creates value for customers and shareholders. Further, we are continuously positioning the company for future growth and value creation. Our goal is to ensure the ongoing strong alignment of Raytheon's broad portfolio of capabilities with the needs of our global customers. To do this, we continue to prioritize our investments with a focus on enhancing our competitive advantage and leveraging our capabilities to grow globally in new markets, as we've done recently in Oman and we are going to do in Qatar. Furthermore, we continue to strengthen our \"one company\" collaboration to improve our performance in execution and growth. And we're attacking costs by leveraging commercial best practices to drive value and affordability. As many of you already know, Raytheon's international reach is a key element of our solid foundation and an important differentiator for the company. It's an area that holds great potential for our future. In the first quarter, international bookings were 39% of total bookings, and international now comprises 39% of our total backlog.","I'd like to point out 2 key international bookings that we received in the quarter. We booked $515 million for an award to provide Kuwait 2 Patriot fire units. This adds to Kuwait's existing inventory of 5 fire units and reflects continued demand for our combat-proven integrated air and missile defense systems in the global marketplace. We also booked $195 million for an international cyber program. This booking demonstrates the significant value of our cyber capabilities and solutions to a broader spectrum of markets and customers. It also demonstrates our ability to leverage our international market channels to expand our cyber business. We continue to make progress on new opportunities in Qatar, which initially includes Patriot systems and Command and Control capabilities. Qatar publicly announced their intentions to proceed with the Patriot procurement at the DIMDEX show and the LOA is awaiting final approval. Additionally, we continue to pursue a number of other international Patriot opportunities that include Poland, South Korea and others. Closer to home, we had a very key international win on the North Warning System for Canada. This program supports the operation and maintenance of 47 radar sites across the Arctic that supply tracking data to NORAD. We won the competition late in the first quarter and the booking will be reflected in the second quarter. This is a great example of the diversity of both our portfolio and the international markets that Raytheon serves. And after the close of the quarter, an international customer executed a contract with the U.S. government for TOW missiles. We expect this to result in a booking of just over $650 million in Q2. Domestically, we're encouraged by the President's fiscal year '15 budget request, and we welcome the budget stability afforded by the Bipartisan Budget Act. Alongside the budget released in March, the DoD also published the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review. A consistent theme throughout all of these and other recent DoD strategic documents is key support for capabilities that play to Raytheon's strengths including missile defense, cyber, EW and ISR. Of note, one of the areas in the fiscal year '15 budget that received the strongest support was cyber, where the budget request increased 9%. In my more than 30 years with the company, and in all my roles, our top priority has always been continuous improvement. It's part of the culture of Raytheon at all levels and is a key driver behind our operating performance. We will continue to build on our success by pressing forward with our many efficiency initiatives, including optimizing our supply chain through strategic sourcing, reducing our fixed cost base through footprint consolidation and providing innovative and more efficient shared services and solutions to Raytheon's businesses and functions through our Global Business Services group. Our overall goal is to provide our customers with not just the most innovative solutions, but also to do so at a lower cost. As we look to the future, accelerating growth is a key priority for the company. To achieve this, we are focused on investing in the right technology through increased research and development investments which support our drive for competitive advantage. As we've highlighted on prior calls, our R&D investments have yielded significant takeaway wins and we are well-positioned for the next generation of sensors, effectors and cyber capabilities. Similarly, we continue to look for value-added investments outside the company. Over the past several years, we have made a number of acquisitions, primarily in the cyber area, which has significantly enhanced our position in this growth market. Looking ahead, one of the key objectives is to continue to unlock the value of our cyber capabilities to meet the growing global demand in both defense and commercial markets. We continue to see acquisitions as a key part of our long-term strategy. In addition to this growth focus, our capital deployment strategy includes returning value to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Consistent with this approach, we repurchased $200 million of stock in the quarter, and we announced last month that we'll increase our dividend by 10%. We have now raised our annual dividend every year for the past 10 years. We have also invested in making our processes and systems world-class to support our strong execution-focused culture. And we've invested in our people, our most valuable asset. These execution excellence and people investments provide us with a competitive advantage. It's what makes us unique. It allows us to retain and attract our world-class talent and provide an environment where our people can achieve their maximum potential for our global customers. I feel privileged to lead this great company. I want to thank the team for a good start out of the gate in 2014 and for support as we build our strong foundation and embrace the opportunities before us. With that, let me turn it over to Dave.","David C. Wajsgras","Okay, thanks, Tom. And good morning, everyone. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the first quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. Okay, if everyone would turn to Page 3. We're pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the first quarter, with sales, EPS, margins and operating cash flow all at or better than expectations. It's a good start to the year and positions us well for achieving our full year outlook. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.87. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $1.43. I'll discuss this in more detail in just a moment. Operating margin was strong at 14.3%, and on an adjusted basis was 12.7%. And sales of $5.5 billion were at the high end of our sales guidance range. Operating cash flow of $659 million was better than our prior guidance, driven by the timing of collections that were previously expected in the second quarter. During the quarter, the company bought back 2.1 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase program for $200 million. I also want to point out that we're reaffirming the guidance that we provided in January, which I'll discuss further in just a few minutes.","Turning now to Page 4, let me start by providing some detail on our first quarter results. Company bookings for the quarter were $4.3 billion, slightly ahead of our internal plans. International awards represented 39% of the total. As you may recall, we had strong bookings in the back half of 2013, so on a trailing 4-quarter basis, the book-to-bill is 0.98x. And as we mentioned on the January call, we expect our full year 2014 bookings to be $23.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million, and a book-to-bill ratio of between 1.0 and 1.05x. Notable bookings in the quarter included $515 million at IDS to provide Patriot air and missile defense capability for Kuwait, and $98 million to provide Patriot engineering services for the U.S. and international customers. IIS booked $111 million on the Joint Polar Satellite System program for NASA and $104 million on the Warfighter FOCUS in support of both domestic and foreign training programs.","Missile Systems booked $479 million for Standard Missile-3 for the Missile Defense Agency. Missile Systems also booked $164 million for Paveway and $86 million for Maverick missiles, both for international customers. Space and Airborne Systems booked $116 million to provide radar spares for an international customer and $81 million for software enhancements to AESA radars for the U.S. Air Force. In addition, IIS and SAS booked $535 million and $216 million, respectively, on a number of classified contracts, including $195 million for international cyber at IIS. We continue to expand our cyber business to provide products and large-scale solutions for both domestic and international customers. Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $32.2 billion, and on a funded basis was $22.7 billion. It's worth noting that approximately 39% of our backlog is now comprised of international programs. If you'd move to Page 5, as I just mentioned, for the first quarter of 2014, sales were at the high end of the guidance we set in January. Looking at sales by business, IDS had first quarter 2014 net sales of $1.5 billion. The change from Q1 2013 was primarily due to the planned completion of certain production phases on 2 international Patriot programs. In the first quarter of 2014, IIS had net sales of $1.5 billion. Compared with the same quarter last year, the change was primarily due to lower volume on our training programs. Missile systems had first quarter 2014 net sales of $1.6 billion. We saw lower sales for U.S. Army programs in this year's first quarter compared to Q1 2013. And SAS had net sales of $1.4 billion. Lower volume on tactical, communications and classified programs drove the change versus last year. In addition, it's worth noting that $68 million of the lower volume is from reduced intersegment sales related to close combat tactical radars. Excluding this, SAS would be down approximately 8%.","Moving ahead to Page 6, we're pleased by our overall company margins, which exceeded our guidance. Our operating margin was 14.3%. And on an adjusted basis, was 12.7%. As a reminder, our first quarter 2014 adjusted margin excludes the favorable FAS\/CAS Adjustment, which was worth 160 basis points or $0.18 per share. Our focus on execution, productivity and efficiency continues to be reflected in our financial results. We remain committed to driving cost out of the business. A good example of this is our improving facilities utilization that we've discussed on past calls. We're reducing our real estate footprint and have been for a couple of years now. We made good progress in 2013 realizing a 3% reduction in square footage over 2012. And we see a couple of percent more reduction in 2014. I'd like to mention 1 example of an action we just initiated that will begin to drive savings in 2015. We now plan to move 1,700 people from our Garland, Texas location to a more efficient facility in nearby Richardson, Texas. This will result in a net reduction of over 600,000 square feet beginning next year. We've picked [ph] similar projects that will enable us to hit an approximate 10% targeted reduction in our company-wide real estate over the next few years.","So looking at business margins. IIS and Missiles margins were up in the quarter compared with the same period last year. Solid overall program performance and favorable mix drove improvement at both businesses. The change in IDS was primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies in last year's first quarter. I do want to point out that in this year's first quarter, there was a program where the assumed cost to complete increased over prior estimates, and this was one of the drivers in the quarterly comparison. And SAS margins of 13.6% were down compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by higher license royalty payments received in the first quarter of 2013.","Turning now to Page 7. First quarter 2014 EPS was $1.87 and on an adjusted basis, was $1.43. I've already addressed the changes in operations and share count. Now you may recall that in Q1 2013, we included the benefit of the retroactive impact of the 2012 R&D tax credit. We excluded this credit in our adjusted earnings. Looking at the first quarter 2014, as I discussed on January's call, our lower tax rate is driven in part by the repatriation of cash. This action was completed in January and resulted in a favorable impact of $0.25 per share in the first quarter 2014. It's worth noting that this impacts the full year tax rate by just under 3 percentage points.","On Page 8, we are reaffirming the financial outlook for 2014 that we provided in January for net sales, EPS and operating cash flow. We still expect our full year 2014 net sales to be in the range of between $22.5 billion and $23 billion. Our full year 2014 EPS is expected to be in a range of between $6.74 and $6.89, and on an adjusted basis was in the range of between $5.76 and $5.91. As a reminder, we have not included the possible extension of the R&D tax credit in our 2014 guidance. If the legislation passes, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 100 basis points and our EPS by about $0.10. We repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock for $200 million in the quarter and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 312 million and 314 million shares for 2014, which would be a 3% reduction at the midpoint. As I mentioned earlier, operating cash flow in the quarter was strong due to the timing of collections previously expected in the second quarter. We continue to see our 2014 guidance for operating cash flow to be between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion. Looking beyond 2014, we don't foresee any notable FAS\/CAS impact to what we discussed on the January call, based on the new mortality assumptions recently published in draft form by the Society of Actuaries. And as you can see on Page 9, we've included guidance by business, which is unchanged from our prior outlook. On Page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, EPS and operating cash flow for the balance of 2014. As we discussed on the January call, sales were expected to ramp up throughout the year. In the first half of 2014, we still expect sales to be down on a percentage basis in the mid- to high-single digits. Keep in mind, sales in the first half of the year -- the first half of last year, predominantly Q2, were relatively strong due in part to some quick-turn book-and-bill business. The back-half sales for this year, 2014, are expected to be in line to slightly up versus 2013. And if you compare second-half sales to first-half sales, we expect to see mid-single-digit growth sequentially. As you may recall, our 2013 bookings finished strong, particularly with respect to international. We booked Oman GBAD and the South Korean RACR program in the fourth quarter. In Q1, we were awarded 2 Patriot units for Kuwait and we also booked a key international cyber program. Looking at the second quarter, we anticipate strong orders internationally for missiles and integrated air missile defense programs. These awards are all key drivers of our second-half sales performance. Before concluding, I'd like to spend just a minute talking about our capital deployment strategy. Raytheon has had strong cash generation over the past several years and we expect this to continue. Our first priority is to invest in ourselves to support future growth and efficiency initiatives. Further, an important part of our strategy is to return cash to shareholders. In the first quarter, we increased our dividend by 10% per share. We plan to continue our share repurchase program, reducing the diluted share base over time. Additionally, we continue to look for acquisitions that will drive growth in strategic areas and enhance shareholder value. We'll continue to unlock the potential of our cyber capabilities to meet the growing global demand in both defense and commercial markets, and we see additional acquisitions as part of this long-term focus. Importantly, our cash balances and cash flow allow us flexibility and provide sufficient capacity, both in the near and long term, to support a balanced capital deployment strategy going forward. In summary, we saw good performance in the first quarter. We're executing well. We continue to drive solid operating performance and we're taking costs out of the business. We have a healthy international pipeline, and we expect to improve our sales trajectory in the back half of this year. We remain well positioned with our domestic customers' priority areas and continue to be aligned with the evolving priorities of our international customers. Our objective is to drive the business to maximize value for all of our customers and shareholders. So with that, Tom and I will open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question is just on the IDS contract you guys mentioned. Any more color you can give on the growth in -- or how much that cost you in EBIT in the quarter? How big is the contract? The confidence in your new cost assumptions, et cetera?","David C. Wajsgras","The IDS contract, specifically, which one are you referring to, Joe?","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The one I think you mentioned that impacted your margin in the quarter.","David C. Wajsgras","Are you talking Patriot for Kuwait?","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, I'm sorry. I thought you mentioned in your description of margins at IDS that there was a contract for which...","Thomas A. Kennedy","Joe, I'll take that real quick. That was a Patriot program we had and there was a refurbishment, and some of the refurbishment elements were required and initially anticipated, so we did book an upcharge on that. That is a profitable program, but it's requiring us to bring in some more additional material into it to complete the refurb.","David C. Wajsgras","I apologize, Joe. Yes, there's a -- it's a contract that's been in production for a while. There was a slight shift in the cadence of the material that's required. So there's a slight impact in the quarter. It shows up in the EAC adjustments, but the contract remains very profitable.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood, okay. And then, just secondly, I was interested in more on the cyber booking internationally. I don't know how much you can talk about it. It -- just from a high level, it always seemed to me that cyber is more difficult -- a more difficult line of business to transfer internationally, more of it is service-oriented than a lot of things you do, conceptually anyway. And so what's really the opportunity to do more of the same, more details you can give on it?","Thomas A. Kennedy","Yes, Joe. I think it's been a focus of ours for several years, to leverage our international channels to drive our cyber business globally. And I think, we were just -- we are seeing -- we saw it last -- late last year, we saw it this year that we're being successful in doing that. And I think the -- one of the main reasons is that we're very credible worldwide relative to our cyber capabilities, and we have a strong international brand relative to the Raytheon company itself. The combination of those 2 is that we're seeing significant opportunities across the globe for our -- essentially our cyber capabilities, our knowledge of cyber and also our cyber products.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Just back on that first -- that contract we talked about first. Are you guys going to quantify the specific EAC adjustment or are you not going to do that?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, the EAC adjustments overall for the quarter ran at about 2.2% of revenue. The IDS -- the change for IDS was about $34 million, $35 million. And that one adjustment made up about half of it. That's the reason we wanted to point it out.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Yair Reiner from Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","First, a follow-up on Joe's question. You mentioned in your discussion of cyber that you'd like to do more on the commercial side. Can you give us a sense of how much of your cyber business today is commercial? And maybe where you'd like that to be in 4 or 5 years?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. So it's an area that we have participated in for a while now. From a financial perspective, it's not significant at this point. We do offer a broad range of products and services and solutions across various customers. And I think equally important, across various information assurance domains. We've been talking about this and thinking about this from a strategic standpoint for quite a while. We do see ourselves expanding in that area. But at this stage, I don't think it would be prudent to get specific as to how significant that could become over the next 3 to 5 years. With that said, it is a key focus area for us both from a government standpoint and from a commercial standpoint. And we do consider it an important growth area.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, one more, if I could. You've had 2 significant new program wins here relatively recently with the Next Generation Jammer and AMDR. I'm hoping you can help us understand when those begin to hit the P&L? And what the margin profile of those are going to look like?","Thomas A. Kennedy","So let me take that, Yair. Obviously both of those wins were very important to the Raytheon Company. They're both franchise wins and essentially based on the investments that we have made in research and development over several years. And that essentially bore the fruits of that effort. As we move forward, right now we're in the development stages of the program. And so we will not be seeing the high production-type of margins out for about 4 years. But we do have healthy margins on both programs through the development phases.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then the cadence of the revenues?","Thomas A. Kennedy","Cadence of the revenues? It's a...","David C. Wajsgras","The cadence of the revenues, they ramp up throughout this year and become more significant as we get into '15.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about just on -- on one of the slides on SAS, you called out the $68 million impact from intercompany sales. I don't remember you calling that out before. So is there something different for specific programs or is it just larger this quarter for some reason?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, the -- it's army-related. The end product is a battlefield radar that's sold out of our IDS division. The reason I pointed that out is because it's a significant intersegment change year-over-year of $65 million, $70 million. The other businesses have intersegment sales that are in line with last year. So just on a purely external basis, SAS was down a little over 8% and I just thought it was important to point it out.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, just when -- you mentioned the capital deployment question and I guess, I'm just thinking more broadly, which is, you have done a lot of work throughout the 2000, I guess to go from, call it, a BBB to an A rating. And just thinking about your credit profile. How important is that and in the context of what you would do with your capital structure and your cash?","David C. Wajsgras","So we are pleased with what we've been able to do from a balance sheet perspective, driven by the strong cash flow over the last number of years. We are essentially an A- rating across-the-board. And we feel that between BBB+ an A- is about the range that we are targeting and comfortable to stay within. From a capital deployment standpoint, I suggested in my opening remarks that we would continue a balanced approach. There is a likelihood that we will see more from an acquisition perspective going forward than we've done certainly in the last year or 2. Last year was pretty quiet on the acquisition front and you can see that when you look at our balance sheet. Going forward, I wouldn't expect wholesale changes from the way we're thinking about capital deployment or the way we're thinking about the rating.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Might as well carry on from where Sam was talking about, the balance sheet situation, but maybe from a different angle. I'm wondering if this shift towards 40% of sales being export also changes your thinking about where you expect the balance sheet to be or what sort of cash debt holding you should have going forward.","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. So international, as you know, typically has a slightly improved cash profile when compared to our domestic business. I think when you cut through the details, that simply gives us more opportunity with respect to our capital deployment priorities as we look ahead to 2015 and '16. I think that that's really the short version. We're going to continue to invest in ourselves as a priority, I think Tom mentioned that earlier, both from a cost efficiency standpoint -- for example, we have allocated about $100 million to facility utilization improvements this year. We're continuing to invest and increase the investment in R&D as we go forward. And there is some capital associated with that. I'll say this again because it's worth repeating, we fully intend to continue to return value to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. And like I said, we have an increasing focus on value-creating acquisitions. I do want to point out one last thing. The first quarter of this year, we posted the highest cash flow performance, operating cash flow performance in over a decade. So I think your question is the right one, and we'll continue to drive cash flow for the company in that regard.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Maybe a follow-up on your favorite topic of pension space. I was wondering if you could very simplistically explain why these mortality table changes aren't going to much have an impact.","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. So I think different companies use varying assumptions as they go forward and suggest outlooks and forecasts for pensions. Our assumptions are such that the new mortality tables that are in draft form and recently published wouldn't suggest a big change for us from a FAS\/CAS standpoint, or -- and you didn't ask this, or from a cash flow standpoint. As a matter of fact, if you look over the 3-year period, 2014, '15, '16, it actually suggests a slight increase in the net funding cash flow performance for pensions.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jason Gursky from Citigroup.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Dave, just a quick question for you. Can you just update us on e-Borders, in the case going on over there? And then, Tom, a bit broader question for you on the international side. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the competitive environment there, both from a price perspective, as well as a technology perspective, particularly in missile defense, looking at the Chinese products out there and the potential threat that MEADS might offer up as well. And then, just the pipeline itself, how far out that pipeline reaches and whether we ought to be expecting continued solid demand in growth potentially coming out of international markets to the rest of the [indiscernible].","David C. Wajsgras","Yes, so let me start by talking about the e-Borders situation. The arbitration proceedings in the e-Borders matter, as you know, were initiated in 2010. And hearings before the arbitration panel were concluded in 2013. We expect the decision from the panel sometime in the first half of 2014. That's our expectations, but it's behind closed doors and we'll see when we get a decision. That's all we have.","Thomas A. Kennedy","So Jason, on the international side, obviously, right now there's a significant threat across multiple regions. If you're fairly knowledgeable about the Middle East, you understand the concerns about Iran by several countries in that region. And for example, that's why we're seeing that uptick in Qatar and several other countries relative to the integrated air missile defense. Our brand in that region is very strong. We've been in the region for 50 years. We've delivered products, supported product, and have provided, we call it, solutions that were very well-matched to the customers' needs. So bottom line is, we have a great relationship with those Middle East countries in terms of future product upgrades, and then also future product solutions in -- not just the integrated air missile defense, but also C4I and several other technology areas in ISR. One other question you brought up is how does -- I think you're alluding is how does Patriot compete with MEADS and then how does Patriot compete with the Chinese? A significant change to Patriot occurred, we just completed it with the U.A.E., which was about a $500 million nonrecurring upgrade to the complete Patriot system, which has significantly improved not only its capabilities, but also its availability, reliability and maintainability. So right now it's the only system out there that has those capabilities that has been fielded. MEADS has not been fielded yet and has not been completely tested. So it has work to go before it gets to the availability levels and support levels that Patriot is already achieving today. Furthermore, we continue to make investments in Patriot, too, for future upgrades. And we look forward to them. If you look at the budget and the outlay for the DoD, there is money in there for some upgrades on Patriot. They may be competitive as we move forward. One of them is an AESA radar for Patriot, which obviously is in our -- straight and down center of our capability area and we will definitely be -- are pursuing that upgrade. So I think Patriot, overall, is very strong, not only internationally, but also domestically. And it's being funded very strongly in both areas.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","How far up does your pipeline stretch of potential deals? Are you looking at things that will get fulfilled out into the '18 and '19 period?","Thomas A. Kennedy","We have a pretty healthy 5 year for integrated air missile defense. For example in '14, we're awaiting the Qatar Patriot award, and there's also Qatar Command and Control that's associated with that. And then when go into '15, there's upgrades in Korea and there's also a Poland competition that we are presently in. So there's an uptick there. And then, as you may know, once -- there is already 12 countries that have Patriot and there are continuous upgrades that occur across all those 12 countries. And with the Qatar addition, that will make it 13, and then when we win Poland, that will make it 14 countries. So a strong base, we're integrating our missile defense. Then we also have a -- our NASAM system, which we had a contract award last year with Oman. So we have not just the Patriot system, which is a higher end, but we also have the next level right below that for cruise missile defense and the airborne -- air breathing type of threats. So I think bottom line is the portfolio is strong, our customer pull is very strong over the 5 years.","Operator","Or next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. The first, Dave, if you could just quantify domestic versus international growth for the quarter? And then secondly, on this facility reduction, square footage reduction and the cost actions there. How much of that is sort of, to Tom's comment, continuous improvement versus kind of a new initiative? And what's sort of behind that? Is there any -- is it reactionary or proactive? Any color you can help us with on that? Is that a new effort? And if so, why?","David C. Wajsgras","Sure. So on the -- on your first question, on the -- in quarter 1 of this year, domestic sales were down about 7%. International was slightly off at about -- down at about 4% over last year. We did mention that 2 long-duration production programs in our air missile defense area were scaling down. And we expect a pretty meaningful ramp as we get to the back half for the year in that segment of the business. With respect to the facilities utilization improvement program that we have, we've been working on that for a while now. Last year, we took out about 3% of our overall square footage. We're now down to about 28.5 million square feet globally. I would say this is not at all reactionary, it's something that we have started focusing on a few years ago. We're continuing to focus on that area. We have a 10% overall targeted reduction in square footage over the next few years. This year, we -- I mentioned earlier, it's going to -- from the investment side, cost about $100 million; $40 million or $50 million in capital and $40 million or $50 million from an expense standpoint. So I repeat what I said back on the January call, from a margin profile, it impacts us in the near term, but in the long term, makes us much more competitive from a cost posture.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","The question I have is, I'm trying to understand, defense investment outlays are going to go down double-digit second and third quarter. If the Green Book's light, even more, although I think that's too optimistic. This quarter, your sales were down 6%, investment outlays were down 5%. Why do we see an increasing disconnect between what you're suggesting for sales in the second and the third quarter versus what defense investment outlays are going to be?","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. So we understand the question. There's clearly a need to track these numbers at a macro level, and they do provide some insight into the broad trends. But keep in mind that our specific company performance is a function of our bookings and the related sales. Domestically, bookings and sales played out as we expected in Q1. And we're confident in our full year domestic sales guidance. Keep in mind that we're halfway through the government fiscal year, and we have the majority of our FY '14 government contracts in backlog, and the revenue profile of these contracts are relatively fixed. Now we are and remain confident in our program-by-program approach to setting guidance. And for that reason, we don't believe a change in the forecast is warranted simply based on Green Book forecasts or projections.","George Shapiro","Okay. I guess, I'm still looking for the companies that are going to be impacted by this. But I guess I haven't found one yet. But we'll see. The other question...","Thomas A. Kennedy","And George, just back on that, real clear is that we're already halfway into fiscal year '14. And I just wanted to reiterate what Dave said relative to the fact that we have -- yes, the contracts are in place and the contracts do dictate the payment schedules. So that pretty well dictates what we're going to have for the rest of the year. [indiscernible] And we roll up -- when we roll up our estimates, it's based on the actual contracts that we have and what -- any sales we'll achieve out of those for the rest of the year. So it's pretty set.","George Shapiro","No, it's a good answer. As I said, I'm just looking for the disconnect, I haven't found it yet.","Thomas A. Kennedy","All right. All right.","George Shapiro","The other question I had, Dave, is in the first quarter cash flow, you had a $250 million advance, which I assume was probably from Kuwait or maybe Oman. How much of the free -- of the $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion cash that you have, how much more advances do you expect to get and...","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. So, George, I'm not going to get specific on the amount of advances because they are associated with a number of programs that are factored in the outlook. There is a portion of advances in the guidance. There is every year, certainly since I've been here. I think what you may be looking for is our confidence in the cash flow outlook. And we're highly confident in the $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion.","George Shapiro","On the contrary, Dave, I would think your guidance is low because last year, you didn't have any real net advances. You're getting more CAS reimbursement this year, plus the advances.","David C. Wajsgras","Yes, George. I thought that might be where you were going with it. But let me just repeat, we're confident with our $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. Cash -- to forecast cash flow, as you know, is difficult. There's always timing 1 quarter to the next with respect to both cash coming in and cash payments being made. So for now, I think the $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion is where we're comfortable guiding.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Strauss from UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wanted to ask about -- back on IDS margins. I know we're going through this transition here, margins have dipped down. But as we think about longer term for this business as the international profile continues to build, tom, what do you think of kind of a long-term sustainable margin is for IDS?","Thomas A. Kennedy","IDS is our business unit that has the highest percentage of international. It's over 50%. And so we do believe -- and a lot of those -- there's a mix between FMS, foreign military sales contracts, and also direct commercial sales, and a lot tend to be production oriented. And as you probably know, in our business, the production programs, they tend to have higher margins. So a combination of all those, I would say, the IDS will continue to be a strong margin business in the out years.","David C. Wajsgras","So let me just add one thing to that. We see margin improvement quarter-over-quarter, sequentially, as we move throughout 2014. And I would suggest that if you're thinking in the 16% plus range longer term, you would be in the neighborhood. I'm not guiding to that. I just want to be clear, but given the mix of business, that's where I would suggest is a good way to think about IDS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. I wanted to ask about classified, how it's doing. I know you can't say much there. But I just noticed in the -- in your 10-K that the classified bookings last year were down a fair amount. If you could comment on that? And then, last one, just talk about Tomahawk and the budget. It looked like it took a pretty big hit.","Thomas A. Kennedy","I'll take that. Our classified bookings were 19% of our total Q1 bookings. So volume was up about 51% from Q1 2013. Classified sales were 15% of total Q1 sales, and it was down about 6% from Q1 2013. So for the total year, we expect classified bookings to be about 12% to 14% of total, and sales to be in the range of 13% to 15% of total.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then on the...","Thomas A. Kennedy","And then, on the Tomahawk, the Tomahawk was funded for FY '14 and also in the FY '15 budget. But the 5-year defense plan for FY '15 did show funding not occurring in '16, '17 and '18 for production, however, it does show an uptick in '19 for a recertification program. And we are working with the -- our customer to ensure that our production line continues in '16, '17 and '18 to be able to support the certification and working to restore those production numbers.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Douglas Harned from Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm curious. In 2013, you fell short of your goal of reaching the book-to-bill above 1. And we understood that, that was related to the timing of some orders that moved to the right. Then you look at Q1, the backlog fell again. Was this a surprise for you? What's the outlook for bookings over the course of this year?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. So we talked a little bit about this earlier. We see strong bookings in the second quarter of north of $7 billion. We did meet our internal targets for Q1 at about $4.3 billion. We -- on a full year basis, we're seeing $23.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million. The international piece of that will be between 35% and 40%. So what I would say is, from our perspective, we vet our internal targets in the first quarter, and we feel good about the way the year is going to play out. I would suggest that there is a -- there's a -- when you close out the second quarter, based on what I'm saying, we would expect a change in the trajectory of the backlog. And we should be back to where we were when we closed out the end of last year, if not better.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Then, when you talk about the 39% of the backlog now being international, if you took a very simplistic view, you might think that over the long term you would be moving towards something like 39% of sales being international. But can you describe how you expect that to play out? Or are some of the international awards longer-term contracts that might not lead you to that kind of a percentage?","David C. Wajsgras","There will be a higher proportion of international sales as we move forward into '15 and '16. With that said, you are right with your assumption that the international programs, in general, are longer in duration than the domestic programs. They can be on average, say, 4 to 5 years, where domestically, you may be looking at 3 years, plus or minus.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And if I could just slip one last thing on the international. When you look at the tensions right now in Eastern Europe, I'm just interested, are you seeing anything specific either directly or indirectly through the budget that's affecting your business as you look as this in real time?","Thomas A. Kennedy","The time sequence for the budgets hasn't caught up to the activities, geopolitical activities we're seeing in Eastern Europe yet. However, we are seeing direct requests for, I will call it, solutions to help countries in the Eastern Bloc region. And the big one out there right now is Poland. And there is a Poland Patriot competition that is going on today. And that, I would see that as being pretty firm as we move forward due to the activities in the -- due to the Ukraine activities.","David C. Wajsgras","We have time for one more question.","Operator","Your last question will come from Peter Arment from Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I -- this is more of a, I guess, a bigger picture question. I'm just curious about kind of the -- with the international cyber bookings, I assume that this is a segment that's got a low percentage of international mix. But is this an opportunity, I think long-term, to see margins maybe trend higher? Or is that not going to happen until we see kind of trading volume bottom out?","Thomas A. Kennedy","I definitely think that increasing the international content for that business will drive its margins in the upward direction. So you're right in your assumptions moving forward. This has been an activity that we've been pushing heavily here for the last 2 years to essentially leverage our existing international market channels with our other solutions across the entire business. The cyber is just one example. We have other examples across the business where we're doing that. But again, kind of leverage the fact that on the international we -- our margin profiles are stronger.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Is there -- David, any clarification on how much is international today versus where you think it can get to?","David C. Wajsgras","No. I don't think we're ready to get into the mix of international versus domestic on the cyber business. And again, it's a business of products and services and overall solutions. We do see the proportion of international growing over time. But today, I just -- I don't think it's appropriate to get into that level of detail.","Todd B. Ernst","All right, well, before closing, I'd like to turn it over to Tom for some closing remarks.","Thomas A. Kennedy","Yes, before we close the call, this being the week of the Boston Marathon, I wanted to take a moment to recognize our employees who were impacted by last year's bombings. And on behalf of the entire Raytheon team, I want to thank all of those who made this year's marathon a safe and resounding success. Thank you.","Todd B. Ernst","Okay, thank you for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again in our second quarter conference call in July.

And welcome to the Raytheon First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Shanon, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kelsey DeBriyn, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Kelsey DeBriyn","Thank you, Shanon. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our first quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site.","With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We will start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release, and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I will turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Kennedy","Thank you, Kelsey. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon delivered strong operating performance in the first quarter. Sales increased 7.4% and our bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow were all better than expected. We had backlog of over $41 billion, which is up almost $3 billion versus the same period last year. Our trailing four quarter book-to-bill ratio is strong at 1.13, and our growth strategy continues to be aligned with the needs of our global customers.","Overall, I was pleased with our results in the first quarter, including strong performance at IIS and SAS, which more than offset missile's performance, which was below our expectations. Toby will review additional details about the quarter in a few minutes.","Given the constantly evolving threat environment, I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss some of the innovative solutions we are developing consistent with Raytheon's long history of pushing the bounds of what is possible. Today, we are at the forefront providing advanced technology solutions for customers the most complex challenges. And we are seeing strong future opportunities in our core capabilities, such as in radars and missiles. And a great accomplishment for the company and our customer for the first time in March, The U.S. Missile-Defense Agency, in partnership with the industry team, launched two Raytheon exoatmospheric kill vehicle in back-to-back tests.","One EKV successfully destroyed a complex threat representative intercontinental ballistic missile outside of the Earth's atmosphere, while the other EKV gathering test data in what is now known as a two-shot salvo engagement. This was a critical milestone for the ground-based midcourse defense system, and it also relied on Raytheon's advanced sensing capabilities, such as the Sea-Based X-Band Radar, 52 radar and multispectral targeting system on unmanned aerial vehicles to provide EKV with tracking and targeting data of the ICBM.","Next, as we have discussed on prior calls, Raytheon is a leader in providing the next generation of GaN based naval radars. Our air and missile defense radar and our enterprise air surveillance radar for the U.S. Navy and international customers will form the backbone of radar capabilities for U.S. and allied surface fleets of the future. The AMDR provides integrated air and missile defense capabilities with greater range, increased accuracy and higher demonstrated sensitivity, allowing us to counter large and complex rates.","EASR is the navy's next-generation radar for aircraft carriers and amphibious warfare ships that provide simultaneous anti-air and anti-surface warfare, electronic protection and air traffic control capabilities. Understanding our customers' need for performance and disputed relevance, we are making considerable progress on these advanced capabilities. During the first quarter, AMDR completed its latest and most complex test and has exceeded all performance requirements. The radar is currently in low rate initial production and on-schedule for delivery to Navy's first modernized DDG 51 Flight III class ship in 2020. And in March, we booked over $400 million for the next award of 3 AMDR LRIP units.","A for EASR, in April, the radar was moved to Wallace Island in Virginia to begin its next phase of system level testing. We expect EASR to shift from the engineering and manufacturing development phase to the production phase at the end of 2019. And earlier this week, we received the first of two critical contracts from the missile-defense agency valued at approximately $400 million for 52 radars as part of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia's purchase of the terminal high altitude area defense or THAAD area missile defense system. We continue to see the total Raytheon opportunity on this program to be around $3 billion.","In the area missiles, Raytheon is continuing our leadership as a provider of numerous advanced and innovative solutions to our customers. During the quarter, Raytheon and U.S. Army completed a successful preliminary design review for DeepStrike, Raytheon Solution, to meet the Army's precision strike missile, or PrSM requirement. This moves the missile down the development path toward its first flight test planned for later this year. The new missile's range and speed will enable Army combat units to engage targets over vast geographic areas in high threat environments, and will fly farther, faster in fact, more punch than the current missile.","And our franchise win at the naval strike missile for the U.S. Navy last year continues to show opportunities for growth. The missile is offered by Raytheon in partnership with Kongsberg. And recently, we entered into an agreement that expands the franchise further by integrating NSM into U.S. Marines' existing force structure to support the national defense strategy and modernization efforts. And in April, we saw further extension of the NSM franchise with an approved international sale to integrate NSM onto rotary wing aircraft.","We are also developing both offensive and defensive hypersonic systems, and providing our nation's military with the advanced tools they need to stay ahead of the escalating threat. In March Raytheon was awarded the DARPA contract to further develop the tactical boots glide hypersonic weapons program. This joint DARPA and U.S. Air Force effort includes a critical design review, a key step in building the technology.","In addition, we are working on advanced interceptors for missile defense. During the quarter, Raytheon successfully completed more than 1,700 rigorous wind tunnel tests on the newest extended range variant of the combat proven AMRAAM air-to-air missile. Testing is a major step in the missile's qualification for integration with the NASAMS' ground based air defense system. The AMRAAM-ER missile intercept targets at longer distances and higher altitudes, thus, enhancing system performance for our customers worldwide.","While we are pleased with the growth missiles has achieved, and we remain confident about the future opportunities, we recognize there is more work to be done to meet our expectations on performance. The fundamentals that missiles remains very strong and we are implementing action plans to improve program execution. In the mean time, as I previously mentioned, we are pleased with the strength in the rest of our portfolio, especially at IIS and SAS, which offset missile's performance.","In addition to the strong performance at IIS, earlier this year an IIS team demonstrated a land-based expeditionary version of its joint precision approach and landing system with JPALS for the first time to the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corp officials. The precision landing system is currently used on ships to guide F-35Bs in all types of weather. JPALS has the potential to help any fixed or rotary wing aircraft land in rugged low visibility environments at austere bases worldwide.","I would like to highlight one more of our many innovative solutions this one at SAS. Last year, we were selected as one of two companies to complete for the opportunity to provide the mission payload for the next generation overhead for persistent infrared program. Next Gen OPIR is a new missile warning satellite system for the U.S. Air Force aimed at countering emerging global threats.","During the first quarter, we were awarded a proposal update. And in April, we successfully completed the payload system design review on-schedule. We are in an era of rapid technological change. And as a result, it is becoming clear that the solutions our customers will need in the future relative to escalating threats will most likely to be complex systems, integrating multiple technologies, including radars, missiles, missile-defense and cybersecurity. This is an area of strength for Raytheon. With our deep portfolio capabilities and leading franchises across all of our segments, we are well-positioned to be a key partner for our customers.","The initial development of our advanced capabilities is often through our classified work, which as we've discussed on past calls points next-generation technology development that is integral to the long-term growth of our future franchises and production awards. And our Classified Business was once again strong in the first quarter with Classified bookings up 37% and Classified sales up 22% versus the same period last year.","Turning to D.C., we were pleased to see the increase in the base budget and modernization levels in 2020 Department of Defense budget request that was released in March. Raytheon programs fared well in the request with notable increases from weapons, radars and C5ISR programs. The budget request was clearly driven by the priorities of the national defense strategy with the research and development accounts increasing substantially to develop high end capabilities to counter peer threats. And the NDS aligns well with our other innovative solutions that address our customers' most complex challenges. We will continue to work to ensure robust funding for our programs, which are a critical need for customers.","In closing, the Raytheon team remains focused on driving strong execution and future growth, backed by workforce of over 67,000 employees and a corporate culture grounded in our company's values. These values, trust, respect, collaboration, innovation and accountability, guide the way we engage with colleagues, customers, investors and other stakeholders.","Now let me turn the call over to Toby.","Toby O'Brien","Thanks, Tom. I have the opening remarks, starting with the first quarter highlights and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.","So everyone return to Page 3. We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the first quarter with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow better than our expectations. We had bookings in the first quarter, resulting in a strong trailing four quarter book-to-bill ratio of 1.13 and a backlog of over $41 billion. This positions us for continued growth throughout 2019 and beyond.","Our sales in the quarter were $6.7 billion, up 7.4% with growth across all of our businesses. Our EPS from continuing operations was $2.77, better than our guidance and an increase of 25.9% year-over-year. I'll give a little more color on this in just a moment. We had an operating cash outflow of $411 million in the first quarter, better than the guidance we provided in January. And as expected, operating cash flow was lower than last year's first quarter, primarily due to higher net cash taxes and the timing of payments. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.8 shares of common stock for $500 million. And I would add that last month, we announced an 8.6% increase in our dividend. This marks the 15th consecutive year of increasing dividends at Raytheon.","Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our first quarter results. Company bookings for the first quarter were $5.4 billion, resulting in backlog at the end of the first quarter of $41.1 billion. This represents an increase of approximately $3 billion or 8% compared to the first quarter 2018. It's worth noting that around 38% of our backlog is comprised of international programs.","If you now move to Page 5. For the first quarter of 2019, sales were better than the high end of the guidance we set in January. Sales were especially strong at IIS. Looking now at sales by business, IDS had first quarter net sales of $1.6 billion, up 4% compared with the same period last year. The increase from Q1 2018 was primarily driven by higher sales on various Patriot program and a naval radar program. In the first quarter, IIS had net sales of $1.8 billion. Compared with the same quarter last year, the 12% increase was primarily due to higher net sales on classified programs in both cyber and space.","As we've previously discussed, we expect ISS's growth rate to moderate in the back half of the year due to the continued planned ramp down and transition of the Warfighter FOCUS program. Missile systems had net sales of $2 billion, up 9% compared with the same period last year. SAS had net sales of $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2019, up 5% compared to last year's first quarter. The increase from Q1 2018 was primarily due to higher net sales on classified programs. And at Forcepoint, sales were up 12% in the quarter compared with last year's first quarter. Overall, we're pleased with our total company sales, which grew 7.4% in the quarter.","Moving ahead to Page 6. Now, let me spend a few minutes talking about our margins in the quarter. Our operating margin was 16.5% for the total company and 11.8% on a business segment basis, both generally in line with last year's first quarter, and better than our expectations at the company level. IDS margin was lower in the first quarter 2019 as expected, primarily due to lower sales on a large international Patriot program awarded in last year's first quarter. IIS's margin was higher by 310 basis points compared to last year's first quarter, primarily due to a gain of $21 million related to the consolidation as planned of an entity that was previously an equity investment, and from $13 million gain from the sale of excess assets. Excluding these items, the margin at IIS would be about 8.5% better than last year's first quarter, primarily due to higher net program efficiencies.","Missile's margin was lower in the first quarter compared with the same period last year, and lower than our expectation. We expected there to be an impact from program mix in the first quarter, but we also saw lower than planned net program efficiencies, which I'll discuss further when I review our outlook by business.","From a total company point of view, we remain focused on margin improvement going forward, and continue to see our business segment margins in the 12.1% to 12.3% range for the full-year, consistent with the guidance we laid out in January. We see our margin improvement in the back half of the year driven by favorable program mix and productivity improvements.","Turning now to Page 7. First quarter 2019 EPS of $2.77 was up 25.9% from last year's first quarter and was better than our expectations. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by higher sales volume and pension related items.","On Page 8, as I mentioned earlier, we have updated the company's financial outlook for 2019. We continue to expect our full-year 2019 net sales to be in the range of $28.6 billion to $29.1 billion, up 6% to 8% from 2018. We still expect our full-year 2019 EPS to be in the range of $11.40 to $11.60. As I discussed earlier, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock for $500 million in the quarter, and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 279 million and 281 million shares for 2019, driven by the continuation of our share repurchase program.","Operating cash flow in the first quarter was higher than our prior expectations, primarily due to the timing of collections. Given that it is still early in the year and our cash is back half weighted, we continue to see our full-year 2019 operating cash flow outlook to be between 3.9 billion and 4.1 billion. And although not on the Page, it is worth noting that we continue to see our full year 2019 bookings outlook to be between $29.5 billion and $30.5 million.","Turning now to Page 9, as you can see, we've included guidance by business. Before I discuss the other businesses, I wanted to address missiles first. At missiles, as I mentioned earlier, we saw lower-than-expected net program efficiencies this quarter. As a result, we have reduced their outlook to reflect first quarter performance and what we now expect for the balance of the year. We now see their margin to be in the 11.5% to 11.9% range. As Tom mentioned earlier, we have an action plan in place to improve their execution.","The strong performance we saw at both IIS and SAS in the first quarter and their improved outlook for the remainder of the year offset the performance at missiles. This reflects the strength of our balanced portfolio. We now expect ISS margins of 8% to 8.2%, which is up 20 basis points over the prior outlook we provided in January. And we've updated SAS margins to 13.2% to 13.4%, an increase of 30 basis points from our prior outlook. As a result, it's important to note that for the full year 2019, we continue to see our business segment margins in the 12.1% to 12.3% range for the full-year, consistent with the guidance we laid out in January. We are committed to improving margin across all of our businesses. And this focused effort is now starting to come through in the margin performance at our ISS and SAS businesses.","On Page 10, we provided you with our outlook for the second quarter of 2019. As we mentioned on our last call, we still expect the cadence for the balance of 2019 to play out similar to 2018. We see sales, EPS and operating cash flow ramping-up sequentially in the second half of the year. I want to point out that we expect second quarter sales to be in a range of approximately $6.95 billion to $7.1 billion and EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in a range of $2.50 to $2.55. We expect operating cash flow to be in a range of $500 million to $700 million.","Before concluding, I'd like to spend a minute on our capital deployment strategy. As we said on the call in January, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet that provides us with financial flexibility. We remain focused on deploying capital in ways that create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth, obtain a sustainable and competitive dividend, reducing our share count, making targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs and making discretionary contributions to the pension.","In summary, if you stand back and look at the quarter, we had strong performance, which provides a solid foundation for the balance of 2019. Our bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all above our expectations. And we remain well positioned for continued growth.","With that, Tom and I will now open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies and Company. Your line is open.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","On missiles, how do we think about the franchise programs? Tom, you mentioned in your prepared remarks and how they develop longer-term as growth drivers and maybe just the return on sales of those assets. And then as a follow-up, you both mentioned actions have been placed for MS. Can you maybe describe that a little bit more? Thank you.","Tom Kennedy","Let me start-off with the franchises. I think what\u2019s unique about missiles is the fact that they have a strong -- first of all, a very strong stable of existing franchises that have gone to a syndicated refresh here over the last five years. In other words, new technology being inserted into them, essentially give them legs for another two decades. And the other one is that the success we've had in extending those franchises in international marketplace. And what's special now is that we have an opportunity for some, brining some new franchises on-board. We just brought one on-board NSM. I mentioned, how just within a matter of six months, we've extended that franchise into two other mission areas, so essentially doing three mission areas right off the bat.","The other items are the ones where we're in a competition for one is the PrSM, which is a precision strike missile for the United States Army. And that program there it's just had very successful test that had CDR I mentioned and it just had a very successful motor test. So we're very keen that that we're in a very good position to potentially win that new franchise. And that will replace all of the Army's that comes out in the field today and give us the Army number one in a great significant capability, but also a brand new franchise for Raytheon.","And we're also working on the next generation nuclear weapon for the LRSO program that is in competition that has down select out in the 2022 period. And that\u2019s also the next generation weapon for the United States Air Force, and with about over a thousand weapons that will be procured over a period of time. So I feel very strongly about, number one, we call it the competitiveness of our existing franchises and our ability to extend them over a couple decades and then also provide them international legs and the new opportunities we have at missile.","So bottom line is missiles has a lot of upside in terms of growth and we're supporting that. In fact the action plan that we're taking at missiles, this is the -- for us, so we have a new leader that has come on board that\u2019s Wes Kramer. Wes was President of IDS, did a great job for us at IDS. He has also been at missiles support. He ran their largest business area, which was a standard missile business. So he knows the business. He knows the levers to pull to drive I think both continued growth and also margin expansion there. And we know we've been putting in some of the very detailed action plans to go drive margin expansion in the business. We're very certain for the margin range we have for this year's set, but we're also very positive on growing margins incrementally in '20 and then '21, and that sets our main focus at missiles.","Toby O'Brien","And Sheila, I'll just add a little bit on the details of the things that we're doing out there. So there's already been some changes that have been made. There were some modifications to the word structure. Some product lines were consolidated, which obviously reduces management costs. There were some other leadership changes made on the staff. The team out there continues to review the cost structure, looking for opportunities to get benefit of the leverage that we have given the growth we've seen. We're reviewing the factory operations for incremental efficiencies and Wes, as Tom mentioned, will leverage his prior experiences at missiles and will be clearly focused on improving execution.","And there'll be some other things we make, other changes we make along the way. But bottom line, the team is very focused on growing the business, improving program execution and as Tom mentioned, expanding margins.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Raviv with Citi. Your line is open.","Jon Raviv","Tom, you had mentioned an era of rapid technological change. And it's maybe for both of you. Can you talk about the earnings algorithm in that era where we're seeing obviously this trade-off between growth in margin, which should maybe reverse in a couple years? And then also you mentioned that customer in that era want more integrated solutions. So how do they balance that desire for integration with them wanting more open architectures and maintaining competition? Perhaps in that answer you can also address the LTAM's competition. Thank you.","Tom Kennedy","Well, first of all, we are having an explosion in technology. I mean essentially people talk about the fact that there's an exponential change in technology that is occurring now with things like machine learning, nanotechnology, quantum computing coming onboard out of the manufacturing. And we're heavily involved in all of those areas. I think our customer realizes that they need to take advantage of those new technologies to be able to generate the next generation of capability to put the United States in a premier position from a defense perspective. And so we're seeing a lot of activity in R&D on the government side to bring those new technologies to fruition.","And what we're doing at Raytheon, our strategy is to take those technologies and again upgrade our existing franchises, whether they be radars or missiles, ground stations, ground systems and then also generate the next generation ones. And so we're playing both extending our existing franchises and then also working to take these new technologies to win new franchises. So we're -- the fact that we're all over that and the prime example, and you brought it up is the U.S. Army's Lower Tier Air Missile Defense Sensor, we call it LTAM.","We are in a competition on that and we'll be proceeding here in May to something called the U.S. Army sense-off. What we're doing there is we're taking brand new technology and then start to coming up with the new 360 degree active electronically scanned array radar using our high-end GaN technology that we produced here at the Raytheon company. We expect the sense of this taking place in May and June of this year. And at some point, we believe the Army will complete their analysis. There is an RFP that's out there. So sometime late '19 early 2020, we expect to down select there.","Toby O'Brien","Jon, let me maybe just add a little bit on the part of the question related to the earnings algorithm or exactly how you put that, just a couple things to remember right. So we've talked before a lot last year about the mix we're seeing, the change in the mix, driven by the National Defense Strategy and obviously the changing technology plays into that as well. And just as a reminder, the segment margin that we guided to this year, it has about 20 basis points of margin headwind that we see because of that mix and we're offsetting that in a little bit more with about 40 basis points of productivity. We're clearly in an era or a time when we are winning many of these new developing classified programs. And as Tom said, we see them as future franchises that ultimately transition and lead to production over time.","And as I mentioned, near term margin pressure but it should be tailwinds to margin in the future. These awards strengthen our portfolio right. We're all about franchises. And the more franchise that we can get, help and we expand those internationally at a point in time as well. So while we've seen some puts and takes as a result of this, especially in our 2019 guidance by business, we continue to see margin expansion going forward. And again, don't forget about our international content. About 30% of our business is international. It's on the higher end of our margin scale that we have to have the benefit of working to leverage when looking at the earnings equation also.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Harnett with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Doug Harnett","I\u2019d like to go back to missiles, because I just want to understand what's been the evolution here. We've really seen margin guidance reduced for four quarters in a row now essentially. I understand that some of last year that was attributed to a mix shift to more development. But now when you look at Q1, we actually see the backlog drop by more than $1 billion in missiles, and you made a leadership change. Can you talk about how you've looked at this unit over the last three to four quarters? And what you've seen is the issues there and when did you come to the decision that there had to be some significant changes.","Tom Kennedy","Let me start off and then Toby will follow. The first thing is in terms of the leadership change the prior leader, prior president, Taylor did informed the company that he was plans to retire. So that president change was based on that retirement request. And so we were able to at the time bring on a very strong player that's Wes Kremer, and I'd say he's a strong player, because right now he is running the IDS business and he's doing quite well. And it's a similar type of business to missile. They do have in strong franchises there, lot of production, and also a lot of growth opportunity at IDS. And so we're taking that to the missile company, applying some of the techniques that Wes put in place and we have in place and we have in place at IDS at the missile company.","But I think in the end game, first, it was originally as a initially relative to mix. We were winning and have one quite a few contracts in missiles and in development area and essentially it\u2019s the R&D area for the government, which put pressure on us from a mix perspective. The other issue we were seeing is that we do have quite a bit of production programs going on here. And we weren't seeing as much pick-up on the production programs that we have seen in the past. And this started about probably about three quarters ago. And so we are putting much emphasis on essentially on the leaning out the factory, really working on our supply-chain and really driving productivity across all the production programs. The mix is a mix. But what we can do is we can drive essentially significant improvement in the factories and in our supply chain to drive margin expansion on that part.","And I'll let Toby to answer some of this too.","Toby O'Brien","So Dough, just to your questions about what\u2019s happened overtime with the guidance, a lot of that last year was around the mix. And we did get hit with a lot more of the lower margin development classified work. We believe the guidance for this year going back to what we provided in January properly size that relative to missiles, the mix effect. We still feel that's the case today. The change that you're seeing here in the quarter is as we said around performance and execution. There were a couple of program adjustments in the quarter at missiles.","We did have one that was about $15 million. But when you step back from it, they are growing the effects of mix, I think are well understood, we think that's right. And it was all performance related. So as I said before, we took that into account, relook at the year and made the adjustments. I think Tom said in his opening remarks the fundamentals there remain strong and we believe that.","Our comment to your comment about the backlog. So I think it's important, you can't take one quarter and think of that as trend, either good or bad. I'd take you back to the fact that missiles has been leading growth in the company going back the last four or so years. As a reminder, last year they had a book-to-bill of 1.09, it was 1.26 in 2017. The book-to-bill was low in the quarter, which is what drove the backlog down. It's all timing related. I would tell you, we expect north of $9 billion of bookings at missiles this year, a book-to-bill of 1.05 or greater. Again, I think we've talked about it before. We expect two multiyear production awards in the back half of this year out at missiles that is part of what is going drive that. So I wouldn't read anything into the change in the backlog in the quarter, other than just timing related to some large bookings.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Robert Stallard","Just on the missile theme, unfortunately. If you sort out the performance issues, what sort of benefit could you have to the operating margin in this business going forward? So ignoring mix just the productivity.","Tom Kennedy","So Rob, I think the way to think of it, and I'll maybe start with this year and move forward for you here. So first of all, again, as Tom said, we believe we sized it. We've adjusted their range downwards, it's 11.7% at the midpoint, which is in line with where they ended last year. And we think we've seen -- see that appropriately. We would expect the cadence of margin to improve quarter-to-quarter throughout this year with a little bit of a bias towards the second half. And then when you think about 2020 and beyond, if I were to take it back to the 2016 timeframe, 2017 even 2015. Missiles was generating margins in the 13% range before we started to see this higher influx of the development in the classified work, and I believe that's still attainable, albeit out in time, because it's going to take time, both for these development programs to transition into production and to implement some of the actions that we talked about and refocus on the program execution.","So we're not going to peg a number, but we would say improvements, incremental improvements in 2020 and beyond, driven by both the combination as that mix shifts a little bit more favorably, the production, the two big multiyear awards get into a strong production cadence out in the future and we execute better. It's going to be a combination of all that. But clearly, the business has demonstrated in the past, especially when the mix is different how they can perform.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.","George Shapiro","You wound up beating the high-end of your EPS guidance by $0.25. You beat the high-end of your sales guidance by $150 million. I mean, a lot of this is due to IIS. But you didn't raise the guidance or the sales guidance. And usually, when you beat it by this much, you raise it by something. So is it all IIS where Warfighter sales didn't come down this quarter, aren\u2019t expected to come down? And then also, was there any benefit to IIS sales from the consolidation that you did in the quarter? And any other color you might provide. Thanks.","Tom Kennedy","I'll address the couple of IIS things, and then I'll tell you how we're thinking about the year from a company level. So the Warfighter sales came down in the quarter like we expected, but year-over-year we're looking at about $0.5 billion reduction. Most of that's in the back half of the year. So there is there is an imbalance first half, second half relative to how Warfighter is going to impact the revenue cadence at IIS. I would tell you even with that decline the rest of the IIS business is strong. You saw some of that in the first quarter in the cyber and space areas. And ex-Warfighter IIS is growing around 10% for the year.","The consolidation of the entity that you referred that you asked about did have about $38 million impact in the quarter on revenue. So that's IIS. At a total company level, as we said, we're pleased with the first quarter results. They did exceed our expectations at the company level. Some of the higher sales volume we saw was timing related, driven by timing. And it clearly gives us confidence in our outlook of our 6% to 8% growth for the year. We mentioned the favorable performance at IIS and SAS, and we improved their total-year guidance. But those improvements were offset by the decrease in the missiles margin for the quarter that we flowed through to the year. So in total, as we said, the range stayed the same for segment margins, 12.1 to 12.3.","Bringing it down to EPS, we were $0.35 higher than the high-end of our guidance range as you mentioned. Roughly half of that driven by the timing of sales and margins within the year, the other half driven by the timing of some corporate and non-operational items within the year that would now be expected to have a impact, a negative impact in the back half. So the change in margin guidance at the two businesses that improved IIS and SAS that flowed through and offset missiles. It's early in the year. We continue to be focused on growing the top line and improving margins.","And then I'd just add for completeness. I think I mentioned in my opening remarks. We were pleased with the cash performance for the quarter, about $140 million better than the high-end of our guidance. It was timing related. It's early. The $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion that we have out there for the year would be on top of the, or is on top of the record performance we saw last year. Bottom line, we will keep an eye on all this, but we're confident in the outlook for the year. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Strauss, Barclays. Your line is open.","David Strauss","Last one on missiles and then also one other question. Toby, I think you said you highlighted, maybe a $15 million negative to EAC. What were the total negative EACs in missiles in the quarter? And then on cash deployment, I think the $500 million share repo number, that\u2019s a biggest I've seen on a quarterly basis that you guys done. How you're thinking about share repo from here? And then also the potential to potentially pull forward some of the future pension contribution needs into this year? Thanks.","Toby O'Brien","So on missiles, just to put in perspective, the net EAC adjustments in the quarter were $4 million, and they were above $69 million -- a little over $60 million of negatives. And again, if you just kind of think of the 9.5% margin. If the performance had been more, the EAC adjustments had been more aligned with our expectation, we would've been in a plus or minus 11% margin range for the quarter. Again, the issues we're dealing with here in missiles in the quarter are related to their performance. On the share repo, we continue to see value in our shares. We are committed to the share repurchase program. The outlook for the year, similar from a dollar value point you give or take to next year -- to last year about $1.3 billion and the 2 plus percent reduction. And we will continue to evaluate that.","As far as the pension goes, we will, per our normal practice, we're looking at that all the time. But we'll have a clearer view of that as we get towards the back half of the year. We obviously want to see what's going on from an overall cash generation, allocation of capital and certainly what's happening in the market and how the plans are performing. Last year, just as a reminder, the reason we did something a little bit earlier was we got the benefit with the change in the tax laws to make the deduction at the prior tax rate of the 35%. So we were a little bit ahead of when we would normally look at discretionary contributions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Cai von Rumohr","So your guidance for the second quarter, 250 to 255 in earnings, looks like we get a fair amount of margin compression given your revenue guide. Could you walk us through maybe some of the puts and takes on margins, particularly missiles? Do we have some more pain to get things under control in the second quarter? And is that the reason for what looks like a light margin guide? Thanks.","Toby O'Brien","So typically for the company, our segment margins do ramp up in the second half. And obviously, therefore, start a bit lower in first half. We did see some Q1 margins, about 50 basis points higher than our expectations, so that we were ahead of our guidance, ahead of our expectations on the segment margins in Q1. A decent portion of this improvement was driven by the timing of some profit previously expected in Q2, primarily at both IIS and SAS and therefore, taking that all into account does result in a lower margin in Q2. If I look at the businesses, specifically for Q2, we do see lower IDS and IIS margins compared to Q1. And also just as a bit of a reminder, Forcepoint traditionally or typically does have a loss in both Q1 and Q2 due to the seasonality of their business.","So although the Q2 margin expectations, they are a little bit lower, we do feel good about our guidance for the total year of the 12.1 to 12.3. And I can tell you we have had years in the past where the cadence was similar. And part of that is driven, as I mentioned, by Forcepoint given that they are in a loss for the first half of the year and a profit in the back half as their volume increases.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Spingarn","So Tom, I wanted to go to hypersonics and think about Raytheon's positioning in offensive hypersonics. So you talked about the TBG, and I think you want something -- I'll hop a few years. But it seems like one of your competitors has been winning a lot of the hypersonic work lately. Where do you stand and what are the opportunities, can you catch up or is this the wrong way to think about it?","Tom Kennedy","Let me start off with what we are doing right now. So on the offensive, and I think I mentioned on our prior call that the defensive hypersonics is actually a bigger market than the offensive. But on the offensive, we are heavily involved in multiple programs. One of them is the air breathing hypersonics weapons program, and that's with the DARPA program. And then we are working on that program. We are also on a hypersonic boost glide weapons program, one of them is the tactical boost glide program that I mentioned on my -- during my discussion upfront. So that's essentially the two big programs that we are engaged in from a hypersonic perspective on the offensive side.","We are also working several other arrangements in hypersonic area that I can't really get into on the phone here. But we feel we're in a very strong position relative to where we want to be on offensive hypersonics. On defensive side, we are heavily involved in that several activities involved in that, but it also moves on beyond just the missile part also moves into the sensor part, both on land and in space. So the overall area of hypersonics is a big opportunity for Raytheon where we believe we're engaged in the right elements of that and we're proceeding forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Seth Seifman","I wanted to ask briefly another question about IIS, where excluding any Warfighter headwind as the performance has been consistently good for several quarters now both sales and margins. I mean, if we look just specifically at the margin and we exclude the one timers from the quarter. It's been consistently mid-80s for the past three quarters now? I mean is this mid-8 business going forward, and if not why not? And you're obviously growing nicely, the end markets are growing and it seems like you're taking some share to. How do you think about the growth potential in the out years?","Toby O'Brien","Let me jump in there and obviously Tom can add any color if he wants and hopefully I get it all you broke up a little bit on the question, but I'll go back to Q1 performance right and kind of, to your question about the margins. If we exclude the couple items that we talked about in the comments in the release around the consolidation of the entity that we planned on, in the material sales, right. IIS would have about 8.5% margin in the quarter and there see a real strong execution. That was largely driven by their net program efficiencies compared to where they perhaps perform to the last year in their prior guidance. So, we expect them to continue to perform at a strong level going forward I think I have said before this business can certainly get a north of 8% on a consistent basis from a margin point of view.","I think they have got the execution side of it down really well based upon how they performed last year and certainly into the first quarter this year. I think as everybody knows they are the one business right that from their business model has the structure that drives the margins to be a little suppress right to have the least amount of fixed price and the least amount of international work, but I know Dave and the team are working hard to improve that especially in the area of cyber and various international opportunities.","So I expect they are going to continue to grow even with the headwinds of Warfighter that they will be through this year between cyber and space and international. And I would expect that over time they will continue to incrementally improve the margins and that they clearly have the ability to get this business to operate in the very high single-digit margins, albeit over time especially as that mix transitions and becomes a little bit more international biased.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Your line is open.","Pete Skibitski","One more question on missiles but more from a revenue standpoint. Tom, I know you guys kind of organized each of your segment by product area and I'm wondering which of the product areas within MS is going to grow the fastest this year to get it to your guidance? And just how dependent is the guidance on signing the two multi-year on the SM this year?","Tom Kennedy","So, I think a big player this year for missiles and actually for their segment that has the two multi-year in it, the SM-3, Block 1B multi-year and the SM-6 multi-year. And those are combined that's about four over little bit over $4 billion booking. And so the ramping up the latter half of this year and obviously into 2020 and beyond. I think they're going to get significant because they are multi-year -- its five-year multi-year will give them significant base improvements and their factories moving forward. We are seeing across all elements all the business areas within missiles significant growth and also significant international demand signals. So I think it's maybe Toby, give you the exact numbers here but we are very positive on the growth side of missiles and so again we want to leverage the fact that we are growing not just on the development programs but now with these two multi-years on the production programs; when we want to leverage that to drive productivity and efficiency improvements to essentially drive the inter-margin expansion going in the right direction also.","Toby O'Brien","The only thing I would add, Pete. As Tom, hit it right on. I mean they have got such a broad portfolio there isn't a single program or program area that were dependent upon here in the near term certainly this year and into the future to drive the growth that's coming from some of the classified work, some of our air-to-air business, the missile defense business that SM-3, participates in. So I think that's a key feature they have got the largest amount of franchises in the company. And while they are all at various stages they are all contributing or most all are contributing to the growth this year.","Kelsey DeBriyn","Shannon, we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Our last question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is open.","Carter Copeland","I wondered you called out in missiles in the K, a charge on a next-gen precision strike weapon. And then in your earlier remarks you mentioned a couple of charges. Can you tell us a bit if that's the same program if we added another program, if we're talking about an expansion of loss making or zero margin work there. And then just in general with respect to the mix at missiles with respect to the 2019 plan versus 2018? How much more of the cost type of work do you have as a percentage this year than say you'd had last year? Thanks.","Tom Kennedy","Let me start with the last one first. At missiles in particular the cost type mix and directionally is, think of it as maybe five to seven points -- 500 to 700 basis points higher or more biased toward cost type versus fixed price on a year-over-year basis. On your first question, I mentioned, I figured who asked the question earlier but when I was talking about the performance and I mentioned in the quarter we had a one adjustment that was about $15 million. It is not the same program that you referenced from the K, this was an international test range upgrade program that we saw some growth driven by design related issues in the early phases and we are now moving into the production in the integration phase. So, it's not the same program that was driving the negative adjustments that I referred to here in Q1.","Kelsey DeBriyn","That's all the time we have today. Thank you for joining us this morning.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kelsey DeBriyn, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Kelsey Ann DeBriyn - Raytheon Co.","Thank you, Derek. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our second quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com.","Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website. With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Thank you, Kelsey. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon's growth strategy continued to deliver results for our shareholders and customers. In the second quarter sales increased 5.5% and our bookings, sales, EPS, and operating cash flow were all better than expected.","We continue to see strong global demand for our advanced solutions. Our book-to-bill ratio in the second quarter was 1.31. This drove an increase in backlog of $3.7 billion year-over-year to a new record backlog of approximately $40 billion. Given these strong results and opportunities we see in the second half of the year we are increasing our bookings outlook for the year by $1 billion driven by strength primarily in our classified business. We are also increasing our sales and EPS guidance for the year. Toby will discuss additional details about our second quarter performance and updates to our guidance in a few minutes.","Now let me share some highlights from our domestic business where we saw strong growth in bookings and sales in the second quarter. Domestic bookings were up over 60% year-over-year and domestic sales grew 6.5% in the quarter. For the company, bookings growth in the quarter was driven by classified, which represented over 30% of our total bookings. In fact, we set a new company record for classified bookings in a quarter which more than doubled over the same period last year. We had classified bookings in the quarter of $1.1 billion at SAS, $800 million at IIS and $700 million at Missiles.","Classified sales also set a new record in the quarter, up over 20% versus the same period last year. As a reminder, our classified business is important as it often funds technology development that is integral to the long term growth of our future franchises and production awards.","Our strength in classified is driven in large part by the need of our domestic customers to address advanced threats and demonstrates Raytheon's alignment to the National Defense Strategy. The increase from the fiscal year 2018 Defense Appropriations Bill is starting to come through in our domestic bookings, especially in classified and we are starting to see some of the increase to sales. But as we said last quarter, we will see a majority of the sales impact starting in 2019 and beyond.","To prepare for this growth in classified, in May, Missiles dedicated new facilities as part of its expansion in Arizona. The first buildings are scheduled to be completed this year and include an advanced testing facility. The full expansion is expected to be complete in 2020 to support the development of advanced solutions and includes engineering and manufacturing enhancements, new laboratories and high power computing capabilities.","During the quarter we also expanded the content we have on the F-35 fighter jet. In June, Raytheon was selected to develop and deliver the next generation distributed aperture system or DAS for the F-35. The DAS collects and sends high-resolution, real-time imagery to the pilot's helmet display from six infrared cameras mounted around the aircraft.","With the ability to detect and track threats from any angle, the F-35 DAS gives pilots unprecedented situational awareness of the battle space. Our DAS system enhances capability and reliability versus the prior system. We have been developing this technology over the past few years, which will be applicable to other aircraft including the rotorcraft market.","And in April, Raytheon and the U.S. Navy completed the final development test to integrate the Joint Standoff Weapon C onto the F-35 variant. This keeps these low-cost, air-to-ground missiles on track for full deployment in 2019. The JSOW glide weapon uses a GPS inertial navigation system with an imaging infrared seeker that can identify and track targets autonomously. JSOW C can eliminate the toughest high-value land targets at ranges greater than 70 nautical miles, day or night and in adverse weather conditions.","Also in April we completed developmental testing on the Small Diameter Bomb II, also known as StormBreaker. This is a key step toward bringing this new capability to our domestic and international markets. U.S. government operational testing is scheduled to be completed later this year. StormBreaker can eliminate a wider range of targets with fewer aircraft, reducing the pilot's time in harm's way.","(6:26) detects, classifies and tracks targets even in adverse weather conditions from standoff ranges. Raytheon and the U.S. Air Force have completed aircraft integration for the F-15E and have begun integration activities for the F\/A-18E and F and the F-35B with the U.S. Navy.","Also during the quarter, the U.S. Navy selected the Naval Strike Missile for over-the-horizon defense of littoral combat ships and future frigates. NSM is a fifth-generation long-range precision strike weapon that can find and destroy enemy ships at distances up to 100 nautical miles away.","The missile is offered by Raytheon in partnership with Kongsberg. And because it's already a proven and operational solution, NSM saves the U.S. billions of dollars in development costs. The contract includes options which if exercised would bring the contract value to approximately $850 million.","NSM is a new missile franchise for Raytheon, and our goal is to replace the existing domestic and international inventory of Harpoon and other international surface-to-surface missiles, making NSM a multibillion-dollar franchise opportunity.","Turning to international, last week at the Farnborough International Air Show, we hosted over 800 meetings with a wide range of global customers. Having spoken personally to customers at the show, as well as on other customer visits, I can tell you that demand for our advanced solutions is strong and growing across Europe, Asia-Pacific and MENA as nations look to protect their sovereignty, deter adversaries and acquire counterinsurgency\/counterterrorism capabilities.","We have a strong pipeline of international booking opportunities ahead. In May, we booked over $300 million on our first award with Romania to purchase our combat-proven Patriot air and missile defense system. The next award is expected in 2019, and additional follow-on awards to complete the program are expected to be booked in 2020 and 2021. We continue to see the total Raytheon Romania Patriot opportunity to be around $2 billion.","Our other international Patriot opportunities remain on track as well. We still expect Sweden to sign the LOA with the U.S. government to purchase our Patriot air and missile defense system in the second half of 2018. This paves the way for the U.S. government to begin contract negotiations with Raytheon for a booking in 2019. The Sweden Patriot opportunity for Raytheon is expected to be around $1 billion. For our Poland Patriot opportunity, we still anticipate a booking for Phase I in 2019 and Phase II in 2020. The Phase I opportunity for Raytheon is expected to be over $1 billion, with the total Raytheon Poland Patriot opportunity to be around $5 billion.","Turning to Washington, we are pleased that Congress is moving forward with the fiscal year 2019 funding bills including Defense. The fiscal year 2019 request is consistent with the newly revised BCA caps and will keep DOD modernization funding at about the same elevated level of fiscal year 2018. We continue to see congressional support for the National Defense Strategy modernization priorities where Raytheon has strong core capabilities.","I want to close by underscoring one of the foundations of our success, and that is our culture of innovation. This reflects the fact that we are a technology company, and for generations our global team has been pushing the bounds of what's possible. The awards and opportunities I mentioned earlier are just some of the most recent examples of our innovation in action.","And last month, we were the proud recipient of the 10 millionth patent in U.S. history, one of Raytheon's more than 13,000 active patents. I want to thank the Raytheon team for continuing to champion a culture of innovation, which helps us to create the trusted, innovative solutions we are known for around the world.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Toby.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the second quarter highlights and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, if everyone would please turn to Page 3. We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the second quarter with bookings, sales, EPS, and operating cash flow all better than our expectations.","We had strong bookings in the second quarter of $8.7 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.31. Sales were $6.6 billion in the quarter, up 5.5% led by our IIS and Missiles businesses. Our EPS from continuing operations was $2.78, better than our guidance and an increase of 47.1% year-over-year.","I'll give a little more color on this in just a moment. We generated strong operating cash flow of $1.2 billion in the second quarter, which was also better than our prior guidance primarily due to favorable collections and lower net cash taxes of approximately $250 million related to the discretionary pension plan contribution that we'll make in the third quarter 2018. I'll discuss this further in a few minutes.","During the quarter the company repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $400 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 3.8 million shares for $800 million. And based upon our strong performance to-date I want to point out that for the second time this year we are raising the full year 2018 outlook for sales and EPS. We are also raising the full year 2018 outlook for bookings, as well as making other updates, primarily for pension and tax related items. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.","Turning now to Page 4, let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Company bookings for the second quarter were $8.7 billion, which were $2.2 billion or 33% higher than the same period last year. And on a year-to-date basis, bookings were $15 billion, which were $2.8 billion or 23% higher than the comparable period last year.","It's worth noting that on a trailing four quarter basis our book-to-bill ratio was 1.18 and our bookings were a record $30.5 billion over that same period. As Tom mentioned, these strong bookings position the company well for future growth. For the quarter, international was 21% of our total company bookings and on a year-to-date basis was 31%.","For the year, we expect international to be about 35% to 37% of total bookings. Backlog at the end of the second quarter was a record $39.9 billion, up over $3.7 billion or 10% compared to last year's second quarter. Approximately 40% of our backlog is comprised of international programs.","We now move to Page 5. For the second quarter 2018, sales were above the high end of the guidance we set in April primarily due to better than expected performance at our IIS business. For the second quarter our international sales were approximately 31% of total sales. And as we mentioned on past calls we expect sales for the company to accelerate throughout the year with a stronger second half driven by our bookings over the past several quarters.","Looking now at sales by business. IDS had second quarter 2018 net sales of $1.5 billion, up 4% compared with the same quarter last year. The increase from Q2 2017 was primarily driven by higher sales on an international Patriot program that was awarded in the first quarter of 2018. In the second quarter 2018 IIS had net sales of $1.7 billion. The 8% increase compared with Q2 2017 was primarily due to higher net sales on classified programs, the DOMino cyber program and the Air and Space Operations Center Weapon System program. And as we've previously discussed, we expect IIS growth rate to moderate in the back half of the year due to the planned ramp down and transition on the Warfighter FOCUS program.","Missile Systems had second quarter 2018 net sales of $2.1 billion, up 8% compared with the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher net sales on classified programs. We expect the growth rate at Missiles to be stronger for the balance of the year.","SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion, in line with last year's second quarter. As a reminder, we see growth in the second half of the year at SAS. And for Forcepoint, sales were up 7% compared with the same quarter last year. We expect the growth rate will continue to accelerate across the next two quarters as indicated by bookings strength in the second quarter of $148 million, up 29% versus the same period last year. Overall we're pleased with our total company sales which grew 5.5% in the quarter.","Moving ahead to Page 6. Overall we delivered solid margin performance in the quarter. Our operating margin in the quarter was 16.6% for the total company and 11.7% on a business segment basis and as expected, lower than last year's second quarter primarily due to mix.","So looking now at margins by business. IDS second quarter 2018 operating margin was strong at 17.3%, which benefited from productivity improvements as well as favorable mix versus Q2 of 2017. IIS operating margin was up slightly compared to last year's second quarter. The decrease in margin at Missiles in the quarter compared with the same period last year was primarily driven by an expected change in mix. We see Missiles' operating margin improving in the back half of the year.","As expected, SAS margin was lower in the quarter compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by a change in program mix and other performance in the second quarter of 2018. And at Forcepoint as we discussed on past calls, operating income was negative for the quarter. This is due to an increase in operating cost to support Forcepoint's long-term growth. We expect Forcepoint's operating income to be positive in both the third and fourth quarters of 2018.","Turning now to Page 7, second quarter 2018 EPS was $2.78, higher than last year's second quarter primarily due to the favorable impact of tax reform and the tax impact from the third quarter 2018 discretionary pension plan contribution. It's worth noting the discretionary pension plan contribution was not included in our prior guidance and I'll discuss it further in a moment. In addition, second quarter EPS was better than our guidance primarily due to higher sales volume, timing and the tax impact of the previously mentioned discretionary pension plan contribution.","On Page 8 we've provided you with a 2018 financial outlook walk to bridge our prior guidance from April to our current guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we are increasing our full year 2018 guidance for sales and EPS to reflect our improved operating performance as well as for tax and pension related items. Let me take you through each of these items.","In operations, we increased the sales range by $200 million, driven by higher domestic orders primarily in the classified area. This increase contributes about $0.05 to 2018 full year EPS. Next, there are a couple of pension related items to discuss. First, a $1.25 billion pre-tax discretionary pension plan contribution will be made by September 15, 2018 using cash on hand. As a reminder, we have discussed making a potential discretionary pension plan contribution on past calls.","Since the decision was made in the second quarter 2018, a $95 million net tax benefit was recorded in the second quarter which had a favorable impact to the effective tax rate for the full year of 310 basis points and a favorable EPS impact of $0.33. In addition, as a result of the discretionary pension plan contribution, I want to point out that our outlook for operating cash flow from continuing operations was reduced for the full year 2018 by approximately $1 billion. This reduction is the net impact of the third quarter 2018 $1.25 billion discretionary pension plan contribution, favorably offset by lower net cash taxes of approximately $250 million related to that contribution.","Moving on, some of the company's pension plans purchased a group annuity contract to transfer to an insurance company nearly $1 billion of outstanding pension benefit obligations related to certain U.S. retirees and beneficiaries of some of our non-CAS covered and previously discontinued operations. This transaction closed on July 17, 2018. In connection with this transaction an unfavorable non-cash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $288 million pre-tax, $228 million after tax, will be recognized in the third quarter 2018, primarily related to the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses in those plans.","This will have a favorable impact to the effective tax rate for the full year of 30 basis points and an estimated unfavorable EPS impact of $0.79 in both the third quarter and full year 2018. This transaction will have no impact to our operating cash flow from continuing operations. To summarize, this transaction reduces and de-risks about $1 billion of pension obligation.","Lastly, due to other tax improvements, we see a favorable impact to the effective tax rate for the full year of 410 basis points primarily related to various tax planning initiatives and further refinement of the estimated impact of the new tax law passed in December 2017. This has an estimated favorable EPS impact of $0.48 for the full year 2018.","To summarize, we now expect our full year 2018 net sales to be in the range of between $26.7 billion and $27.2 billion, up 5% to 7% from 2017. The year-over-year increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business. We have lowered our effective tax rate to reflect the discretionary pension plan contribution, pension plan annuity transaction and other tax improvements that I just discussed. We now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 10.5% for the year.","We've increased our full-year 2018 EPS by $0.07 from our prior guidance and now expect it to be in a range of $9.77 to $9.97. As discussed, the increase is driven by our improved operational performance in the second quarter, as well as the improvement to the effective tax rate, largely offset by the unfavorable noncash, nonoperating $0.79 impact of the pension plan annuity transaction.","Moving to operating cash flow from continuing operations, as a result of the discretionary pension plan contribution discussed earlier, we are updating our 2018 operating cash flow outlook to be between $2.6 billion and $3 billion. Similar to last year, our cash flow profile is more heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter due to the timing of program milestones and collections on some of our larger contracts. It's worth noting that based on the third quarter 2018 $1.25 billion discretionary pension plan contribution, we would expect to see an improvement in operating cash flow from continuing operations in 2019 and 2020.","As I sit here today, holding all pension related assumptions from our January call constant, we would expect the gross funding required for the pension to decrease by an estimated $1 billion over 2019 and 2020 combined. I'd also note that the discretionary pension plan contribution and the pension plan annuity transaction will have no impact on our CAS recovery in 2019 and 2020.","I would add again, holding all pension-related assumptions from our January call constant, as a result of the two pension transactions we would expect a roughly $100 million favorable net impact to nonoperating pension expense over 2019 and 2020 combined. And as we have done in the past, we will provide a further update to the gross funding required and other pension assumptions on our fourth quarter 2018 call in January.","On Page 9, we've provided you with our standard updated 2018 financial outlook, most of which I just discussed. I do want to point out that we tightened our diluted share count to be approximately 287 million shares for 2018. And as you can see on Page 10, we've included guidance by business. We've increased the full-year sales outlook at both Missile Systems and IIS and for the total company to reflect the combination of stronger bookings and sales performance to-date and second half expectations.","Now turning to margin, we've increased the range and expect higher full-year operating margin performance for IDS, IIS and SAS. The strong year-to-date results exceeded our prior estimates. We lowered the range of our full-year operating margin guidance for Missiles, driven by the change in program mix and a change in the timing of an expected favorable resolution of a contractual matter.","At the business segment level, we continue to see operating margin in a range of 12.5% to 12.7% for the full year. And at the company level, we continue to see total operating margin to be in a range of 17.1% to 17.3% for the full year. Before moving on to Page 11, as I mentioned earlier, we are now raising our full-year 2018 bookings outlook to a range of $28.5 billion to $29.5 billion. This reflects a $1 billion increase to the prior range and is driven by strong demand from our domestic customers, primarily in the classified area.","On Page 11 we have provided guidance on how we currently see the third quarter of 2018. We expect our third quarter sales to be in a range of a little under $6.6 billion to $6.7 billion, and we expect EPS from continuing operations for Q3 to be in a range of $1.88 to $1.93, which includes the unfavorable $0.79 impact of the pension plan annuity transaction.","For EPS, when modeling the second half effective tax rate, you can think of the third quarter as similar to the second quarter, maybe a bit lower, and the fourth quarter as similar to the first quarter, maybe a bit lower there as well. And for operating cash flow we expect Q3 to be an outflow in a range of $1.07 billion to $870 million. As a reminder, the outflow is due to the third quarter 2018 $1.25 billion discretionary pension plan contribution.","Before concluding, I'd like to spend a minute on our capital deployment strategy. As we said on the call in April, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet that provides us with financial flexibility. We remain focused on deploying capital in ways that create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investment to support our growth, paying a sustainable and competitive dividend, reducing our share count, making targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs and making discretionary contributions to the pension.","In summary, if you stand back and look at the quarter, we had strong performance. Our bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all higher than expected. We increased our full year 2018 sales and EPS outlook for the second time this year and increased our bookings outlook by $1 billion. We took actions to de-risk our pension and remain well-positioned for continued growth.","With that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Rob Spingarn, Credit Suisse.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Rob.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Hi, Rob.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Tom, I wanted to ask you about the DAS win and F-35. It seems the program is constantly looking to lower cost and increase value. The predecessor, the incumbent did a no bid there on the basis at least from their perspective that the value wasn't there. So how do we reconcile that with your win? And are there future opportunities? It sounds like the EW system and maybe the C&I could come up for recompete?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Let me just kind of set the stage here, the system that we offer is a system that's been under development at Raytheon in the last several years, but we have had this DAS product for many years. I think what's different with this EO-DAS solution it's using our latest technology, which is giving us two I would say competitive advantage.","One, this new technology gives us significantly higher performance than the technology that was used to develop the original system, which \u2013 the technology stake in the ground was back in 2001. So that probably makes a lot of sense that new technology would be a lot better than the old technology. That's one.","But the other area that it gives us a significant benefit for is cost. This new technology has allowed us to significantly reduce the cost of these type of products, so we were able to bring to the marketplace a system that had twice the performance and about half the cost of the systems and technology that were developed back in the 2000s.","And that's a technology that we've been developing over the years in other product areas such as electronic warfare, ICNIA, radars, and constantly trying to do two things with the technology. One is obviously increase the performance, but at the same time, really try to lower the cost. And I think that's the big difference here.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Doug Harned, Bernstein.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Hi, Doug.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Doug.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Can you talk a little bit about Missile Systems. And you took down the margin guidance a little bit. But if you had not had the contractual issue that you described, what would the margin guidance have been? I'm trying to understand how we should think about the long-term margins at Missile Systems which have been quite good. You've got quite a large backlog there, so I would expect it would give you good visibility into what the longer term margin performance should be?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, Doug, it's Toby. Let me walk you through that. So we did reduce the margin outlook really based upon two factors. One, we talked about for the quarter good strength in domestic and especially classified volume and that's what drove the bookings outlook for the year. A big portion of that is related to Missiles.","So the way to think about the change in the margin for the year, the mix because of higher classified volume is about 20 basis points of the change. And then the balance of it or 30 basis points is related to the timing of what we expect to be a favorable resolution of a contractual matter that we had assumed in the back half of 2018 moving out of the year.","I'll just add a little bit of color. I won't get into it in detail or the specifics of it but only to say we're making progress with it. And to put it in the right context, there's no downside to this. This is not a problem. We don't have anything recorded on the books for it. It's only upside to Missiles once that ultimate resolution takes place.","So again, it's worth about 30 basis points of margin. So the way you can think of it for the year, we would have adjusted for the mix. So about not quite but close to half of the margin decrease would have still taken place because of the mix. And then going forward as we've talked about in the past, Missiles has it going across all elements of their portfolio. A little bit more heavily here in the near term on the front end with the development work as I just talked about. But they do have a good balance of production work and that's part of what we expect to help drive the margin up in the back half of the year, especially given the strong bookings they saw at the end of 2017 which will be ramping up in the back half here of 2018.","So going forward, broad portfolio, good mix of development work, E&D type of work, production work. And we're always focused on trying to drive the margins up the classified work just at times in a good way presents some headwind because as you know that's what develops technology that leads to future production and future franchises.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Richard Safran, Buckingham Research.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Tom, Toby, Kelsey, good morning. How are you?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Rich.","Kelsey Ann DeBriyn - Raytheon Co.","Morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So I'd like to ask you a bit more about your comments about those really impressive bookings and the 1.3 book-to-bill in the quarter and also your comment, Tom, about the classified. First off, Tom, I'm not sure I heard but I think you kind of quantified the trend in classified versus unclassified. I think you said they doubled. Was that correct? And I was wondering how you see that trending for the rest of the year and maybe into 2019? And what I'm looking for is to see if classified is going to grow significantly more than unclassified bookings? And then finally here, does \u2013 is the general rule that classified contracts come with higher margins than unclassified, does that still hold?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Let me start off. We did have an unprecedented year \u2013 quarter relative to classified. And for the second quarter the classified bookings were 31% of our total second quarter bookings but the volume was up year-over-year from Q2 2017 169%. So it's definitely a significant increase in classified bookings. Classified sales in the second quarter were 20% of our total sales and that volume was up over 21% from Q2 2017. So \u2013 and so the reason is why? Well, we talked about on the last call that the budget and I talked about it on this call, the budget is up and the modernization budget is up 19% year-over-year. And so we're starting to see the impact of that coming through the bookings line and a lot of it is coming in through the classified area. And the reason it's coming through the classified area is the third element or third bucket that I \u2013 terminology I use of the National Defense Strategy is all about catching up with the peer threat. And to catch up with the peer threat significantly new capabilities are required across multiple domains, domains of space, the domains of air and the domain of land surface. And so we are seeing these classified awards come in at a much higher rate than we've had in the past years again due to the 19% increase.","Just real quick back, you did state that you thought that the classified program margins were higher than the unclassified. It's actually the reverse. The classified bookings are generally associated with programs that are we call CRAD, contract research and development programs and\/or E&D engineering, manufacturing and development programs. Those programs tend to be cost share programs with the government.","And because of the cost share nature of the contracts tend to have lower fee structures and resulting margins but the bottom line is those programs are integral to our business model. They are essentially the seed corn for future franchises. And as you know that's one of the strong points of Raytheon is the numerous strong franchises that we have across all domains.","Operator","The next question is going to come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu, Jefferies.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning, everyone and thank you.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Sheila.","Sheila Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC","I appreciate the commentary on Missile Systems, but can we think about mix with the broader portfolio and how we think about it over the medium term, if you can give us some color there?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yes, Sheila. It's Toby. I'll start and then if Tom wants to jump in here and add anything he can. So when we talk about mix and we relate it to our programs, we generally think of it, programs with sales volume at either higher or lower from period to period that we're comparing to. And obviously because of those particular programs' margin rate, the profit and the sales volume can weigh in on the business either favorably or unfavorably.","Most often it's the mix if you will, between development and production work. And we see that at generally speaking all of our businesses other than IIS isn't dramatically impacted by that. Tom just talked about on the prior question the nature of the classified or the CRAD volume and that really goes across all of our businesses. The cost type work in the near term it does present margin headwinds.","Obviously, the contract phase right where we are at any given point in time in the execution of a contract relative to risk retirement, opportunity realization, which is generally as we've talked about in the past more in the middle towards the end of contracts. Again, that goes across all of our businesses. And also domestic versus international, right? The mix and the volume there, primarily more impacting IDS and Missiles, but also to a lesser degree SAS.","And I think when you think about it big picture and from a trend point of view, we've talked about how we've been working to incrementally improve our margins. You see that this year with about a \u2013 the 12.5% to the 12.7% and 20 basis point increase at the midpoint of the range over last year. We talk about these incremental increases because while the mature part of the portfolio with the production programs, the international programs continues to perform well, in a good way we're seeing some headwinds from more of a mix relative to the classified work. And a lot of that, as Tom just said, ties back to the NDS and where the focus is there, especially in that third bucket that he referred to. So there's a balance there that we're working through. And obviously in Missiles in particular in this quarter they've got a lot more classified cost type work and that trend is continuing through the year.","Operator","The next question will be from the line of George Shapiro, Shapiro Research.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Hello?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Hi, George.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Hi. I guess pursuing Missiles just a little more, Toby and what you've been saying. To kind of get to the margin range, even though you lowered it, you got to get the Missile margins near 14% in the second half versus 11.4% in the first half.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","So what changes sufficiently in the mix in the second half to get there? And then just on the other side, IDS margin's got to come down pretty significantly in the second half. Now it came down in 2Q, but what changes there to get the margin to come down so? Thanks.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, sure. Yeah, no. Your math is right, George. At Missiles we do expect a ramp up in the margin in the back half of the year, 13.6% to 14% as you said. There's a couple factors that are driving this. One, on the FEMA mix, that mix turning a little bit more favorable in the back half of the year. We expect higher volume on our production programs compared to the first half.","There is some inventory we're expecting to be relieved to a few of our second half higher margin awards that are in our outlook, as well as improved productivity driven by improved operating leverage as the business continues to grow, benefits from factory automation that we've talked about in the past. And then as I mentioned a little bit earlier to Sheila's question, at Missiles we expect some retirement of risk, especially on a few international programs. And it's the combination of all those that would cause us to see the margin ramp up in the back half into the high 13% approaching 14%.","On the flip side of the coin at IDS, IDS had another solid quarter, and certainly for the first half a real strong performance. We did increase their outlook by 30 basis points for the year. As we've discussed before, the risk retirement on programs, the quarter in which the risk is retired, is where the retroactive benefit occurs. IDS had risk retired on a few programs both in the second quarter and the first half, and part of that was timing. And we just see the cadence or the pace of that lower than it was in the first half, right? We still expect strong margin performance, roughly around 16%, for the back half of the year, and that's pretty consistent with where their margin was last year, but overall very pleased with the margin performance at IDS.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I wanted to go back to Missile Systems once again. But just looking at the bookings strength, I guess what I'm trying to understand is really do you think your win rate is increasing? Or is it simply that your products are what's in demand given the current threat environment? Because certainly your missiles competitor is showing similar strength, and I'm just trying to understand how you define market share, whether you're holding your own or just you're in the right place?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","So, Sam, I'll take that upfront. I think it's both, based on when we peel the onion and then look inside. The bottom line is we are winning quite a few programs. This last one was the Naval Strike Missile. Brand new missile franchise for us, which will be a multimillion-dollar franchise moving forward. So that's one example. And on the other side we are also bringing onto production several new or upgraded franchise missiles. One is \u2013 we mentioned there was a JSOW C, which is a new variant of JSOW which has a significant demand signal pull in the U.S. and we'll eventually have it in the international marketplace. And we are also completing the development of another missile, the Small Diameter Bomb II, which will be transitioning into full rate production. And that will start to see significant volume and obviously margin increases in the fact that it's in a production type run.","So the bottom line is two things are going on. One is we're winning new franchises. And the second thing is we had multiple missiles that were I would call in development and then the final testing stages that are now transitioning from either into LRIP or from LRIP into production. And so we're starting to see larger volume.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","And, Sam, I'd just add bigger picture at the company level relative to the competitive win rates, we continue to be very pleased with the performance across the company in all the businesses. Historically we've run in the 70% range give or take and we're seeing similar results so far this year again across all of our business \u2013 Missiles included but across all of our businesses, all within that 70% range, so strong performance there.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Jon Raviv, Citi.","Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Jon.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Jon Raviv - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Toby, can you give us a sense for the \u2013 some of the pension decisions that you made in terms of what kind of return metrics do you see? Why did you choose to do the annuity contract now? And then also appreciating that CAS does not change, how do you think about the CAS mechanics sort of beyond 2020? What's it sensitive to and how it might trend over the long term? Thank you.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, so let me maybe start with that last part first, Jon, and then I'll come back to the beginning part of your question. So from a CAS point of view, I think the simple way to think of it is that for the next, say, five or six years, the CAS recovery \u2013 we expect it to be roughly in line with our 2018 expectation, okay? And then after 2018 we anticipate to have, from an overall pension point of view, positive cash flow out until the 2026 timeframe, right, holding all assumptions constant. So I think very positive news and somewhat predictable as far as the CAS goes.","Related to the two pension actions that we took in the quarter, certainly related to the discretionary, we've been talking on and off that we'd been evaluating that. If you recall we put a $1 billion discretionary contribution into the plan at the end of last year. We made this additional contribution decision in June. The contribution's being made in the third quarter in part to leverage the benefit of getting the deduction at the 35% rate on the 2017 tax return. And it helps work relative to the funding of the plan. So that one was kind of straightforward.","On the annuity that we enacted here in the quarter, two independent transactions. We just saw an opportunity in the marketplace based upon some other activity to \u2013 in a appropriate way, right, that continues to provide benefit security for our pensioners, to de-risk our liability, right, and reduce our liability in a very economical way. We're doing this with a solid insurer. We are continuing to follow our goal of operating our business effectively and this de-risking and reducing the obligation is consistent with that.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Carter Copeland, Melius Research.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Good morning, gentlemen.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Just a quick clarification on the pension piece, Toby, not to let you off the hook totally yet. It sounds like the transfer, you get rid of the liability side. What happens to the associated assets with those plans?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","So we \u2013 as part of the transfer we funded that with assets out of the plan.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Okay. Okay. That's what I figured. I just wanted to make sure. So you will get \u2013 you will lose in the future years the expected returns on those plan assets but you won't have any of the actuarial amortization associated with it?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Correct. Right.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","Okay.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yes.","Carter Copeland - Melius Research LLC","All right. And then just, Tom, briefly. Just because it seems to be on the tip of everybody's tongue. And I know you guys have been particularly growth focused for a while but given that we might actually have budget passage and authorization passage on time for once and folks are looking at higher levels of funding, when you take a step back and just look from a business development standpoint what the opportunity funnel looks like out of there? Is it materially different today than say six months ago? Or nine months ago? Or any color you can provide us on how you're thinking about that. Thanks.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","I'll take it. I think, I would say it's significantly different than over a year ago in terms of demand signal. Demand signal is global. We are seeing significant demand signal in Europe. A lot of that is for deterrence type products like our integrated air missile defense systems, a la the Patriot system. And we're also seeing strong demand in the MENA region. That demand signal is coming in for again defensive type systems, deterrence systems like the Patriot System but also our NASAMS system, seeing significant demand signals for that. And then eventually the THAAD system is going to be \u2013 make a inroad into the MENA region also. So we're getting that kind of demand signal. In Asia-Pacific region it's also the whole area of deterrence and that area is demand signals for our Patriot systems and also our standard missiles both in Japan and also in South Korea.","And we come back to the U.S. The biggest change in U.S. is the classified. And again that \u2013 the element of the third bucket of the National Defense Strategy which is the need for the United States to catch up to our peer threats and the U.S. government is taking that seriously, Congress is taking that seriously and providing the funding required to make that happen. And that is one of the major reasons that our classified bookings have been up significantly this quarter.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Seth Seifman, JPMorgan.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, and good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I think \u2013 I apologize if you guys addressed this. But in IIS as you look forward on the Warfighter FOCUS contract I think you guys recently were selected for one piece of the follow on. And so maybe if you could talk about how that fits into your overall plan for that contract and the coming decline?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, sure, Seth. This is Toby. I'll take a crack at that. So I think we've talked about in the past that the guidance for this year and you can read beyond this year, right are \u2013 always assumed that we'd have a planned decline on Warfighter as we transition the program primarily in the second half of this year to new contract vehicles.","So again there's no change in the negative way to our guidance range for IIS this year. We were selected as one of three large businesses for the portion of the program called ETSC, which at a high level is related to the international aspect of the program. We're also on one of the five small business set aside teams for that part of the follow on program as well. So between both of those positions we feel we can be very competitive on that future scope.","I think it's important when you think of IIS as I talked about in my opening comments, they saw strong growth in the quarter. And for the year, even excluding Warfighter FOCUS, right we are looking at call it mid-single digit growth for the rest of the business between their classified business, their cyber business.","As an example, right they're starting to make up for and offset that business. So IIS is more than Warfighter and that's what we're expecting to continue to carry them into the future as well as the portions of Warfighter we continue to execute.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Cai von Rumohr, Cowen & Company.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes, thank you very much. To maybe follow up on Carter's question, could you update us a little bit on where we stand regarding your opportunities for THAAD and (57:33) in the international arena? And also, given that the president has been pressuring NATO to spend more money and at the same time basically beating them over the head in terms of tariffs, what impact do you expect those two initiatives to have on your business? Are you seeing anything today? Thanks.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","So maybe I'll take the second part of that relative to the NATO and the tariffs. I mean we're not seeing any impact today nor do we expect the tariffs will have an impact, certainly not a direct impact even when we look forward into the supply chain and if there was any potential concern there. We don't think there's anything of a material point of view. Relative to NATO specifically, Cai, Tom talked about we booked the Romania Patriot order. Just as a update for everybody, the Patriot Poland LOA was signed. We are working towards getting on the first phase of that contract, a little north of $1 billion sometime in 2019. That program is still $5 billion overall with the second phase in 2020.","We told you last time around, Sweden had selected Patriot. And we expect them to sign their LOA in the back half of the year contract next year for $1 billion. My whole point there is not seeing anybody backing off of what they were interested in and committed to before, all because they continue to want to have a deterrent against the threat from that perspective.","As far as our TPY-2 radars, which are part of the THAAD system, the opportunity in KSA for us is a $3 billion to $4 billion opportunity. We look for the LOA on that to be signed here in the back half of the year with the, potentially an initial award of a few hundred million dollars with the follow on, the majority of it in 2019.","There's an opportunity in Qatar for THAAD, again with our early warning with the TPY-2 radar as part of that in the plus or minus $1 billion range, maybe out in the 2020 timeframe. So, strong demand for our products.","Kelsey Ann DeBriyn - Raytheon Co.","So that's all the time we have today. Thank you for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter conference call in October.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Todd B. Ernst","Thank you, Frances. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our second quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com.","Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available on the Investor Relations section of our website.","With me today are Bill Swanson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Wajsgras, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief questions -- or brief remarks by Bill and Dave, and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill?","William H. Swanson","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. The company continued to perform well in the second quarter. Sales, margins, EPS and cash flow were all ahead of expectation on strong international sales growth. Our solid execution on productivity initiatives is helping to drive both our financial performance and our ability to provide affordable solutions for our customers.","Combining these initiatives with our technology investments and innovation yields a powerful strategy that continues to show positive results. We remain confident in our overall outlook and have raised our EPS guidance for the year.","Let me take a minute to update you regarding the progress of our business consolidation efforts.","We've successfully consolidated from 6 businesses to 4. Our investments in common systems have enabled us to move swiftly through the consolidation process. We're ahead of plan and are already seeing tangible results.","With the new structure in place, the team has been identifying additional opportunities to drive cost savings by streamlining product lines and reducing footprint and fixed costs. Further, we see potential for additional product synergies across the company.","We're pleased with the progress we've made, and as always, we're challenging our teams to do more.","In the U.S., the debate surrounding near and long-term resource allocation to national security is ongoing. Congress and the administration continue to work toward a compromise on the fiscal '14 budget and are not there yet. Current versions of the budget don't include sequestration, and barring some type of grand bargain, the defense budget ultimately will need to be reconciled with the cap spelled out in the Budget Control Act of 2011, which is about $50 billion lower than the currently proposed levels.","The outcome remains unclear, but as we've said all along, we remain focused on executing our strategy and managing the business in order to deliver the best value for our customers and shareholders, whatever the environment.","International continues to be a key driver of the business. In the second quarter, international grew by 10% compared to last year's second quarter and was 27% of total sales. International also represents 26% of bookings in the quarter.","Last month, as we've done many times in the past, we attended one of the largest aerospace industry events in the world, Paris Air Show. We met with a number of international customers. In fact, Raytheon hosted over 1,400 guests and the largest number of delegations ever, reflecting a 16% increase compared to the last time we were there in 2011. This demonstrates the significant global interest we continue to see for our technology and our innovative solutions.","The timing of international awards is always difficult to peg with certainty. In the quarter, we made notable progress. Oman ordered AMRAAM missiles for their ground-based air defense system, and we're now in the final negotiations for the remaining part of the program.","We continue to make progress in both Qatar and Kuwait Patriot, as well as both of which are expected in the second half of the year.","We were thrilled to be selected for the F-16 RACR program by South Korea early in the second quarter. These are always tough competitions, and we're awaiting word on the next one, Taiwan's F-16 radar upgrade led by the U.S. Air Force. A decision is expected soon.","As some of you know, we were expecting Next Generation Jammer program to be awarded in the second quarter. Instead, it occurred right after the close. This was a key competitive win for the company, and it solidifies Raytheon's position as a premier electronic warfare provider.","The Next Generation Jammer is a critical component of our enterprise-wide EW strategy, which was launched back in 2011. This strategy aligns us with our customers' evolving requirements to address the increasingly sophisticated anti-access and area denial threats that are emerging globally.","A significant factor behind our innovative approach to Next Gen Jammer competition was our ability to leverage the investments we've made in gallium nitride or GaN technology. We've been investing in GaN for the past decade, and our in-house technology development in this area is a huge competitive discriminator, allowing us to increase the power and improve the efficiency of our offering. And importantly, this positions us well for future competitions.","While offering innovative solutions can be a competitive advantage, making them affordable is equally as important. The benefits we derive from our supply chain, Global Business Services and recent business consolidation initiatives, for example, allow us to offer improved affordability for our customers without compromising our financial performance. This is critical in today's economic environment, where customers have limited resources available to achieve their missions.","Given this, Raytheon's ability to execute is key, and our continued solid operating performance is a testament to the dedication of the Raytheon team. I want to thank them for all that they do, for continually rising to the challenges and for remaining focused on our mission, which is customer success.","With that, let me turn it over to Dave.","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. I have a few opening remarks starting with the second quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I will be referring to the Web slides that we issued earlier this morning.","So if everyone could please move to Page 3. We performed well in the second quarter. Our adjusted EPS of $1.64 was up 4%, driven by continued operational improvement and capital deployment actions.","Adjusted operating margin was 13.7%, up 10 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted operating margin was 13.5%, up 20 basis points.","Sales of $6.1 billion were up 2% compared with last year's second quarter. We exceeded the high end of our prior guidance, and I'll discuss the reasons in just a minute.","Operating cash flow from continuing operations was approximately $200 million better than last year, primarily due to the timing of our required pension contributions. We're increasing our full year EPS guidance, which I'll address further in just a few minutes as well, along with other updates to our 2013 outlook.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock for $225 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 7.6 million shares for $450 million.","In the quarter, we consolidated from 6 businesses to 4 and are now reporting in the new structure. In the attachment that accompany the press release, we've recast our historical results going back to 2011 to reflect the consolidation.","Just as a reminder, we combined 2 of our former businesses, IIS and RTSC, to form the new Intelligence, Information and Services business. We also moved the previous NCS product lines to the remaining Raytheon businesses.","Additionally, we realigned some of our smaller product lines across Raytheon to enhance complementary product areas. These moves allow us to further streamline operations, leverage customer synergies and reduce our overhead costs.","Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Our total company bookings for the quarter were $5.3 billion and on a year-to-date basis were $8.9 billion. Second quarter bookings were impacted by the timing of a few potential awards, including Next Gen Jammer, Kuwait Patriot and Aegis multi-year. Looking back at our trailing 4 quarters, our book-to-bill is about 1, driven by our strong bookings in the back half of 2012.","As I mentioned on the last 2 calls, we continue to see the order book back-end loaded for 2013. We're making progress on a number of opportunities. For example, as we just discussed, we were awarded Next Gen Jammer after the close of the quarter and we're in final negotiations on an air defense system for the country of Oman.","We expect the book-to-bill ratio to expand in the second half, and our bookings outlook remains unchanged for the year.","For the quarter, international was 26% of our total company bookings. For the year, we now expect international to be in the range of 30% to 32% of total company bookings.","Notable awards in the quarter included $543 million at Missile Systems for AMRAAM for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and international customers. MS also booked $228 million for SM-3 and $224 million on EKV, both for the Missile Defense Agency, as well as $132 million on Paveway for international customers and $98 million for the JSOW for the U.S. Navy and international customers.","IIS booked $582 million for domestic training and $117 million for foreign training in support of the Warfighter FOCUS Program.","Integrated Defense Systems booked $93 million for in-service support for the Royal Australian Navy and $85 million on the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System program for the FAA.","And Space and Airborne Systems booked $78 million for the production of electronic warfare systems for an international customer. In addition, IIS and SAS booked $252 million and $351 million, respectively, on a number of classified programs.","Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $32.4 billion. It's worth noting that approximately 37% of our backlog is from international programs.","If you now move to Page 5, we're pleased with our sales performance in the quarter, which was ahead of our expectation and, importantly, driven by strong international performance.","Our international business increased by approximately 10% in the quarter. This was partially offset by our domestic business, which declined about 1%.","For the second quarter, our international sales were approximately 27% of total sales.","Looking at the businesses, all were at or above our expectations. IDS had second quarter 2013 net sales of $1.7 billion, up 9% from the comparable period last year. The increase was primarily due to higher sales on various international air and missile defense programs.","IIS net sales of about $1.6 billion were essentially in line with the same period last year.","Missile Systems had second quarter 2013 net sales of $1.7 billion, an increase of 7% on a year-over-year basis. The increase was primarily due to higher sales on SM-3 and an international Paveway program.","And SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion, down from the comparable period last year, primarily due to the timing of classified programs.","Now moving ahead to Page 6. We're pleased by the improvement in our overall company margins, driven by program performance at IDS. Our adjusted margin was 13.7%, an increase of 10 basis points. And on the year-to-date basis, our margin was 13.5%, up 20 basis points over the comparable period in 2012.","The strength in our underlying margin in the quarter was due to our continued focus on execution.","As I mentioned earlier, we're pleased with the progress that we made with our consolidation initiative. We've completed the initial phases of the business consolidation and have realigned our key product lines. We believe these efforts will drive improved affordability for our customers and improve our competitiveness.","It bears noting that our consolidation efforts are only one element of our overall focus on productivity. Other key aspects include strategic sourcing, where we're optimizing our supply chain, as well as our facility utilization efforts. We are consolidating facilities to improve utilization and further reduce our fixed cost base.","So looking at the business margins, all were in line or better than our expectations. IDS's margin was up in the quarter compared with the same period last year. Solid operational performance and favorable mix drove the improvement.","Margins for IIS and Missile were essentially in line with our expectations, and SAS was slightly ahead.","Overall, the company continues to perform well.","So if you now move to Page 7. Second quarter 2013 adjusted EPS was $1.64, up 4%. The increase was driven by operational improvement and capital deployment actions, more specifically, share repurchases. And on a year-to-date basis, adjusted EPS was $3.20, up 5% from the same period last year.","On Page 8, I would like to briefly comment on our updated outlook for 2013.","Based on our performance year-to-date, we have narrowed our sales guidance range, raising the low end by $300 million. We now expect our full year 2013 net sales to be in the range of between $23.5 billion and $23.7 billion with a bias towards the high end.","The second half of the year assumes impacts from both sequestration and now a continuing resolution in the fourth quarter.","You'll note that we raised our full year 2013 EPS guidance by $0.25 on the low end and by $0.20 on the high end. We now expect to be between $5.51 and $5.61, and on an adjusted basis for adjusted EPS to be between $6 and $6.10.","The increase is essentially driven by performance and also includes about $0.05 from the expected benefits of our business consolidation. Additionally, we are projecting a slightly improved tax rate and a reduced share count.","During the quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares of common stock for $225 million, and on a year-to-date basis, have purchased 7.6 million shares for $450 million. Our strong cash generation does give us some flexibility with respect to near-term capital deployment actions. Overall, we've improved our outlook compared to the initial plan for 2013 that we first spoke to in January, and this is reflected in our updated share count guidance.","In dollar terms, we now expect share repurchases in the back half of the year to be modestly higher than in the first half of the year.","And although not on the page, it's worth noting that we still see our bookings outlook for the year in the range of $23.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million. This outlook is unchanged from our prior estimates.","Now if you turn to Page 9. We've raised the low end of our sales guidance range for each of our businesses. The increase in margin guidance reflects our strong overall program execution and productivity initiatives, including the business consolidation.","On Page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations for the balance of 2013.","Now before we open it up for Q&A, let me summarize. We saw solid operating performance in the second quarter and exceeded the sales, EPS, margin and operating cash flow guidance we provided back in April despite the challenging environment.","As we look to the balance of the year, the pipeline of international and domestic opportunities is strong. We continue to move forward with our productivity initiatives and are very pleased with our progress to date. These efforts bode well for our customers and our shareholders, and we're confident in our outlook for the year.","So with that, Bill and I will open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a few quick ones. First, Dave, on the IDS margin performance, you called out in your prepared remarks both favorable mix and strong performance. I wondered if you might parse that out a bit for us, if you can, to kind of separate the impact of mix versus what may have been some favorable EAC adjustments.","David C. Wajsgras","Sure, so the performance is reflected in our EAC adjustments. I appreciate the way you articulated the question. And that's up for IDS, it's up about $24 million in the quarter. And as you just noted that business is also impacted by a change in mix, driven by the strong international sales in the quarter. The weighting of the improvement, I would say, is more towards the performance side than the mix side.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And one for Bill, just wondered if you'd expand a little bit more on Next Gen Jammer. I mean, obviously, it seems like all we ever talked about these days is capital deployment and bookings, but obviously, it's a big competitive win for you guys. And you hinted at how this would enhance your EW offering and future competitions. I wondered if you might expand a little bit on that and how you see this impacting the business over the long term, and in kind of general terms, just interested in any color you can share there.","William H. Swanson","No, it's a great question. In 2011, we started really putting the focus on EW. I mean, clearly for us, we are an electronics house, AESAs and that type of technology is what we really kind of hug around here, I guess no better way to say it. And our SAS business out in California, teaming up with our Missile business and our IDS business worked very hard on this offering. I can add some color, this Next Generation Jammer replaces the ALQ-99. And for me, it's a little personal. It's the first program I ever worked on in Raytheon, so it will tell you how long ALQ-99 has been around.","David C. Wajsgras","Bill, it's not that long.","William H. Swanson","But it's -- when you think about it, there aren't many opportunities like this. This program is a program, by executing it right, people will be able to start and finish their careers on it. And from that standpoint, it's a hallmark program. They don't come around that long. The competition was conducted by NAVAIR, who is probably one of the best in the business at evaluating technology and what they're looking for. And clearly, for us, our GaN technology allowed us to meet the weight and the power requirements, which were extremely difficult on this. Why it was important, I think is where you're coming from, is back in '11, we saw that things were going to start winding down in Iraq and Afghanistan someday. And when that happens, our forward presence changes. And when your forward presence changes, now you have to think about the world differently, how do you get in, do what you have to do and get out without anyone getting hurt. And electronic warfare is the way that you can do that. You deny your enemy the capabilities that he needs to be able to deny you that access. So for us, we saw this, and we've been working on it here for some time. And I'm really proud of our SAS business because this was one of the toughest competitions around, and everybody knew it was probably the last big one for some time in EW, and it just solidifies us in that marketplace, not only domestically but internationally. And that was what was really key. I hope that color helps.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Bill, I was wondering if you could -- I know you mentioned a couple of the international missile defense pursuits in your opening remarks. But if we could just take a step back, maybe if you could characterize the way you're looking at, on a multi-year basis where we are in terms of international missile defense demand. Is there a replacement cycle or an upgrade cycle that's going on here? How much of the strength that you're expecting to see in the second half of the year is really sustainable into 2014 and 2015? Where are we in this whole cycle?","William H. Swanson","Yes, I think the way I would say is that we are probably in the second or third inning, if I wanted to relate it to a baseball game. And from that standpoint, there are still innings to play. The nice part about Raytheon's portfolio, whether it be the standard missile family, whether it be our radar family in a sense of, I affectionately call our big radars that we do, dinosaurs. They're one of a kind, they are big, and they do hang around for a long time, but they also reflect the latest technology in the world. Our TPY-2s are in demand for anyone that wants to be able to detect something. They are the only radars like it in the world. And the company has the ability now to remote launch, which means if you can detect it someplace, you can launch from another place. And you tie that all together with command and control or your air and missile defense systems. So for me, this is early. We see plenty of opportunities. The Mid East, even parts of Europe, especially Asia, too, all need this capability. So I feel pretty good about the company's ability to go do that. And we've got a lot more innings to go play here.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, that's a lot earlier -- I was going to say a lot earlier in the game than I would've thought you would have said. Is this about existing customers that we've seen the last couple of years coming back and buying more? Is it new technologies they are going to buying? How would you characterize that?","William H. Swanson","I would characterize it from a standpoint that some have the capability and there's a lot that don't. Some that have the capability, one of the things, if you have the infrastructure in place, you have what we call P3I, preplanned product improvements. And we can help them in discrimination, we can help them tie it in together into their net. So it's -- there's many facets to missile defense. And no one's at the stage of where the United States is. That's why I probably put it in the early innings because you asked me about international. If you had asked me domestically, here, we might provide them our radar, too. And we've got more standard missiles to deliver. But the rest of the world needs to catch up to the U.S., if that helps.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just -- it does. And then just one quick one for Dave. When you announced your restructuring in March, you noted there will be $85 million of cost savings, but it wasn't going to impact financial guidance. I was wondering, now that we see first half results, if you could give us any sense as to where the realignment has impacted numbers, and what we should be thinking about for the second half of the year in that regard as well?","David C. Wajsgras","Sure. So Tom Kennedy, our recently appointed Executive Vice President and COO, led the effort on the business consolidation. We have exceeded our scheduled milestone objectives. When I initially looked to 2013, I suggested that from a financial performance perspective, the cost of implementation would essentially offset the financial benefits, the savings. Given what we've been able to accomplish, we're now seeing about a $0.05 impact in a positive way for the year. And that's included in our guidance. There was a couple of cents in the second quarter and about $0.03 in the back half of the year. Also, our overall gross savings from the program, we had initially set up a target of about $85 million, and we are now well in excess of that number from a forecast standpoint.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And we're seeing that in segment operating income?","David C. Wajsgras","That's a good question, Joe. You're seeing it across the board in the 4 segments.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to follow on that, on the organization. So the improvement in margins, Dave, you referred to that as partially due to improved performance and -- this is the guidance, and partially due to the benefits of consolidation. But if we consider that you've got onetime implementation costs associated with that for this year, would we expect that the benefit is actually somewhat more than what we're seeing here and we should see that probably in the next year, in '14?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, remember, much of that, and at some point, all of that, goes back to our customers. And that's just the way this business works, it's the way the industry works. It does make us more competitive as we go forward. There will be some benefit in 2014, but again, there is a where away given the contracts expire and the new contracts come online and need to be negotiated with our new cost structure.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Understanding that the fixed price component of your business has gone up some over time, that benefit might be greater, I would think, than it would've been in the past in terms of...","David C. Wajsgras","That's correct. That's a good way to think about it. That's a fair way to think about it.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then also on the organization, I know, Bill, you've said in the past that the new structure gives you some synergies that are beyond costs, basically the ability to do C4ISR better, things like that, that can work for international customers. What I'm interested in here is how much more can that get you? You have a huge presence right now, particularly in missile defense. Where do you see the upside actually coming out by being able to integrate things better in this new organization?","William H. Swanson","I think I saw -- I was at the Paris Air Show, sat down with one of our customers, I won't say which one or which business. So we were sitting there. And they have an existing contract. They are going to be signing a new contract with us. And we were at the table, and they started to talk about a problem in one service, another through a different service. And all of a sudden, they're sitting there and we have both right at the table and are underneath 1 person, and it's fixed instantaneously. There was no debate, no nothing, surface done, finished. And just -- it would've taken some coordination before to go through it and get the alignment. And for me, it just -- I just sat there and smiled for a minute and watched how nice it worked. And it's not to say it wouldn't have been done in the past, it would have, but it took a little more coordination. And now, it's all integrated in 1 area, in Command and Control, and it's done. And so it's just one example that's real, that's right in my mind that I see. And oh, by the way, domestically, when we deal with the Navy in 1 area, we used to have it in 2 separate businesses. And now, the Navy realizes we can pull it together because the 2 parts of the Navy didn't talk to each other. And now they got us looking at it both ways and we're saving both sides money. So I really do see it, and I have concrete examples of it","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Bill, just a quick one for you, hopefully. On the export front, as you grow towards around 30% of revenues and potentially beyond that from export sales, what sort of impact does this have on the structure of the firm and also the way that you manage risk?","William H. Swanson","It's a great question because I have this theory that back when we were at 18%, we went in and put some things in place to be able to handle 20%. And then we set a goal for ourselves at 25%, and we changed our structure a little bit to be able to do that. And now we're getting to 30%. And at each 5% increment, we've seen a fundamental change in the way we have to do it. And the way I would say is you have to think more globally than you have to think internationally. And for that is, how do we have a bigger presence in country? How do we make sure that our teams are on the ground and that we are integrated into the culture and the business climate that we do. And I can tell you that Raytheon will be making a shift in how we look at our international business because 30% will happen and we'll be prepared for it. And then as we get to that milestone, we'll be thinking about 35% because you got to think in increments to go do it. And there's not 1 cookie cutter approach because we've sold in 120 countries. We have active about 82 now. And that changes, but our presence changes. If you look at Saudi or Japan, we've been there 50 years, and that's a long time. And we want to be there another 50. And so each model is different because Japan, you have trading companies; in the Mid East, you need a presence. So we are thinking of it and you'll probably hear changes about what we're going to go do to be able to handle that, if that helps.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, that's very helpful. And just a quick follow up technical question on the Jammer program. I see one of your competitors has protested the award. Does that mean that you haven't actually started work on it yet?","William H. Swanson","No, what happens, you're correct, is when there's a protest in the first 10 days, there's a stop work put out in that regard. That's normal. The NAVAIR will now go handle the protest with the GAO and one of the things that we are very comfortable about is NAVAIR is the best at doing this. And they are very thorough. And you have to look at the protest results that people have against them. And this is not a competition that happened overnight. They've seen us perform on kind of proof of principle contracts. So NAVAIR has seen all 4 of us operate. And we feel very comfortable in their selection. Of course, we are biased, but we feel comfortable.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Bill, I was going to ask if you could just give us an update on a couple of different programs. This speaks to some of the things you've already addressed. But Patriot for Turkey, AMDR, and then I was wondering if we should be concerned about Space Fence.","William H. Swanson","Yes, I would say, one, they had a space command -- I'll start in reverse order. Basically, I've said, they are ready to go. They've made their selection, and they can award. I think part of the internal scanner review that DOD had, they're going to go through and determine what they're going to do in this regard. As an engineer, I look at what Space Fence is trying to do when I think of the debris that's up in space, and I think of all the assets, whether they be commercial satellites, whether they be the space station, whatever is up there for any country, people need to map that debris and be able to move things out of the way, because I got to tell you, losing a satellite or damaging the space station will pay for a Space Fence really quickly. But people have to make the decision. These are tough economic times. And the department will go through that. AMDR is due to be awarded this fall. And from what we gather, it's one of the Navy's top priorities. It's survived all the reviews, and we will see what happens in that regard. I think your other one was Turkey. Of course, you can pick up the papers and see the thing that goes on political. I mean, it's one of the things we've lived with internationally. Kuwait, I'm surprised you didn't ask about it. But Kuwait, for example, we have an LOA sitting on the Minister of Defense's desk. And Parliament was dissolved, and they will be forming a new Parliament, July 27th. And after that, they'll put it together, and then we'll expect the LOA to float forward and we'll get moving that way. Regarding Turkey, they have the same political unrest now. They'll probably make a decision in the third quarter. I think they've asked for proposals to be extended. And then we'll take it from there. But that's the nature of International business.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Dave, just on that, how much of those Patriot orders are in your booking? Or how do you figure those into the $23.5 billion you're talking about? And then the other thing I wanted to ask you is just on cash flow. It looks like you brought forward some cash flow from Q3, just based on the guidance and the numbers you -- the way they adjusted, is that correct?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes, that's correct. That's right. So on the first part, it's -- it would be not very traditional for us to give out specifics on what program specifically are valued at in our guidance. I will say that from a booking standpoint, these are all significant awards from a value standpoint. But in our guidance, we factor the overall value quite a bit. So -- and this can be anywhere from the 20% to 50% value of what the potential program might be, depending on a lot of different probability estimates. From a sales standpoint, I would say some of these larger ones are not significant drivers in the back half, from a sales standpoint. So that's kind of the way to think about some of these international Patriot programs that Bill just took us through.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right. I was asking from the bookings perspective, but you answered it.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Yair Reiner from Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask about the guidance for the back half of the year. It implies a pretty sharp drop off in terms of the revenue momentum across the business. I know you attributed that to sequestration and potentially a CR in the fourth quarter. I'm wondering, to what extent is that reflected in what you're seeing today in -- across your businesses? Or is that just an anticipation of the fact that eventually the budget needs to kick in?","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. So again, the way you framed the question is accurate. The second half does reflect our current thinking relative to the impact of sequestration and the continuing resolution in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. So if we see things differently going forward, obviously, we will update the outlook. I mean, what we're seeing today kind of represents the way we see things playing out from a sales cadence standpoint. I do want to mention that I did speak to our bias earlier in the discussion being to the high end of the range. It's probably worth noting -- I'll say it's most definitely worth noting that from an internal perspective, we do have targets for sale that exceed the high end of our guidance. But at this stage, we believe that the guidance we put out is a prudent way to look at it.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just a quick one on the tax rate. Is the decline there reflective of the international mix? And if so, should we expect that there's going to be a downward bias on that moving forward?","David C. Wajsgras","Sure. We have a number of tax planning initiatives that are taking place. And the tax group has done an excellent job in managing our tax obligations. We did take the rate down about 50 basis points from an ETR standpoint for the balance -- for 2013 versus where we were thinking a few months back. Going forward, I'd suggest that you can think about the tax rate in that general range.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Strauss from UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On the -- revisiting the booking side, I just want to make sure I'm doing the math correctly, that you're basically assuming for the full year that domestic bookings are down around 20% and offset by about 20% growth in international. And if so, what does that mean, Dave, for advances in the back half of the year, if some of these international awards that you're anticipating actually come through?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, advances have been pretty consistent year in and year out, relative to our direct commercial sales with international customers. Again, when we look at those and we think about how they might impact cash flow for the year, it's also factored. So we're comfortable with the range that we've put out there. From a cash flow standpoint, again, I probably should have mentioned this earlier, we are also biased toward the higher end of the cash flow guidance. One thing I do want to remind everyone of is that this year, there is some ramping down of advances, given some of the strength in 2012, and we'll see how things play out. But again, overall, again, there's a lot of different moving parts here. We factor everything and are quite comfortable with the outlook.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And was that on domestic bookings? Is that why you were expecting about 20% decline in domestic bookings this year?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, let me just -- let me walk through this briefly. So from a -- on a full year basis, with respect to the overall domestic bookings, as a percent of the total, we see it in the 68% to 70% range when we close out the year. And importantly, Bill mentioned this earlier, we see international in the 30% to 32% range.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And did you give the EAC number for the quarter yet?","David C. Wajsgras","The EAC number, no, I haven't. And I knew you were going to ask before you got off this call. The EAC number for the quarter approximates about 2.6% of sales. And the overall number is, I believe, about -- I don't have it in front of me, about $156 million positive.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Dave, just related to the comment about sales being towards the high end this year, I guess what got better to get the additional $300 million? And can you talk just in terms of what that implies for U.S. DOD, non-DOD and non-U.S. growth this year?","David C. Wajsgras","Sure. Well, it's again the strength of our overall international business. And it's clearly what drove the second quarter results from a sales standpoint. And a good portion of that does flow through to the year. So on an overall basis for the year, from a domestic standpoint, we're seeing the sales profile down about 6% to 7%. And from an international standpoint, we're seeing sales up about 6% to 7%. And I suppose that's the law of large numbers, that they're the exact same percent. But for the company, the guidance for sales is down in the range of the 3% to 4% area.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if I look at your -- the outlook for the margins, certainly it has implied the second half as a big step down and, I guess, mostly in IDS. Can you talk about why that's coming down so much?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. So we did have strong margins in the quarter. And you are correct, specifically at IDS. In the back half, margins still remain strong but lower than the first half, given the cadence of our efficiencies, which are weighted to the first half, as well as some new programs starting up and some of our longer duration production programs ramping down. It's important to point out that we did increase the full year outlook for margins.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then one last question for Bill, just on that AMDR competition. Does the result of the combat systems engineering decision earlier in the year have any bearing on that? Or is there any way to get insight into how that might play out?","William H. Swanson","The initial one, I mean, when you look at it, that was for the overall weapons system. And clearly, Lockheed had a nice win there, but they've been doing that since the whole thing started. So to displace somebody that's been doing something for 30 years really gets hard. AMDR, it's hard also, but it's a brand new radar. And there, what the customers are looking for is innovation. They're looking for detection capability, they're looking at discrimination capability. And for that one, it is different, and the playing field is, I'd want to say, a little more level in that regard of being able to compete. But it's an S-band radar, and we're -- we like to win everything in X-band, so this is a new area for us to go off in. And we're trying to take on an incumbent which is always hard.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Cai Von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So Bill, you mentioned Taiwan AESA radar. What's the timing on that? And what's the sequencing that you expect between the U.S. Air Force decision on the F-16 radar and Taiwan's?","William H. Swanson","I expect that anytime soon, Cai. I mean, it could have happened already but it didn't. It just takes a while to get things through. And of course, the building is trying to balance a bunch of things now. So it could be anytime. I think they have everything in there. I think from the point of view, these South Koreans determined that they were going to do it on their timetable. And they went through one of the toughest competitions that I've seen and they selected us. And now the Air Force will select for Taiwan. They've asked Taiwan to go do that. And it looks like the international world is updating their F-16s before the U.S. will update theirs. It's the way I'd describe the timing.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But the Air Force will decide. So if the Air Force decides for you or brand X, that's probably what the Air Force ultimately will buy. Is that one way of thinking of it?","William H. Swanson","Not necessarily. I mean, this is a competitive world. We thrive on competition here, we don't run from it. So I would imagine that if they can compete Taiwan, then they can go compete U.S. radars and we are ready to do that.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. And Dave, one for you, a number of your peers have talked about pension, some of them better prospects for next year, some of them maybe not as good because of the impact of the uptick in rates. Could you comment on what you see based on where we are today, and particularly, your -- as I recall, your pension contributions were going to go up next year and the impact on your contributions for next year?","David C. Wajsgras","Sure. I'm glad you asked the question. In 2013, the FAS\/CAS adjustment is expected to be around $286 million. Looking further out, there's a number of variables that obviously impact the FAS\/CAS adjustment and the funding requirements, including the discount rates, the return on assets and other actuarial assumptions, the cash harmonization rules and the pension funding stabilization law as part of PPA. Now if rates remain flat, if we hold all assumptions constant, our FAS\/CAS adjustment in 2014 could be $100 million to $150 million less than 2013. So that's a positive pickup from a financial results standpoint. Looking beyond '14, we see the FAS\/CAS adjustment. It could become favorable in 2015, possibly as much as $350 million to $400 million positive, again, assuming no change in the discount rates and assuming we meet our expected returns. And when I say no change, I'm taking 2013 as the baseline. Now if we set the discount rate today, sort of as we're sitting here, it would likely be 50 to 75 basis points higher than what we're using in '13, the point at the end of 2012. And again, it's for 2013 results. But if they were to increase about 50 basis points, it would additionally improve our FAS\/CAS in 2014 and beyond by maybe upwards of $200 million each year, assuming the discount rate in the environment persists. So let me get a little more specific, and I know I'm being lengthy here, but a number of folks have asked. Our 2014 FAS\/CAS, again with a higher interest rate environment, the 2014 FAS\/CAS adjustment could be $250 million to $350 million less than what we're seeing in '13. And looking beyond '14, the FAS\/CAS adjustment again becomes favorable in '15 and could be as much as $0.5 billion, and that's positive. Again, that's assuming that the interest rate environment persists at about 50 to 75 basis points higher than where we are today. So from a funding standpoint, if interest rates again stay at this level that I just suggested where we are today, the net funding is about breakeven for next year.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","When you say net, so basically would you contribute less CAS?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, this is what happens. Essentially, we have the gross funding and then you have the CAS reimbursement essentially through the contract actions. And frankly, whether interest rates stay up or interest rates stay where they are in -- where they were in the beginning of '13, the net funding contribution is about breakeven next year. So it doesn't really move it that much.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","One quick follow-up, Northrop mentioned that the impact of higher rates had an adverse impact on their return on assets year-to-date. They were only up 50 bps through the end of June. What's your ROA look like year-to-date?","David C. Wajsgras","So yes, they may be heavily weighted into fixed income and other interest sensitive investments. I don't know that, but that may be the case. For us, I would say more than on a year-to-date basis, but as of just a couple of days ago, we were just under 8% return on assets.","Todd B. Ernst","Frances, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And that question will come from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to step back and ask a bigger picture question. And Bill and Dave, you can both weigh in or one of you. As we look at the orders that you've taken or the bookings that you've gotten this year, obviously, the revenue streams that we're going to see out in the future. I just wondered if you could just talk a little bit about the margin expectations on those bookings. And maybe you can do that by talking about the contract mix itself and whether it represents a departure from your current revenue streams. Just harkening back to the beginning of the year when you talked a little bit about your margins for 2013 being negative impact -- having a negative impact due to some more development work. And obviously, you've just now signed on some development work. We don't have a good understanding of the rest of the bookings that you just made. If you could just talk a bit about how your contract mix may or may not be changing as we move out over the next several quarters.","William H. Swanson","Yes, I think what's important is what I tried to talk about a little bit that we look at international being 30% to 32%, I think those are the numbers that Dave gave there. So when you look at international, clearly for us, we understand that marketplace. We understand it because we know the risks that are in there. And part of our responsibility is to be able to mitigate those risks as we go through the program. So on international, we start slower, retire the risks and then build up as we get towards the end. I don't see that changing in the way we do it. We go through every one of the bids here to make sure that they take place in the same manner. But what we also do is -- a key thing for us is affordability. So as we look at a tougher environment, how do we make sure that we are able to deliver at an affordable price but at the same time deliver the kind of margins you all expect from us as investors. So that's absolutely key. Clearly, the development programs that you get into, whether they be Next Generation Jammer, whether they be AMDR or Space Fence, those also start lower, but those turn into much like what Zumwalt was years ago for us. It started low and then turned into the production for the 3 ships there and have the regular margins you expect for us. So there's always an ebb and flow, and Dave takes that into account. He and his team do a great job at modeling not only what we have in the business but what we're looking at in the future of the business so that we can make sure there's no surprises coming because one of the things that we try to be is transparent as we look at that going forward. So there is an ebb and flow there, but I would tell you, we have our foot on the throttle here from a standpoint of what we can do because we know what we're bidding. And the bidding philosophy in this company has not changed.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And specifically to international and some of these missile defense systems that you've signed here late and you said that you're in the second or third innings, so clearly, there's more to go. Will there be a need for incremental development work to be done on any of those systems to fit international requirements?","William H. Swanson","Yes, we always do that. And then the other thing is that we as a company are never satisfied. We can find ways to continue -- one of the things that's tough is O&M. And a lot of people don't think about maintenance. And our engineers look at the total life cycle, and they're constantly trying to find ways to reduce the O&M costs or operating costs in our customers. So if we can take devices or technology -- I mean, when you look at Patriot, the Patriot I started on is not the Patriot we're delivering today. 2\/3 of it was redesigned for U.A.E. And as we keep delivering Patriot, we keep upgrading it. And oh, by the way, once you upgrade it, you can go back to all your other customers and offer them the upgraded hardware to reduce their costs, reduce the spare content and so forth. So it's a never ending opportunity for us here at Raytheon.","Todd B. Ernst","Okay. Thank you for joining us this morning.

Raytheon concluded 2014 with a strong fourth quarter, driven by global demand for advanced technologies and solid executions across the company. Bookings were better than expected at $7.1 billion, yielding a book-to-bill ratio of 1.16 for Q4. Sales were up nearly 5% in the quarter as both domestic and international sales increased, and cash flow and margins were strong as well.","These results were made possible by the dedicated efforts of the entire Raytheon team and I want to thank everyone on the team for the strong quarter and solid year.","As I look back on 2014, I'm pleased with our overall performance. We had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.05 for the year. Bookings of $24.1 billion exceeded the high end of our expectations.","The company capitalized on key domestic and international opportunities in missile defense, electronic warfare, cybersecurity, C4ISR and training. This highlights our continued alignment with our customers' priorities and our strong competitive position. Furthermore, we're especially proud that we delivered better-than-expected bookings performance, even as one of our anticipated large international Patriot awards moved into the first quarter of 2015.","Operationally, we continue to focus on reducing costs, improving affordability and delivering strong returns, while at the same time, we follow through on our commitment to invest in our future. As we look forward to 2015, we expect to continue to perform well. Dave will walk you through our 2015 guidance in a few minutes.","Demand from our broad base of customers continues to drive growth in our international business. Over the past few months, I continue to receive feedback from our international customers and investing in national security remains a top priority, given the global threat environment, and you can see this in both our fourth quarter and full year results.","Full year 2014 international bookings were up 27% over 2013 and were 35% of the total company bookings. I would note that our international book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.28 and at 4 -- at the fourth quarter, it was 2.0. So we finished the year with very solid international bookings.","We saw strong demand across our international portfolio during the year, including bookings from Qatar for Patriot and an air defense operating center; Kuwait for Patriot fire units; Canada for the North Warning System; several countries for AMRAAM; South Korea for GEM-T missiles and the Australia for the Air Warfare Destroyer, among a host of others.","At the end of Q4, international backlog increased to 40% of our total backlog. Our domestic bookings in 2014 also improved over 2013. We received key awards in training, SM-3, AMRAAM, Tomahawk and the FAA STARS program. We also closed on a key competitive awards, including the family of advanced beyond line of sight terminal. And last summer, we also had successful test of the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle that allows us to move forward on this important program that protects the homeland.","We saw strong bookings in our classified business, which includes both domestic and international, and our overall classified bookings increased by 29% in 2014.","We feel good about the outlook for 2015 and we expect another year with a book-to-bill ratio above 1. International bookings are expected to continue to be strong, representing approximately 1\/3 of our total 2015 bookings, driven by opportunities from a broad base of global customers and across a wide range of our products and solutions, including missiles, tactical radars and Command and Control systems.","In addition, demand for the proven Patriot systems air and missile defense capability continues. New opportunities in Asia and the Middle East as well as competitive awards in Europe continue to develop. As I just mentioned, we are close to finalizing a $2 billion Patriot order from an international customer in Q1. We also expect to conclude negotiations on a Patriot upgrade program in South Korea within the next 6 to 9 months. Keep in mind the GEM-T missile upgrade awarded to us in Q3 of 2014 is a precursor for Korea's expected follow-on hardware upgrade to Configuration-3 plus.","In Europe, Poland is expected to make the final down select for their medium-range integrated air and missile defense competition by the end of this year. Patriot is 1 of 2 systems in the final round of the competition.","From a domestic perspective, the final agreement on the fiscal year 2015 DoD base budget was reached in December. Modernization accounts came in several billion dollars higher than requested, yielding funding increases for several Raytheon programs. We expect the Administration to submit its fiscal year 2016 defense budget request next week. While we won't speculate on what the final funding level for DoD will be in fiscal year 2016, we will point out that even if the Budget Control Act caps are not raised at all, DoD base budget funding will be several billion dollars higher in fiscal year 2016 than fiscal year 2015. While the domestic market is still constrained, the trajectory of the DoD base budget is finally starting to trend upwards.","We see considerable opportunities in the domestic market. The growing sophistication of the threat to our national security is creating demand for new innovative solutions. As a result, we are investing more to develop the discriminating technologies and differentiated capabilities that will enable us to provide our customers what they need in areas such as missile defense, electronic warfare, high-energy lasers, advanced propulsion and undersea sensors. These investments will position us to capture future franchise programs and lay the foundation for growth.","Another area where we see continually evolving a pervasive threat is in cyber. In fact, we've seen a nomenclature change for certain areas of the industry. Whereas C3ISR expanded to C4ISR, this is now evolving to C5ISR where the latest C stands for cyber. Consistent with this, many of our customers are turning to us to incorporate the latest cyber protection into their networks and systems so that they are more secure. As always, we stand ready to help our global customers with our advanced cyber capabilities. At the end of the last decade, we began adding to our organic cyber capabilities through acquisitions and we've made a number of cyber-related acquisitions since then, positioning us as a technology leader in this growing market.","Our latest cyber-related acquisition was Blackbird technologies, which we completed in the fourth quarter. Blackbird not only adds unique cyber and other capabilities but also expands key market channels in the special operations and Intel markets for Raytheon. It is a great fit and we welcome their employees to the Raytheon team.","One of the key strengths of Raytheon is our ongoing commitment to our core values and in 2014, we were recognized for our achievements in the area of ethics and integrity, health and safety and sustainability. We were awarded the 2014 corporate leadership award by Transparency International-USA for our commitment to shape initiatives that promote high business standards, transparency and anticorruption in the U.S. and internationally. We achieved the best safety record in our history, significantly reducing both lost workdays and recordable injuries.","We received the ENERGY STAR Partner award for an EPA and have been recognized as one of the top green companies in America for our strong greenhouse gas reduction program and sound energy practices. We were also recognized as one of the 100 best corporate citizens by Corporate Responsibility magazine. Our goal is to continue to build on these successes.","Before wrapping up, I'd like to highlight another significant attribute that we pride ourselves on here at Raytheon: that is having a deep bench of management talent as a result of our strong leadership development and succession planning programs. Over recent weeks, we've made announcements that clearly demonstrate this. I'd like to again congratulate Dave Wajsgras on his new role as President of IIS. Dave has been CFO of Raytheon since 2006. His tenure as CFO has been an integral component of an exceptional period of value creation for the company. His deep industry background and broad experience working with both customers and industry partners will be key in driving the global growth strategy in IIS. Dave will be succeeding Lynn Dugle who will be retiring after serving more than 10 years with the company, including 6 years as a President of IIS where she delivered solid operating results and outstanding leadership.","I'd also like to welcome Toby O'Brien to his new role as CFO of Raytheon. As many of you know, Toby has been with the company for nearly 30 years and has held a number of business CFO roles in the company. He was CFO at IDS when I led the business. So I've had the pleasure of working with Toby before and look forward to doing so again. I'm confident he'll do a great job.","In summary, we had another great year at Raytheon and we have a solid outlook for 2015. With that, let me turn it over to Dave.","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and full year results, then I'll discuss our outlook for 2015 and after that, we'll open up the call for questions. So during my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on the Raytheon website.","Okay, if everyone could please move to Page 3. We delivered solid results in both the quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter operating margin was 14.1% and on an adjusted basis was 13%. For the full year, operating margin was 13.9% and 12.7% on an adjusted basis. Our fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations was $1.86 and on an adjusted basis, was $1.71. For the full year, EPS from continuing operations was $6.97 and our adjusted EPS was $6.12. Our sales for the quarter were $6.1 billion and $22.8 billion for the year. We also generated strong operating cash flow of over $825 million for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the year, after a $600 million pretax discretionary pension contribution, which was not in our prior guidance.","Additionally, the company repurchased 7.7 million shares of common stock for approximately $750 million in 2014. The company ended the year with a strong balance sheet and net debt of $611 million.","Also, as previously announced, the company acquired Blackbird technologies in the fourth quarter for approximately $425 million.","If you turn to Page 4, let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. We had strong bookings of $7.1 billion in the quarter and $24.1 billion for the full year, resulting in a year-end backlog of $33.6 billion. Our book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.16 and 1.05 for the year, and the company ended 2014 with a funded backlog of $23.1 billion.","For the quarter, international orders represented 50% of our total company bookings and for the full year, was 35% of total bookings. At the end of 2014, approximately 40% of our total backlog was international.","Turning now to Page 5. We had fourth quarter sales of $6.1 billion, up 5% over the same period in 2013 and again, was consistent with our expectations. So looking at the businesses, all had higher sales than the same period last year. Net sales at IDS were $1.6 billion in the quarter. Compared to last year's fourth quarter, the increase was primarily due to higher sales on international Patriot programs.","IIS net sales of $1.5 billion in the quarter were up from the same period last year, primarily due to higher volume on classified programs.","Missile Systems had fourth quarter 2014 net sales of $1.7 billion, up 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher sales on AMRAAM and evolved Sea Sparrow missile programs. And SAS had net sales of $1.7 billion in Q4, higher than the comparable period last year, primarily due to increased sales on an Electronic Warfare systems program.","For the year, sales were $22.8 billion, down 3.7%, again, consistent with our expectations. International sales growth partially offset a decline in domestic sales.","So moving ahead to Page 6, we delivered solid operational performance in the quarter and for the full year. Looking at business margins in the quarter, at IDS, IIS and missiles, margins were essentially in-line with or better than last year. In the fourth quarter 2014, IDS achieved some important program milestones and I did briefly discuss this on the call in October.","And at SAS, fourth quarter 2013 benefited from the timing of profit adjustments. Said another way, SAS had a tough comparison. Also, you may recall that this business had strong third quarter margins in 2014, driven by the timing of performance that we had previously expected in the fourth quarter. It's worth noting that at IDS, IIS and SAS, margins all exceed the guidance range that we provided back in October.","Missile Systems did come in slightly below our guidance, driven by program mix.","So on Page 7, you'll see the both the fourth quarter and full year EPS. In the fourth quarter 2014, our EPS was $1.86 and for the full year was $6.97. And on an adjusted basis, was $1.71 in the fourth quarter and $6.12 for the full year. EPS for the quarter was strong and included the extension of the R&D tax credit, which was not in our prior guidance. As I previously mentioned, the company generated strong operating cash flow of $2.1 billion in 2014. Again, this includes the $600 million pretax or $400 million after tax discretionary pension contribution, which was also not in our prior guidance. Excluding the net discretionary cash contribution, our operating cash flow in 2014 would have been $2.5 billion. It's worth noting that on this basis, we exceeded the guidance that we provided you in October due to the timing of collections.","Moving on to the 2015 guidance on Page 8. We see sales in the range of $22.3 billion to $22.8 billion, flat to slightly down from 2014. As for pension, we see the 2015 FAS\/CAS adjustment at a positive $197 million, which I'll further discuss in just a minute. We expect net interest expense to be between $225 million to $235 million. We see our average diluted shares outstanding to be between $305 million and $307 million on a full year basis.","As for our effective tax rate, we expect it to be approximately 27.5%. Our 2015 tax rate is higher than 2014, primarily due to the lapse of the R&D tax credit, which, again, is not included in our 2015 guidance. If the R&D tax credit is extended, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 110 basis points and our EPS by approximately $0.10.","As a reminder, we had an $83 million foreign tax credit in the first quarter of 2014, which also impacted the effective tax rate. And for 2015, we are anticipating a non-cash $88 million tax settlement in the second quarter.","In 2015, we show our EPS to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.35 and our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.49 to $5.64. Our operating cash flow guidance for 2015 is expected to increase to between $2.3 billion and $2.6 billion.","Before moving to Page 9, I want to mention that we expect the 2015 book-to-bill ratio to be between 1.0x and 1.05x, driven by continued demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. And we, again, expect stronger bookings in the second half of this year similar to both 2013 and 2014.","So if you move to Page 9. Here, we provided our initial 2015 guidance by business. Consistent with our prior comments, we expect 2015 adjusted margins to continue to be solid in the 12.1% to 12.3% range. Our margins for 2015 will be impacted by a change in program mix as well as higher investments in technology, with the objective of returning to top line growth. The investments we've made in GaN and cyber are paying off in significant ways today. We fully expect these new investments in radars, directed energy, EW and advanced propulsion to lay the foundation for growth over the next few years.","At IDS, we see margins in the 15.1% to 15.3% range. The change from 2014 is driven by mix, most notably, the planned completion of some of our international Patriot programs. And in 2015, we are ramping up on several new programs, including Qatar Patriot and the new international Patriot award expected in Q1. As you know, we typically see lower margins at the inception of longer duration programs, which can improve over time as we retire risks and drive operational improvements. Longer-term, we see IDS margins improving after 2015 as the overall business mix improves and as these new large international programs progress through the production cycle.","Additionally, you should note that we expect IIS margins of 7.4% to 7.6% to be impacted by approximately 60 basis points due to the Blackbird Technologies acquisition related costs. Excluding these, IIS margins would be in the range of 8% to 8.2%.","SAS margins are expected to be down, driven by mix from lower volume as a result of completing some international programs as well as from higher business investments in 2015.","Looking ahead, from a company level perspective, as domestic development programs transition to production and our international programs mature, we do see opportunity to improve margins in 2016 and beyond.","If you'd now turn to Page 10. We've provided you with our 2015 outlook by quarter. You'll notice the sales ramp throughout the year. In addition, the second quarter EPS is favorably impacted due to the previously mentioned non-cash $88 million tax settlement.","And finally, on Page 11. As we've done in the past, we provided a summary of the financial impact from pensions in 2014 as well as the projected 2015 through 2017 impact, holding all assumptions constant.","As I mentioned earlier, we see the 2015 FAS\/CAS adjustment at a positive $197 million, which reflects our investment returns in 2014 of over 6% on our U.S. pension assets and the December 31 discount rate of 4.1%. The discount rate is down 100 basis points from last year.","Further, we reduced our long-term return on asset assumptions from 8.75% to 8% due to a change in the allocation of our planned assets and related investment strategies.","Taken together, these result in a lower favorable FAS\/CAS pension impact in 2015 compared to '14.","Looking beyond 2015, it's important to keep in mind for each 25 basis point change in the discount rate, a result of $65 million to $75 million change in FAS\/CAS takes place.","Lastly, required pension contributions are decreasing in the near term as CAS recovery is increasing. This has a favorable impact on our pretax net cash flow over the forecast horizon.","Before concluding, I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Toby on his promotion. I've worked with Toby for 9 years and I can tell you that he understands Raytheon, has a strong network and is well respected across the entire company. He has a deep understanding of finance, the industry and our customers and he also has a strong commercial background, having been the CFO of Raytheon Aircraft for close to 5 years. His extensive and broad background provides a strong foundation for his and Raytheon's future success. Now on a personal note, I would like to mention that it's been great to work with all of you since joining Raytheon, and I'm looking very forward to my new role. I'm sure I'll see you at future Raytheon events.","Let me conclude by saying that in 2014, Raytheon, again, delivered solid operating performance with bookings, margins, earnings and operating cash flow, all on or ahead of expectations. Book-to-bill was strong and our international business continues to grow. We have a strong balance sheet which gives us substantial flexibility and options to continue to drive shareholder value. With that, we'll open up the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I want to make sure I understand the bookings and backlog trajectory better. And you booked $24 billion in '14, that's up from the prior year, and your book-to-bill is above 1, yet your backlog declined slightly. Can you connect those 2 so I can understand why -- how that decline happened despite the good book-to-bill?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes, sure. This is Dave. Our book-to-bill in 2014 was 1.05, as you just mentioned. With that said, we did have a little over $1 billion in backlog adjustments, which was in line with the adjustments we've had over a number of years historically. And just to be clear, backlog adjustments reflect several items including currency fluctuations, under runs on completed cost type contracts and scope changes, including scope reduction on contracts and finally, contract terminations. I hope that helps.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, it does. And what I'm just trying to understand is you mentioned some of the areas that you're investing in and so -- to lead to top line growth but when you look at your guidance for next year, you've got a lower revenue number. And if we come in with a book-to-bill again like this and -- what I'm worried about is that you have a trajectory with backlog may continue to decline, and I'm trying to understand when we should expect to see that growth in the top line.","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. So Doug, for next year, we see sales essentially in line with 2014, flat to maybe down 2%. As you look beyond the 2015 time frame, we do expect to return to growth in '16 and beyond. And importantly, again, we do see very strong bookings, both domestically and internationally, again, in 2015 that we saw in '14.","Thomas A. Kennedy","And Doug, just one last one there, in 2016, we'll have ramped up on 2 major new Patriot programs, Qatar and the other one that will be coming in this quarter, and so that will generate significant revenue growth for 2016.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But what I'm trying to understand on that is that the international -- a lot of the international orders, as you ramp down, say, on U.A.E, you ramp up on Qatar and others, how do you see that ebb and flow? Because you also have some coming down at the same time and it's quite difficult to track how each of these sort of adds and subtracts from your, I guess, top line.","David C. Wajsgras","So Doug, let me try to add something here. So you'll recall, there was a fairly significant reduction in the DoD budget as we entered into the period of sequestration. That impacted the entire industry and Raytheon was not immune from that reduction. So what happened a few years back is now making its way through the backlog and through the sales line. That's partially offset over the last few years by the strength of our international bookings and our international growth. So as we look forward, what happened from 2012 to '13 is now in the rearview mirror from an overall financial performance standpoint. And again, we do expect to return to growth beyond '15.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So does this mean that your expectations for your U.S. defense revenues, you're expecting that to stabilize, which would make the international contributions more positive and allow you to grow? Is that fair?","Thomas A. Kennedy","Yes, Doug. I think you hit the nail right on the head. The bottom line is, is that the defense budget, even with the BCA restrictions in caps, does start to increase in 2016 and beyond. And so our domestic business will start to trend up at that point but at the same time, we have a very, very strong backlog on the international, which we'll also be driving forward in terms of revenue. So we think we see 2016 as a year that we start ticking up.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Dave, can you talk a little bit about the cash flow? If I just look year-over-year, you talked about a $900 million less contribution for pension but you don't see operating cash flow go up anywhere near that. So can you just talk about some of the moving pieces as to -- cash taxes and others as to why you're not seeing as big of an increase without the pension contribution?","David C. Wajsgras","So Sam, I was literally 100% certain you were going to ask me that question. So let me try to summarize it for you. In 2014, we had 2 items that impacted cash flow at the end of the year. We had the discretionary pension contribution of $400 million on a net basis, and we also saw some year-end collections in Q4 that we had expected in the first quarter of 2015, that's between roughly $100 million and $150 million. So when you normalize for these 2 items, 2014, we did achieve the high end of our guidance at roughly $2,350,000,000. And for 2015, adjusting for the earlier collections, the range would be $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion. So if you look at this year-over-year on a normalized basis, 2015 is roughly $300 million to $400 million higher than '14 at the high end of the range. So I hope that clarifies it for you. I tried to give you some numbers as I was walking through this.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. And then can you give an update just on the GPS OCX program just because there was a lot of press about overruns there? I'm trying to just square that as to is that any impact in why IIS margins, even without the Blackbird, are still showing a decline next year or in '15?","Thomas A. Kennedy","Let me attack that one. On the GPS OCX program, there were some issues, we have worked with the Air Force on those. It is a very complex program, technology advanced. Number one, it is a cost-plus program, development program, and it is revolutionary relative to adding information insurance capability to a very large ground station for the GPS system. And we have been working with the Air Force on that program, we believe that we have turned the corner on that program moving forward, and we don't see any impact in this year or in the out years relative to that program.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Two questions. Nice to -- good luck, Toby.","Toby O'Brien","Thanks, Howard.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","But first is if we look across the board, although you set us up, Dave, a little bit for lower margins and discussed mix, it still seems as if there's a change in the trajectory of the business. And is this as much a setup for what you said is well, we beat our margins from our initial guidance? Or in fact, is there a business change?","David C. Wajsgras","No. So Howard, I appreciate you asking that question. So let me start out by saying at the end of last year, when Tom and I participated at the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse conference, we did talk about adjusted margins in 2015 being in sort of the lower 12% range. So again, we're projecting 12.1% to 12.3%. Now there's a number of areas that are important to mention here. Firstly, there is the program mix, particularly at IDS. And we talked about the cadence of the longer duration production programs coming down in '15 as we start out on the new programs that we were recently awarded and fully expect to be awarded in the first quarter and throughout the year. Secondly and maybe more importantly, we are increasing our spend in IRAD and program investments. Last -- we closed out the year last year with IRAD at just a little over 2% of sales. And as we look at 2015, we expect it to be closer to 3% of sales and that is -- those are important technology investments that Tom addressed earlier that position us well for both the top line and the bottom line growth. And then lastly, we mentioned this a little earlier as well, IIS, the acquisition of Blackbird Technologies, from an IIS standpoint, there's about 60 basis points of impact from the amortization of acquisition cost through intangibles. And at the company level, that's about 15 to 20 basis points. Now what I just went through, there is an offset there. There continues to be higher productivity as a result of the focused efforts throughout the company. But when you stand back and look at this, 2015 is a very strong year and positions us well for 2016 and beyond.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I'm going to switch for a moment. And Tom, I know you've been talking about a large $2 billion order for some time and it's always hard to pin down a date. Could you elaborate a little bit on what gives you increased confidence that we'll see it in this first quarter?","Thomas A. Kennedy","Yes. So last year, we had 2 big international awards that we were working to bring in. One of them, we did, which was Qatar for about $2.4 billion that came in December. This other one did slip into the first quarter and we are very close to closing on that deal. Based on the customer schedule, this one will close in this quarter, I'm highly confident of that. And that's about a $2 billion Patriot order. What's significant here, Howard, is both the Qatar and this order will be going on at the same time. So it's definitely going to give us an economic order quantity capability in terms of being able to get the best material buys for those programs. And also we'll definitely be turning the factory 3 shifts on those 2 programs over here for the next 3 to 4 years. So they are very important and are back-to-back, which is good for us.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Dave, we can't let you go without a question about pension.","David C. Wajsgras","Yes, we had a feeling that was coming as well.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I thought really, when you mentioned the discount rate had changed but also I was wondering if you could comment on how your rate of return ended up for 2014 relative to what you told us in Q3. And also, what's prompted you in this 3 months' period to change your assumed rate of return.","David C. Wajsgras","Sure, yes. We ended the year with a little over 6% actual return on our pension assets in '14. And looking ahead, every year, we evaluate our long-term return on asset assumptions. So in the fourth quarter of '14, we did reduce our long-term target allocation for equities and increased our target allocation for fixed income, and that's principally in order to reduce our overall exposure to equity volatility going forward. The change in asset allocation resulted in a reduction of our long-term ROA assumption of about 75 basis points, and that's basically, in a nutshell, how we see things going forward.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up on the guidance. I notice you've increased your interest expense expectations. Can you give us an idea of what's behind that ? I mean, are you anticipating taking on more debt? Or is your cost of debt going higher?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, you'll recall that we issued $600 million of debt in Q4. $300 million in 10s and $300 million in 30s. Average cost was around 4% and that's what you're seeing impact interest expense in 2015. It's all fixed rate, that's an important thing to note. It's all fixed rate.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So you're not anticipating any additional debt movement beyond what's the announcement?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, look, we're always looking at our capital structure to optimize the financial foundation of the company. Standing back, we still have a very strong A- rating. We've talked about this in the past. We don't see ourselves going lower than BBB+. I think I mentioned that exactly on the third quarter call. So we could, in the future, but I'm not signaling anything. We have a very strong balance sheet and there is room to use the balance sheet from a shareholder perspective and from other perspectives. It's just a very solid foundation.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research","A question, Dave. The margins were down in '14, you're projecting them down in '15 again and then maybe a little bit better in '16. I mean, how do you look at what normalized margin should be? I mean, obviously, the investments you're making are somewhat discretionary. So I just kind of see if you have a -- what your answer to that might be.","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. Thanks, George. So let me start by saying our objective is to improve and grow earnings through both top line and margin improvement. So the company's focused on program execution, on cost reduction and importantly, margin performance and we've talked about this before. If you look at the company, changes in mix, the timing of program completions and program starts, all impact margin. In 2015, and I mentioned this earlier, we're making important technology investments that drive future growth in margin expansion. After 2015, we do see opportunity for margins to increase on an adjusted basis, not from only a FAS\/CAS basis. And it's driven by a number of different initiatives, in addition to the overall business mix improving over time. Tom and I both talked about strategic sourcing, facility optimization, expanding what we call our Global Business Services, which is our shared service initiative internally. So when you look at all this together, I think you framed it correctly. We do see growing margins in 2016 and beyond. But at this point, we're not going to suggest a target margin profile for the company.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research","Okay. And one different one, Dave. I don't want to disappoint you because you figured I'd probably ask this as well. How much was international sales up versus domestic down?","David C. Wajsgras","International sales in 2014 were up about 1.5% and domestic was down about 5.5%.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research","And how about Q4?","David C. Wajsgras","In Q4, I'm glad you asked that, George. International was up by about 6% and domestic was up over 4%.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","I appreciate all the commentary on margins. I'm going to go there again, particularly sort of at IDS. You obviously gave great color on sort of the ramping work in Patriot and all that, but is there something maybe going on? We've obviously always held the belief that international is much more profitable than domestic, which, of course, it still is and will be going forward. But is there anything that you're seeing structurally, particularly maybe in the FMS arena that's causing some degree of pressure on the international margin side, maybe it's the bidding environment getting a little more aggressive? Is it -- should we think of that sort of traditional gap between international and domestic holding as we look out over the next couple of years? Or might we see some compression on some of the international margin side?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. So Hunter, I think it's probably best to let Toby O'Brien handle that question since he just spent 5 or 6 years at the business. So Toby, go ahead.","Toby O'Brien","Sure, Dave. And Hunter, Dave hit some of this in his comments and I'll just try to add a little bit of color to that. I do have a good handle on the business, having been there for about 6 years, as Dave said, and know what drives it. From a big picture point of view, I can tell you it remains a very solid business. There are many things that can impact margins but really, the story with IDS margins in 2015 is driven by mix, program mix and timing. And I think the thing to understand is that we've seen this before a few years ago, where IDS margins did fluctuate year-over-year and then they did come back, okay? And at that point in time, it was the same thing, it was a combination of the mix and the timing related to the program completions and program startups, the same things that are impacting us here in 2015. So this is not a new phenomenon. We don't see any other pressures on the business related to your other question. And to reinforce what Dave said, we would expect to see the margin profile at IDS to improve after 2015 as the mix improves. And these awards that we've talked about, Qatar and the other one that we expect here in the first quarter that Tom talked about, as they move through their production cycle.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research, LLC","And another one on -- maybe this is sort of a backdoor M&A question, but you talked obviously, about even a sequestration comes back into play, you're going to see a higher baseline budget going forward. But obviously, the investment accounts are going to be under a little bit more pressure. Do you guys see yourselves trying to move into sort of getting a bigger chunk of say, the O&M budget to generally [ph] sort of try to offset a little bit of incremental revenue headwinds that you might see in some procurement in R&D accounts?","Thomas A. Kennedy","Well I think bottom line is in fiscal year '16, even with the BCA caps, the domestic base budget does go up. And we also, if you look at the F '15 fi-ed [ph] up, you'll see that the Administration has come in about $35 billion over what the BCA caps are for fiscal year '16. So in either case, there will be a larger base budget. And as part of that base budget the modernization is also going up. And so we believe that the domestic, we will have some uptick business. We're also seeing -- and that's why we're making some investments this year with the evolving threat out there, there's some opportunities for some -- inserting some new technology in -- starting in '16 and '17. And so that's another area why we're moving forward on that. On the LISC, the LISC is a great win for us. It's a joint venture that we have with General Dynamics, and that does give us insight into the ranges across an entire Air Force. So it's a great program for us there just on the base program itself, but giving us insight into what technologies we can bring to bear to the Air Force to help them as they move forward to get to a more affordable solution for all of the ranges. And then the other major area we have is the Warfighter FOCUS Program in terms of training. And we're working with our customers to ensure they have the appropriate training moving forward to be more efficient and from an affordability perspective.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Dave, can you quantify either in dollar terms or as a percentage of revenue, the investments that you said that you're making here again in cyber, direct energy, electronic warfare, advanced propulsion? Kind of on a year-over-year basis, how much is growth that we're seeing in the spend here in 2015 and what's the spend trajectory look like for the next couple of years?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. So specifically on the internal R&D, I noted it before with an earlier question, but I didn't give out the specific dollars. Let me start out again by saying in 2014, that ran a little over 2% of sales and in 2015, will be close to 3% of sales. That translates into roughly speaking, about $500 million of direct R&D spend in 2014, up to between $600 million and $650 million in R&D spend in 2015. Now importantly, that's only one element of our overall R&D focus. Every year, we book and bill, essentially, between $1 billion and $1.5 billion of customer funded R&D. And this is another important element of our overall focus on technologies. And lastly, there are occasions where we win large programs, particularly international, where part of the program win is development activity for technologies that we can leverage on the other programs in the future. So I hope that helps and clarifies the way we're thinking about the company in '15 and beyond.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No, that is helpful. But as you look out to '16 and '17 and beyond, are we moving our internal R&D from 2% of sales to 3% in perpetuity? Or is 2015 a special year and we go back to 2% in the future?","David C. Wajsgras","No, I'm actually glad you asked that. We're thinking about internal R&D in the upper 2% range for the foreseeable future.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then on the yet to be named Patriot customer, can you talk about what region in the world that might be coming from?","Thomas A. Kennedy","Well, the world is a pretty big place. So let's put it this way. There's 3 regions where we have significant demand for Patriot. And one is Eastern Europe, another one is the MENA region, and the other one is Asia-Pacific. And it's in one of those regions. So I can't get into a direct -- but all I can tell you is I do have a team in country. We are -- we essentially completed all of our activities and now the customer is now going through some of their final arrangements, and we look pretty strong here for a Q1 award. And again, it is important because if you take that on top of the $2.4 billion Qatar, that's within a very short period of time, $4.4 billion of pure Patriot manufacturing where we have significant control over, how you say, efficiencies and in driving our material cost down to ensure we provide, I\u2019d say, pretty good margins on those programs.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And can you remind us, the installed base on Patriot is 11 or 12 countries at this point, how many of them still need to have an upgrade?","Thomas A. Kennedy","So we have about -- the new addition of Qatar, we have 13 countries that have Patriot, that's with the addition of Qatar. And out of those, we have probably another 7 -- actually, it's 8, another 8 will have opportunities for the Configuration-3 upgrade. We have the upgrade we've done in Taiwan, we have done the upgrade in UAE. We're doing -- we'll be doing the upgrade in Korea moving forward, and also Qatar, we'll have that upgrade in it. And we've also been doing an upgrade in Saudi on Configuration-3 plus. And then Kuwait, if you remember at the beginning of this year to the beginning of 2014, the first quarter, we got an order for Kuwait for a Configuration-3 plus. So the bottom line is, significant opportunity within the consortium of Patriot users and again, we're up to 13 countries. And with the Polish competition, if that goes in the right direction, that will give us another country and allow us to have 14 participants in the Patriot consortium worldwide.","Todd B. Ernst","Taheesha, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Your last question will come from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to ask about from a couple of perspectives. One, can you tell us how much Blackbird is going to contribute to revenue in 2015? And then part 2, just on the cash flow outlook, it really looks like at a reasonable level of share repurchases, it really looks like your dry powder is going to build pretty meaningfully over the next couple of years. So should we expect especially now that you've got maybe some better DoD budget visibility, should we expect M&A to accelerate kind of sharply over the next couple of years?","Thomas A. Kennedy","Let me talk about Blackbird real quick here. It is a great acquisition for us, number one, for its technology and also for its channels into both SOCOM and the Intel communities. But in terms of this year, it will give us about a 1% in terms of revenue contribution to the business. Just one other element we -- it is a very excellent management team for Blackbird and also have a great workforce of I would call some very highly skilled technical folks. So we're looking forward to the synergies that we'll be able to achieve via that acquisition.","David C. Wajsgras","So Pete, again, Toby O'Brien, the soon to be official CFO, it's probably best for him to talk about his thoughts on capital deployment going forward. So Toby, why don't you handle that?","Toby O'Brien","Sure Dave. So Pete, as Todd mentioned, I won't officially be in the CFO seat here until early March, but capital deployment is something I've spent some time on and given some thought. And Tom and Dave have described our priorities for capital deployment for a while and they've been pretty consistent. And I do believe that our approach has and will continue to serve us and our shareholders well. So bottom line at this point, I don't foresee the need for any meaningful changes to our current approach or priorities. That said, we will continue with an active share repurchase program. We will continue to recommend annual dividend increases to our Board. And given the funded status of the pension plans and where we are now forecasting markets over the next 3 years, we are not currently seeing any need for further discretionary pension contributions. And lastly, as you know, our global growth objective, it's very key to us and will continue to be a priority. And acquisitions that create shareholder value, meaning that they have to make sense economically, they have to fill a gap from a product technology or market channel standpoint. They will become a focus more than they have in prior years and Tom just described Black Border -- Blackbird -- excuse me and that's a good example of an acquisition that met that criteria.","Todd B. Ernst","All right, great. Well, thank you. We'll have to leave it there. Thank you for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter conference call in April. Taheesha?","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"18294":["Raytheon Co.

My name is Katina, and I will be your operator for today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay proposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Todd Ernst - Raytheon Co.","Thank you, Katina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our third quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com.","Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website. With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon once again delivered strong operating performance in the third quarter. Our revenue increased by 4.5%, driven equally by both domestic and international growth. We also achieved solid operating margins. Earnings per share was well ahead of our prior guidance for the quarter, allowing us to increase our EPS guidance for the year. We continue to see strong global demand for our advanced solutions. Book-to-bill in the third quarter was 1.11. This drove an increase in backlog of nearly $1 billion year-over-year.","Given this and opportunities we see in the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our bookings outlook for the year by another $500 million. It's worth noting that since the beginning of this year, we have increased our bookings outlook by a total of $1.5 billion over our original expectation and now expect the full year book-to-bill ratio of 1.07.","So as you can see, our growth strategy remains on track, which positions us well as we head into 2018. Toby will discuss additional details about our third quarter performance, updates to guidance, as well as our initial 2018 outlook in a few minutes.","Over the past couple of months, I've met face to face with many of our global customers including just this past Tuesday when I attended the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The conference was a unique opportunity for global business and Saudi leaders to discuss industry and company investment opportunities in the Kingdom. My takeaway from that dialogue and others I've had around the globe over the past several months is that Raytheon's broad portfolio of capabilities remains well aligned with these customers' rapidly evolving requirements.","One area where we are seeing strong demand is within our Integrated Air and Missile Defense portfolio both domestically and internationally. We have a wide range of solutions to address threats ranging from short-range rockets, all the way to intercontinental ballistic missiles. Raytheon has developed some of the strongest domain expertise derived from decades of experience designing and building interceptors, radars and command and control networks.","There are several notable third quarter achievements in this area that I'd like to point out. We received a booking of $492 million for the development of the Redesigned Kill Vehicle also known as the RKV. RKV is the next-generation kill vehicle for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense System.","As you may know, GMD is the United States' anti-ballistic missile system for intercepting incoming warheads in space during the midcourse phase of flight. It is a major component of our country's defense strategy to counter intercontinental ballistic missile threats.","In addition, in August, the Air and Missile Defense Radar we're developing for the U.S. Navy successfully searched for, acquired and tracked a ballistic missile target. Also known as AMDR, this was the radar's second test against a live target and featured a more complex, threat-representative ballistic missile target than prior engagements. And in September, during a third AMDR test, the radar successfully tracked multiple simultaneous missile targets. We're very pleased with the performance of this new radar against increasingly complex threat scenarios.","Also in August, a Standard Missile-6 successfully intercepted a medium range ballistic missile at sea in its terminal phase. This shows that the SM-6 is a highly versatile missile that can perform missions from anti-air to anti-surface warfare and now even more advanced sea-based ballistic missile defense.","And after the quarter, in early October, Raytheon interceptors downed four missiles in a NATO test exercise over European waters that showcased our multiple innovative solutions to protect against ever-advancing threats. Our Standard Missile-2 and the evolved SeaSparrow missile successfully knocked down anti-ship cruise missiles, while our Standard Missile-3 IB successfully intercepted a medium-range ballistic missile target, an important milestone that paves the way for full-rate production.","We also continue to see very strong demand for Integrated Air and Missile Defense solutions in the international market. For example, earlier this month, Congress was notified of a $15 billion sale of seven THAAD fire units and related equipment to Saudi Arabia. Critical to the THAAD system capability is a long-range TPY-2 radar which Raytheon produces. With each fire unit having one TPY-2 radar, we believe the opportunity for us is in the $3 billion to $4 billion range. While the timing of international awards is always difficult to predict, we currently expect an award for this opportunity in the late 2018 or 2019 timeframe.","In addition, Japan has indicated that it is pursuing missile defense solutions to protect its homeland, creating opportunities for us with our AMDR, SM-3 Block IIA missiles and SM-6 missiles. I would add that we co-produce SM-3 Block IIA missiles with Japan. Beyond this, we continue to make progress on several large Patriot opportunities in Europe and we see additional demand signal for early warning sensing and missile defense offerings in the Middle East.","Let me point out several other areas where we're seeing strong demand. In the third quarter, we had significant bookings for TOW, Excalibur, training as well as strong classified bookings in Missiles, SAS and IIS. We also received an award for the Long-Range Standoff Missile that leverages Raytheon's domain expertise in this area.","In ISR, we were selected by DigitalGlobe as the provider of the next-generation imaging payload for its WorldView Legion satellite constellation. Raytheon's new payload extends our expertise in defense imaging solutions into the commercial markets.","And in a big milestone for our cybersecurity business, after the close of the third quarter, the Government Accountability Office dismissed the DOMino protest on all grounds and IIS is now actively working with the Department of Homeland Security on cybersecuring the .gov domain. DOMino is over $1 billion IDIQ contract that is vital to U.S. national and economic security. It's one of the largest single cybersecurity contracts ever awarded.","As I look to the future, I'm excited about the strong customer interest we're generating in some of our newest technologies, some of them which were on display at AUSA earlier this month. One example is our new SkyHunter system, a collaboration between Raytheon and Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. This system is designed to help protect U.S. forces and their allies from short-range threats including short-range rockets. SkyHunter is based on a combat-proven Iron Dome system, which has more than 1,500 intercepts to date. The SkyHunter variant recently completed successful testing at White Sands and is available for procurement and rapid deployment.","Another product that was well received at AUSA was our vehicle-mounted High-Energy Laser, which can knock drones out of the sky, an increasingly important capability in theater. We have already begun field tests of this advanced capability and we will be demonstrating it in an upcoming U.S. Army event in December.","Before concluding, I would like to take a moment to briefly touch on the U.S. defense budget in the current environment in Washington. As most of you know, we are again operating under a continuing resolution through early December as we had anticipated when we last gave guidance in July. We are cautiously optimistic that a final defense appropriations bill will be completed by the end of December or shortly thereafter. We continue to see strong support for the fiscal year 2018 defense spending in congressional committee markups.","Lastly, during the third quarter, Raytheon celebrated its 95th anniversary. And while our products and systems may have changed over the decades, what has remained the same is our focus on providing innovative technologies and solutions for the success of our customers, company and shareholders. Thank you to the generations of Raytheon teammates, past and present, who have made it all possible.","Now let me turn the call over to Toby.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the third quarter highlights. And then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. If everyone would please turn to page 3. We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the third quarter, with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all at or better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the third quarter of $7 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11.","Sales were $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 4.5% with growth across all of our businesses. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.97, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes. We generated solid operating cash flow of $382 million in the third quarter. Operating cash flow was lower than last year's third quarter, as expected, primarily due to higher required pension contributions in the third quarter 2017. This was partially offset by the timing of collections.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.1 million shares of common stock for $200 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 4.4 million shares for $700 million. I also want to point out, based on our strong performance to date, that we're raising our full-year 2017 outlook for bookings and EPS that we provided in July. We are also updating the expected sales growth range from 4% to 6% to 5% to 6%, as well as making other updates. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.","Turning now to page 4, let me start by providing some detail on our third quarter results. Company bookings continue to be strong. For the third quarter, bookings were $7 billion, and on a year-to-date basis, were $19.2 billion. It's worth noting that on a trailing four-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.08. Total backlog at the end of the third quarter was $36.7 billion, an increase of approximately $950 million compared to the end of the third quarter 2016.","If you'd now move to page 5, third quarter 2017 sales were in line with the guidance we set in July. Our international sales were approximately 32% of total sales.","Looking now at sales by business. IDS had third quarter 2017 net sales of $1.4 billion, up 4% compared with the same quarter last year. The increase in net sales for the quarter was driven primarily by higher net sales on an International Early Warning Radar Program.","Missile Systems had third quarter 2017 net sales of $1.9 billion. The 10% increase from the third quarter 2016 was primarily due to the Paveway and Excalibur programs. And at IIS, SAS and Forcepoint, sales were up slightly compared with the same period last year.","Moving ahead to page 6. Overall, the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 13.7% for the total company and 13% on a business segment basis.","So looking now at the business margins. IDS third quarter 2017 operating margin was strong at 16.6%, an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year. The increase was driven by improved program performance. The decrease in operating margin at IIS in the third quarter compared with the same period last year, as expected, was primarily driven by a change in program mix and other performance.","Missiles margin was up 110 basis points in the quarter compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies. This increase was driven by favorable adjustments on a couple of international contracts due to a change in requirements, partially offset by an unfavorable contract modification. SAS operating margin was in line with last year's third quarter. And at Forcepoint, the third quarter 2017 operating margin, as expected, was lower than last year's comparable quarter primarily due to investments to expand the sales force capacity, increase the new business pipeline and improve brand awareness.","Additionally, I want to point out that our third quarter operating income was unfavorably impacted by $26 million for the annual actuarial update to our pension plans. I'll touch on this more in a minute.","Turning now to page 7. Third quarter 2017 EPS was $1.97, better than expected, primarily driven by strong margin performance as we accelerated some program efficiencies that were previously expected later in the year.","On page 8, as I mentioned earlier, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2017 to reflect our improved operating performance to date and our expectations for the fourth quarter. We have increased the low end of our full year 2017 net sales by $200 million and we now expect net sales to be between $25.3 billion and $25.6 billion, up 5% to 6% from 2016. The increase over 2016 is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business.","As I just mentioned, and as we have done in prior years, during the third quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of this update, the FAS\/CAS adjustment for the year decreased by $39 million from $428 million to $389 million or an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.09 per share. Again, $26 million or $0.06 per share was recorded in the third quarter 2017 and $13 million or $0.03 per share is expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter 2017.","Turning to share count. We continue to see our average diluted shares outstanding at approximately 292 million shares for 2017, a 2% year-over-year reduction, consistent with what we said in July. We are reducing the range of our net interest expense to be between $185 million and $190 million to reflect higher average cash balances and interest rates on cash. This is worth about $0.02 to EPS compared to our prior guidance. We have slightly lowered our effective tax rate to reflect an update to the assumed tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation and for some additional tax planning items within the second half of the year.","The total benefit is worth about $0.05 per share for the full year. We now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30% for the year. We've increased our full year 2017 EPS, raising the low end by $0.10 and the high end by $0.05 from our prior guidance, after absorbing the $0.09 per share unfavorable pension impact I just discussed.","We now expect our EPS to be in the range of $7.45 to $7.55. The increase is primarily driven by our improved performance to-date as well as the improvement to the effective tax rate and lower net interest expense. Our operating cash flow in the third quarter was in line with our prior expectations. We continue to see our 2017 operating cash flow outlook between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion. Similar to last year, and as I mentioned on the last earnings call, our cash flow profile is more heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter due to the timing of program milestones and collections on some of our larger contracts.","And as you can see on page 9, we've included guidance by business. We've increased the low end of the guidance range for the full year sales outlook at IDS, IIS, Missiles and SAS to reflect a combination of stronger bookings performance to-date and fourth quarter expectations.","Looking at margins, at the business segment level compared to our prior guidance, we have raised the low end of the range by 10 basis points and now see business segment operating margin in a range of 12.5% to 12.6% for the full year. And at the company level, as a result of the actuarial update to the pension plans that I previously discussed, we have narrowed the margin range from our prior guidance and now see our company operating margin to be in a range of 13.2% to 13.3% for the full year.","Before moving on to page 10. As Tom mentioned earlier, given our year-to-date bookings strength and our expectation for a solid fourth quarter, we are now raising our full-year 2017 bookings outlook to a range of between $26.5 billion to $27.5 billion. This $500 million increase to the prior range is driven by strong demand from our global customers and positions us well for 2018. We expect international to be about a third of total bookings this year.","On page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see the fourth quarter for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations. We expect our fourth quarter sales to be in a range of $6.7 billion to $7 billion and EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in a range of $1.86 to $1.96. We expect operating cash flow to be in a range of $1.7 billion to $2 billion.","Now turning to next year, as we have done in the past, we intend to provide detailed 2018 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. As we sit here today, we currently see the book-to-bill ratio in 2018 above 1 and strong sales growth for 2018 of 3% to 5% over the midpoint of our 2017 outlook. We expect business segment margin to be up slightly in 2018 compared to 2017, driven primarily by improved program mix. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 31% in 2018. I would note that this tax rate guidance reflects current law.","In addition, we expect solid operating cash flow in 2018, in line with 2017 as improvement from the businesses is offset by higher cash taxes, and as expected, higher required pension contributions. Of course, I want to caveat all this by saying our assumptions are based on a defense budget being approved in Washington before year end, thereby avoiding an extended CR or a government shutdown.","So, if you could please move to page 11. We have provided a combined FAS\/CAS adjustment matrix for 2018. As we sit here today, the discount rate is approximately 30 basis points to 40 basis points lower than it was at the end of 2016 and would be roughly 4%. And our return on assets through October 25 is a little above 11%. And just to be clear, the final discount rate and the actual asset returns won't be known until we close out 2017.","Before moving on, I want to point out that consistent with our public filings, we plan to adopt the new retirement benefits standard in the first quarter of 2018, which moves the presentation of certain components of FAS, pension and postretirement benefit expense from operating to non-operating income.","We expect the standard to increase operating income due to the removal of all components of SAS expense other than service costs. Likewise, we expect non-operating income to decrease by the same amount with no impact to net income. As a result, our FAS\/CAS adjustment will be split into FAS\/CAS operating income and FAS\/CAS non-operating expense. We'll provide a more detailed pension outlook on our year-end call in January.","Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls, with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we continue to expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year and are targeting returning approximately 80% of free cash flow to shareholders, while maintaining a strong balance sheet.","In summary, we had another strong quarter. Our bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow were at or above our expectations. We remain well positioned with both our domestic and international customers' priority areas. We increased our full-year 2017 outlook for bookings and EPS, updated the sales growth range to 5% to 6% and have a solid foundation for continued growth in 2018.","With that, Tom and I will open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky representing Citi. Please proceed.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Jason.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, Tom, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the backlog \u2013 or the bookings outlook, I should say, for 2018. Maybe you talk a little bit about the major pursuits that you have there and maybe the international domestic mix that you expect. And then finally, in the context of other bookings pursuits, talk a little bit about the contract vehicles that you've been experiencing in weight (26:37) and kind of what you expect going forward and whether there are any significant changes that you're seeing being used by any of your customers that might inform us about the risk profile or the margins on a go-forward basis? Thanks.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","That's a great question. It's going to take a little while to answer all of it. But let me start off on 2018. I mean it's all a good new story here. In 2018, we do expect a solid bookings year. We do believe it will be a book-to-bill above 1, looking into the overall year. Right now, we are seeing roughly 40 opportunities, 40 opportunities that are greater than $100 million. About one-third of our total bookings are expected to come from our international customers and I'm going to tie that back into your question about contract vehicles later as it is important. For IDS, we see around two-thirds of their bookings being international, that's made up of Patriot-related bookings in Europe and the Middle East, plus other Integrated Air and Missile Defense opportunities.","The balance of the international is comprised of other spares, upgrades, sustainment and training contracts. And we also expect IDS to have solid domestic bookings on various naval systems, missile defense and Patriot programs. IDS has a good mix on classified, Intel, cyber training, missions support. The domestic bookings for IAS will make up about 85% of their bookings; at least that's our plan to date. And Missiles, we see a solid mix of both international and domestic awards and that's going to be throughout the year and it's across their entire portfolio. Every one of their franchises has significant demand signals in 2018.","On the domestic side, we see over about $1.5 billion on SM-3, AMRAAM and also the SM-6. In addition, there is significant opportunities for AIM-9X, Tomahawk and Phalanx. Now about one third of their bookings will be coming from international customers, including $1 billion on Paveway in addition to other opportunities for AMRAAM, Stinger, TOW and Phalanx. And then for SAS, we see about $3 billion related to electronic warfare and ISR, along with opportunities in classified space and tactical airborne systems and their total international should be about one-fifth of their business.","Now I'm going to answer your question relative to contract vehicles. So on our domestic work, a majority of the contract vehicles are either cost plus, either fixed fee or incentive fee and that's usually associated with development programs. Transitioning into production, the LRIPs, we see a majority of those contracts going into fixed-price incentive-fee and then into full rate production, either fixed price incentive fee or firm-fixed-price.","On the international side, we have our set of FMS contracts and about half of our international business is on the, I would call it, the FMS-type contract vehicles. And those FMS contract vehicles, they range very similar to domestic. There are some cost-plus contracts. There are fixed price incentive fee contracts and also firm-fixed-price. And I would say it's a mix of those three types of contract vehicles. But we also have half of our international business is direct commercial sale. So it's a true commercial contract and that's where we do see our highest margins in the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr representing Cowen & Company. Please proceed.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Company, LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. So your full-year guidance for Forcepoint assumes \u2013 looks like it assumes the profits are down in the fourth quarter. Maybe give us some color overall in terms of how is Forcepoint doing, why is the fourth quarter down and what does all of this imply for 2018. Thank you.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. Hi Cai, it's Toby. I'll start and then Tom can jump in here if he wants to add some color to it. I'll maybe start with 2018 and work my way back here a little bit. But for 2018, we're early in our process. But I'll tell you for Forcepoint, we are looking at about a 10% plus or minus top-line growth and double-digit margins. Okay. So that's kind of how we're thinking of things going forward.","In the quarter, the sales at Forcepoint were up about 2%. If you adjust for their legacy filtering business that we've talked about in the past has been dwindling, it was about a 5% increase in the quarter. We're seeing good growth around network security and also for data and in cyber threat security. We've also seen a little bit of a challenge from timing, both in the Global Governments business here in the third quarter, and as we've talked about, as we've tried to move further up the food chain on the commercial side, selling into large and very large enterprises, that sales cycle time has become a little bit longer and a little bit harder to predict. And that's what you're seeing here, both in Q3 and the outlook for the year.","I will say that in the third quarter, the margin was within our expectations. The team did a good job driving the margin in the quarter. And as I said in my opening remarks, a year-over-year decrease was expected because, taking it back to the beginning of the year, we talked about a $25 million investment in the business, a lot of that focused in the areas of sales and marketing. And therefore, what you see in the fourth quarter is the continuation of that investment, okay, which is, you're right, is driving the margins down on a sequential basis. But again, that all said, we feel everything that we've done this year between the investments, a couple bolt-on acquisitions, is positioning the business for that 10% plus or minus top-line growth, and double-digit margin in 2018.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned representing Bernstein. Please proceed.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Doug.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Doug.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I wanted to get a sense from you on really how governments right now are looking at missile defense opportunities. Because this has clearly been a good growth area for you. But in the past, particularly in the Middle East, you've seen decision making take a long time. These can get deployed over a very long period of time. Can you talk about what's becoming typical given how serious many of the threats are around the world, how the governments are thinking about the scale of system they want to use and the urgency of deployment? Because I'm thinking when are we going to see these situations translate into revenues on an earlier basis perhaps than we've seen in the past?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, Doug. Let me take that since I just came back from my wild \u2013 total world tour here. Let me start off in Europe. We're seeing, especially relative to Eastern Europe, significant concerns relative to their sovereignty and the security of their citizens. A large portion of their needs is, I would say, is in the Integrated Air and Missile Defense area and relative to Raytheon, a big strong demand for Patriot. We're also seeing in Europe and we just had a major test with NATO, I mentioned that in my remarks, a strong demand for our Standard Missile vehicles and also the ESSM missile.","Again these are systems that shoot down other missiles and other unmanned systems and even aircraft if they do try to invade a country. So that's in Europe. Right now, we see several countries, two big countries out there that we mentioned; one is Romania and the other one is Poland that are pushing forward working through the FMS process with the U.S. government to procure the system. I can tell you they're putting pressure on us to deliver as fast as we can possibly deliver. And so we're really working that in our factory to accelerate delivery of the systems for Romania and also Poland.","Switching over to the MENA region, Middle East North Africa, again a significant demand for a lot of our products, our Paveways, our TOW systems, on the Integrated Air and Missile Defense, it's Patriot, and big demand for additional fire units from countries and upgrades of their existing systems and then also our GEM-T missiles. It turns out that since about 2015, there has been over 220 tactical ballistic missiles fired in the region. The ones that were headed towards areas where there are civilians was over 150 and those 150 were all shot down by Patriot systems.","So the system is working very well in that region, which is causing additional demand. But the threat's also increasing, which is even driving the demand signal even higher in that region. So the question is not about buying, the question that we get is how fast you can deliver. So that's a different story and so maybe that's answering your question on why it's taking long.","And then I just also came back from the Asia-Pacific region. I'm sure you've read about the landslide victory that Abe had recently. And again, he went, he called that election, that snap election because he was looking for support in making a modification to their constitution to allow them to take their defense group from a homeland, purely homeland defense and a passive defense into an active defense type of forces. And in that case, they're looking for additional capabilities, obviously Patriot standard missiles. We do co-produce the Standard Missile-3 Block IIA with Japan. They're also looking for Standard Missile-6. And also, they want our Air and Missile Defense Radar, the SPY-6 as part of an Aegis Ashore type system there. And other countries in the Asia-Pacific region are also looking for our capabilities. So that's the international market and again, half of that's direct commercial sale and the other half is FMS.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Safran representing Buckingham Research. Please proceed.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hey, good morning, Tom, Toby and Todd, how are you?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Rich.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","How are you doing?","Todd Ernst - Raytheon Co.","How are you doing?","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Tom, Toby, so you were pretty clear in your remarks about what's it (38:12) about 2018 and I also know you take \u2013 sometimes take a, maybe a conservative outlook here. I was wondering if your outlook for 2018 was based on the President's request or some meshing of the bills making into way (38:28) through the House and Senate.","Now, the reason why I ask is that both congressional bills appear to be above the President's request. So I'm just wondering, if based on the outlook and on the President's request, could be some upside here to your guide if we end up with a bill closer to what's in the House or the Senate, do you think that Raytheon fares better in the House or Senate version? And just separately, if you could comment on international, if that's \u2013 if you say it's one-third of bookings this year, how you think that might trend next year? Thanks.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, Rich, it's Toby and Tom can jump in here. But as far as the initial outlook for 2018, think of it more towards the President's request and keep in mind to the degree that we may have any upside from that, given that it would be the instant year, it's more likely to be a favorable impact on the bookings where we said we'd have a book-to-bill ratio of greater of 1. The sales profit impact from that would really, if we do see something higher than the President's request, would really materialize more in 2019 and beyond.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, and let me just jump on that. So if you, relative to the modernization budget, if you add in both the base budget and OCO, the President's request was about $35.5 billion over the BCA limits. And then if you go into the HASC, the SASC and HAC-D, they're all actually pretty close to what they're shooting for. They're anywhere for $24 billion to $25 billion over the President's request. As Toby said, we're really looking more at the President's request in terms of our outlook for 2018.","I can tell you that I have spent quite a bit of time on the Hill talking, on a bipartisan basis talking to two members. And there is a strong support for defense moving forward because, I'm hopeful you recognize, the world's become a much more dangerous place here in the last several years. And there are some capabilities that the U.S. needs to bring onboard here pretty quick in terms of advanced technologies. And so there's a strong support in Congress for an increased budget over and above the BCA limits.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard representing Vertical Research. Please proceed.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks so much, good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Rob.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Hi, Rob.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Tom, I thought I'd just follow up on your comments about the demand environment and the news that's come out of Turkey that they are moving forward with a Russian air defense system. Do you think these will actually come to pass, and if it does, does it create more competitive pressure around the world?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Well, I would say the following: I'd say, this is the second round for Turkey, you remember, they initially selected a Chinese system a while back. So we'll see how that plays out. Turkey is not in our forecast for 2018 or 2019 or 2020. So we really \u2013 haven't really pursued Turkey relative to this offering and they knew (41:40) they've been \u2013 they have \u2013 I don't believe they've really settled down in terms of what they really want. But you're right. Right now, they are saying they're going to go forward with an S-400 sale with Russia, that has significant issues relative to NATO. They will not be able to interconnect that system in with any NATO system. There was an article out today of NATO very, very concerned about the sale itself.","When we compete internationally, we do compete against countries and \u2013 because most of the companies we compete against are owned by other countries. So there is always a geopolitical aspect of some of these, I would call it, competitions. I think right now, we think we're in a very good position. We have really some firm orders that are lining up for 2018 and a significant amount of opportunities. And I've been in each of the major regions, Europe, MENA region and Asia-Pacific and I've looked the leaders of those countries we do business with in the eye and have had firm handshakes and contracts following. So I feel very positive about our outlook for 2018 and beyond relative to our international business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro representing Shapiro Research. Please proceed.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Good morning. Quickly, Toby, my typical question, $165 million lower backlog on a sequential basis than bookings. But my real question is, your fourth quarter guidance for sales assumes 7% sales growth at the low end and 12% at the high end, a significant uptick from what we've been seeing. And a lot of it looks like it comes from the fact that Missiles, you've got to step up in growth to either between 16% and 21% in the quarter. So if you could just expand a little bit what the growth \u2013 where the growth comes from.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. Sure, George. No problem. And yes, we had about $165 million of adjustments. One thing on that I'll just remind everybody that the majority of those adjustments are when we have under-runs on cost-type programs and we do continually work with our customers to convert those under-runs into new work, new scope, i.e., new bookings, either on current programs or future bookings.","And again, we increased our bookings outlook for the year by $500 million, so we're pleased with where we're positioned right now. You got the numbers right on the Q4 revenue growth, I think from an overall company point of view and also for Missile Systems.","And at Missiles for the year, we have improved our guidance range on the low-end and see Missiles total year sales growing by about 10%. As you noted, Q4 is strong with high double-digit growth expected. We're well positioned across the entire Missiles portfolio with the strong backlog and we do expect to see that additional sales volume really coming from the startup of some recent awards as well as some Q4 awards, some of which will relieve inventory balances and this kind of gets back to Tom's point about where our customers, from a demand perspective, want our products and they want them sooner or they want them quicker. So, where it makes sense, we've been working with our customers to try to do that and part of the growth in the fourth quarter at Missiles, as I said, is the \u2013 is reflective of that, with inventory being converted to revenue to drive that growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn representing Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Hey, Rob.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Toby, I wanted to get a clarification on Forcepoint. And then Tom, on the back of George's question, I wanted \u2013 focusing on Missiles, you mentioned AUSA and you were talking about SHORAD, but I wanted to go back to the emphasis at AUSA on readiness with regard to North Korea. I mean, it was a very strong message, almost surprisingly strong coming out of the Army at that event. And I see the 10% growth in Missiles and Excalibur is part of that. I think Toby mentioned that earlier. I wanted to see how sustainable this kind of a rate might be, especially if we uptick the readiness. And in that context, I was going to ask you for the latest update on DeepStrike, just given that Long-Range Precision Fires is now one of the six pillars of the latest acquisition strategy.","And then Toby, the clarification was just on Forcepoint. If you could speak to the revenue seasonality that we keep seeing in the third quarter.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. Do you want me to \u2013 Tom, if you want, I'll cover the Forcepoint question.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Do Forcepoint. Then I'll hit the other 10 questions.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. So Forcepoint does have a couple elements of seasonality. So in Q3, typically it's the peak quarter from a government booking perspective and we saw that again here this year and in Q4, it's really the peak for commercial. So we did see the spike-up in revenue in Q3 driven by our government orders, but also some strength on the commercial side. We do expect strong commercial bookings in Q4, which typically convert to sales at a bit slower pace than the rest of the business, think more leaning towards some subscription-based sales versus licenses in the fourth quarter.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","And let me, back to your readiness, you're absolutely correct. At AUSA, there was a definite, I would say, position by the Army that we need to kick in on readiness. The good news is Raytheon is very well-positioned to support the Army in achieving the readiness across our entire set of our franchises, for example, TOW, Paveway, just to name a few, obviously the Patriot system, getting that ready.","And then even in these future systems that you did mention, we are in a competition for the next-generation replacement to the ATACMS system, which is called the Long-Range Precision Fire missile. We have, I think, a very interesting solution for the Army there that actually doubles their capability and significantly increasing the range at the same time.","So we are working hand in glove with the Army and to bring that system online now. It is a competition and it will be a down-select here in the next couple years. But we feel very, very optimistic about the solution that we're offering for the Army on that.","And just one other element, we have been seeing an intake relative to efforts on being able to support this readiness. And across many of our systems, we have tripled the production capacity. So we've been able to meet the demand with our supply base. We believe there's additional capability to increase and that goes all the way through our supply base and have been working with our suppliers to ensure that they can even increase their material to us over and above what they're already doing. So we feel in a very good position here relative to meeting demands for the Army relative to readiness.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein representing Wells Fargo.

Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I was hoping you could help me kind of square a few things, which is talking about governments and a desire to see more missile defense and you've raised your bookings a couple times and still talking about a strong bookings environment. But if I look at IDS backlog at a little over $9 billion, looks like it's the lowest we've seen in quite a number of years and actually year-to-date, the backlog for the total company is down a little bit. Like why aren't we seeing book-to-bill over 1 driving us to see backlog increases and what does that mean about the sustainability of that 3% to 5% organic growth?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","So, Sam, this is Toby. I'll take a crack at that starting out. I mean we've said it before, Tom or I might have mentioned it earlier on, in any given period, bookings can be lumpy. We are expecting, as an example, you mentioned IDS, right, and they had a strong Q1 for bookings. There was nothing significant in Q3, but we do expect their book-to-bill, as an example, in the fourth quarter to be well over 1 and approaching 1 for the year.","They have some significant opportunities in front of them. Tom alluded to a few of them when he was kind of going around the world talking about the threat and the demand environment. And then when you take it down to a total company perspective, 1.11 in the quarter, last year was 1.16, 1.08 book-to-bill on a rolling four-quarters basis and our outlook for the year at 1.07, there's nothing there other than positive news relative to be able to sustain, certainly, for 2018 that 3% to 5% growth that I talked about earlier.","Samuel J.

O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Toby, you had a nice increase in the guidance for profitability in IDS. You talked about companywide what the kind of modest margin expansion you're expecting next year. I wonder if you could talk about, A, whether that includes further growth off of this new baseline at IDS, and B, as you look to capture these new Patriot wins next year, and we think about the maturity of Patriot programs across the portfolio, does adding in the new programs kind of create kind of a new cycle, kind of like what we saw in 2015, I guess, or so when you booked a whole bunch of new Patriot programs and kind of ramped up on those?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Sure. And maybe \u2013 I know your question's largely focused around the margins, but maybe I'll kind of give you a little bit more color across all the metrics here. Keeping in mind that our intent today is give everybody a high-level look at how we're thinking about 2018. And as we continue to work through our process through the balance of the year, we'll obviously give you details, more details by business in January. But if I start at the front end of the business, as I said, another book-to-bill ratio over 1, again even on the higher expected sales that as I mentioned, 3% to 5% growth. I would tell you that the growth next year is a little bit more weighted towards Missiles, but we do see growth in every segment and we also continue to see both domestic and international growth again next year.","Specifically, on your question around margins, again, up slightly from 2017 for segment margins. And just to give a little bit of color, at this point, we do see some incremental improvement next year at IDS, to your question, they're executing well. We expect to get a little bit more of a lift in 2018 from IDS and also some improvement at IIS. Right now, we'd look at Missiles to be in line with 2017 and we do have some mix-driven headwind, if you will, at SAS.","As I talked about earlier, strong cash flow in line with 2017. We're looking at higher cash flow being generated by the businesses, partially offsetting as we expected and have talked about before, higher pension contributions and higher cash taxes, mentioned the tax rate at 31%.","And of course, we gave you the grid. I gave you the outlook or at least not the outlook, but the current status as of today for discount rate as well as the asset returns which \u2013 I know doesn't pinpoint it exactly, but think of it a little bit ahead of where the new outlook for 2017 is, plus or minus in the $400 million range for the FAS\/CAS and I talked about Forcepoint. So hopefully, that helps you a little bit understand how we're thinking about things and again we'll go through more details by business in January.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment representing Baird.

We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby, and then we'll move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Todd. Good morning everyone. A little over a year ago, we laid out a strategy to return the company to growth by evolving our approach to international markets and increasing investments in key technologies to better position the company for the future. Our strong growth during the third quarter reflects the traction that we are gaining from this strategy. In the quarter, our revenue increased by 6% driven primarily by missiles and IDS, as well as from an increased contribution from Raytheon|Websense.","International revenue, which grew by 13% over last year's third quarter, rose to 32% of the company's total revenue. This is a record level for the company and was driven by customers across various regions turning to Raytheon's advanced technology to address the rapidly-evolving threats. I would also note that our growth was backed by strong cash flow generation reinforcing our strong financial foundation. Domestic revenue also increased in the quarter and was up a solid 3% driven in part by classified.","Turning now to bookings. In the third quarter, international drove 26% of our total bookings. Key international awards included the second phase of the Air Defense Operations Center for Qatar, plus missiles, training and radars for a number of other international customers. Domestically, bookings included training, classified, as well as various missile programs including AIM-9X, the Joint Standoff Weapon, and SM-3.","Given our year-to-date bookings strength and our expectation for a strong finish to the year, we are now raising our full-year 2015 bookings outlook to $25.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million, which translates into a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.1 for the year. This is $1 billion increase to the prior bookings range that we gave you last quarter, driven by strong demand from our global customers. Further, it sets the stage for solid top line growth in 2016 which Toby will talk about in a moment.","In the quarter, IIS received good news on two key awards, one from the U.S. Air Force, and the other from the Department of Homeland Security. For the U.S. Air Force contract, which is often referred to as NISSC, Raytheon will be providing products and sustainment services that support NORAD and its mission to provide air, missile and space threat warnings, as well as critical command and control capabilities. NISSC has a $700 million ceiling value over five years.","This competitive win was initially awarded to Raytheon in April of this year, but was protested. The protest was resolved in our favor late in the third quarter. I would add that this award follows a series of recent programs wins at IIS for high value-added services. These wins reflect our modernization through sustainment strategy.","As for the Department of Homeland Security award, Raytheon was selected to be the prime contractor for the development and sustainment of the National Cyber Security Protection System, a system providing the vital infrastructure that assists more than 100 federal, civilian and government agencies with the protection of their networks against advanced cyber threats. This award has a ceiling value in excess of $1 billion over a seven year period. While this too has been protested, the customer recognized our compelling cyber strength when making the award, another strong validation of our cyber strategy and capabilities.","In addition, we have been supporting our long term growth strategy by increasing investments in our business and advanced technologies. Consistent with our discussions on prior calls, IR&D is being directed to areas that we believe will be future growth markets, including directed energy and hypersonics and undersea to name just a few. Investments in these technologies will position us well for the future, as our customers look for capabilities to counter increasingly sophisticated threats that are developing on the horizon.","I'd like to shift gears and take a minute to touch on our capital deployment strategy. We continue forward with a balanced approach and we are on track to achieve our $1 billion share buyback target for 2015 that we outlined back in July. After the close of the quarter, we did announce a small acquisition that fills a cyber security technology gap and enhances our position in high value managed security services, one of the fastest growing areas in the cyber security market. This is consistent with our go-forward strategy of pursuing smaller targeted bolt-on acquisitions.","Before concluding, I would like to note that the Websense integration is on track. As you will recall, we are currently in the process of combining our legacy Raytheon Cyber Products business with the Websense acquisition that we completed in May. The business segment had solid margin performance in the quarter and we continue to work to integrate Raytheon Cyber Products technology into the Websense architecture.","To close, I want to say how proud I am of the Raytheon team and their hard work and dedication that has allowed us to deliver growth despite sequestration and I want to thank them for their focus on performance which benefits our customers, our company and our shareholders.","With that, let me turn it over to Toby.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks starting with the third quarter highlights and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. If everyone would please turn to page three. We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the third quarter with sales, EPS and operating cash flow all at or better than our expectations. We had solid bookings in the third quarter of $5.3 billion. Sales were $5.8 billion in the quarter, up 6% led by our IDS, missiles and Raytheon|Websense businesses. EPS from continuing operations was $1.47, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes.","And operating cash flow of $1.1 billion was better than our prior guidance driven by the timing of collections. Third quarter 2015 operating cash flow was significantly higher than last year's third quarter primarily due to the improvement in working capital and the timing of cash taxes paid in the quarter. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for $250 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 7 million shares for $750 million.","Turning now to page four. Let me start by providing some detail on our third quarter results. Company bookings for the third quarter were $5.3 billion. On a year-to-date basis, bookings were $17.4 billion, an increase of approximately $425 million over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing four-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.06, and as Tom just mentioned, given the strength of our overall bookings year-to-date, we now expect full year 2015 bookings to be approximately $25.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million, an increase of over $1 billion from the outlook on the last call in July. This provide a solid foundation for sales growth in 2016.","For the quarter, international was 26% of our total company bookings and on a year-to-date basis was 37%. For the year, we expect international to be approximately 35% of total bookings. Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $33.6 billion compared to $33.2 billion at the end of the third quarter of last year. And on a funded basis, backlog was $24.4 billion, an increase of almost $1.5 billion compared to last year's third quarter. We expect 2015 year-end total backlog to be up between 4% and 8% from year-end 2014.","If you now move to page five. Sales in the third quarter of 2015 were strong primarily due to the performance at IDS and missiles. Looking now at sales by business, IDS had third quarter 2015 net sales of $1.5 billion, an increase of approximately 7% compared to the third quarter of 2014. This increase was primarily due to two recent international Patriot awards.","Missiles had net sales of $1.6 billion in the third quarter 2015, an increase of approximately 11%. This increase was driven by higher sales spread across various production programs including the TOW missile program and certain missile defense programs.","In the third quarter 2015, IIS had net sales of $1.4 billion, down slightly when compared with the same quarter last year. SAS had net sales of $1.4 billion. The change versus last year was driven by volume on international tactical radar programs.","And for Raytheon|Websense, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense, which we completed in the second quarter of 2015. As a reminder, third quarter 2014 included the results for only Raytheon Cyber Products.","Moving ahead to page six, overall the company continues perform well. Our operating margin was 12.1% for the total company and 12.3% on a business segment basis. Year-to-date operating margin was 12.9% at both the total company and business segment level.","As we discussed on the last few earnings calls. Compared to 2014, our margins for 2015 have been impacted by a change in program mix as well as higher investments. We continue to invest in ourselves with the objective of positioning the company for future growth.","So, looking now at the business margins. The change in margins at IDS was primarily driven by a change in program mix on international Patriot programs nearing completion, which is similar to what we've experienced in the past when we've completed certain programs and ramped up on others. We expect IDS margins to be strong in the fourth quarter driven by strong performance as well as from an expected contractual modification.","The change in margins at IIS was primarily driven by a change in program mix and acquisition related cost. Missiles margins increased 40 basis points in the third quarter 2015, primarily due to a change in program mix. SAS margins were down in the quarter as expected, compared with the same period last year primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies in the third quarter of 2014.","And at Raytheon|Websense, the third quarter 2015 operating margin was driven by strong operating performance as well as the timing of restructuring expenses in the quarter. We expect restructuring cost to increase in the fourth quarter, reducing margins sequentially but still on track to meet the full year 2015 margin outlook.","Turning now to page seven, third quarter 2015 EPS was $1.47, better than expected driven by improved margin primarily at missiles and SAS. As you look at the EPS walk, operations is being impacted by the investments we are making in the business and program mix. These are largely offset by our reduced share count. The timing of tax related items and non-cash expenses related to the Raytheon|Websense acquisition make up the difference.","On page eight, we've tightened the full range for full year 2015 net sales, increasing the high end by $100 million. We now expect net sales to be between $23 billion and $23.3 billion. As we have done in prior years, during the third quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of this update, the FAS\/CAS adjustment for the year decreased by $12 million from $197 million to $185 million, or an unfavorable impact of $0.03 per share. We're reaffirming our full year 2015 EPS outlook of $6.47 to $6.62. While this outlook is unchanged from our prior guidance, I would note that we were able to absorb the impact of the unfavorable $0.03 FAS\/CAS adjustment.","And as a reminder, we have not included in our 2015 guidance the potential extension of the R&D tax credit. If the legislation passes, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 130 basis points and our EPS by about $0.11 per share. As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for $250 million in the quarter and now see our diluted share count to be approximately 305 million shares for 2015.","Operating cash flow in the third quarter was strong primarily due to the timing of collections. We continue to see our full year 2015 operating cash flow outlook coming in between $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. And as you can see on page nine, we've included guidance by business.","We've increased and tightened the full year sales outlook at both IDS and missiles. At IDS, this is driven by the program mix and performance to date that I discussed earlier. Missiles has also experienced better than expected year to date growth. In addition, we tightened the full year sales range for IIS and SAS.","Now turning to margins. We've increased the range and expect higher full year operating margin performance for missiles and SAS. The strong year to date results exceeded our prior estimates. We lowered the range of our full year operating margin guidance for IDS driven by the change in program mix and performance to date.","Now turning to next year. As we have done in the past, we intend to provide detailed 2016 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. However, as we sit here today, we currently see strong sales growth for 2016 at 3% to 4% over the midpoint of our 2015 outlook driven in part by some new development awards we are expecting.","We expect segment margins to be flat to up for 2016 compared to 2015 excluding the eBorders settlement in 2015, and depending upon the mix from higher volume in 2016. This positions us well going forward with further margin expansion over time as new development wins lead to production. I would also add that we currently expect FAS\/CAS to improve in 2016 over 2015, which I'll talk about in a moment.","In addition, we expect operating cash flow from continuing operations to be higher in 2016 versus 2015 after adjusting for the eBorder settlement. Of course, I want to caveat all this by saying our assumptions are based on a defense budget being approved in Washington before year end, thereby avoiding an extended CR or a government shutdown.","So if you could please move to page 10. We have provided a FAS\/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2016 as we've done in prior years. As I just mentioned, we expect to see improvement to the FAS\/CAS adjustment in 2016 compared to 2015 given the current interest rate environment and asset returns. That said, and just to be clear, the discount rate and the actual asset returns won't be known until we close out 2015. We'll provide a more detailed pension outlook on our January year-end call.","Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet at our current credit rating going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans, as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, making smaller, targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs, and from time to time making discretionary contributions to our pension plans.","And as a reminder, as we said on the second quarter earnings call in July, we increased our share buyback by $250 million from our original expectation, bringing the full year 2015 buyback to approximately $1 billion.","In summary, we saw solid performance in the third quarter. Bookings were strong, our sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all at or above our expectations. And our strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow us to continue to drive value for our customers and our shareholders. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2016.","With that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Carter Copeland from Barclays. Please proceed.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, Tom, Toby.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Carter.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I wondered if we might just kind of get a little bit more color on IDS. Obviously, it seems like the top line is quite strong. That has implications for the mix I think relative to your commentary about 2016 that you've sort of been hinting at recently. Should we think that you've got a little bit more top line with a little bit less favorable mix next year than what you were talking about before or is this sort of in line with where you were before?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Well look, Carter, let me talk about this year for a little minute because I think it's kind of a precursor heading into 2016. So for IDS, as I mentioned, we still expect margins in Q4 to be strong. We did however adjust our guidance. It does reflect, as you just suggested, an update in mix and our performance to date. Specifically, we are seeing more development work on programs like AMDR, and we have had some increase in our content on AWD.","Combine that with the fact that we're still ramping up on some of our other large recent awards, which we've talked about in the past. They start out at lower margins. They expand their margins over time as they progress to this cycle and retire risk. So we're still seeing that mix issue impact us as we go through the balance of this year, okay. But that bodes well for the future, as those development programs move into production. And that thought is contemplated in the initial outlook that we gave you for 2016.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, so there's no material change in the performance expectation of the EACs, it's more just the mix of the work you're saying.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","That is correct.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say it's development program driven growth that exceeded our expectations at IDS this year. And what that does lead us into opportunities in 2016, 2017 and 2018 as we transition those programs into production, on top of all of the Patriot production work that we are starting up on now, for example, Qatar program. So we have a very positive outlook for IDS. Just a reminder, both Toby and myself ran that business so we know all the levers in driving margin in the business. And we see clear signs and opportunities based on the mix that they have today moving into 2016 and 2017 and 2018.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then a quick follow up. I don't know if you can tell from a pro forma basis on the Raytheon|Websense top line, what it would have been like had you owned it or maybe break out what Raytheon Cyber Products maybe did in growth terms year over year? Do you have any color in that?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Well, the growth that we show obviously because we only had Cyber Products in last year's third quarter, is essentially all from the acquisition of Websense. And the way to think about it, it would have, to answer your question, it would have been flat year over year.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color, guys.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I wanted to ask \u2013 morning \u2013 to ask about missiles and this was sort of the second quarter in a row that you've increased the sales guidance there. And you were up I guess about 5% or 6% from where you were at the start of the year. And talk about really what's driving that. How much of it is coming from the Middle East? Kind of how sustainable that is and put some ties around that.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, I'll start and then obviously Tom can jump in here if he wants to add some color. So to your point, missile sales were up in the third quarter from prior year, double digits around 11%, and that's sequential growth as well. We do expect the missiles sales cadence to continue to improve into Q4, really driven by volume from our production programs. And it's really not one individual program as I mentioned in my opening comments. It's across multiple production programs, TOW, and some of the standard missile family of programs as well. For the total year, we see sales growth in the mid single digits. Obviously as you said, we have updated our guidance to reflect the favorable performance year to date in our outlook for Q4. But there's not one individual program and\/or country if you will that's driving that. It's just a very strong portfolio of programs that's pushing the growth up in the missiles business.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Can I just jump on that? I mean, you did see there was a successful SM-3 launch this past week with our European coalition partners. And so we see a significant demand signal pull for missile defense missiles relative to our European partners outside of the US itself. And then if you go across the regions, you do know that there's significant turmoil in the Eastern Europe area, so we see demand signals there, obviously in the Middle East. But we're also starting to see demand signals in the Asia-Pacific region. We saw it initially in South Korea with Patriot orders, but we were also seeing it in the areas relative to replenishing the weapons that they have. So it's not just in one region, it's essentially across the globe that we're seeing these demand signal pulls.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And I just -","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","And I think, just Seth, another thing that reinforces that, the bookings for the quarter, AIM-9X, Paveway, JSOW, spares, et cetera, right, SM-3. It's again, it's across that portfolio that we have in our missiles business.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, okay thanks. Just as a real quick follow-up on a totally different topic, we heard a little earlier in the week about some delays from the government in executing undefinitized contract actions. Just wondering if you've seen anything similar.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, these are \u2013 are you talking about UCAs?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","UCAs, yeah.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, yeah and if those are having any impact on your platform.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'll tell you, it is an area that we track in the business. It is something that is necessary especially relative to FMS contracts to shorten the period of getting on contract and starting to work the programs. We do track and try to drive the definitization of those UCAs as soon as possible. I mean, that's something we work with directly with the Department of Defense. And I can tell you I have my, I review those on a periodic basis to make sure that they're not getting out of control. I can tell you, the department wants to definitize them as soon as possible also, but it is a lot of work. And we just got to make sure that we work hand and glove together with the government to drive those to closure as soon as possible.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Please proceed.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much and good quarter, guys.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Cai.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","So your guidance on international of 35% orders kind of works out, looks like it's $2.6 billion in orders in the fourth quarter. That looks like a pretty big number. Could you give us some color on what's in there, any particular single large awards?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah. So, I'll give you at a high level, Cai. Unlike prior years, we don't have any binary $1 billion-plus type of awards whether it be international or domestic in the fourth quarter. So there is not one particular program or award that's driving it. We do have several programs in the $500 million range, plus or minus. And Tom, I don t know if you want to comment any more detail on.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean there's several Patriot related awards. We're also looking at the several C5I awards also. And this is not international, but the domestic air, some air traffic work. And then we already mentioned the missile company in terms of their portfolio of missiles being in demand on the international marketplace.","I do want to mention something, go back to something that Toby said about the binaries. And in the past, we've always had one of these big $1 billion or multi-billion dollar binaries we were waiting on. One of the elements of our international strategy was to not just have one but to have three or four binaries, so that we were never relying on any given one. And that's actually the position, the great position we're in today. We don't just have one order we're waiting for to be able to achieve several billion dollars worth of international bookings. And it's kind of a different \u2013 it's a totally different feel here. It's a great feel, by the way, that we don't have to hang our hat on one big binary in any quarter. But the bottom line is the international strategy we put in place is paying off relative to that.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Terrific. Your R&D was up 100 basis points as a percent of sales. Maybe give us some color what you're spending on, where it should be for the year, and how much of that is recoverable under IR&D?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's all IR&D, so it's all recoverable depending on whether it's a cost plus contract in our rates or a firm fixed-price contract. So that's the answer to your first one. The areas that we've been concentrating on and we've been talking about this on the calls is high energy lasers. It's been a big area for us. We do see that as a new up and coming area. There's a lot of demand signal from multiple services.","Also, the other big area is hypersonics. As the threat gets more and more sophisticated, it requires more, I would call it speed and agility to be able to get to the threat and hypersonics are becoming a big part of that. So we are investing in that. We've had some great successes in terms of wins on some advanced technology contracts with DARPA in the hypersonics area over the last four months.","And then also, we're really engaging in the undersea area and really looking as that starts to expand and becoming an area of interest, especially relative to anti-access\/area denial. We continue to invest in advanced EW, again driven by the need for a systems to counter the evolving threat. And we also see a demand, especially across the Middle East region for our C5ISR solutions. So we're continuing to invest in that product line.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","And Cai, I think your question about recoverability, think of it this way. About a quarter of that increase, at least in dollars, so about $15 million of that relates to Websense. So that obviously on the commercial side, not recoverable on US government contracts. But the balance of the increase is recoverable on our contracts.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please proceed.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Doug.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I wanted to go back to Carter's question on IDS, because I just wanted to make sure we understand what happened sort of Q3 to Q4. Is the change, the fact that the margins are lower in Q3, and you expect them to then increase in Q4, does that have to do more with timing on specific programs, particularly international ones or is it more increased spending in the quarter for things like AMDR? What changed from what you thought was going to happen a quarter ago?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","From Q3 to Q4, Doug?","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Well, no. In Q2, when you laid out your guidance, clearly, you had thought you would have higher margins earlier, and that's been pushed out. What changed there?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, so I think that a couple of things that \u2013 and I'll try not to be repetitive to Carter's question here. So the mix is changing, right, so we're seeing higher volume. But because of the higher levels of development work and some increases on AWD that are at lower margins, we're seeing that which is new compared to what we had expected before. The other thing too, we, as I mentioned in my comments, we do expect, which is not atypical, to have a contract modification that will result in income that we recognize in the fourth quarter, and the magnitude of that is a little less than what we had previously expected. So from a Q4 point of view and therefore a total year perspective, that those are the two major things that are driving the change.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then when you look at international, it's a lot of focus on things that the binaries, as you were referring to them, and those often are Patriot systems, things like that. If you look beyond it, I'm trying to get a sense of what other areas, such as early warning radars, potential Hawk replacements, when you look at some of the other systems out there that may be in pretty good demand, can you characterize how important those are relative to some of these big systems that make the big headlines?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well I would say for example, the TPY-2 radar that's part of THAAD, but it's also now being looked at as essentially an early warning radar. It's kind of standing on its own and we're getting \u2013 there's been a lot of interest on that system within THAAD obviously, but also outside of THAAD. So that's, I would call that, that's been a development that's been occurring here over the last couple of years. So we see that in the future as a major international system that we provide.","Obviously, we have the Patriot System itself. We have a big award in 2016. It's the Qatar early warning radar. So it's on the order of $1 billion potential for that system. That's getting ready to go through congressional notification. And earlier had a congressional notification but the customer wanted to increase the size of the radar, so we have to go back. And that looks like that'll complete this year with CN and with an award in 2016.","We also, we talked quite a bit about a lot of our missile products which are big. And you are correct, we are getting traction in integrated air and missile defense, especially relative to our NASAM system. That's starting to get traction especially as a replacement to the Hawk System. So outside of Patriot, we see multiple other areas that are allowing us to essentially get out of this pure Patriot binary that we're waiting on.","Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason Gursky from Citi. Please proceed.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey good morning. Hey, Toby, a couple of quick clarification questions for you. Can you give us a sense of how much that contract mod might we worth so that we can get a truer sense of what sustainable margins are in the fourth quarter?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, so as far as the amount, we're still in negotiations and working through this with our customer. So unfortunately, Jason, I won't give you specifics. But what I can tell you to maybe try to help you size it, if you remember, we did have a similar type of item at IDS in last year's fourth quarter. But I would tell you that was of higher value or higher magnitude than the one we're looking at here. Our run rate for the quarter, even if you exclude this item, I would tell you our run rate for the quarter would still be better than our year to date performance. So even without that item, the Q4 margin would be better than year to date.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Another clarification question, the flat to up margins that you suggested for next year, ex the eBorder settlement, is that at the segment level or total company-wide operating margins?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","That's a fair question. That's at the segment level.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay great. And then lastly from me, your bookings that you're expecting for this year, does the resolution of the continuing resolution have any impact on that outcome?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","No, Jason. We feel good about the outlook for this year regardless of what happens with the shutdown.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So on our domestic, none of them are new starts, and there's also a significant amount of international which is obviously independent of the CR.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay great. Thank you, gentlemen.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","And hey, Jason, just a little bit of a follow up to your question about the margin rate for next year, as I said, it is at the segment level. And as a reminder, obviously we'll update it in January, but we do expect our FAS\/CAS to be improved next year from this year as well, if you're thinking about it from a total company point of view.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Right, and then at that segment level guidance then, are you willing at this point to give us a first look at whether any of those segments will be up more than others? Are there any big movements in any of the segments? Are you saying that total segments are going to be flat to up? Is there any movement up or down that we should be aware of?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, no I mean our goal today was to give everyone a high look at where we are headed for next year. We're in the middle of our process for locking down 2016. So we're not going to go any deeper than we did, but certainly in January, we'll give you all the details and the color around each of the businesses.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Fair enough. Thank you very much, guys.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning, Sam. How are you doing?","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. How are you?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're doing great.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","When you're growing, it feels good.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Can you ask you a question? I know you have thousands of programs, but to just ask about a couple. Any update in terms of 3DELRR, in terms of the protest, when that might get re-awarded? And then any comments in terms of the long range discrimination radar and what happened with that one.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, let me hit the 3DELRR first. For those who don't know, we essentially were awarded the 3DELRR. There was a protest. And through the protest process, the U.S. Air Force has decided to essentially recompete the 3DELRR. So that's right now in a competition. At the same time, we are in an appeal process to see if we can undo that and have the award sustained. So that's where we're at on that. I can't really say much more about that one.","You are correct on the long range discrimination radar. There was an announcement last night that didn't go in our favor. We are obviously disappointed in that. We feel we had a good solution for the Missile Defense Agency. And we are awaiting our debrief because we really don't have any more information than essentially you have based on the release out of the DoD.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And so if I can follow up, if I look at that grid on page 10, can you kind of talk about where you would be right now if we ended the year? And then secondly, have you given any thought or would you consider voluntary contributions this year to help move that a little bit as well?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, so our return year to date is around 1%, okay, on our assets to the first part of your question. I'll just add a little bit more color there. And if we were even to remain flat for the remainder of the year, as I mentioned earlier when, to Jason's question, we would still see our FAS\/CAS income for 2016 to be better than 2015, as I mentioned earlier. As far as the discretionary contribution, that is an element of our balanced capital deployment. We will look from time to time to make that. Right now, we don't have a plan to do that, but it's certainly something depending upon how things shape up over the next couple of months that we'll be evaluating, and certainly we'll obviously let everyone know if we choose to do something there.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please proceed.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes. Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, George.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","At the Analyst Meeting in September, you'd commented that the big increases in margins on these international contracts usually occur three or four years out. Now there's a change in the guidance this quarter. Any change changed that at all or are we still probably look for maybe some margin improvement next year, but the bigger increase is in 2017 and 2018?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, George, it's Toby. I mean what we said for next year, early look right, was flat to slightly up on margins. But related to those major production programs, it would really be 2017 and 2018 when we'd be in the sweet spot from driving the productivity and the efficiencies on those programs.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","And then, Toby, just one further clarification. The segment margin, it's probably pretty trivial. But does that include Websense or does that just relating to the defense pieces?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","No, it includes Websense, but it does not include the amortization of the intangibles or the deferred revenue. So it includes their operating results, if you will.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay, and those margins should get better next year, I mean even though you commented the fourth quarter will be much weaker than the 17.5% you just reported.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, we would see on an operating basis excluding the accounting in acquisition related adjustments, we would see margins next year in the high teens, okay. And what's happening here, this year, Q2 had low margins for Websense because of the restructuring related activities. And it's just a timing issue. We didn't have much going on relative to how those costs we incurred in Q3. We expect them to pick back up, if you will, as we work towards completing the integration activities, which is going to drive the margins down in Q4. But again, all within the outlook we've given for the year for Websense.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","And then last quick one. You mentioned I thought in an earlier question that Websense on a pro forma basis was relatively flat with last year. So what starts the growth next year that you've been looking for?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, so what's happening at Websense, we're seeing growth in their TRITON platform and their TRITON product and related services in around the 10% range. And as we've talked about before, they have a legacy web filtering business that has been declining. It continues to decline and the two of those are kind of a push that get us to that flat. So what would drive the growth in the future is both the combination of the expansion of TRITON but also the integration of the Raytheon Cyber Products into the TRITON platform and the synergies of cross-selling across both customer sets that Websense bring to the table and RCP bring to the table.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, George.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Robert.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So, Tom, just going back to IDS and thinking about the 3% to 4% top line growth in the context of all the business you've won, and moving past the fourth quarter dynamics which sounds at least on the margin side somewhat one time, how do we think about the ramp at IDS with all this new business particularly in international Patriot over the next couple of years? And how significant a part of the 3% to 4% is that next year? Meaning is that primarily driven by IDS or you're getting some help from missile systems there as well?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well on IDS, let's talk about IDS first. So the new awards, especially the big Patriot awards are normally about a five-year period to essentially get through those programs. So on these new ones, for example Qatar, we're just in the first inning, essentially the first year of that contract. So we're in the, I would call it the ramping up element. And Toby addressed this on a prior question here. So we see the sweet spots, especially relative to the Patriot orders occurring in the 2017 and 2018 timeframe relative to the margin expansion as we ramp up.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So does that mean, Tom, that the segments are going to all be somewhat similar? Or the growth segments, I'm looking at missiles systems and IDS, and that essentially the other two primary segments are a partial offset there?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, Rob, I think again, we were just trying to give everybody a high level look at next year. We're not prepared to go into the details by business because some things are probably going to move around between now and January when we do that for you guys. As I mentioned, we're still in the middle of our process of walking this all down.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then just on services itself, there's a lot of activity in the market, some people buying, others selling. You've gotten deeper into commercial cyber. Is there any kind of portfolio shaping that's left at IIS just to streamline services going forward in a market that seems a little bit volatile, if I may?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah so, Robert, we continually look at that in terms of our portfolio shaping, essentially quarterly in terms of all of our programs. And then we mentioned this on prior calls, we never got into the fed IT business. We had good vision and I guess we had the right crystal ball at the time not to get into that particular business area. So most of our services are what we call the value-added type services in terms of servicing our products and our solutions. We're getting us into areas where we can do maintenance and sustainment and also upgrades to systems that are out there which essentially fits better into our overall portfolio of other systems.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","And I think, Rob, in general, we're always looking at that across the company.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Including if there are certain programs or products that are better suited even internally in one business or another. So, it's something we constantly look at.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All right. It sounds like you're pretty happy with the portfolio. And then just a quick one. I don't know what you can say on this. You were asked about it last quarter, but I'm going to ask it differently. I know you can't talk about what you'll do for bomber, but can you tell us which team you're more significantly positioned on?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I wish I could tell you anything on the bomber, but I'm not going to be able to tell \u2013 go there on that answer.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sorry about that.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All right. Okay thanks, Tom.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.","Rob Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Robert.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Hi, Rob.","Rob Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just quickly on the cash front, Tom, both of you actually, Tom and Toby. You both mentioned that your appetite for acquisitions going forward would be pretty small. I was wondering what sort of free cash flow return to shareholders we might anticipate looking forward. We're looking at sort of 90% or something like that. And then as a follow up, what do you think the split would be of that return between buybacks and dividends? Thank you.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll give you kind of the top line here, and we keep readdressing this at all our calls to make sure that you understand how consistent we are on it. And we do drive a balanced capital deployment strategy. And so we look at all avenues and try to make sure we do the right thing for the shareholder in terms of total shareholder return. So from that perspective, I'll give it over to Toby here to go through the, I guess the exact numbers as we move forward.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, so I think, Rob, as you know we've been in the range of 80% to 90% the last few years. Be similar this year, depending on how things shake out a little bit. As far as going forward, I think generally speaking, I think of it at the same way in the context of the broad balanced capital deployment strategy that Tom just referred to. Again, we think it's served us well historically.","As far as the mix, I won't comment specifically on a mix of how that return would split between dividend and\/or buyback. But what I would tell you, that both elements would be part of our return to shareholders going forward. Obviously, we're subject to board approval on these things. But from a dividend perspective, obviously we want to make sure it's competitive and sustainable at the same time.","And we'll give you all an update early next year as to our thinking on that, and I think it's usually our March timeframe when we get the board to vote on the dividend, and we'll provide you that detailed information. But you're absolutely right, too, about the aspect of acquisitions, and just to be very clear, we don't have sitting here today any $1 billion-plus deals that we're contemplating for any part of the portfolio including our commercial cyber venture. It would be the more niche targeted type of acquisitions that fill technology gaps or product gaps or customer gaps as we've talked about.","Rob Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's great. Thanks very much.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks, Robert.","Thomas A.

Please proceed.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey, good morning, guys.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","On the strong cash flow this quarter, I think you mentioned cash tax timing. Can you tell us what were cash taxes in the quarter and then what's the full year expectation? And then is there any opportunity to outperform your cash flow guidance?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","So, let me start with the last one first. I mean we feel pretty comfortable. Obviously we've got a range of a couple hundred million dollars on the cash flow outlook for the year of the $2.5 billion to the $2.7 billion. As far as Q3 of 2015 versus 2014, the cash taxes were favorable by about $130 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis there. Let me just check on the absolute amount of the cash taxes here for you. So the cash taxes paid this year were about $300 million.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","That's year to date or for the full year?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","No, that was in the quarter, okay. For full year it's about $1.2 billion.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay, got you, got you. And then just one follow-up guys. It's some of the wins you had, I think LISC and NORAD that came off, I thought they were in the IIS segment. And I think you made some comments at the beginning, but are those in IIS? And if so, I was surprised, I mean we didn't get a guidance increase in that segment.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","They were both in IIS, that's correct. Just remember, one of them, the DOMino is being protested. So it was not \u2013 I mean it was awarded, but then protested.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. Okay.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The NISSC was protested, and then the protest went in our favor. So that one's done. But DOMino award was protested and it's still in protest.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, and obviously where there wasn't a guidance increase, Pete, those were contemplated in the outlook we had previously given.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, good morning. Thank you.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Hunter.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Just a follow-up to Rob's question about the capital deployment. I understand you guys want to give yourselves some flexibility. But just if we just go through just some of the moving parts in terms of sort of higher operating cash flow next year net of eBorders. Given the 80% to 90% return policy, which has been how you guys have thought about it historically, would you say at a baseline, it's probably fair to assume that the repo continues at this $250 million s quarter, $1 billion annual run rate at a baseline barring a major change in sort of the funding environment? Is it fair to think about it that way?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, I wouldn't think of it that way necessarily. I mean we bumped it up this year, right. We were at $750 million. We went up to $1 billion, based upon how we felt about where the stock was valued and the growth opportunities that we had in front of us to improve the valuation in the stock, which we've talked about today relative to the strong bookings to date, the backlog, the growth we see for next year. We obviously still think that there's upside in the valuation from Websense. We know we're in a kind of a wait and see period here. But over time, and again not to beat a dead horse, right, we just wanted to give you all a high level view of things and we'll certainly provide more color and specificity on the detailed components of our overall capital plan in the January call as well.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right, I think the other message we wanted to send is that the growth in 2015 is not limited to 2015, based obviously on our backlog but also what we see in the demand signal pulls, we will be growing in 2016. That was really the message.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. All right, thanks guys. And then as we think about international a little bit more, sort of parsing that out a little bit. Maybe this is an incorrect conclusion, but does the orientation towards some of the smaller size awards dovetail into maybe more of a direct commercial mix versus FMS, or is that just a line that shouldn't be drawn? And if you could give me at a higher level sort of how foreign direct has trended as a percentage of the international bookings and backlog over the last couple years and how you sort of expect that to trend moving forward into next year?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me give you kind of our strategy relative to FMS versus direct commercial sale. So number one is, we always work with the customer. And if a customer prefers to go FMS, we obviously support that customer and go on FMS. If there is a choice to be made between FMS and direct commercial sale, we do look at in terms of what is the overall risk in taking a direct commercial sale. So we're pretty prudent in terms of how we make the decisions relative to pushing FMS versus DCS. Now that being said, we do have significant DCS opportunities. We have the direct commercial sale work in-house today that we're doing quite well on. And Toby can give you the exact breakout.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, so at the end of Q3, about 40% of our international backlog was FMS with the balance being direct commercial, so the 40-60 split. That's changed a little bit. It's come, the FMS content percentage-wise has come down a little bit by maybe about 5 points. So that had been a little bit higher, around 45%. Going forward, I don't know that I'd necessarily expect any major change. I'm thinking we'd probably continue to be in that 40% to 45% range at any given point depending upon the mix of programs. And as Tom said, some of them we have to have FMS. Some of them we'll try to drive to DCS. But I wouldn't expect any significant change in that mix.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Okay.","Todd Ernst - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right. It looks like we're going to have to leave it there.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kelsey DeBriyn, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kelsey DeBriyn","Thank you to De Tamara. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our fourth quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site.","With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the Company's future plans, objectives, and expected performance and the proposed merger with UTC, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risk that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings, and with respect to the proposed merger and related matters in the definitive merger proxy statement filed with us with the SEC on September 10, 2019.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.","Tom Kennedy","Thank you, Kelsey. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon had a very successful year in 2019 and our global growth strategy is delivering record results for our shareholders and customers. We had many highlights and set many company records.","So let me start by touching on some of our financial results. In 2019, we continue to see strong global demand for innovative solutions, illustrated by our book to bill ratio of 1.54 in the fourth quarter and 1.25 for the full year. And for the third time in 2019, we achieved record backlog, which rose to almost $49 billion at the end of the year. This drove an increase in backlog of more than $6 billion year-over-year or up 15% and it positions us well for the future. Sales are up 6.5% in the fourth quarter and 7.8% for the full year. And in 2019, we accelerated our sales growth for the fifth time since 2015.","This year in the new company record for annual sales of $29 billion EPS exceeded our expectations for the quarter and for the year. Cash flow is better than we expected and we achieved a new company record for operating cash flow for the full year. Toby will review additional details about the fourth quarter and our 2020 outlook in a few minutes.","Now, with all of our successes in 2019, I wanted to share what I see and some of Raytheon's key milestones during the year, successes from across the company that will drive future growth. First, let me highlight the strength at both our classified business and our international business. In 2019, we achieved record classified bookings for the full year of almost $8 billion and we saw strong classified bookings across the businesses, including $2.8 billion in both missiles and IIS and $2.1 billion at SAS.","Raytheon also had record classified sales, which grew 15% versus 2018 and represented 20% of company sales. Our strength in classified is driven in large part by the need of our domestic customers to address advanced threats as outlined in the national defense strategy. As we've said before, classified business is crucial for Raytheon's growth and success. It funds next generation technology development that is integral to the long term growth of our future franchises and production awards.","We also achieved company records in our international business, both international bookings and sales and record levels for the year. International sales are $8.6 billion for the year and year-over-year, international sales have now increased for 16 consecutive years.","Turning to our franchises, we further strengthened many of them in 2019 to be long term value generators for years and decades to come. The newest example of this is our clean sheet offering for the U.S. Army's next generation Air and Missile Defense radar. In October, we were pleased to be selected to develop the lower tier Air and Missile Defense sensor, which extends Raytheon's position as the world's premier Air and Missile Defense radar capability provider for decades to come.","We expect LTAMDS to have potential lifetime value of over $20 billion from sale to domestic and international customers. LTAMDS will operate on the Army's integrated air and missile defense network. Our Patriot franchise continued its momentum with the Kingdom of Bahrain signing an agreement in August to purchase Patriot. This letter of offer and acceptance allows the U.S. government to begin contract negotiations with our Patriot team. Bahrain is the 17th nation to procure Patriot.","With the U.S. approval, all 17 of these Patriot partners will have the opportunity to add the LTAMDS capability to each of their fire units. This will enhance the performance and extend the life of their systems for many decades. In addition, the capabilities of the LTAMDS radar also opens up a market for standalone forward deployed applications. Our Patriot system fires multiple interceptors, including our guidance enhanced missiles or GEM-Ts. And during the fourth quarter, we booked over $700 million on a direct commercial contract to provide GEM-T missiles for an international customer.","Demand for integrated air and missile defense solutions is also furthering growth in our NASAMS franchise, a mid range solution, jointly manufactured by Raytheon and Kongsberg. In 2019, we added two new countries to the NASAMS family. In May, we booked over $500 million to provide NASAMS for Australia. And in July, we received $1.8 billion award to provide Qatar with NASAMS.","Qatar is the 11th country to procure NASAMS, which uses a Raytheon radar, and will be capable of firing multiple interceptors, including our AMRAAM-Extended Range and AIM-9X missiles. As a result, NASAMS help support the growth of additional franchises AMRAAM and AIM-9X. For AMRAAM Raytheon is continuing the development of AMRAAM ER and expanding its capabilities to support land based applications. This significantly extends both the range of AMRAAM and the market of the NASAMS system.","Qatar will be the launch customer of AMRAAM ER. As part of the procurement of the NASAMS systems, we expect the foreign military sales contract award from Qatar for AMRAAM ER in 2021. Our airborne radar franchise was extended in July with our selection as a radar supplier for the B-52 radar modernization program, displacing the incumbent. Under the contract, Raytheon will design, develop, produce and sustain the use of radar systems for the entire U.S. Air Force B-52 fleet.","With improved navigation reliability, mapping and detection range, the advanced radar upgrade will ensure the aircraft remains mission ready through 2050 and beyond. And we continue to see strength across our standard missile franchise, including the multiyear award for SM-6 and then the bundle award for SM-3 Block IIA, both of which were booked in December for a total award value of around $3 billion. We still expect a multiyear contract award for another SM-3 variant. SM-3 Block IB, worth about $2 billion in the first half of 2020.","The endo-atmospheric SM-6 delivers a proven over the horizon offensive and defensive capability, and it supports anti air warfare, anti surface warfare and sea based terminal ballistic missile defense in one solution. In the next generation SM-3 Block IIA, interceptor defeats missile threats outside the Earth's atmosphere and is produced in cooperation with Japan. With the recent and expected awards for our Standard Missile product lines, we have production visibility until at least 2026. Both the SM-3 Block IA and IB are integral to MDA's position in missile defense.","This month, after the quarter closed, IIS was selected by the U.S. Air Force to develop the future operationally resilient ground evolution program, also known as FORGE. This newly developed open framework will be capable of processing overhead persistent infrared satellite data from both the U.S. Air Force's evolving SBIRS constellation and the future Next Gen OPIR constellation for missile warning.","Also in January, we were awarded the fourth element terminal by the U.S. Air Force, which extends our protected communications franchise at SAS. Finally, one of our most notable highlights of 2019 was announcing our transformational merger of equals with United Technologies. These two industry leading companies will create one of the best positioned aerospace and defense companies.","Raytheon Technologies will have a diversified platform agnostic suite of offerings that are balanced across end markets, which is a key differentiator through business cycles. The combined company will also have a vast global footprint. By combining our complimentary technologies, we can go after and win and increase number of new franchises. We expect the revenue synergy opportunities from our combined technologies to continue to be value generators for decades to come, positioning the company to increase market share and outgrow the aerospace and defense markets.","Integration planning for the merger is progressing well and the merger is targeted to close early in the second quarter of 2020. As we start the New Year, we feel optimistic about the future and our ability to continue to grow, both domestically and internationally. We are pleased with the fiscal year '20 appropriations bill enacted in December with our Raytheon programs fairing well, and the DoD monetization account up versus fiscal year '19. Fiscal year '21 budget control act caps were increased last year, so we have top line certainty and include a modest increase in a DoD base budget. Perhaps best of all, fiscal year '21 is the last year on the BCA.","Bottom line, we have a strong foundation for the future. And this is recognized last week in Fortune magazine's annual survey. Raytheon was ranked the number one company in the aerospace and defense industry in the 2020 study of the World's Most Admired Companies. And it's included number one rankings in key attribute categories, such as innovation, financial soundness, global competitiveness and social responsibility.","Let me close by thanking all the members of the Raytheon team worldwide. When I think about our many successes in 2019, I do so with deep appreciation for my dedicated colleagues who made it possible. They are the ones helping the company grow and meet its commitments, the ones creating value for shareholders and the one providing the trusted, innovative solutions our customers depend upon.","Given the expected timing of the merger's close, this could well be the last earnings call for me and for Raytheon Company. For nearly 100 years, this company has provided mission critical technologies to our customers, supported a diverse and engaged workforce and has been a good corporate citizen. That legacy built on a foundation of trust, respect, collaboration, innovation and accountability, will continue. And we are excited to redefine the future of the aerospace and defense industry as Raytheon Technologies.","With that, let me turn the call over to Toby.","Toby O'Brien","Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and full year results. Then I'll discuss our outlook for 2020. After that, we'll open up the call for questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the Web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on our Web site.","On Pages 2 and 3, we have our fourth quarter and full year highlights and summary results for the year. We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in both the fourth quarter and the full year with bookings, sales, operating income, EPS and operating cash flow that all met or exceeded our expectations. We had record bookings in the fourth quarter at $12.1 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.54. And for the year, we also had record bookings of $36.3 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.25.","This sets the stage for continued strong growth in 2020, which I'll discuss in more detail in just a few minutes. And we achieved record backlog of $48.8 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Sales were $7.8 billion in the quarter, up 6.5% from the same period last year, and we saw growth across all of our businesses. For the year, sales were up 7.8%, reaching a new company record of $29.2 billion.","Our EPS from continuing operations was $3.16 for the quarter and $11.92 for the full year. I will give a little more color on EPS in a few minutes. We also generated strong operating cash flow of $2.8 billion for the quarter and $4.5 billion for the year. It's worth noting that we exceeded our operating cash flow guidance by approximately $400 million at the midpoint and achieved new company record for operating cash flow. This increase was driven by operations and improved working capital. The company ended the year with a strong balance sheet and net debt of approximately $500 million.","Now turning to Page 4. Let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. As I mentioned earlier, we had strong bookings of $12.1 billion in the quarter and $36.3 billion for the full year, resulting in a record backlog of $48.8 billion. This is an increase to backlog of over $6 billion or 15% over year-end 2018, and provides us with a strong foundation for the future. International orders represented 28% of our total company bookings for both the quarter and the full year. At the end of 2019, approximately 38% of our total backlog was international.","Turning now to Page 5. We had fourth quarter sales of $7.8 billion, an increase of 6.5% compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 and in line with our expectations. International sales continue to be strong, representing 31% of our total sales for the fourth quarter and 29% for the full year of 2019.","So looking at the businesses. IDS had net sales of $2 billion in the quarter, up 18% from the same period in 2018, primarily due to higher net sales on an international air and missile defense system program awarded in the third quarter 2019 and an international missile defense radar program. IIS had net sales of $1.7 billion in Q4, up 2% compared with Q4, 2018. Net sales at missile systems in the fourth quarter were $2.3 billion, up compared with the same period in 2018. And for the full year, missile sales of $8.7 billion were up 5% over 2018.","It's worth noting that missiles had strong bookings performance for the full year 2019 with bookings up 23% over the prior year. In the fourth quarter 2019, SAS had net sales of $2 billion. The 7% increase from the fourth quarter 2018 was primarily driven by higher sales on classified programs, the Next Gen OPIR program and tactical communication systems programs. For the full year, total company sales were $29.2 billion, up 7.8% over full year 2018.","Moving ahead to Page 6, we delivered strong operational performance in the quarter. Our operating margin was 16.3% for the total company. On a business segment basis, our operating margin was 12.7%, up 70 basis points and higher than Q4, 2018, primarily due to higher net program efficiencies. Total business segment operating income of $993 million grew $109 million or 12% in the quarter.","So now looking at the business margins. IDS fourth quarter 2019 operating margin was strong at 15.5%, up 80 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. IIS operating margin of 8.6% was up 20 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 and better than expectations. Missiles operating margin was 12.7% in the quarter, up 90 basis points compared to Q4 2018.","The fourth quarter of 2019 benefited from a favorable change in program mix and higher net program efficiencies. SAS fourth quarter 2019 operating margin was 13.8% and in line with the fourth quarter of 2018. And SAS had a $21 million gain from the sale of real estate, which was assumed in our fourth quarter 2019 guidance.","Turning to Page 7, we have solid operating margin performance for the year. Our operating margin was 16.4% for the total company and 12.1% on a business segment basis, an increase of 10 basis points compared with 2018.Total business segment operating income was $3.5 billion in 2019 and was up $290 million for the year or 9% over full year 2018.","On Page 8, you'll see both the fourth quarter and full year EPS. In the fourth quarter 2019, our EPS was $3.16 and for the full year was $11.92. Both the quarter and full year were higher than the comparable periods in 2018, primarily driven by operational improvements from higher sales volume and favorable pension related items. Overall, we have strong operating performance for both the quarter and full year.","Now, let me update you on our 2020 outlook on Page 9. As we sit here today, we currently see the book-to-bill ratio above one, and would expect to achieve another record backlog year. We also see strong sales growth for 2020 for the underlying Raytheon business of 6% to 8% over our 2019 results.","Additionally, we expect growth across all of our businesses. We would expect IDS and SAS, our highest margin businesses, to have higher growth rate than the others, both with expected sales growth of 6% to 8% versus 2019. And at IIS, we'd expect sales growth of 4% to 6%. At missiles, we would expect sales growth of 5% to 7%. Although not on the page, I want to spend a minute talking about our expectations for the first quarter of 2020. We remain confident in our growth rate of 6% to 8% for the full year 2020.","We expect the first quarter sales growth to be in the low-single-digits due to a tough comp with last year's first quarter. We see the sales growth profile of 2020 second half weighted with sales ramping up throughout the year, which is driven by the strong bookings in the second half of 2019.","Before concluding, I want to touch on the pending merger with United Technologies. The collaborative merger efforts and integration planning between Raytheon and United Technologies are continuing to progress well. We look forward to the next steps in the process, including continuing to work closely with regulatory authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions to secure the required clearances and approvals for the merger. We are targeting the merger to close early in the second quarter of 2020. And post closing, we look forward to Raytheon Technologies delivering strong free cash flow growth and deploying a significant amount of its free cash flow to its shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.","Let me conclude by saying that 2019 was a very successful year for Raytheon where we once again delivered strong financial results. We set many new company records in 2019, including record operating cash flow, backlog, bookings and sales and records for both sales and bookings in the classified and international areas. We have a strong balance sheet, which gives us a strong foundation as we move forward with the merger. And our business segments are well positioned to grow in 2020 and beyond.","So with that, we'll open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from the line of Carter Copeland.","Carter Copeland","So just a quick clarification and a question, just on the IDS growth, Toby, seems like for 3Q '19 award, the impact on the topline is pretty fast. Was that work that was done that got on contract? I just wanted you to help us with that. And then Tom, I wondered if you could give us some color on where the customer is kind of thinking or heading on [three dealer] [ph] and the change there? Thanks.","A - Toby O'Brien","So on IDS, you know Carter, we're real pleased with their performance for the quarter and the year. The 12% growth they delivered in '19 was real strong. But yes, you got it right. There was some inventory liquidation that took place in order to ensure we had the right schedule cadence on the program going forward.","Tom Kennedy","On the [three dealer] [ph], you may remember we initially won that back in 2014. And it was a bunch of protests and everything else like that, so it's kind of a program that kind of got off to kind of an interesting start with the protest. In any case, the technology baseline was back in about 2008 when essentially the whole solicitation efforts started with the Air Force. And as you can imagine, by the time we got started after the protest, there were many advancements in technology since then, but we had a baseline that was kind of rigid.","And as also under the older, call it the acquisition strategies or techniques that the department had. And so couple of things they want to do, one is they wanted to refresh on the technology and then the other one is to get more into an OTA structure where they thought they could get the program through faster. And so they're going to go off and conduct an industry day here, surely lot more details. Part of that is they're going to try to do a sense off that was very similar what the United States Army did with the LTAMDS radar. And if you guys remember that last year, they conducted a sense off and in the end game, we went one up winning that program with the solution that we brought to the sense off.","Toby O'Brien","The only thing I would add, given the state of where the program was at from a development point of view, it doesn't have a material impact on our financial results for 2020 and even the next year or two beyond that.","Operator","Thank you. Your next response is from Sheila Kahyaoglu. Please go ahead.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Tom, while we have you. How do we think about IDS and profitability mix, given FMS sales pick up and just the cadence of those? And related to that, how do we think about Patriot international opportunities with the LTAMDS win in the U.S.","Tom Kennedy","I think IDS has a really bright future. And the number one is there they have the largest content of international. But they've also developed some key franchises here recently, the Air Missile Defense Radar or the Spy 6 for the DEG-51s, they also developed the enterprise air surveillance radar for the Navy. And as you know, the Navy is pushing for 350 ships, a lot of them are going to be frigates and the EASR has been already designated as the radar for those frigates. So I think that's a good for there for moving forward.","They also won the lower tier air missile defense sensor, which is the LTAMDS for Patriot. And as we mentioned during the scripts, that's got about a $20 billion future here, both of between domestic and international customers. Just last year, Bahrain became our 17th country that has the Patriot system. So we have 17 countries that we work with on the Patriot system. Obviously, they're buying spares, aftermarket efforts in those areas. But they also continue to buy new solutions for the Patriot System.","And now we have a brand new solution to bring in and it significantly enhances the capability of the Patriot system, called the LTAMDS radar. And there's about an opportunity for over 240 of those radars here over the next decade or so. So they're very strong all across the board in terms of new franchises coming on board, refreshing the Patriot franchise. On the international marketplace, they've done quite well by balancing both the FMS, which has higher margins than the domestic but also bringing on quite a bit of what we call DCS, Direct Commercial Sales business, which has higher margins than the FMS. So all-in-all, I think IDS is on a very strong foundation but they built, I call a launch pad for increased success through the decade.","Toby O'Brien","And maybe I can just add a little bit and I'll start at the highest level of a company. So we're not giving guidance for 2020 consistent what we said back in October. But that said, I would tell you specifically around margins, nothing's changed. We still see the opportunity to improve margins incrementally going forward, improve our operating income overall, number one. As far as IDS in there, FMS, DCS mix. In the near-term, yes, that's a headwind.","It's a good problem to have given the volume of the FMS work coming in. And we still have solid DCS work. I would tell you and remind you I think you all know IDS has been historically our highest margin business. We expect that to continue in the future. And we talked about the improved margin in Q4 for the company, a lot of it through net program efficiencies, IDS was a big contributor to that and we'd expect strong performance from IDS going forward.","Let me just expand too a little bit on LTAMDS, because back when we were awarded in October we mentioned that the contract vehicle here is an OTA. Given that I think as folks know that does require periods of investment and we're going to experience that here for Raytheon. We have been spending on this for a while. As Tom alluded to leading up to the sense off and the hardware we delivered there.","We're delivering six represent -- production representative units under the contract, it's about three year effort. The majority of the costs are going to be incurred in 2020. And you might have seen in our release, we took $13 million expense at the corporate level related to LTAMDS. We're managing this as a corporate project given the strategic significance tie back to the $20 billion opportunity, the standalone opportunities. And consistent with that, we'll be recording an expense throughout the year at the corporate level, probably in the $200 million range plus or minus and then it would tail off into 2021 as well. There's no impact on the IDS margins or the IDS segment margins as a result of that.","Operator","Your next response is from Cai Von Rumohr. Please go ahead.","Cai Von Rumohr","So you'd mentioned that your fastest growth is IDS and SAS, which are your higher margin -- highest margin business excluding the $200 million investment in LTAMDS. I mean, should we assume that your margins if you were a standalone company would be up?","Toby O'Brien","So I think Cai, again, both for 2020 and beyond, I think we've been consistent. We are on a path to incrementally on an annual basis improve margins. Our segment margins were up 10 basis points in 2019 compared to 2018. That said we do have to think about mix impacts. And as Sheila asked and I just mentioned, we do see some mix with more FMS, less DCS and IDS, but we are focused on operational excellence and driving more efficiencies through the business.","Missiles as an example, we expect their margins to be improved after some of the challenges they had in 2019. We expect their margins to improve in 2020. But they're still dealing with more development work, more classified work. Again, big picture kind of punch line is yes, there a standalone business. We would expect the company segment margins to incrementally improve in 2020 and beyond.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Myles Walton. Please go ahead.","Myles Walton","Just on the remaining 19% for fourth quarter. Just curious if that now allows you to or pushes you to pursue process there. And also how indicative is the price you pay Vista to what you think you'll get in the open market? And maybe Toby, can you just give us where the pension ended? Thanks.","Toby O'Brien","So let me start with the fourth point part of your question. So look back to when we acquired Websense almost five years ago, we had disclosed the liquidity rights that both sides had. I think we and Vista hadn't been aligned all along. So ultimately the end game here was to monetize the investment in Forcepoint. They chose to do it through the foot process. We followed a very stipulated process per our agreement with Vista. We had outside advisors involved. And amongst other things, it took into account market conditions, comparable trading companies, et cetera.","So at the time, yes, we think -- if we think it is indicative of that, obviously, at the end of the day, we still want to monetize the asset. We're going to do that in a smart way, evaluate all of our options. The whole software security market continues to trade pretty favorably here. And as we move along, we'll be looking to do what makes the most sense for the company and shareholders around that.","Switching over to the pension, we had a return of about 19% for last year compared to our 7.5% long term assumptions. The discount rate that we're using for 2020 now is down about 100 basis points from what it was last year, it's at 3.3%. And we also did, through our normal process, update our long term return on asset assumptions and we reduced that from 7.5% to 7%.","That all said, I'll just remind everyone that once the merger closes, because of purchase accounting, there will be some significant changes in this area. SAS operating and non-operating expense will improve as a result of that. And I think also to keep in mind there will not be an impact on our CAS recovery if you want to think about from a cash flow perspective that the CAS recovery stays intact.","Operator","Your next response is from David Strauss. Please go ahead.","David Strauss","I want to ask about the cash flow. Obviously, very strong performance this year, I think it came in $700 million or so above what you were thinking or what was in the S-4. Does any of that represent any sort of working capital pull forward that you had expected to come through in '20? Because I know what's in the S-4, looks like it reflects some pretty big working capital benefit. And then I think CapEx came in a little lighter than what you were thinking. Can you just address kind of the CapEx profile from here as well? Thanks.","Toby O'Brien","So on the cash flow, I'm real pleased with how the company performed and delivered and overachieved in this area. And it was from improvements in working capital, all program operational related. That said, again, we're not giving guidance for 2020. But I would expect excluding the effects of the merger, so taking the merger related costs and cash impacts out of it, I'd expect stronger cash flow in 2020 despite the over performance in 2019.","So said another way, it's not a timing issue. It's not -- you're not moving from one year to another. And again, I think that's indicative of our focus on running the business, executing the business and obviously, having a strong balance sheet here for the first part of your question.","Secondly, on CapEx, a couple things. We had talked about 2019 being a peak year for capital spending. We still feel that way even though it did come in a little below what the original expectation was. As far as 2020 goes, we'd expect it to be down a little bit further, albeit slightly of the reduction compared to what we were expecting in 2019. Some of that was permanent where we found ways to do things more efficiently and a little bit of it was timing that moved from 2019 to 2020. But again, we're on a downward trajectory consistent with what we have said this time last year.","Operator","Your next response is from George Shapiro. Please go ahead.","George Shapiro","Toby, can you tell us what's actually happened in missiles? I mean, the sales growth this quarter was clearly came below your revised guidance and for 2020, we're not expecting a lot of growth on the positive. The margin got a lot better. But what's happened on the sales side for kind of what was compared to what we're seeing?","Toby O'Brien","So for Q4 overall at the company level, the 6.5% growth that contributed to 7.8% for the year, that was within the range we expected. You're right, missiles was a bit lower than we previously expected. We saw a little bit more strength than some of the other businesses. The way to think of missile sales in the fourth quarter was really some supplier delivery volume on a couple of production programs that we were expecting didn't materialize. And we had a few awards that had some inventory liquidations that again were a little less than expected.","That said, the way to think of missiles going forward is they closed the year real strong, as I mentioned, relative to their bookings being up 23% year-over-year. Tom, in his opening comments, spoke about $3 billion worth of awards in the Standard Missile family that came in in the fourth quarter. We have the -- and one of those was -- one of the two multiyears that we had previously talked about, the second multiyear for the SM31B, we expect in the first half of this year. So we believe all that taken as a whole supports and provides for a foundation for missiles to grow and at a higher rate than we saw in Q4 again in the 5% to 7% rate for the year.","Operator","Your next response is from Robert Stallard. Please go ahead.","Robert Stallard","Thomas, this could be your last opportunity. And I was wondering if you give us your usual run through of what you're seeing at the moment in some of these key export markets. You've seen another good year of bookings. I was wondering how that could progress from here?","Tom Kennedy","I'll start off -- let's start off in Europe. We have seen significant uptick over the last several years in Europe. A lot of it's been the pressure from our administration to push these countries to get to 2% -- the NATO countries do 2% of the GDP for defense. So we have seen an uptick there in Patriot, countries like Romania and Sweden buying the Patriot system was part of that. But we also have additional opportunities in that region for integrated air and missile defense and upgrading their systems, military systems across the board.","Over in the Middle East, that continues to be an issue of significant demand for our solution set. As we recently saw in Iraq, anyone who has forces in that region needed to have integrated air missile defense capabilities and defender troops and their resources and their infrastructure. So we're seeing significant demands across the region for integrated air and missile defense solutions that range all the way from countering drones to, to ballistic missiles, to cruise missiles. So it's right in our sweet spot. And again, we're doing quite well in that region already but we see significant upside potential in the Middle East.","And in the Asia Pacific region, North Korea has not quieted down, they're still doing testing. So there is considerable concern relative to, for example, South Korea and also Japan. Also in Korea, you don't see it out there in the press a lot but there is going to be a handoff of defense of South Korea from the South Korean government -- from the U.S. to the South Korean government. And that's going to provide an uptick requirement for us to be able to help provide the South Koreans the solutions they need to maintain their defense in that region as a primary defender.","And then also relative to Japan significant uptick there, not just from the North Korea issue but also from the pressures from China. I think there's considerable push from China as we know expansionism relative to the first and second island chains. Japan wants to make sure they have a defense against that. So that is requiring some higher end solution sets that we are working with the Japanese government to provide.","So in all the regions that we really participate in, in Europe and the Middle East and also in the Asia Pacific region, we're seeing significant demand singles for solution sets across the board. Obviously, we have created a bunch of new solution sets, like the SPY-6 radar, the EASR, now with the LTAMDS radar. So we had new solutions to bring to those markets and that we're working that very hard.","Toby O'Brien","And Rob, I just from a quantitative point of view, just reinforce and we mentioned last year was a record year for international, including bookings. So we're seeing the results of that threat environment that Tom just walked through materialized in our results. We talked about 1.25 book-to-bill, both the domestic and international book-to-bill were plus or minus in that ballpark. So it was not one side of the house, if you will, driving the growth. We said 28% of the bookings were international 38% of the backlog, 29% of the sales and plus or minus we'd expect that same level of contribution from both in 2020 as well.","Operator","Your next response is from Seth Seifman.","Seth Seifman","Toby, if I just look at the guidance for the individual segments and proportion of the company, looks like the growth for 2020 would come in more at the 6-end than 8-end. Is that the right takeaway at this point? And where might there be potential upside?","Toby O'Brien","No, I think the way I think of it, you got to think is that range is 6% to 8%. We're not specific beyond that. Don't forget that's total sales, don't have on the chart, we didn't talk about what would happen with eliminations. So those numbers exclude eliminations, which are close to in line, we expect them to be more in line with 2019. So I think that may be part of what is drove you to the question, you did there from the 6% versus either a midpoint or something else. That said, I mean we're confident in the range, the 6% to 8%, the strong backlog, the $49 billion in backlog, up 15% growth across all the businesses where we see that happening consistent with what we've laid out there, so no concerns on our end.","Operator","Your next response is from Peter Arment.","Peter Arment","Tom, we know you're not going anywhere. So -- but thanks for all your guidance over the years. But Toby, just back to kind of, I guess, follow up on Seth's question. If we look at the 6% to 8% and off of the base of 2019 and we compare it against 4$, really seems closer to 2021 numbers that you had out there, not the 2020, I guess. What would you highlight as the differences? I assume the LTAMDS might be one of them or so. Thanks.","Toby O'Brien","So LTAMDS would not be one, Peter, just because of the nature of the OTA and kind of as I described before, the funded R&D concept. Right now, we're not recording revenue on that. We're really treating it as funded R&D and the related expense that I talked about earlier. Just as a reminder from the origin of that S-4 data, we talked about in the S-4 the process that led to the merger and the timeline around that. And that S-4 data, the origin of it predated that. So you got to go back to the 2018 timeframe for when we pulled that together.","And I think the simplest way to think of it is last year, we ended 2018 with a backlog growth of 11% that was better than our expectations, because our bookings were higher and a similar thing happened here with the 15% increase, including multiple increases in the bookings outlook throughout 2019. So really tie it back to the strong bookings growth and the translation into the $49 billion in backlog that's driving and ask as you did the math, the absolute dollar profile compared to the data in the S4. This shows the underlying strength of the business and how well positioned the portfolio was.","Operator","Your next response is from Hunter Keay. Please go ahead.","Hunter Keay","Obviously, much you can say on this topic, but at high level. How is the classified arena evolving as you think about areas of priority? And can you just help us understand the pro forma RTS exposure that market once the deal is closed? I asked the question, because I didn't really hear you guys talk about hypersonics in your prepared remarks either. So if you want to somehow pull that in. Thanks.","Tom Kennedy","Hunter, let me just talk a little bit about the classified. I mean, obviously, you're right. It's classified if you can't talk about it. But in any case, it's really driven out of the national defense strategy, which really outline this next generation capability that the United States needs to be able to defend itself against these new evolving threats. And that really sets, I would say, the overarching requirement. And then from there, we go down to what actually has to occur. And there's all the areas of -- the NDS calls out the fact that we need to protect space. And so there's a whole set of efforts going on to ensure we protect space or space assets, the assets that we need to just do in our economy, but also for the defense of our nation. So that's a large area there.","There's also a large area in the, I would call it missile defense capabilities and how do we defend our nation against the missile, intercontinental ballistic missile threat or other types of threats like hypersonic weapons. So there's a whole counter hypersonics and counter advanced intercontinental ballistic missile threat type work that's going on. And then there's the whole issue of the South China Sea and our ability to be able to maintain a presence there, keep those sea lanes open, and what type of technologies we need there and what advance capabilities we need. So that's the other major threat.","But it all starts with the national defense strategy. And it's driven our business up. We have a solid set of, not just franchises but we also have a solid set of technical capabilities across the company that we're seeing in significant demand to satisfy these needs, I would call classified requirements needs, driven out of the national defense strategy. And that's driven our sales up 20% of our company's sales this year, has been classified.","And I've said this on calls in the past but this classified work, we use this term as the sea corn of our -- for our future franchises. What I mean by that is this classified work allows us to take are our technical capabilities and resources and IP, and work hand in glove with our customers to evolve the next set for our sake, the franchises that will enable our customers to meet their mission needs, especially relative to the NDS.","And so I think one way of looking at this for Raytheon is the greater, the amount of classified work we have, the stronger our future will be and our ability to generate new franchises that last for decades to come. And the classified bookings represented 22% of our total bookings in '19. It was up 17% over 2018, again, setting a new company record. And I think it just sets the company up for a great future to come.","Kelsey DeBriyn","That's all the time we have today. Thank you for joining us this morning."],"18171":["Raytheon Co.

With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby, and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters we discuss today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives, and expected performance constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. We're off to a strong start in 2017 as we continue to build on our momentum from last year. In the first quarter, sales increased by over 3%. This growth, combined with operating margin expansion, drove strong EPS performance. I'm also pleased to report that all of the businesses met or exceeded our expectations in the quarter.","Bookings were solid and our backlog increased by 5.5%. Overall, our growth strategy continues to be well aligned with the needs of our global customers. And you're seeing this in our operating results. Toby will take you through the quarter's financials and the increases to our sales and EPS guidance in a few minutes.","I'd like to take a moment to talk about the threat environment. It continues to evolve and is driving a significant increase in demand signals from every one of our major global markets. Whether it's capability for strike, integrated air and missile defense, or long-range sensing capabilities, Raytheon is at the forefront providing high technology solutions for our customers' most complex challenges.","Key areas, where we see strong future opportunity are the sea and undersea domains. As we have discussed on prior calls, Raytheon is a leader in providing the next generation of GaN-based navel radars. Our solutions include the air and missile defense radar and the enterprise air surveillance radar for the U.S. Navy and international customers.","Together, these will form the backbone of radar capabilities for the allied surface fleets of the future. We are making considerable progress towards delivering these advanced capabilities. To that end, in the first quarter, AMDR successfully completed its first test which called on the radar to acquire and then track an advanced ballistic missile target, a significant milestone for the system.","Our development work on AMDR continues and the program is expected to enter low rate initial production this year. Beyond radars, Raytheon also provides a broad set of naval missile defense and strike systems, which include Tomahawk, which just this month again proved its value as the weapon of choice for standoff engagement, protecting the warfighter and achieving a critical mission. We're adding new capabilities to Tomahawk that will enable it also to engage maritime targets, providing the Navy with a much longer reach.","While Tomahawk has been in the headlines lately, let me also remind you about SM-6 and SM-3, which provides the Navy with over-the-horizon air and missile defense capabilities. In fact, in the first quarter, the latest version of SM-3 Block IIA, which we are co-developing with Japan achieved a significant milestone and successfully completed its first intercept of a target resembling an advanced ballistic missile threat. This intercept is an important demonstration of the new missiles capabilities and the program is on track for deployment in the 2018 timeframe.","We also have many other ship protection systems that include the Evolved Seasparrow Missile, Rolling Airframe Missile and the Phalanx as well as the Mark 54 Torpedo. To maximize the effect in this of all of these systems, we provide ship-based strategic communication systems and advanced command and control such as the Cooperative Engagement Capability.","CEC ensures that the Navy has advantageous situational awareness of the battlefield through superior networks and shared sensor information. CEC is a key element in Naval Integrated Fire Control-Counter Air capability. Another key growth opportunity for us is in the area of advanced sonar programs for the U.S. Navy. This month, we were pleased to have our award for the new variable-depth sonar program affirmed.","While the award is initially for the Littoral Combat Ship, this advanced sonar program will ultimately allow us to deliver game-changing capability to the entire fleet. This is one of the most significant anti-submarine warfare opportunities of the decade positioning us well on a number of new programs going forward. And we see a number of classified undersea opportunities that should drive future growth as well. So as you can see, we have a broad portfolio of sea and undersea capabilities and we are well-positioned for future growth in modernizing the Navy fleet and the fleets of our allies.","Now turning to the quarter, bookings exceeded our expectations and included the $1 billion award for the Qatar early warning radar as well as a number of awards for missiles and radars. Based on this and new opportunities, we are raising our bookings outlook for the year to a range of $25.5 billion to $26.5 billion, an increase of $500 million. Revenue increased by 3.4% in the quarter and was driven largely by a growth of 7.5% in our international business.","International comprised 32% of our total sales in the quarter. We also saw strong sales growth in our domestic classified business of 6.4%. Last year's record classified bookings were a key driver behind this quarter's continued strong classified revenue growth. As we look forward, we are making progress on a number of large international opportunities. For Poland Patriot, as announced last month, an updated LOR is being provided to the U.S. government with an estimated value for us of up to $5 billion.","Patriot will provide the Polish government with integrated air and missile defense capabilities to meet the threat today with an upgrade path to new GaN-based radars that will address the threats of tomorrow, a key competitive discriminator for the customer. Later this year, we expect the Polish Ministry of Defense to sign an LOA with the U.S. government, which will make Poland the 14th country to utilize Patriot.","Beyond Poland, we see other opportunities for Patriot in Europe, driven by customer demand due to evolving threats to the region. These opportunities, in combination with demand for additional fire units and upgrades for existing customers in other regions, continue to demonstrate the strength of the Patriot franchise.","Earlier this month, Raytheon Australia announced that it has been selected to be the sole bidder for the country's ground-based air defense system. This system will provide the innermost layer of Australia's enhanced integrated air and missile defense capability. Our offering, which would be produced in cooperation with Australian industry, is initially based on our NASAMS system and represents an opportunity of up to $1 billion for Raytheon. This award is currently expected in the 2019 timeframe.","Following the award of Qatar EWR in the first quarter, we continue to see growing interest from customers in the MENA region for long-range surveillance capabilities. This includes significant additional demand for early warning radars, as well as our TPY-2 X-Band radars in the 2018 to 2020 timeframe. To meet future threats, we've continued to evolve TPY-2. Last year, we received a contract from our domestic customer to incorporate GaN technology into the TPY-2 radars. This provides a potentially significant future upgrade opportunity for the existing global inventories.","Now turning to domestic. While the debate about government funding levels is ongoing, we are optimistic that the longer-term budget trends will be favorable. For us, we see a number of key opportunities developing across multiple domains as the Department of Defense looks to invest in new technologies to deter rapidly evolving threats and fund increases and readiness to meet high operating tempo requirements.","Before concluding, I'd like to mention, in the last month, we announced an 8.9% increase in our dividend. This marks the 13th consecutive year of increasing dividends at Raytheon. Our solid growth, operating performance, and strong alignment with our global customer needs provide us the flexibility to continue to execute our balanced capital deployment strategy. A key priority of this strategy continues to be paying a competitive, sustainable dividend.","I would like to thank the Raytheon team for their dedication to delivering world-class solutions for our warfighters, as well as their commitment to creating value for all of our stakeholders.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Toby.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the first quarter highlights. And then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.","If everyone would turn to page 3. We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the first quarter with bookings, sales and EPS better than our expectations. After this good start, we're raising our full year outlook for all three of these measures, which I'll discuss further in just a few minutes. We had solid bookings in the first quarter of $5.7 billion and sales in the quarter were $6 billion, up 3.4%, led by our IDS and SAS businesses. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.73 which I'll give a little more color on in just a moment.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock for $400 million. And as a reminder, effective January 1, 2017, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard. The 2016 results have been recast to reflect this change.","Turning now to page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our first quarter results. Company bookings for the first quarter were $5.7 billion, which were ahead of our expectations and down slightly from the same period last year. And on a trailing four quarter basis, our total book-to-bill ratio is 1.12. International awards represented 33% of the total bookings, an increase of approximately 14% over last year's first quarter.","A couple of key bookings in the first quarter included the $1 billion award for the upgraded early warning radar for Qatar at IDS, $256 million for active electronically scanned array radars at SAS, and at missiles over $200 million on AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missiles.","Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $36.1 billion, an increase of approximately $1.9 billion or 5.5% compared to the first quarter 2016. It's worth noting that approximately 41% of our backlog is comprised of international programs.","We now move to page 5. As I just mentioned, for the first quarter 2017, sales were higher than the guidance we set in January. Sales were particularly strong at both IDS and at SAS. We expect sales for the company to increase throughout the year with a strong second half driven by our bookings over the past several quarters.","Looking now at sales by business. IDS had first quarter net sales of $1.4 billion. The increase from Q1 2016 was primarily driven by higher sales on an international early warning radar program. We expect IDS sales to increase through the year as some of our larger international programs continue to ramp up.","In the first quarter, IIS had net sales of $1.5 billion. Compared with the same quarter last year the change, as expected, was primarily due to lower net sales on an international classified program which substantially completed in 2016.","Missile Systems had net sales of $1.8 billion, up slightly compared with the same period last year.","SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion. Higher sales on electronic warfare systems program contributed to the 8% increase versus last year.","And for Forcepoint, sales were up about 4% in the quarter.","Moving ahead to page 6, let me spend a few minutes talking about our margins. We delivered strong margin performance in the quarter. Our operating margin was 12.4% for the total company, up 180 basis points, and 11.8% on a business segment basis, an increase of 160 basis points. Margin improvement in the first quarter of 2017 was driven by favorable program mix with some of our largest international awards progressing through their lifecycle. And, as a reminder, in the first quarter of 2016, at IDS, we had a $36 million unfavorable program adjustment that impacted their margins.","At Forcepoint, as expected, the first quarter 2017 operating margin was down for the quarter. This is due to the internal investment to support Forcepoint's long-term growth that we discussed on the earnings call in January. We remain focused on margin improvement going forward and see our business segment margins in the 12.4% to 12.6% range for the full year, consistent with the guidance we laid out in January. We also see our margin improving as we move throughout the year.","Turning now to page 7. First quarter 2017 EPS of $1.73 was up 21% from last year's first quarter and was better than expected. This year-over-year increase was largely driven by higher volume and margin expansion. On page 8, as I mentioned earlier, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2017 to reflect our improved performance to-date. We're increasing our full year 2017 net sales range by $100 million, which favorably impact EPS by about $0.04. This increase is driven by higher expected sales at our Missile Systems business.","We now expect net sales to be in the range of between $24.9 billion and $25.4 billion. For the year, we expect sales to be up 3% to 5% from 2016. Earlier this month, we gave notice to redeem $591 million in notes that were due in March and December of 2018. As a result, in the second quarter of 2017, we expect to record a non-operating charge associated with the make-whole provision related to the early retirement of debt. This charge of approximately $40 million pre-tax or $26 million after-tax based upon current market conditions impacts EPS by $0.09 and has been included in our updated EPS guidance.","We're also reducing the range of our interest expense to be between $196 million and $201 million to reflect this early retirement of debt. This is expected to reduce our interest expense primarily in both the third and fourth quarters worth about $0.04 to EPS compared to our prior guidance. We have slightly lowered our effective tax rate to reflect the improved benefit associated with stock-based compensation and various other items, which in total is worth about $0.06 for the full year.","We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 31%. Looking at our EPS guidance, we exceeded the high-end of our guidance in the first quarter by $0.18. For the year, due to the strong first quarter operating performance, we are raising guidance by $0.05 after absorbing a net $0.05 financing charge that was not in our prior guidance.","The remaining $0.08 is due to timing within the year. And as a result, we now expect our full year EPS to be in a range of between $7.25 and $7.40. As I discussed earlier, we repurchased 2.7 million shares of common stock for $400 million in the quarter and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 291 million and 293 million shares for 2017, a 2% reduction at the midpoint of the range.","Operating cash flow in the first quarter was essentially in line with our prior expectations and was slightly impacted by the higher sales we saw in the first quarter. We continue to see our full year 2017 operating cash flow outlook between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion. And, as you can see on page 9, we've included guidance by business, which reflects the higher net sales at Missile Systems that I mentioned earlier.","Before moving on to page 10, as Tom mentioned earlier, we're now raising our full year 2017 bookings outlook to be between $25.5 billion and $26.5 billion. This $500 million increase is driven by demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. On page 10, we provided you with our outlook for the second quarter of 2017. As we mentioned on our last call, we still expect the cadence for the balance of 2017 to play out similar to 2016 with sales, EPS and operating cash flow ramping up in the second half of the year.","I want to point out that we expect second quarter sales to be in a range of $6.05 billion to $6.2 billion and EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in a range of $1.67 to $1.71. It's important to note that we expect the tax rate to be approximately 29.5% in the quarter, lower than the full year, primarily due to the timing of the benefit associated with stock-based compensation. Again, I want to reiterate that our second quarter EPS outlook includes an estimated unfavorable $40 million pre-tax or $0.09 EPS impact to non-operating income associated with the early retirement of debt. This charge will be recorded in other income and expense.","Before concluding, I'd like to spend a minute on our balanced capital deployment strategy. As we said on the call in January, we expect the full year 2017 share buyback to approximate 2016's levels. And as mentioned earlier, we recently raised the dividend by 8.9%. We continue to expect to generate strong free cash flow for the year and target returning approximately 80% of free cash flow to shareholders, while maintaining a strong balance sheet.","In summary, we saw a good performance in the first quarter. Our bookings were strong, sales and EPS from continuing operations were higher than the guidance we set in January and our operating cash flow remains on track for the year.","With that, Tom and I will now open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","In the interest of time and to allow for broader participation, you are asked to limit yourself to one question. And the first question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Todd Ernst - Raytheon Co.","Cai, are you there?","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC","Me?","Todd Ernst - Raytheon Co.","Hello, Cai.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hello?","Todd Ernst - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. Hi, Cai.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC","Yes. Can you hear me?","Todd Ernst - Raytheon Co.","Yes.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yes.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. So you mentioned the heightened global threat environment. Could you talk specifically about the opportunities first for additional orders for SM-3 and SM-6 from our Asian allies given the heightened threat from North Korea? And also in the Mid-East, your partner on THAAD, Lockheed, continues to talk about potential foreign order this year. It requires the TPY-2 and yet you're talking about not getting an order until next year.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Okay. Let me \u2013 okay. Actually both of those questions are very good news. The first question is on the SM-3 and SM-6. It ties into the readiness moving forward. I'm sure you've heard that one of the elements of Trump's defense policy is to make sure we have the appropriate readiness for our entire fighting forces, including the Navy, in this case, both the SM-3 and SM-6. So we're looking to see in terms of the overall readiness potentially some additional funds in the area of missiles to essentially replenish, but also to make sure they have enough of these systems to protect the fleet.","On the other side of this, the other element you mentioned was the international. So, both the SM-3, for example, Block IIA has been co-developed with Japan. So, Japan will buy many of the SM-3 Block IIAs. On the SM-6, the U.S. government has authorized SM-6 to some of our coalition partners. And so we are working through that right now to determine how many they will buy over the next five years.","Back over to your other question relative to THAAD, you're absolutely correct. We are a major player on THAAD. Our TPY-2 radars, for example, are a major element of that system. And there are multiple opportunities in the Middle East. For example, Qatar has said that they are interested in buying THAAD and also the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. And, right now, in our, I would say, conservative outlook, we have those occurring in 2018 and beyond. So, I think, that's exactly how we have it set today.","Operator","And your next question \u2013 it comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC","Tom, in the press release as regards IDS, you talked about a favorable change in program mix contributing to the margins. I think that's the first time we've heard that in quite a while with regard to IDS. Can you just give a little bit more detail on the mix, where we stand today and how that's going to progress going forward? And what that means for margin? Thanks.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Well, for example, IDS, right now has a significant number of Patriot orders being accomplished in the factory. So we always talk about that \u2013 the lifecycle. When you get the orders in, you essentially reestablishing the factory line and moving forward, but right now, that factory line has been reestablished and has been very productive. And that's what you're seeing in terms of that flowing down to the improvement in the margins on that.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","And Tom or David, I'd just add the following from a big Patriot point of view with IDS. A lot of talk about their margins over the last couple years. I think as we closed out the back half of 2016, we saw the margins improving there as we had indicated they would. They are off to a solid start this year with regard to their Q1 margin. The rate they achieved in the quarter is just below the guidance for the year and they had strong sales. The margin \u2013 they did exceed in Q1, exceeded our expectations, primarily due to the earlier timing on some program improvements partly related to the mix.","And when we look at the full year, at IDS, we expect to see margins improve a bit more because of the mix that you referred to and increased productivity. Recall as well that, in 2016, IDS did have the exit from the business venture. So when you look at IDS, excluding the impact, we would expect to see about 100 basis points of margin expansion that's reflected in our guidance for the year compared to last year normalized for the business exit. And we're pleased with the track that the business is on.","Operator","And your next question \u2013 it comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please proceed.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Rob.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Hi, Rob.","Robert Stallard - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Tom, in your prepared comments, you had mentioned Forcepoint. So I was wondering what your perspectives are on the progress that business is making and whether you've had any indications from your partner that they may be looking to sell out.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","First of all, we are pleased with the performance of Forcepoint, I mean double-digit operating margins. Their growth was in line with our expectations. In fact, if you remove the web's filtering part of the business, which we're exiting, they achieved about 9% year-over-year growth. So, they're meeting our expectations. Because of some of the growth of that business, we are making some investments this year in terms of their infrastructure to be able to support an additional growth in the out-years. So bottom-line is that we're overall very happy with Forcepoint.","We are seeing significant demand signal that's coming in that we've been preparing for, for the last two years. And that's in the area of insider threat, especially from the large and very large enterprises. And so we're very excited about that market, because we think we are the number one provider of solutions in the area of insider threat and data loss prevention. So, that's extremely good news for Forcepoint moving forward. Based on your other question relative to our partners, to-date our partners have not indicated any position relative to doing a put, for example, to exit the joint venture.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. And I think, Rob, just to kind of maybe complete and pile on a little bit what Tom said. From a margin perspective, the quarter was a little ahead of our expectations. It was at the high-end of our guidance for the year. One thing I would say the Q2 margin we do expect it to be down slightly from Q1, probably in the mid-single-digits, driven by a combination of some seasonality as well as, as I referred to in my opening comments, the timing of the investment that we see at the business there. So, I think that kind of sums up Forcepoint.","Operator","And your next question \u2013 it comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Sam.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Tom, this is very helpful to beginning and talking about all of your sea and subsea business. But is there any way you can just put it all together and just tell us, I mean, what is the size of your business for the U.S. Navy and then if you can help us think about the timing as there has been a lot of discussion about more ships? And if we were to increase the rate of say destroyers, when does that actually affect you and when do you start to see that pick up?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, so real quick. I think a majority of our naval business \u2013 and I am going to just talk about the surface and undersea. Obviously, in the air part of the Navy, we have quite a bit of business relative to our solutions that we have on F-18s and other aircraft like the E-2D. But on the surface and undersea, on the surface side, it's the \u2013 our bigger contribution there is in the radars, in terms of AMDR, Air and Missile Defense, radar and the EASR. That's essentially going to be the two major radars for the entire surface fleet. Same on the missiles, the standard missile family, the SM-2s, SM-3s, SM-6s, the Tomahawks, the Rolling Airframe Missiles, the Enhanced Seasparrow Missiles, essentially all the protection for the ships and their entire capability.","As you mentioned, there is a position on the Trump administration to increase the capability of the Navy. And there is the talks about increasing the number of ships from 275 to 355 ships. Obviously, if that happens, these systems I talked about are on those ships. We would see an uptick relative to requirements in demand signals for both the radars and the missiles if that went forward (31:48). In terms of total dollars...","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. Last year, Sam, our Navy business in total was about 18% of our total revenue.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Operator","And your next question \u2013 it comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, Tom and Toby.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, Toby, maybe this is just kind of a housekeeping one. But there was \u2013 in the backlog there was about a $1 billion adjustment in Missile Systems. Could you provide a little more color on what that was?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. So, I mean, it just effectively mapped, right, the relationship of their bookings in the quarter to the sales that they generated, nothing out of line there. At a total company level, as we indicated, the bookings in the quarter exceeded our expectations. But if you peel that back, Missiles' bookings were roughly that order of magnitude below their sales in the quarter. But for the total year, we expect them to be on track and have a slight increase on a year-over-year basis with their backlog. And just as a remainder, they've had some strong bookings over the last couple of years. Their book-to-bill, I think, last year was about 1.13, so nothing out of the norm there. Just the burn-off of revenue and lower than what they had been experienced \u2013 level of bookings, but nothing to be concerned about.","Operator","And your next question \u2013 it comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Myles.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","In the release, in SAS, I think one of the biggest areas \u2013 product lines where you saw pickup in bookings was in AESA radars for Air Force, and I imagine that's F-15 but you can correct me if I'm wrong. And I was hoping though in terms of the real question is give us some clarity on where the Air Force is with their F-16 AESA strategy, kind of where you sit, where the competition between yourselves and Northrop are, and kind of timeline. And if you can give us some color there, that'd be great. Thanks.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. So, right now \u2013 and you're absolutely correct. That was an uptick in SAS relative to the F-15s and putting the AESA radars on the F-15. So right now, that's what we're pursuing moving forward is both the F-15s and the F-18s in terms of the AESA radars both domestically and internationally. Some of the uptick on the F-15 is due to the proposed buy in Qatar for the F-15s. And so we are obviously supporting that.","One of the things that I'd also like to bring up in terms of Qatar and the F-15 buy is this is the first buy for Qatar for, I would call it, a U.S. fighter aircraft. And so along with that comes the whole support for all of the missiles that the F-15 uses. So not only do we get an uptick on the radars, but we also get a significant uptick in establishing a weapons program for Qatar to support the F-15 system.","Operator","And your next question \u2013 it comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Seth.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Tom, some \u2013 good morning. Tom, some of your peers this quarter have talked kind of broadly about the tradeoff going forward between growth and profitability and some of the competitions that they see out ahead maybe inhibiting margin expansion going forward, but would obviously be important to win. I wonder how you talk about \u2013 if you could talk about how you see that tradeoff for Raytheon going forward from here.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. Let me talk about that, because it's something that we discuss quite a bit in the company. And just like with our capital deployment, we take a balanced approach in terms of growth and profitability. The bottom line is we need both. We need both top-line growth and margin expansion. And so, we have the whole company focused on both of those elements.","On the growth side, I think you've seen what we've done here over the last several years, especially relative to our international expansion. It turns out that international also is our \u2013 a lot of our higher margin business is international.","So those two things, the growth in international business and the growth in margins goes hand-in-hand with that.","We also look domestically. We look to participate in growth in these new programs, especially ones that are, I would call it, new franchises, programs that have long legs that we can infuse technology in over the years to keep that franchise moving, but also has legs into the international market. And so for programs that have both a long lifecycle and also international, we do support ensuring that we make the right investments to go in those programs moving forward.","Operator","And your next question \u2013 it comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC","Thank you very much. Tom, possibly to follow up on the last question, one of the hotspots in the world is also air defense systems, as we've seen with Patriot in Australia and in other markets, and Qatar to some degree. Could you talk a little bit of how you manage risk and how you see other opportunities, especially with respect to there's more (37:41) in Australia and also upgrading of Patriot?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. Let me talk about that. We are, in terms of demand signals, we're getting demand signals from three different areas on our Integrated Air and Missile Defense Solutions. First is Europe and you've heard about the demand from Poland. There is two other countries in Europe that are seriously considering a Patriot buy that we are working.","Once we move into the MENA region, obviously, we're completing work with the Qatar on the Patriot, but also the early warning radar to Integrated Air and Missile Defense type systems. But also, in Qatar, we're also doing something called an ADOC, Air Defense Operating Center (sic) [Air and Missile Defense Operations Center] (38:21), which ties together all of the Integrated Air and Missile Defense capabilities of that nation. And it's also a new product line for us that we will be taking into the rest of the MENA region and also back into Europe.","And as I \u2013 and the next region I'm going to talk about is the Asia-Pacific region. Now, obviously with the North Korean threat there's been a significant uptick in demand signal from multiple countries, obviously, South Korea, Japan and then to a certain degree Taiwan, Taiwan for a little bit of a different reason with another country. But, in any case, it's all about Integrated Air and Missile Defense. It's all about protecting the sovereignty of these nations and keeping their citizens safe. And the Integrated Air and Missile Defense Solutions that we have do that.","Operator","And your next question \u2013 it comes from the line of Finbar Sheehy with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.","Finbar Thomas Sheehy - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Finbar Thomas Sheehy - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Maybe we could talk about capital deployment just for a moment. You've said you're going to be buying back \u2013 retiring debt. You've talked about plans to buy back stock and you are raising the dividend. Can you talk to us about how you think about the tradeoff between in particular retiring debt versus returning cash to shareholders, especially given that your top-line is growing, which presumably would allow you to carry the debt?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. So, let me hit that a couple ways. I think given everything that you just laid out, what I think is important we're going forward with the early retirement of debt under our balanced capital deployment. And that still assumes, which has been our stated objective now for a couple of years of returning about 80% of free cash flow to shareholders. And I think in my opening comments I reaffirmed that. We did buy back the $400 million of stock in the first quarter. We're on track to reduce the shares outstanding by about 2% at the midpoint of our range.","And as Tom mentioned in his comments, for the 13th year in a row, we raised our dividend this year by 8.9%. As it relates to the retirement of debt, the debt that we're retiring is out there at about 6.5%. We're going to finance that, if you will, with a combination of cash on hand and commercial paper and rates on CP around 1%. And we're doing this because this approach allows us to do a couple things, lower interest expense, clearly maintain our financial flexibility, especially ahead of potential tax reform and what that could mean for us.","I think, overall, more importantly, it doesn't change our philosophy around our balanced capital deployment, including the 80% of free cash going back to shareholders. And it also does not reflect the change in the view of how we view our balance sheet, which, as I mentioned earlier, remains very strong and gives us flexibility.","Operator","And your next question \u2013 it comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Yeah. Good morning, guys.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Pete.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey, Tom. On Patriot, I was just wondering on the Poland one, the schedule and the sizing. When you say up to $5 billion to Raytheon, how many barriers does that include and is there kind of optionality built into that contract? And you mentioned the other two European opportunities, I'm pretty sure Romania is one of them. I was wondering if could size those other two opportunities as well.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. Let me talk about the Poland Patriot first. So, right now, it's going on as Poland has submitted an LOR for something called LOA. It's essentially to get approval for to buy the Patriot system. That is going through a negotiation process with the U.S. government. But in case of the total impact to Raytheon, it's north of $4 billion. And then it also adds another member to the Patriot family. So it takes us to 14 countries that have Patriot, which is \u2013 actually is good for us in terms of expanding the Patriot market.","The other element is you mentioned other countries. I'm not going to name any other countries, but there is two other countries that are working through a process to acquire a Patriot also. And we are obviously working with the U.S. government to ensure that we can expedite those as fast as possible.","Operator","And your next question \u2013 it comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yes. Just a comment I see it put in funded backlog. I assume that will be in the Q, Toby?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. I can give you that, George. Funded backlog at the end of Q1 was $24.6 billion. That's about 68% of our total backlog. And that's in the range that we typically see it out. It typically runs 60% to 70% of total. The reason we didn't put it in, as I mentioned earlier, we did adopt a new revenue recognition standard in Q1. And we've adjusted our reporting, including around backlog, to align with the new standard. But we're still tracking it and we'll provide it, if folks are interested.","Operator","And your next question \u2013 it comes from the line of Matt McConnell with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Matt.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Matthew McConnell - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Could you help me understand what drove the working capital build in the quarter? And one of your defense peers also had a little bit larger of a build here in 1Q. So is that something structurally you're seeing or what's the timing of working that down over the remainder of the year?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. Yeah. Let me kind of hit that from two or three different angles here to make sure I give it the right context. So, obviously with the guidance we'd given in January of zero to $100 million, we were expecting our overall operating cash flow to be relatively low \u2013 lower than last year. And that was all driven by the cadence around the working capital.","For one thing, recall, we really exceeded our cash flow expectations for 2016 by about $300 million, which otherwise, from a timing point of view, all tied to collections, would have been beneficial to Q1. And we'll always take the cash earlier, right? So we saw what was lining up here for the quarter. It really is all due to the timing of collections that are tied to the timing of pre-determined or negotiated contract milestones with each of our particular contracts. And also, we're continuing to grow and we're ramping up to support some of that growth.","If you want to think of it from a total year point of view, I'd expect that to continue to build over the next couple quarters into Q2 and Q3 and then we would come back down in the fourth quarter. And, again, to try to help you size that a little bit, we will come back down, it will below the levels we're at for \u2013 somewhere between the levels we're at at Q1 and where we were at the end of 2016. And, again, really tied primarily to the timing of payments related to executing contract milestones. From a \u2013 translate that to cash flow, I'll just throw in there, for Q2, we expect cash flow \u2013 strong cash flow, operating cash flow above $700 million. And as we said earlier, we feel confident in the total year outlook of the $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion.","Operator","And your next question \u2013 it comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Kristine Tan Liwag - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. This is Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","We can't hear you. Can you speak up a little bit, please?","Kristine Tan Liwag - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. It's Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron. There was a slight uptick in receivables sequentially. Has there been any changes in payment terms from international customers, particularly in the Middle East?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","No. We've seen pretty consistent terms here for the last year or two and from a terms' point of view not seen anything different.","Kristine Tan Liwag - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And also, maybe a different question, there has been discussion of a possible safe zone or a no fly zone in Syria. If we move towards this direction, can you discuss opportunities you would expect to see?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","I think the tempo in Syria is pretty up right now. And we are seeing significant demand signaled to provide solutions and keep up with the replenishment requirements. So I think that's about it.","Operator","And your next question \u2013 it comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse","Good morning. I wanted to ask two quick things. Toby, first of all, if you could just give us the cadence for the free cash flow for the rest of the year. And then I had a question on GBSD, Tom. And with this major program and the primes getting set up for that, how are your teamed and what kind of capabilities will you offer?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. Rob, obviously, I'll take the first one. As I just said, we're confident in our outlook for the cash flow for the year. We do expect to see about $700 million in Q2 with the rest of the year playing out or following a cadence that is roughly in line with prior years but with the majority of the cash flow weighted in the second half and even then more into Q4 driven by the program milestones and deliveries that I just referred to.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","On your second question, the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, or as you said, the GBSD program, it will replace the Minuteman III missiles and the associated command and control systems and that goes all the way out to about 2028. And the program is structured right now so that there will be a risk reduction contract, two primes, and that's going to be expected sometime here in 2017, then followed by a final down select to a single prime in 2020. Right now, our strategy is we are engaging with multiple teams and seeing where our best solution is relative to being able to make one of these primes a winner. And so we're working through that process right now (49:30) to find who will be the person, or the company we'll be working with.","Operator","And your next question \u2013 it comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Jason.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I just wanted to chat briefly about \u2013 have you chat briefly about the international contracting environment, kind of what you've experienced over the last couple of years, what you're experiencing today and kind of what you expect going forward, particularly focused on the contract vehicles or the contract types. And maybe give us a sense of the mix with regard to firm fixed price contracts, particularly on the development side.","As you're probably well aware, we've had some of your competitors that have been struggling of late with some fixed price development contracts. So, I think it would be helpful for us to all get a sense of where you sit today with regard to international, and from fixed price development contracts, what percentage of your backlog, which is at about 40% international, is from fixed price development and how you guys are working your way through that. Thanks.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. Let me take that on, because some of your question was philosophy and some of your questions, I think, were percentages. So, first of all, we've been operating in the countries we're operating today in some cases for over 51 years and our overall type of contracts that we have break down into two parts. First of all, one is, some of them are foreign military sales and the other ones are direct commercial sales. And the foreign military sales \u2013 we treat that just like we treat all our domestic type contracts, because the terms and conditions essentially are the same as we deal with any domestic program.","So, that takes us to the direct commercial sales. So on the direct commercial sales, we have a mix of essentially all the contracts. The majority of them are firm fixed price and majority of them are production type deliveries. So we are going back to the factory, the same factory line that we build our domestic products on and we're essentially just delivering product out of those production lines to these international customers. Some cases customers do have a request for some modification, something that's unique. For example, on the Patriot system, sometimes they want a different truck by a different manufacturer. And in that case there, we do the work that is \u2013 puts the gear on the different trucks.","It's a usually fairly low risk. We've done it multiple times. And so, we have the playbook and we do very well on those programs. There are some other programs out there that we have which are, I would call, more on the development side. When we approach those, we do it from a risk position. We ensure we understand the risks. We try to quantify them and we work to essentially minimize any downside on those contracts. And they are \u2013 we monitor them on a very frequent basis.","Operator","And your next question \u2013 it comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Noah.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Just wanted to go back to this working capital topic, because I thought you guys have been talking about a few hundred million dollar improvement in working capital pretty recently for the year. And it sounds like you're now saying actually maybe a few hundred million dollar use. So, it seems like a pretty big reversal. Do I have that correct? And is it a commentary on being able to find improvements or is it a commentary on your growth profile changing since you last saw that (53:37)?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. So again the profile \u2013 as I just described a little bit a while ago, not anything really new than what we were counting on. By year-end, as I said, the absolute balances from where they are here in Q1, they will be lower, okay. But part of it is \u2013 a little bit of it is the growth aspect of it and the growth profile. And we're going to continue to work to drive down working capital. There is always kind of the things that fall December versus January. So there are some opportunities that we're working on that we're looking at that could potentially get accelerated into 2017 and provide a better outlook, similar to what happened at the end of 2016.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But, Toby, do I have it correct that you were previously saying working capital would be $100 million plus source of cash?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. I think when you go \u2013 if you go back to the outlook for January \u2013 and I know we gave a range right for just using cash as a surrogate for the working capital to $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion. What we were saying is that when you normalize for the discretionary contribution that we made last year, free cash last year would have been \u2013 I'm sorry, operating cash last year would have been $3.4 billion. The decrease this year was driven by the net pension effect of higher required contributions. And we said that we thought working capital could be flattish to maybe nominally favorable. And we still could end up in that range there, but because of the growth that is maybe a little bit more pressure. But you're thinking of it relatively correctly.","Operator","And your next question \u2013 it comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yeah. Tom, I just wanted to look at Forcepoint a little bit. I mean the last quarter really organic growth that we had was the third quarter. The fourth quarter was week. This quarter is weak. And obviously that reflect your comment that you'd start investing in the fourth quarter. So my question is what technology \u2013 or what happened to slow the organic growth? You must have lost to a competitor and now you're figuring out how to fix it with more investment. If you could just provide a little more color on that. Thanks.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","No. I'll hit first and then Toby can come in with some more detail. So, first of all, the year-over-year growth was about 4%. But if you take away the web filtering which we are exiting, the year-over-year growth is 9%. And what we're doing now is we're trying to drive that growth into double-digit margins. One of the areas in terms of that was to support the infrastructure. So there is an investment this year on that infrastructure and also in some enhancements to a couple of products.","The one product that we're getting significant demand signal from is our insider threat data loss prevention software capability. And so \u2013 and it's really relative to a draw from the VLEs and LEs. And that's kind of the overall picture how I look at Forcepoint. I believe they have significant upside potential. We're driving that potential and we're making the right investments this year to go get there.","Todd Ernst - Raytheon Co.","Okay. Great. All right. That's all we have time for today.

My name is Quentin, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.","And now, I turn the call over to Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Todd B. Ernst","Thank you, Quentin. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our fourth quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.","With me today are Bill Swanson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Tom Kennedy, our Chief Operating Officer; and Dave Wajsgras, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Bill and Dave, and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.","William H. Swanson","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon continued to perform well in the fourth quarter, as we did all year. I'm particularly pleased with our performance, given we operated under a government shutdown in October, sequestration and continuing resolutions at the start and end of the year.","In the quarter, we delivered strong margins, earnings and cash flow, driven by solid execution. Bookings were good in the fourth quarter at $7.5 billion, which resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.28. For the year, our margins, EPS and cash flow were all up, while sales were down slightly. Said another way, we had good performance in a challenging environment. Looking forward, we're expecting solid performance in 2014, and Dave will walk you through our guidance in a moment.","As expected, our international business continues to be a significant driver of our results. In the quarter, international sales were 29% of the total sales and 43% of total bookings. Notably, we booked several key international awards in the quarter: A ground-based air defense system for Oman, for $1.28 billion; $500 million for tactical radar systems for international customers; and $100 million for international classified cyber.","For the full year, international sales represented 27% of total sales and grew by 3%. Our international bookings increased by 10%, a result of our strategic focus on global markets. In November, I visited several of our customers in the Mideast, and we continue to make considerable progress on some of the larger opportunities in the region. For example, Kuwait signed an LOA for Patriot in December. The U.S. Army now has it, and we expect to have a completed agreement by the end of February.","We also made significant progress on Qatar Patriot, which is the first step in a multi-year, multi-billion dollar opportunity for the company. Qatar has the LOA, and we're expecting their leadership to sign an agreement for Patriot portion any day now. Then it will go to the Army for final approval, and we expect an award exceeding $2 billion in the first half of the year. We feel good about the bookings outlook in 2014 and expect total bookings of $23.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million. International bookings are expected to be in the 35% to 40% of total bookings. We expect international sales to be around 30% of total sales.","Domestically, we continue to see strong interest in our portfolio of advanced technologies, and we received several notable awards in the quarter, including TPY-2 radar 12 and 2 competitive wins, the Global ASNT communications system and the Air and Missile Defense Radar or AMDR for short. We weren't immune to the effects of the Budget Control Act in 2013, but the good news is that in December, a budget deal was reached, which provides a stable budget for 2 years, giving the DoD and industry some much-needed clarity. Hopefully, there'll be no more continuing resolutions and shutdowns.","After the close of the quarter, we received some more good news: Protests on 2 of our competitive wins, the Next Generation Jammer and AMDR, were favorably resolved. And as I noted on previous calls, these are important development programs that will provide long-term growth opportunities for the company and also reflect our strong position in future markets, both domestically and internationally.","Looking back at 2013, I'm really proud of what the Raytheon team was able to accomplish. We continue to meet our customers' needs in a challenging environment. We successfully consolidated Raytheon's businesses from 6 to 4 and in record time, and we continued to reduce our costs. I'm also proud that Raytheon was the only AMD company recognized in the Civic 50 for the second consecutive year as one of America's most community-minded companies. The Civic 50 identifies and recognizes companies for their commitment to improve the quality of life in the communities where they do business. So in summary, as I look across the company, our performance continues to be solid, our strategy continues to create value, our culture is stronger than ever and the company is well-positioned and prepared for the future.","I also want to take the time to thank the Raytheon team for its focus and dedication throughout the year. I would also like to thank our supply chain partners for their support. As you all know, I announced my intention to step down as Raytheon's CEO, and the board appointed Tom Kennedy to be CEO, and Tom is on the call with us today. We started the transition, and we're both excited for the company's future. Most of you know Tom and the excellent job he's done as COO, leading our business consolidation that enhances productivity, agility and affordability. His experience as a proven leader with a broad understanding of key technologies, a key -- keen customer focus and a deep knowledge of our business makes him the ideal CEO to take the company forward. I look forward to continuing to serve as Chairman of the Board and working with Tom to ensure a smooth transition.","With that, let me turn it over to Dave.","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and full year results, then I'll discuss our outlook for 2014 and after that, we'll open up the call to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on our website.","If everyone could please move to Page 3. We delivered solid results in both the quarter and the full year. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.58. For the full year, adjusted EPS of $6.38 was up 1.6%. Our sales for the quarter were $5.9 billion and $23.7 billion for the year, consistent with the guidance range we presented in October. We also generated strong operating cash flow of $1.1 billion for the quarter and $2.4 billion for the year. Our focus on cash cycle productivity continues to drive results.","I'd like to point out that we made a discretionary contribution of $300 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Even with this pension contribution, we still achieved the high end of our prior cash flow guidance. Additionally, during the quarter, the company repurchased 4.7 million shares of common stock for $400 million, bringing the full year 2013 repurchases to 15.2 million shares for about $1.1 billion. The company ended the year with a strong balance sheet and net debt of $437 million. As we previously disclosed in the fourth quarter 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion of the company's outstanding common stock.","Turning now to Page 4. Let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. We had solid bookings of $7.5 billion in the quarter and $22.1 billion for the full year, resulting in a year-end backlog of $33.7 billion. Our book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.28, and the company ended 2013 with a funded backlog of about $23 billion. For the quarter, international orders represented 43% of our total company bookings, and for the full year was 30% of total bookings. At the end of 2013, approximately 37% of our total backlog was international.","In the fourth quarter, significant international awards included $1.3 billion at IDS on a ground-based air defense system and $566 million at SAS on tactical airborne system upgrades for international customers. Other significant bookings included $393 million at IDS for AMDR; $173 million for a TPY-2 radar for the Missile Defense Agency; and $585 million at IIS on a number of classified programs, including $100 million for international cyber. Missile Systems booked $189 million for the evolved Sea Sparrow missile and $177 million for the Phalanx Weapon Systems for the U.S. Navy and international customers. Missiles also booked $172 million for Paveway for the U.S. Air Force and international customers.","If you'd move to Page 5, we had fourth quarter sales of $5.9 billion, down 9%. As I mentioned earlier, sales were consistent with our expectations. It's worth noting that fourth quarter sales reflect the impact from the timing of international awards, some of which were received late in the quarter. Looking at the businesses. Net sales at IDS were $1.6 billion in the quarter. Compared to last year's fourth quarter, the change was primarily due to an international Patriot program nearing completion and lower volume on a tactical radar program. IIS net sales of $1.5 billion in the quarter were down from the same period last year, primarily due to lower volume on training and some of our classified programs.","Missile Systems had fourth quarter 2013 net sales of $1.6 billion, down compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. The change was primarily due to lower sales on U.S. Army sensor programs. And SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion in Q4, lower than the comparable period last year, primarily due to reduced volume on some of our ISR and classified programs. For the year, sales were $23.7 billion, down 2.9%. A decline in domestic sales was primarily -- was partially offset by a little more than 3% growth in our international sales.","Moving ahead to Page 6. We delivered solid operational performance in the quarter and for the full year. Looking at business margins in the quarter, all were essentially in line or better than last year, as the IDS, IIS and SAS margins all exceeded the range that we have provided back in October. Missile Systems fourth quarter margin did come in below our expectations, driven by mix, a small loss on the disposal of a non-core manufacturing facility, as well as an investment in the development of a new wafer-level packaging technology. Overall, our adjusted margins were up 30 basis points in the quarter.","As I stand back and look at full year 2013, we again delivered strong margins. Our adjusted margin increased 10 basis points, driven by solid execution, favorable mix and meaningful contribution from our ongoing productivity efforts, including the business consolidation and the successful implementation of Global Business Services.","On Page 7, you'll see both the fourth quarter and full year adjusted EPS. In the fourth quarter 2013, our adjusted EPS was $1.58, and for the full year was $6.38 compared with $6.28 in 2012, an increase of 1.6%. The increase for the full year was driven by capital deployment actions, specifically share repurchases, and by strong execution, partially offset by lower volume. As I previously mentioned, the company generated strong operating cash flow of $2.4 billion in 2013.","So moving ahead to our 2014 guidance, which you'll find on Page 8. We see sales in the range of between $22.5 billion and $23 billion, down 3% to 5% from 2013, driven by our domestic business, which is partially offset by the growth in our international business. As for pension, we see the FAS\/CAS adjustment at a positive $346 million, which reflects our investment returns in 2013 of over 15% on our U.S. pension assets and the December 31 discount rate of 5.1%. We expect net interest expense to be between $200 million and $210 million. We see our average diluted shares outstanding to be between 312 million and 314 million on a full year basis, a 3% year-over-year reduction at the midpoint of the range.","As for our effective tax rate, we expect it to be approximately 28.5%. Our 2014 effective tax rate guidance is lower than 2013 due to an international cash management initiative, which was executed in January, bringing cash back to the United States. This action impacted the full year tax rate by just under 3 percentage points and is worth approximately $0.26 per share. I should also point out that we haven't included the possible extension of the R&D tax credit in 2014 guidance. If the legislation passes, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 100 basis points and our EPS by about $0.10. In 2014, we see our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.76 to $5.91. In addition to the FAS\/CAS adjustment, this also excludes the $0.26 impact that I just mentioned. We see 2014 EPS to be in the range of $6.74 to $6.89. Our operating cash flow guidance is between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion.","Moving ahead to Page 9. Here, we provided our initial 2014 guidance by business. We expect 2014 adjusted margins to continue to be solid and in the 12.6% to 12.8% range. This includes 20 basis points of expected cost to support productivity and efficiency initiatives, including real estate utilization improvements through facility consolidations, as well as investments to support the continuing evolution of our advanced technologies to maintain our competitive edge, which has been a focus area in the past and will continue to be so in the future. Further, our margins for 2014 will be impacted by a change in program mix, both from an international and domestic perspective.","We're continuing to focus on reducing our cost structure. In 2013, we consolidated several facilities, reducing our square footage by about 3% or approximately 1 million square feet. Looking forward, we're targeting a square footage reduction of approximately 10% over the next 3 to 4 years, which should yield considerable efficiencies and further support our customers' affordability objectives.","If you'd now turn to Page 10, we provided you with our 2014 outlook by quarter. You'll notice that sales ramp up throughout the year. In the first half of 2014, sales are expected to be down in the mid- to high-single digits on a tough comp. You may recall that in the first half of last year, we received some quick-turned book-and-bill business. The back half sales for 2014 are expected to be in line to slightly up when you're comparing to the same period in 2013. And if you compare second half sales to first half sales, we expect to see mid-single-digit growth. The improvement in the back half was driven by the timing of international awards, which we received in late 2013 and expect in the first half of 2014. It's worth noting that the sales cadence in 2014 is consistent with what the company saw in 2011 and 2012.","Finally, on Page 11. As we've done in the past, we've provided a summary of the financial impact from pensions in 2013, as well as the projected impact for 2014 through '16, holding all assumptions constant. Let me conclude by saying that in 2013, Raytheon delivered solid operating performance. By focusing on program execution and structural cost improvements, our margins, earnings and operating cash flow were all ahead of expectations. Our international business continues to grow. We have a strong balance sheet and net debt of less than $450 million. This gives us real flexibility and options to continue to drive shareholder value. We continue to find new ways to apply our world-class technologies to deliver meaningful and differentiated value to our customers, improve efficiency and drive productivity.","Before concluding, I'd like to offer my personal thanks to Bill. Your leadership has transformed this company, and you are handing off a strong, well-managed organization. I know I speak for the rest of the employees by saying thank you for your leadership, vision and all the contributions you've made over your 42 years of service to help make this company a success for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. I look forward to continuing to work with you in your role as Chairman.","I would also like to personally congratulate Tom. I've had the pleasure of working closely with Tom over the past 8 years, and especially, since he became COO this past spring. With his 30 years of experience, Tom knows this company from top to bottom and has demonstrated strong leadership throughout his career. So Tom, I, and the rest of the team, are looking forward to working with you and building on our strong foundation under your leadership.","So with that, we'll open the call up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein of Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Bill, we're not going to ask about succession today.","David C. Wajsgras","Well, you can go ahead now.","William H. Swanson","I can probably give you a definitive answer now.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'm sure. Well, congratulations. Can I just ask a question? If I just take some of the numbers you gave us for the domestic and international, it would seem to imply that domestic is probably down 8% this year and international gets 6% growth. And given that first half, second half dynamic you just talked about, should that growth continue into next year? I mean, is the midpoint of this year where you feel like we start to hit bottom in a cycle?","David C. Wajsgras","So Sam, why don't I start with that, and maybe Bill or Tom want to add a little bit of color. So we expect domestic on a full year basis to be down in the mid-single-digit range. And we see our international business, again for the year, growing in the low- to mid-single-digit range. And to use a phrase that Bill has used in the past, '14 does look a lot like '13 from a sales profile standpoint.","William H. Swanson","Yes. And I would add that I think we've always said that we look at '14 in part of '15 being a transition year. And if you look at '16 and look at the numbers, there's actually -- it ticks up even under sequestration. So for us, this feels like what we've been talking about and the international awards that I highlighted and some of the ones we're expecting to come in really are a nice transition for us as we go through this change in budget, if that helps.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And Dave, if I can just follow up, is there a cash effect from this tax benefit in the first quarter? Because just looking at the quarterly run rate, it did look like it was heavy in the EPS, which I guess is the tax benefit. But is there a cash effect as well?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes, there is. It's about $75 million or $80 million.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Bill, you've come a long way from -- since the NCS problem programs. It's a much more pleasant call these days.","William H. Swanson","That was about 10 years ago, and I remember it vividly.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, me too. Can you highlight how much of that second half growth is dependent on signing the international contracts in this first half of the year? Obviously, they have a tendency of slipping a little bit, so I just want to make sure we're not counting on too much.","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. So we feel confident in how we have guided for the year, both first half and second half. You'll recall that a number of these larger programs we started talking about mid last year. Bill just put a lot color around where the more significant ones stand. So from our perspective, I would say that it wouldn't be a stretch to say that we're highly confident with our second half performance relative to what I just said in my formal remarks.","William H. Swanson","Yes. And I would just add a little color. The Oman program has started from the point of having a contract. Kuwait, I mentioned, it's all -- everything's done in country. It's back on this side of the pond now for us to take care of. And when you look at Qatar, clearly, that's been through all the processes and just waiting for the final signature over there. So I think Dave said it well. We're confident what the front-end looks like. And once a few more stages are taking place, we might even spend some of our own money to get an early jump on this to make sure we get it nailed correctly.","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. You should also keep in mind that we factor these pretty heavily when we talk about the bookings outlook for the year, and that's certainly taken into account here. So if you look at what had actually taken place in the fourth quarter with a book-to-bill of just under 1.3, we also see strength in the first half of the year. I'll repeat what I just said, on a full year basis, we have a lot of confidence in the guidance and certainly, in the second half.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then just one cleanup one was on SAS, anything in particular in terms of timing in the quarter? And was it just a push out into '14 in terms of the sales for the fourth quarter?","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. From a sales standpoint for SAS, we do see 2014 declining in the mid-single digits, which is driven by lower funding levels on some of the various classified programs, as well as some of the airborne radar and EW systems. You also know that -- and we talked about this in the past, it was scheduled completion on some of the international tactical airborne radars. Now with all of that said, we do see a ramp in the second half of SAS similar to what I just said about the company as a whole. And we continue to have a lot of confidence in that business. It's probably worth mentioning as well, the margin performance in Q4 for SAS was very strong. They were able to pull some productivity initiatives forward into the fourth quarter that we had initially anticipated in the first half of 2014.","William H. Swanson","And I would add just a little bit, Dave, they can now start on Next Generation Jammer. We were delayed for about 6 months there because of the protests, and RACR will be starting up, so that will give them a nice ramp-up here.","Operator","The next question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So congratulations, Bill, and everybody.","William H. Swanson","Thank you.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So at a high level, I mean, I guess there was a lot of concern with maybe some of the changing political perceptions in the Middle East that you guys, in particular, would see some pressure on international sales in the region. So I guess my question is, if we back up, have you seen a changing dynamic in the competitive landscape in international markets, maybe particularly in the Middle East, but just more broadly speaking? As kind of everybody has been trying to dive into international markets and it's been a focus for -- your competitors are putting together international units and that sort of thing so.","William H. Swanson","Yes. I mean, what I would do is remind everybody back to about 8 or 9 years ago when, I guess, we were talking about international. It's not something you can flip a switch and turn on a light and have it instantaneously happen. So I appreciate people starting organizations and putting things in place, but it takes a while to establish your credibility internationally. And our customers really count on the fact that, I mean, we've been in the Mideast 50 years, Japan 50 years, Taiwan 50 years, Korea. I mean, these are the sort of things we've done for a long time, and your performance over that period really helps you capture new business. And it's, to me, it's all about relationships and trust, and that does not happen overnight. To your question in the Mideast, clearly, the region needs the kind of products and services that we as a company have in our portfolio, and I was over there in December and Tom was over there just recently. I think both of us would say the same thing, that there hasn't been any kind of turndown whatsoever in what we're doing in the region. In fact, we find the opposite is true that they're counting on us to do more to help them as they worry about their own national security. So I know what's written in the papers, but to me, first-hand knowledge is really important, and that's why we go over there to interface with people that we've been doing work with for a long, long time.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right, that's good to know.","William H. Swanson","If that helps.","Ronald J. Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, for sure. And just a follow-on. When we think about where maybe some of the next emerging opportunities are for Raytheon internationally, where would that be?","William H. Swanson","Well, for us, the Mideast is still strong. I mean, we have 2 new customers in Oman and Qatar that haven't been in our portfolio before. Those programs took a few years to get over the goal line, and we intend to do more with them and we can offer more to help provide for the security of their countries. So the Mideast is strong. Asia is still strong, whether it's South Korea, Taiwan or Japan or that part of the region. Clearly, Australia and Europe, in my opinion, not now, but in the future, 2, 3 years from now, Europe is going to have to upgrade what they have. They haven't spent money. They've kind of made things do and in my opinion, they're going to have to upgrade what they have, and we'll see that as an opportunity because we've been there for a number of years. As a company, we sell in 80 countries around the world. And one of the things I'm proud of when I travel, and I know Tom feels the same way, is that we never have to talk about our performance, it's a given. So we start really with more what capabilities can we help you with as we go in there.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol of JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Bill, it's been wonderful working with you and wish you all the best.","William H. Swanson","Thank you, Joe.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, onto the business. I thought I heard you guys imply earlier that you're looking at 2014 and 2015 both as transition years or -- I interpreted that as down years for domestic, with then potentially growth reemerging in '16. Is that a fair characterization of the way you're looking at this?","William H. Swanson","Yes, Joe, I would say it is. When you look at the budget process, even with sequestration and the Budget Control Act, '16 was always the year that there was an uptick where it started to come back again. And even when you look at it '17 and on, the budgets start to increase. The other thing is, as the economy gets going, that'll take part of the pressure off too. But we've always viewed that as the transition. You got it right.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the international front. I heard what you said so far, and we can do the math on the 2 deals that you're waiting for here near term. But when you look at the $8.8 billion that you're expecting this year in bookings, roughly internationally, what are the other key deals that we can kind of hone in on as we look in -- particularly into the second half of the year?","William H. Swanson","Yes, we feel good about it with that. Let me turn it over to Tom. He just came back from a trip, so he can add some color.","Thomas A. Kennedy","Yes, I just made \u2013 just back from the Middle East, I did have the opportunity to do the ceremony signing for the Oman deal. And as Bill mentioned before, Oman is a new country for us, and we see additional opportunities in Oman over the next 5 years. Also, the big one Bill mentioned was Qatar. It turns out there will also be a second award towards the end of the year from Qatar. This is for air defense operating center. We also -- Bill did mention the Patriot Kuwait fire units. That is very close to being awarded by the U.S. Army. We're expecting that towards the end of February, beginning of March. There's other Patriot activities between $1 billion to $2 billion coming up more towards the back end of the year. We also have a big opportunity relative to TOW international, and this is for the next -- this year. It's about between $600 million and $700 million. And overall, there's another overall missile, it's about $1.2 billion throughout the year. And then the other major activities, is coming out of SAS is tactical airborne radars and electronic warfare, approximately $600 million. And then we have, as you know, a significant training in O&M activities internationally, and that's about $700 million. And then there's a miscellaneous of about another $1.5 billion, and that's across our special mission aircraft, battlefield radars, air-traffic control, ground sensor systems and also airborne ISR, that kind of wraps it up.","Operator","It comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Bill, maybe for the last time, I was wondering if you could give us maybe your thoughts on maybe the general defense industry. Now that we have some stability in the U.S. defense budget for the next couple of years, do you think we'll see some pickup in M&A and would you, Raytheon, be interested in getting involved?","William H. Swanson","I think right now, the mid and lower tiers are facing some pressure. I think some companies are having to decide what they're going to do if they can continue on the path they're on, which if they decide to do something different, will it involve M&A, and I think some are going to have to do it. I think from our standpoint, Dave said it best, I mean, we've got a balance sheet that's -- I like to say as pristine with a lot of firepower. So if there's opportunities for us to add to our portfolio that make sense, not just to buy something for revenue's sake, that never works, but where it fits in, especially in where we see future growth, then that would be the case. But I don't expect the company to be doing anything totally different from what we've done in the past. One of the things we tried to be -- somebody mentioned back to the 10 programs, 10 or 11 years ago, we tried to be transparent in what we do, and I don't expect that to change at all. Since you asked me to reflect, one thing that I would say that I am concerned about as we go through this budget process, we seem to be protecting personnel and readiness, which is okay. Those can be bought back very quickly, and I'm going to be working hard to make sure that on the R&D side that we don't take a lot of cuts in the budget there because, being an engineer, I know how long it takes for R&D to come to fruition. And we're always a country that has invested in our capability, in war-fighting capability. I know Raytheon, even in the tough times when we had $13 billion in debt, we still invested, and that's paying off in some of our wins as we look today, and we'll continue to invest as a company. But I think as a nation, as we look at the -- our investments, we've got to make sure that R&D is not sacrificed because you can't buy back that time that you lose.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And maybe just a quick one for Dave, of course, on pension and...","David C. Wajsgras","Of course, Rob. I was waiting, yes.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Maybe it's quite a simple question, but you showed the gross funding requirement for the next 3 years. Wouldn't it make more sense to use some of this cash on the balance sheet available today to kind of bring those future contributions down?","David C. Wajsgras","I'm sorry, Rob, I couldn't -- you were breaking up a little bit. Can you just repeat the question?","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, sorry. It was -- I asked if it would make more financial sense to use some of the cash on the balance sheet today rather than these gross funding requirements in the future.","David C. Wajsgras","To use some of the cash on the balance sheet today -- yes, yes. We made a discretionary \u2013 a small discretionary contribution in the fourth quarter. There's a number of considerations with the cash that we currently have on the balance sheet. And as we go forward in '14, I've already suggested that we'll once again have a very strong cash flow performance here of upwards of $2.5 billion. It's something we continue to consider. Historically, the discretionary contributions have been very good investments for the company at any way that you would want to analyze those investments. So it's certainly something we'd look at going forward. I want to be clear, none of that is contemplated as we sit here today. But if we do decide to go in that direction, we will certainly make that public in advance of what we're going to execute. There's different areas that we're thinking about investing in. Bill suggested that we are going to continue to look hard at M&A opportunities that are value-add to the company, both in the near and long term. We'll continue to look at the dividend, and we've said this publicly before. We believe that increasing the dividend over time is a very important economic signal to the investors relative to how we see our cash flow performance. The repurchase plan back in the fourth quarter, our Board of Directors approved a $2 billion authorization, which is not time-sensitive. In other words, we can use that over any period of time we would like. And I just suggested that the diluted share count for 2014 will be down about 3%, so we continue to see that as a value-creation opportunity for investors. So we're cognizant of our cash position. We feel good about the flexibility, and we have a lot of confidence that we'll be able to effectively drive value for our shareholders over time.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I was thinking, since you're a short-timer, maybe all my questions should go to Tom and Dave anyhow.","William H. Swanson","Take your best shot, Howard.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","There's no water in this one, Bill. First, something that goes back a little while, and I think you've talked about resolving it, was the British border authority. Where do you stand with that? And how close do you think you are to getting what you need back?","William H. Swanson","On e-Borders, we expect a decision in the first half of 2014. All the hearings were concluded late last year, and that's about the best color I can give right now, Howard, because I don't know any more than that.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","All right, that's fine. You spent a lot of time and effort on Patriot upgrades and some other things you've been doing. Tom, maybe for a moment you could talk a little bit more of how you've enhanced the system and sort of what does that leave in terms of -- I mean, at some point, it has to go back in and help the Army in a meaningful way, I would think.","Thomas A. Kennedy","So I think the big upgrade on Patriot came out of the U.A.E. program and was about over $400 million in nonrecurring, and nonrecurring is the dollars we use for development. Those changes are now in the Patriot system. They've been through complete testing with the U.S. Army. And so right now, in all our new offerings in the Middle East, we are providing this upgraded Patriot system and it's getting a lot of traction. The other area here is, there's 12 nations that have Patriot today. And so all those nations are now looking at upgrading their systems with all the capabilities that were added via the U.A.E. contract that we had.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then, last, Dave, if you I look at the math on the share repurchase, it appears as if you're going to scale it back a little bit relative to last year. Is that a pretty fair assumption?","David C. Wajsgras","That's a fair assumption, Howard, and I believe I mentioned that on either the second quarter or third quarter call last year. So it is scaled back somewhat, but it's still an important part of the overall capital deployment plan.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So it does sort of indicate that you're looking at finding other ways to -- or just more balance, I guess, might be a way of thinking about it going forward for growth.","David C. Wajsgras","That's a fair comment. We are balancing out the way we're looking at the various levers from a capital deployment standpoint. And we still believe that roughly a 3% reduction is -- will be viewed favorably. We still see Raytheon as a good investment or we wouldn't be repurchasing our shares. But again, there are a number of different areas to consider as we go forward in '14.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Congratulations again, Bill. A job well done over the years. It's always been fun.","William H. Swanson","Thank you, George. I'd like to say I'm really going to miss this. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to be listening in on the calls so it probably will be a lot more fun.","George Shapiro","Okay, my question is that, Dave, given that you've missed the book-to-bill for the year, I mean, it came in at 0.93 versus the nearer 1 you were expecting. Was that the reason why the sales guidance for this year is down 3% to 5% versus what you said on the third quarter call that it would be relatively similar?","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. So you are right, as bookings have moved to the right, that clearly impacts sales in the near term. I want to repeat something that I said earlier. 2014 is very similar to the way 2013 looked from a sales standpoint, both domestically and internationally. Now we did have some larger programs move into the first half of 2014. We continue to see a very healthy book-to-bill in -- particularly in the first half of 2014. So if you take that 3-quarter period, the fourth quarter of '13 and the first half of '14, that bodes very well for the sales outlook for the back half of '14. From an overall standpoint, it impacted the sales guidance somewhat, but it's not overly meaningful, is the best way for me to say it.","William H. Swanson","And I think I should have mentioned that when I gave the $23.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million guidance on bookings, we expect a book-to-bill between 1.0 and 1.05. So we're expecting a strong year.","George Shapiro","Okay. But I mean, when you said similar sales in the third quarter comment, I'm just trying to figure out exactly how much the lower bookings might have impacted the sales guidance for this year. I mean, was it 1%, 2%?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes, it's not a lot, George. I'm not going to get overly specific on the arithmetic, but it didn't -- I would say the bookends of what we just went out with, it hasn't changed as a result of some of these orders moving to the right. It's less than a 1% impact.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then just...","David C. Wajsgras","That's why we go out with a range, George. That's why we have a range.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then just one quick one. You did well on the margins, but the space area, you particularly beat your guidance as set out in the third quarter. So was there something unique in this fourth quarter for space that you didn't anticipate? Or what caused you to beat it by that much?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. No, that's...","George Shapiro","I mean, you're 70 basis points higher than what your highest guidance was at the third quarter.","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. So the SAS business did see strong fourth quarter margins, and they were slightly above the prior year's fourth quarter. It's primarily due to the productivity improvements in our airborne radar program area. We had a couple of things going on and we were able to pull, and I mentioned this earlier, pull some productivity actions that we had anticipated in the first half of '14 into the fourth quarter.","George Shapiro","Okay, very good. Congratulations again, Bill.","William H. Swanson","Thanks, George. I will miss you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi.","Jonathan Raviv","It's Jon Raviv on for Jason. Congratulations to Bill and Tom. Just kind of curious what you're looking out for in the FY '15 budget process from a domestic perspective, where you see risks and opportunities around hitting the top end or bottom end of your guidance for this year?","William H. Swanson","DoD is going to submit the budget in the March timeframe. It'll be the first budget that's submitted within the caps. So for us, it'll allow DoD to make the tradeoffs that they see fit under these -- the new budget process. Beyond that, it's really hard to speculate what we think they may be doing in that regard. But clearly for us, the areas that we're focused in, in missile defense and in cyber and so forth, fit with what we believe the priorities will be in that case as we go forward.","Jonathan Raviv","And then just in terms of thinking about the high and low end of guidance for this year?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. So from a guidance standpoint, we range virtually all of our financial performance measures. I think a good way to think about it would be starting at the midpoint. We have opportunities and we also have some risks. But on balance, I would suggest the midpoint of the range is the way to start thinking about it.","Operator","The next question, apologies for pronunciation, comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr of Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Bill, again, congratulations on job extremely well done.","William H. Swanson","Thank you, Cai, appreciate it.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So well done that my only real question is one for Dave. So you laid out this very attractive profile through 2016 of cash recovery and your discretion -- and your contributions, at least the gross funding contributions. And if you don't make any discretionary contributions, it looks like every year, you get another couple hundred million of cash flow benefit.","William H. Swanson","That's right.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","As you look at that, what could make the cash -- or how locked in is the cash recovery? And I assume the gross funding essentially -- what could change the gross funding other than your discretionary contributions?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, there's a lot of variables involved in this from a discount rate standpoint, from an asset return standpoint, from a demographic standpoint. All of these have various impacts on the accounting, obviously, on the recovery and on the contributions under the Pension Protection Act. With all of that said, I wouldn't -- I would look at what we have in the web slide deck as -- with pretty high confidence. I don't see that changing dramatically going forward. It holds all assumptions constant relative to the discount rate and the asset returns at 8.75%. The demographics can sometimes change these numbers somewhat, but not meaningfully. So I would say that I would look at those numbers from an investor perspective and have a fair amount of confidence in what we put out there.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Todd B.

My name is Chanel, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Todd B. Ernst","All right. Thank you, Chanel. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter conference call. The results we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.","With me today are Bill Swanson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Wajsgras, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Bill and Dave, and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill?","William H. Swanson","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone.","Raytheon delivered solid operating results in 2012. Our focus on lowering costs and program execution drove higher than expected earnings and cash flow for the year. Demand for our broad portfolio of cutting-edge technologies and innovative solutions resulted in bookings well in excess of expectation, and we ended 2012 with a record funded backlog.","Fourth quarter bookings were strong at $7.9 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.23. International comprised a robust 40% of fourth quarter bookings.","When looking at the full year, our book-to-bill was 1.09 and was driven by strong domestic orders for missiles, radars, training, communication and classified programs, as well as international orders for command and control systems, precision munitions and sensors among a multitude of other awards. We also exceeded our initial bookings expectation by about 6%, ending the year with $26.5 billion of total bookings, with domestic demand a little higher and international also strong.","In the fourth quarter, international revenue increased 8% over last year and represents 27% of the quarter's total revenue. For all of 2012, international revenue was 26% of our total revenue, setting the standard for our industry and continuing to validate our international strategy.","As a technology and innovation leader, we continued our investment strategy to strengthen our capabilities, grow our market position and better meet customer needs.","During the fourth quarter, we completed 2 acquisitions. SafeNet Government Solutions is a world-class provider of encryption technology that aligns well with Raytheon's advanced strategic and tactical communications capabilities and enhances our position in these markets. Teligy specializes in wireless RF communication, vulnerability analysis, reverse engineering and rapid prototyping. These acquisitions ensure that we are well positioned in communications and cyber markets for the future.","Looking at the defense environment, the U.S. government averted the brunt of the fiscal cliff earlier this month. However, the ultimate outcome for sequestration was delayed and not resolved, and the new potential implementation date for sequestration is now March 1. The government continues to operate under a continuing resolution for fiscal year '13 that runs through March 27 or roughly halfway through its fiscal year. It's important to remember that we've been operating under various CRs and the threat from sequestration for a while now, and the company continues to perform well. This is a testament to the strength of our strategy and the operating talent across the company.","As we've discussed on previous calls, we're planning for potential various outcomes. Regardless, our focus remains on continually finding new ways to deliver world-class technology, while at the same time reducing our costs and improving our efficiency, whatever the environment. With our culture of continuous improvement, it's how we manage and run the company.","Our latest example of this is the formation of our Global Business Services group, or GBS, that we announced last week. GBS will leverage common systems across the company, enabling simplified processes and increasing operational speed and agility while providing value to our customers. It brings together the best practices from the company's supply chain management, finance, information technology and human resource functions to drive increased customer satisfaction and improve efficiencies. And it will build on the continuing success of our ongoing enterprise efficiency initiatives by applying proven service delivery practices more broadly across the company.","Before concluding, let me spend a minute on the strength of the Raytheon culture and some of the recognition we received last year in 2012.","Raytheon continued to deploy its best-in-class environmental health and safety programs, and the company had its safest year in its history. Our recordable injury rate improved 8.6% over 2011. These results are industry leading and are a direct result of our world-class processes and operating discipline. I'm proud of the team's achievement and will strive to build upon our success in the future.","Further, the company once again achieved a 100% score on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, marking the eighth consistent consecutive year we've achieved this recognition. Raytheon was also recognized as one of America's most community-minded companies in the Civic 50, which is the first scientific evaluation used to rank companies that best use their time, talent and resources to improve the quality of life where they do business. Collectively, these achievements reflect the strength of our vision, our strategy, goals and values as principles that bind each of us and our employees together with a common mission of customer success.","In summary, Raytheon had a good year. Of course, our solid operating performance in 2012 would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the Raytheon team.","During the year, with more than its share of external headwinds, the team remained focused and executed well. Together, we're prepared for the future and stand ready to continue to deliver value to our customers and our shareholders.","With that, let me turn it over to Dave.","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and full year results, then I'll discuss our outlook for 2013. And after that, Bill and I will open up the call for questions.","During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on our website.","So if everyone could please move to Page 3. We delivered solid results in both the quarter and the full year. We booked $26.5 billion in new business, ending the year with a $36.2 billion backlog. Our sales were up slightly compared with last year's fourth quarter and down 1.5% for the full year.","Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.60. For the full year, adjusted EPS of $6.21 was up 6%. For the quarter, our adjusted EPS came in higher than the guidance we provided you in October, but below last year's fourth quarter.","On a full year basis, operational improvements were relatively consistent in 2012 compared with 2011. However, you'll recall that in 2011, operational improvements were heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter.","We also generated strong operating cash flow of $1 billion for the quarter and $2 billion for the year. We were able to achieve very strong cash collections across all of our businesses. This strong performance allowed us to make a discretionary pension contribution of $500 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Additionally, during the fourth quarter, the company repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock for $100 million, bringing the full year 2012 repurchases to 15.9 million shares for about $825 million.","As we've previously disclosed, in the fourth quarter 2012, the company issued $1.1 billion of 10-year debt at 2.5% using the proceeds primarily to retire our 2014 and '15 maturities. We have now lengthened our weighted average debt maturity structure to about 13 years and locked in attractive interest rates over the longer term. The next maturity isn't due until 2018. The company ended the year with a strong balance sheet and net debt of $687 million.","Turning now to Page 4, let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. We had strong bookings of $7.9 billion in the quarter and $26.5 billion for the full year, resulting in a backlog of $36.2 billion. The book-to-bill was 1.23 in the quarter and 1.09 for the year, which exceeded the high end of our initial expectations from back in January of 2012. The company ended 2012 with a record funded backlog of about $24 billion, an increase of over $1.5 billion from year-end 2011. It's worth noting that both Missile Systems and Space and Airborne Systems had outstanding bookings performance for the full year 2012.","In the fourth quarter, we had several significant international awards, including $650 million at NCS for a C4I program; $500 million of missiles for Paveway; $289 million at SAS for its sensor program; and 2 contracts for about $300 million each at IDS, one was for an Early Warning Surveillance Radar and the other was to provide technical and logistics support for a Hawk and Patriot air and missile defense program.","Other significant bookings included $332 million at IDS for TPY-2 radars for the Missile Defense Agency; $251 million on the Zumwalt-class destroyer program for the U.S. Navy; and $511 million at IIS on a number of classified programs. MS booked $303 million for Tomahawk for the U.S. Navy and an international customer. Total company backlog increased by more than $850 million over year-end 2011.","Turning now to Page 5. We achieved fourth quarter sales of $6.4 billion, slightly higher than the comparable period last year.","Looking at the businesses, net sales at IDS were about $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 2%. The increase was primarily due to higher sales on the TPY-2 radar program for an international customer.","Missile Systems net sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter, an increase of 4%, primarily driven by higher sales on the SM-3 and the Rolling Airframe Missile programs. It's also worth noting that we've re-baselined the AMRAAM contract with the U.S. Air Force. We now have an updated delivery plan. We are executing well with a qualified second source supplying rocket motors, allowing us to deliver completed missiles to our customer.","Space and Airborne Systems had net sales of $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 3% as a result of higher sales on an international tactical airborne radar program.","IIS had net sales of $755 million and NCS had net sales of $1.1 billion, both essentially in line with the same period last year.","Technical Services had net sales of $831 million, down a little more than $50 million from the comparable period a year ago due to the completion of the National Science Foundation Polar contract in the first quarter 2012.","If you move to Page 6, we delivered solid operational performance in the quarter and for the full year. When you compare margins to our prior guidance, all of our businesses met or exceeded the range that we had provided in October.","As I previously mentioned, on a full year basis, operational improvements were relatively consistent in 2012 compared with 2011. However, 2011 operational improvements were heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter.","Further, as I discussed on the October call, our results include the costs associated with ending a supplier agreement at NCS.","As I stand back and look at the year, we delivered strong margins. Our adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points for the full year. We continue to see meaningful contributions from our ongoing productivity efforts.","On Page 7, you'll see both the fourth quarter and full year adjusted EPS. In the fourth quarter 2012, adjusted EPS was $1.60, and for the full year was $6.21 compared with $5.85 in 2011, an increase of 6%. The increase for the full year was driven by strong results from operations and capital deployment actions, specifically share repurchases.","As I previously mentioned, the company generated strong operating cash flow of $2 billion in 2012.","Moving on to our 2013 guidance on Page 8. We see sales in the range of between $23.6 billion and $24.1 billion. As for pension, we see the FAS\/CAS adjustment of $286 million, which reflects our investment returns in 2012 of over 12% and the December 31 discount rate of 4.15%. We expect net interest to be between $200 million and $210 million. We see the average diluted share count to be between 324 million and 327 million on a full year basis.","As for our effective tax rate, we expect it to be approximately 30%, which includes the R&D tax credit for both 2012 and 2013, which has an impact of about $0.15. The accounting rules required the full retroactive benefit from the 2012 R&D tax credit, worth about $0.08, to be booked in the first quarter 2013.","In 2013, we see our adjusted EPS to be in the range $5.65 to $5.80. In addition to the FAS\/CAS adjustment, it's worth noting that our 2013 adjusted EPS also excludes the $0.08 benefit of the R&D tax credit that relates to 2012. We see 2013 EPS to be in the range of $5.16 to $5.31. Our operating cash flow guidance is between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. Lastly, I do want to point out that our initial 2013 guidance does not include the potential effect of sequestration.","Continuing on to Page 9. From a sales perspective, we see our domestic business down, offset partially by strength in our international business. We expect 2013 adjusted margins to continue to be solid and in the 12.3% to 12.5% range.","Given the existing uncertainty that the industry faces and to give us flexibility, we've included 20 basis points of costs in our 2013 margin guidance related to accelerating facility utilization improvements and operating initiatives.","We are continuing to take a number of actions to improve the operating structure of the company. We are accelerating facility consolidations, and as you are already aware, we launched Global Business Services. These, combined with our ongoing enterprise-wide supply chain efforts, directly strengthen our competitive posture going forward. We have included the cost of implementing these actions in our 2013 guidance.","If you'd now turn to Page 10, we've provided you with our 2013 outlook by quarter. You'll notice the improvement in sales cadence as we go through the year, which reflects program timing and the current environment. We expect bookings to be back-half weighted, similar to last year.","And finally, on Page 11. As we've done in the past, we provided a summary of the financial impact from pensions in 2012, as well as the projected impact for 2013 through '15, holding all assumptions constant. We believe this will help you better understand our company over the next few years. I do want to point out that with these assumptions held constant, we expect the FAS\/CAS adjustment to significantly improve after 2013, turning positive in 2015.","If interest rates were to increase, we would see an even faster improvement in the FAS\/CAS adjustments.","Let me conclude my saying that in 2012, Raytheon delivered strong operating performance. By focusing on program execution and lowering costs, our margins, earnings and operating cash flow were all ahead of expectations. Book-to-bill was strong. Our backlog in total and our funded backlog increased year-over-year. Our international opportunities continue to be robust. We have a strong balance sheet and net debt of less than $700 million. We continue to find new ways to deliver world-class technologies, improve efficiency and drive productivity. We remain confident in our future and in our ability to continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders.","So with that, Bill and I will open the call up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Joe Nadol, JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Bill, could we go to the NCS segments? It looks like your guidance there is for margins coming down a bit, and I know this is where a lot of the operational activity or operational tempo type of activity in your business has been located. But you've been restructuring that business to some degree. Can you just give us an update on what's happening there?","William H. Swanson","Yes, sure, Joe. We feel confident that, that business is stabilized, I guess, a good way to say it. As you know, part of the focus there has been to concentrate on the network part of the business and show why our customers need to be presented with accurate, actionable data on the move. And so for us, when we look at their full year sales and margin, they were consistent with the guidance we gave back in Q3. And in Q4, NCS had bookings of about $1.5 billion, including a key international C4I win, which drove their full year book-to-bill about 1.13, in line with guidance. And bookings increased about $500 million over 2011, positioning them well for 2013. So taken together, I feel pretty good about where we're going and where we're headed in that regard.","David C. Wajsgras","Joe, let me just add one thing. The 2013 guidance also includes about 50 basis points related to the encryption acquisition that we made. So if you adjust for that, it's basically in line with '12.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then, Dave, just on the cash flow and the pension. It looks like you guys anticipate a positive variance in your cash flow of $600 million, I think, from pension from '12 to 13, just looking at the CAS going up and your contributions going down, and your guidance calls for cash flow that's flat to slightly up. What are the opportunities there or are there other headwinds that you're dealing with that -- such that your cash flow wouldn't be a little higher?","David C. Wajsgras","No, your math is right. There is a swing in the pension. There's a couple of things. We had a very strong performance from a cash perspective in Q4, both on the collections side and with respect to performance-based payments and advances. So as you look at 2013, there is about a $300 million swing relative to timing between Q4 and Q1 from a cash standpoint, and we are continuing to post very strong cash performance of between $2 billion and $2.2 billion as we go into '13. So there's nothing remarkable going on there. We continue to perform well from that perspective.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, could you quantify -- when you get the question, if sequestration as currently -- as it currently looks -- or is scheduled right now kicks in, what's the impact to sales in 2013, what's your answer?","William H. Swanson","Joe, let me take a minute and say that we need to get focused on getting sequestration fixed. It's the elephant in the room, it sucks all the air out of every conversation. And by postponing the debt ceiling, we averted a government shutdown, which means federal checking or checks not going out to servicemen or people operating in our government. It would have been a horrible outcome. Sequestration cuts deeply into areas that Dems favor and cuts in areas that Republicans favor. And for me, I think sequestration sets the baseline upon which both sides will do the budget. It puts the budget where it belongs. It's about making hard decisions that need to be made, and we need to make them strategically and not across the board in a peanut butter fashion. So having said all of that, I'm not sure what the outcome of sequestration is since OMB and DOD have really not passed any guidance down. But if I had to look into a crystal ball and use all the intelligence that I can think of and kind of throw a dart at the wall, I would tell you it probably means an additional point or 2 to us as we look at the balance. And you have to remember, we have our strongest funded backlog in our history.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Dave, you mentioned that there's a 20 basis point headwinds in the year from a marketing perspective driven by some of these cost initiatives that you're engaging in. I was wondering if you might perhaps describe to us what the eventual benefit you think will come out of those from a margin perspective and when you think we might see those benefits.","David C. Wajsgras","So let me start by saying we are continuing to take a lot of productivity actions, and we're accelerating these in a number of areas. Obviously, there are some implementation costs, which you're addressing, specifically with the utilization actions. And we expect more of these due to acceleration than in the prior years. I think, going forward, these actions position us more competitively. And with the environment that we expect to be seeing over the next few years, it positions us well amongst the peer group.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then on the CAS harmonization, earlier in the 2012 year, you were able to begin increasing your billing rates. And I just want to get an update on how successful those increased billing rates have gone. Have those stuck? And are we actually going to see the full benefits that you might have or you might be able to see in the 2014 and '15 time frame from the harmonization efforts.","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. The -- that is playing out as we had anticipated about a year ago, and there's nothing new to report from that perspective. We expect the cash benefit to start being realized as we move into '14 and continue to progress each year thereafter for about a 3- or 4-year time frame. So there's nothing new there and that's going well on all fronts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Given the strong bookings you've had in each of the last 2 years, is it reasonable to expect that maybe next year bookings are going to be more on the order of 1:1? Or do you still expect to come in above 1:1?","William H. Swanson","We expect bookings around 1.0 as you point out. We had a good year this year. We -- when we look at the bookings for 2013, we expect those to be around $24 billion, plus or minus $500 million. We expect about 28% to 30% of those to be international, which is strong for us, and 1:1 or a little over 1:1.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just a follow-up question on the operating margins. Even if I take account of the 20 bps of costs associated with the streamlining of the business, it looks like you're modeling quite a contraction in profitability in the next year. Is there anything fundamental going on? Or is this kind of the standard conservatism that you have at this point of the cycle?","David C. Wajsgras","Right. I wouldn't characterize it as conservatism. There is some mix and timing impacts as we go into 2013. There are some long-duration production programs that are ramping down. We have a number of development programs ramping up, as well as some international production programs ramping up. So there is a mix impact. And again, if you add back the 20 basis points for the cost efficiency programs that we are implementing and roughly 10 basis points at the company level for the encryption acquisition, we believe that the margin profile is resulting in very strong margin performance. So there's nothing, again, that's different there. We think, as we move ahead, we'll continue to post very strong margins and solid earnings.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A couple of bigger picture questions. This one for Dave. I know you guys have been pretty consistent and balanced in your cash deployment efforts and in your strategy and both in your communications. But as you think conceptually about this year, and as I look at where the balance sheet is now with the debt termed out, you'll be in a kind of net cash position by, looks like Q3. The balance sheet looks the best it has in a long time. To Joe's point, you're going to be generating a lot of cash this year. Presumably, at this point later in the year, we'll have a lot more visibility about where the budget is. Is there any potential that you give stronger consideration to returning more cash to shareholders? Or how does that thought process go given the progress you've made on the balance sheet and given the cash generation you expect?","David C. Wajsgras","We do not contemplate any wholesale changes with respect to our capital deployment priorities. You're correct when you point out the health of the balance sheet and the strength of our cash flow. It does give us an opportunity to be flexible with respect to, importantly, investing in ourselves, returning cash to shareholders, investing in the pension, looking at niche acquisitions. But from an overall standpoint, I wouldn't suggest any significant changes in the way we think about capital deployment.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And one for Bill. Just bigger picture, we now have the election behind us. We're contemplating changes around the department. We obviously had some congressional changes. But given its importance to your international business, I wondered if you might speak to any potential changes you see for the FMS process as we move into a second-term administration, some congressional changes, some changes at the department. Is there scope to sell more goods internationally? Is there pressure in any way? How are you thinking about that given its importance to your business?","William H. Swanson","You hit the nail on the head. One of the things that -- having -- going into -- in my 40th or 41st year here at the company, I've seen a lot. And one of the things that I'm really encouraged about is that the department and others see the importance of the FMS process. For us, we've got a robust pipeline here of activity that we're working on, especially either here in the first quarter or throughout the year. And I would say that the department, State Department and the administration, understands that foreign military sales help us bridge the gap as we go through these headwinds in the sense that, if we have these programs in our factories, they help keep our overheads in control. They help, in some cases, to lower them, which allows the U.S. to make the decisions that need to be made. And we're working with the department, and I can say personally, I'm doing it, in the sense of how we look at the timing of U.S. orders versus FMS orders and how do we balance our factories that way. I'm encouraged. The environment really forces this. But people are listening and they're trying to help in the process, and we've had a number of CNs go through the building. And I expect -- the nice thing, if Senator Kerry is confirmed, when he's confirmed as Secretary of State, he really understands this because he headed up Foreign Relations on the Senate side. So I'd say it's bright and not dim.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just one question. I just wanted to follow up on where, I guess, Carter started, which is, if I think about 2012 across the industry and, to some extent, Raytheon as well, there was a slowdown in the pace of using cash. I want to say hoarding some cash in advance of sequestration and continuing resolution. That situation hasn't really changed, so I guess I'm trying to think about, does that mean the pace of buybacks as we go forward in 2013 should also be relatively slow until we get some resolution?","David C. Wajsgras","Sam, the guidance that we provided with respect to the average outstanding diluted share count of 324 million to 327 million suggests a repurchase plan directionally in line with 2012. And that's what I was suggesting when I answered the earlier question with respect to cash being returned to shareholders. We'll also be addressing any change to the dividend as we move forward in the year. We're following the same cadence that we have in prior years, and we'll be discussing this with the board, as we do throughout the year, and talking with the shareholders as we likely close out the first quarter.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just, if I look at the segment guidance for 2013, why, on a year-over-year basis, do you seem to have more of a decline in NCS and SAS than the other segments? Are there certain programs ending? Is it an OCO assumption? Really, what's behind those 2 segments?","David C. Wajsgras","So with respect to NCS, the lower margin is driven by mix, primarily U.S. Army sensor programs nearing completion. It's partially offset by a ramp-up on new international programs. And again, we do have about 50 basis points of impact related to acquisition accounting for the fourth quarter acquisition in that group. With respect to SAS, the operating income declines over '12 due to, again, a change in mix. Here, it's primarily due to international sales moderating slightly, specifically on long-duration production programs, combined with higher sales on new development programs. So again, there's nothing too unusual happening from an SAS perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn, Credit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You said, Bill, or maybe Dave, you said this, that there's no sequester in the guidance. But what level of cuts are contemplated in the guidance? And if we -- you also mentioned that if we do get a full sequester, it's 1 point or 2, how much worse is it in '14, just given that it's going to be back-end-of-the-year timing?","William H. Swanson","Yes, as you know, we don't give any guidance in '14. And that one's really hard to figure out, Rob, because, from a point of view of how are the cuts going to be made, I know there are many on the Hill that are trying to give the Secretary and the department the ability to line up their priorities with their strategies and make the cuts. If they're forced into a peanut butter approach where everything gets spread the same, then different outcomes happen. For us, I always think of Raytheon being different. When you look at 26% of our sales being international and having a strong funded backlog, not being -- or agnostic, the platforms, I like to think we're going to fare better than anybody else going into these headwinds. So I would tell you in '14, I look for us to be better than others.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just to follow up on that. Dave, in your revenue guidance, how should we think about organic growth domestically versus international in '13?","David C. Wajsgras","So the range of international growth is 3% to 5%. And from a domestic standpoint, we look to be down about 3% to 5%. So net-net, that's, if you stand back, that's about 1% to 3% down overall from a company perspective.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just last thing, a clarification. What was the underlying margin at NCS when you adjust for the supplier agreement?","David C. Wajsgras","The supplier agreement cost us about $17 million to end that agreement. There's another point I'd like to make here. We also had an inventory write-down in that group worth about $14 million. So combined, it's about $30 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Stallard, Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Bill, a couple of quarters ago, you commented that some of the acquisition targets that were pensioned out that were too expensive. You've made a couple of small deals this quarter. Does that mean these prices started to come down into your comfort level?","William H. Swanson","No, the small deals, we look at each one of them on an independent basis. The wireless RF is a key capability and, especially for vulnerability, I think people have heard me say anything that has an aperture, meaning an antenna or something that takes in signal, is just a door we can knock on to open. And so we wanted to have these capabilities even more so for our customers because we think that's something our customers are going to face as they go forward here. Right now, I can tell you I've not seen a reduction in market prices. Everybody still thinks they're beachfront properties. And so for us, we're pretty disciplined here about how we go and do that. But as you look to the future here, people are going to have to evaluate what they have and maybe the prices will get better. But right now, for us, they're really based on the capabilities we need as a company, and then we draw a line in the sand of what we're willing to pay for something.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And on the export front, you've clearly had several years now of good growth in export bookings. How long do you think this trend is going to last? Do you think it's going to be strong enough to sustain you over, say, a 3 or 4-year period, if the DOD budget is heading down?","William H. Swanson","Yes, I feel pretty good about the international. It's still a complicated world out there. Everybody faces threats, whether you're in the Mideast or whether you're in Asia or other parts of the world. People still want to know what's going on, on their borders, so the surveillance or the ISR capability. And once they know that, they need to tie it into the command and control. And people are worried about missiles now, so missile defense is key in that regard. And then cyber, being able to protect your assets and your communication and your nodes in country are important. So I could go on and on. And I just -- I'm encouraged, as we go forward here, that the international marketplace is one that, from a strategy point of view, we saw it a number of years ago and you see us constantly getting our booking and our sales up on a year-over-year basis. So to answer your question, I feel pretty good about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Harned, Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I'm interested in -- when you talk about bookings, very good year this past year. Backlogs are up, funded backlogs are up in every unit except for Technical Services, yet you're guiding to lower revenues in '13. Is this conservatism? Do you expect something different in terms of timing with respect to converting these backlogs? What's happening there?","David C. Wajsgras","So let me start by saying our international sales for 2013 are projected to be up 3% to 5%, and domestically, down about 3% to 5%. You do need to consider program duration on our new awards and the general headwinds in the environment. So you are right. We did see strong orders in 2012. We had a book-to-bill of 1.09, some of which was accelerated from 2013. We had a couple of multi-year awards in 2012, specifically at Missile Systems, that are longer in duration and normally would have been funded in annual increments. We also received some longer duration awards at SAS. Our bookings in 2013 are down slightly, with a book-to-bill of just around 1 or maybe 1-plus a little bit. And the strength in international doesn't quite offset what's happening domestically.","William H. Swanson","And Doug, I would add to what Dave said, that one of the things that we're seeing and I'll have better color on by midyear, some of our international customers are seeing what we can do to accelerate, which could have an effect, but it's a little early right now. But a couple of initial discussions are, can we pull some stuff to the left here.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Well, and on that, could you talk about your expectations for some of these awards? In particular, I know we've seen Turkey and Kuwait kind of slip. And then out there is this -- the DFCA notification on Cutter [ph], which is quite large. Can you talk a little bit about the specific things you're looking at for the year?","William H. Swanson","Sure, I'd be happy to do it. It's -- the nice part is, I want to put in perspective that we did increase our bookings above our expectation. So even with the movement, we met what we said we were going to do, plus a little something extra. And I really want to say that because you know us long enough that, many years ago, if something slipped, that'd be a huge disaster, and that's not the case because we have a super strong portfolio today. So if you look at it, Kuwait, we might have expected that in the fourth quarter. We expect it this quarter. It's in country, just waiting for the signatures, and they have a process there. So we're forecasting that for this quarter. We expected a $750 million, plus or minus. The award will be larger than that, but that will be the initial award because services and spares come a little bit later. We've got Oman in the GBADs, which is a ground-based air defense system. We expect that decision in the first half of this year, probably around the July time frame. That's about $1.5 billion, could be $0.5 billion larger. Turkey Patriot, clearly, there, everyone knows, it's no secret, that they have Patriots on the line now that they've gotten from NATO. We expect a decision here on that in March. They were going to make it in January, but they went back to get some more data. That is competitive there, but from our standpoint, we're doing everything to make sure it's in our wheelhouse. That's a couple billion. Cutter [ph], as you mentioned, there's a CN approved in December. That's for 11 fire units and missiles. We expect an award in late '13, later in the year here, that's a couple billion. Then you throw in $100 million here or there for Paveway's, another $750 million or so for missiles internationally. Our ATM business is about $200 million this year for radars and systems. And then, we've got some Airborne sensing programs we're working on for about $1 billion. So that's just a few of the international things that are going on in the company, to give you an idea. I hope that helps.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cai Von Rumohr, Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So I guess, a follow-on to Doug. What about -- I've been hearing about Saudi. Are they potentially in the market to buy anything from you?","William H. Swanson","Yes, they're one of our great customers. We've been there for 50-plus years. And I would say Raytheon's reputation there is about as good as it's ever been, Cai, and we feel good about it. They're going to -- they're looking at additional missile defense capabilities. They're doing an analysis of SNAP, which is the Navy end of the business. So we feel very good about what we're doing there and the kind of work we're doing for them.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And could that result in any meaningful business awards in 2013?","William H. Swanson","Maybe at the end of the year, but definitely '14.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then you've been sort of complaining about mix going the wrong way. If I look at IDS and add back the 20 bps, the margins are essentially flat with an admittedly good 2012. But isn't your mix maturing there, more Patriots, and then we have Zumwalt work that you've doing for a while moves back up. So is there opportunity for the margins to be better at IDS?","William H. Swanson","Cai, I think Dave did a good job -- not because he's sitting next to me here, but I thought he did a good job explaining the mix issue. And you know, as well as I do, that when we start our international jobs, we start them lower because there is risk associated with it till we're able to get through the milestones, get our suppliers going and everything. So part of that is the timing and, as Dave would say, the mix. Zumwalt, we feel good about. The third ship is nailed down here. We got some of that awarded in December. But there's also some awards there that are tied up in the continuing resolution because, as you know and I know, the CR won't let you release any funds higher than what was obligated before. So as soon as the CR gets through, then some funds will be released and we'll be off and running. We expect Zumwalt to be probably in about the $300 million range on sales consistent year-over-year.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And last one. As you look at your margin guidance, could you comment which areas do you think maybe have the most opportunity to do better than you projected? And which are the ones where maybe you're nervous, you might have trouble hitting the numbers?","David C. Wajsgras","So Cai, that's an excellent question, and that's why we provide ranges for each one of the businesses. We are, obviously, targeting internally for strength in every one of our businesses across the board. But at this stage, late January, I think it's fair to say that we've provided the bookends, and we see every one of our businesses working through that within those bookends throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Shapiro, Shapiro Research.","George Shapiro","Dave, this is the first quarter you've had year-over-year decline in margin, as well as sequential in, I mean, an awful long time. Why shouldn't I conclude that, effectively, the margins peaked in '12 and your guidance, even though usually conservative for '13, has been down a little bit more?","David C. Wajsgras","George, I joined the company about 7 years ago and people were suggesting our margins peaked 7 years ago and...","William H. Swanson","And every year since.","David C. Wajsgras","And I believe I've been asked that question about 111 times since then, and every year, we've continued to show improvement. It doesn't mean that, that happens each and every quarter or each and every year, but over time, we believe we'll continue to improve margins and returns. Now 2012, the cadence, with respect to our operational improvements, were weighted in the first 9 months of the year. And comparing the fourth quarter 2012 to 2011, the operational improvements or what some term the EAC adjustments, were weighted in the fourth quarter of '11 as opposed to the fourth quarter of '12. Moving forward, we're continuing to take a lot of actions relative to cost and productivity improvements. We've talked to some of those today. Our guidance includes about 20 basis points relative to implementing some of those actions. I'd say, over the longer term, 3, 4, 5 years out, we would continue to see some upward movement from a margin and return perspective.","George Shapiro","But Dave, if I look at like EACs on average, say, I don't know what the fourth quarter was yet, but have been incremental to the tone of 2 to 3 percentage points of margin. And if you go back several years ago, that was more like 1%, 1.5%. With some of these production programs ending, I mean, why wouldn't those EAC levels go back to where they were there several years ago?","David C. Wajsgras","So they do run, on average, in the mid-2% range. They are weighted toward fixed-price programs, obviously, as well as our production programs, both domestically and internationally. As we continue to expand our international footprint, we continue to see opportunities to drive productivity in those areas. So I would suggest, taken as a whole, the makeup of the backlog and the makeup of the pipeline from a growth perspective suggest that we ought to be able to and that we're confident in continuing to drive productivity improvements.","George Shapiro","Okay. And then I'll go back to my simple one that you probably have at your fingertips anyway. Of the 3% to 5% domestic decline in '13, what's the classified component of that?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, for '13, what we're seeing is classified bookings and sales to be in the range of 14% to 16% of the total.","George Shapiro","Which would imply what kind of percentage increase over '12?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, right now, you'd have to back into the range. But again, I think, at this stage, the 14% to 16% of the total is the best way to provide that information.","George Shapiro","And that was the same in 2012?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, in 2012, our classified sales grew 1 point -- well, let me step back for a minute. Classified bookings for the year were 16% of total bookings and up 30% over 2011. Classified sales for the year were 16% of our total sales and in line with 2011, actually up a little bit.","Todd B. Ernst","Chanel, we have time for one more question, please.","Operator","Sure. And the final question comes from the line of David Strauss, UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Bill, I know you talked about the guidance not reflecting sequestration, but are you assuming we actually get a budget this year? Or are you assuming we have a full year of continuing resolution?","William H. Swanson","For us, right now, it looks like the CR is scheduled at the end of March. My gut tells me it's more like the end of May with everything lining up. And if I had to guess on sequestration, and this is a guess, I'll qualify it, that we'll probably end up touching the stove and feeling the heat, which means it'll happen and then people are going to work to put it back in the box. Hope that helps.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. But -- so you expect, ultimately, we get a budget but it's pretty late in the year?","William H. Swanson","Yes, yes. That's the way I'd say it. We need to do it and it -- to me, the tone and tenor in Washington is people are starting to think about how serious this is. And as I mentioned, both sides want some things, and when you do that, you sit down at the table and you work it out in a bipartisan way and that's what we need to do as a country.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Dave, a couple of questions. EACs in the quarter and what is your assumption for cash taxes in '13?","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. EAC's in the quarter were about 2.2% of revenue. And again, that's because they were weighted to the first 9 months of the year. With respect to cash taxes, in 2013, we expect that to be about $650 million.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And what was the number in '12?","David C. Wajsgras","A little over -- about $840 million.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then on the bookings versus sales question that's been asked a couple times. I guess, specifically looking at missiles and SAS where bookings were up year-over-year, yet you're forecasting sales flat to down there, is there anything -- any specific reason as to why those businesses wouldn't be up given the bookings trend?","David C. Wajsgras","No, again, there's nothing remarkable going on there. Sales are in line from a Missile Systems perspective, 2013 with 2012. There's increased production rates on Tomahawk, SM-6, AMRAAM and some other core programs, which are offsetting lower production rates across various Army programs. Again, this is the area where we did have multi-year bookings, and those are clearly longer in duration than you might otherwise expect.","William H. Swanson","And I would add in there, we expect Missiles to probably have about 25% of their business is international and about 1\/3 of SAS's bookings are international.","Todd B. Ernst","Okay. Thank you for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter conference call in April. Chanel?","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"18169":["Raytheon Co.

My name is Tracy, and I will be your operator for today. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Todd Ernst - Raytheon Co.","Thank you, Tracy. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our third quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.","With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that the company has strong operating performance in the third quarter, and our growth strategy remains on track. Revenue increased by over 4% and our operational execution was solid across the businesses with overall operating margins above our expectations. As a result, our earnings per share was well ahead of our prior guidance for the quarter.","Based on the company's performance, we have updated our guidance for the year, Toby will provide more color on this as well as high level outlook for 2017 in a few moments. We continue to see strong demand from our global customers for our advanced technologies. This demand drove a third quarter book-to-bill ratio of 1.15 and our year-to-date book-to-bill ratio currently stands at a healthy 1.14. I would note that our year-to-date classified bookings have already surpassed our record annual level.","Given our booking strength and our expectations for a solid fourth quarter, we have raised our bookings outlook range again for the year by another $500 million to a range of $26 billion to $27 billion. As you know, bookings ultimately drive revenue, so this positions us well for continued solid top-line growth in 2017.","I'd like to point out that our domestic bookings were particularly strong in the third quarter, driven by classified, training, the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System, Standard Missile-3, Phalanx, and several additional missile programs. Classified bookings were very strong, representing 22% of total company bookings in the quarter. For our overall domestic business, it is worth noting that bookings have exceeded revenue in each quarter this year.","One key area of focus for our team is capturing and renewing franchise programs. These are large, long duration programs that last decades and have both domestic and international potential. In the third quarter, we received a key new franchise booking in our Naval radar area for the Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar or EASR. This competitive award is for the initial engineering, manufacturing and development phase of the program that will ultimately equip U.S. Navy ships and carriers with a new radar based on our gallium nitride or GaN technology.","You'll recall, we developed GaN as a big bet technology over a decade ago and leveraged it for previous franchise wins on the Air and Missile Defense Radar and Next Generation Jammer, both for the U.S. Navy. Altogether, these programs put us in a strong position to support our U.S. Navy and international customers with advanced capabilities to counter emerging threats. The EASR win represents an opportunity over $1 billion for the company.","We see additional opportunities to leverage GaN technology on our ground-based radar franchises as well. The Missile Defense Agency recently awarded us the contract to develop a process to incorporate GaN components into existing and future TPY-2 radars. These are long range radars used to detect and track ballistic missiles.","And earlier this year, we began showcasing a new GaN-based AESA radar for a Patriot Integrated Air and Missile Defense System at key industry events such AUSA and the Farnborough International Airshow. Customer feedback and interest from these events is strong, and we are actively pursuing new opportunities for this radar with key customers.","I'm pleased with the progress we're making on these multiple franchise pursuits, and with the clear success of our GaN investments, which has positioned us well across both radar and electronic warfare market segments. As we look to potential future bookings, there are a number of large upcoming opportunities for the company, including an early warning radar system for Qatar as well as Patriot, Standard Missile-2 and radar upgrades across Japan and Taiwan, which combined represents a multi-billion dollar opportunity.","Further, we continue to make progress on the Patriot opportunity in Poland. You may have seen that Poland signed a letter of request for an integrated air and missile defense system with the U.S. in September based on the Patriot system. We believe Poland will sign a foreign military sales agreement with the U.S. government sometime later this year or early next. On this timeline, we would expect in turn a signed contract with the U.S. government and book an award later in 2017 for initial Patriot capability. I would add that in addition to Poland, we see other emerging Patriot opportunities in the European region.","Turning to sales. Our third quarter increased by a solid 4.3%, as a result of the continued execution of our growth strategy. As we've discussed on past earnings calls, the company is aligned with the needs of our global customers and continues to invest in what we expect to be future growth areas.","Internationally, sales were up 7% in the quarter and represented 32% of our total sales. Domestic sales increased by 3% and included classified growth of 5%. Forcepoint, our cybersecurity product business, saw sales increase 31% in the third quarter, of which 18% was organic.","I'd like to take a minute to update you further on Forcepoint. The business is performing well and on track to meet its 2016 objectives. The integration of all acquisitions is essentially complete. Forcepoint's new CEO, Matt Moynahan, has been on board for five months now and is making very good progress.","We have put in place an updated strategic plan that addresses areas of the cybersecurity market where we believe we have an opportunity for leadership. One of these areas is advanced insider threat, where we are providing an integrated system by combing our SureView and data loss prevention capabilities with policy and analytics to capitalize on this rapidly expanding market area. We believe this approach will align well with our strategy to further penetrate in the enterprise and very large enterprise customer markets and support Forcepoint's long-term growth.","Turning to capital deployment; we continue to pursue a balanced capital deployment strategy. Our number one priority remains investing in organic growth. Beyond that, we remain focused on prudently returning capital to shareholders via competitive sustainable dividend and share repurchases, market conditions permitting. We continue to use smaller targeted M&A to fill technology or market gaps to augment both our defense business and commercial cybersecurity capabilities.","So bottom line, we had a great quarter with strong sales and margins as well as solid bookings, which sets a stage for continued top-line growth. For that, I'd like to thank the entire Raytheon team. Our employees are proud of what they do every day for our customers, company and shareholders.","With that, let me turn it over to Toby.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the third quarter highlights and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. If everyone would please turn to page 3.","We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the third quarter, with bookings, sales and EPS all at or better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the third quarter of $6.9 billion resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.15.","Sales were $6 billion in the quarter, up 4%, led by missiles, SAS and Forcepoint. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.79, which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes. We generated solid operating cash flow of $640 million in the third quarter. Third quarter 2016 operating cash flow was lower than last year's third quarter as expected, primarily due to the timing of collections and payments. And on a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow of $1.7 billion was ahead of last year's year-to-date operating cash flow by approximately $200 million.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for $198 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 6.2 million shares for $801 million. I also want to point out that we're raising the EPS guidance that we provided in July, reflecting our strong performance to-date. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.","Turning now to page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our third quarter results. Company bookings continue to be strong. For the third quarter, bookings were $6.9 billion and on a year-to-date basis were $20.3 billion, an increase of approximately $2.9 billion over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing four quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.16. For the quarter, international was 21% of our total company bookings and on a year-to-date basis, was 26%.","We booked several significant awards in the third quarter, including $538 million on Standard Missile-3, $376 million for Phalanx Weapon Systems, $286 million on domestic and foreign training programs in support of Warfighter FOCUS activities, $265 million to provide advanced Patriot Air and Missile Defense capabilities for an international customer, and $255 million on the Joint Precision Approach and Landing System program, an all-weather landing system for land-based and sea-based aircraft for the U.S. Navy.","Total backlog at the end of the third quarter was $35.8 billion, an increase of approximately $2.2 billion compared to the end of the third quarter 2015. And funded backlog was $25.7 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion compared to the end of the third quarter 2015.","If you now move to page 5, for the third quarter, 2016 sales were in line with the guidance we set in July. Our international sales were approximately 32% of total sales.","Looking now at sales by business. IDS had third quarter 2016 net sales of $1.3 billion. As expected, the change in net sales for the quarter was primarily driven by lower net sales on certain radar production programs and on an international communications program. In the third quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.5 billion, up slightly compared with the same quarter last year. Missile Systems had third quarter 2016 net sales of $1.8 billion. The 9% increase from the third quarter 2015 was primarily due to the Paveway and AMRAAM programs. SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion. The 10% increase versus last year was driven by higher sales on an international classified program. And for Forcepoint, the 31% increase was primarily driven by higher sales in federal products and services, and the acquisition of Stonesoft, which was completed in the first quarter of 2016.","Moving ahead to page 6, overall the company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 13.4% for the total company and 12.5% on a business segment basis.","So looking now at the business margins, all performed at or above our expectations. The increase in margin at IDS in the third quarter compared to the comparable quarter last year reflects improved program performance. Both IIS and Missile's operating margins were in line with last year's third quarter. As expected, SAS margin decreased in the quarter compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by a change in program mix. And at Forcepoint, the third quarter 2016 operating margin was, as expected, lower than last year's comparable quarter, primarily due to an increase in professional services and hardware sales relative to total sales and an increase in commissions due to higher bookings.","Turning now to page 7. Third quarter 2016 EPS was $1.79, better than expected, driven by timing of program improvements from the fourth quarter, as well as from non-operating items.","On page 8 as I mentioned earlier, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2016 to reflect our improved operating performance to-date and our expectations for the fourth quarter compared to our prior guidance. We have tightened the range for full year 2016 net sales, increasing the low end by $200 million. We now expect net sales to be between $24.2 billion and $24.5 billion, up 4% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business.","As we have done in prior years, during the quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of this update, the FAS\/CAS adjustment for the year increased by $5 million from $428 million to $433 million or a favorable impact of approximately $0.01 per share.","We have increased our full year 2016 EPS, raising the low end by $0.15 and the high end by $0.05 from our prior guidance, and now expect it to be in the range of $7.28 to $7.38. The increase is primarily driven by our improved performance to-date as well as slightly higher pension income and lower interest expense.","Turning to our share repurchase. Through the end of the third quarter, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of common stock for just over $800 million and now see our diluted share count at approximately 297 million shares for 2016, a 3% year-over-year reduction. As a percent of free cash flow, we expect to return approximately 80% of free cash flow to shareholders this year, depending on market conditions.","And as you can see on page 9, we've included guidance by business. We've increased and tightened the full year sales outlook at both missiles and SAS. In addition, we've tightened the full year sales range for IDS and IIS.","Looking at margins, we've narrowed the margin guidance range for the company, raising the low end by 10 basis points from our prior guidance and now see operating margin to be in the range of 13.3% to 13.4% for the full year. At the business segment level, we now see the operating margin in a range of 12.7% to 12.8% for the full year.","Before moving on to page 10, as Tom mentioned earlier, given our year-to-date bookings strength and our expectation for a solid fourth quarter, we are now raising our full year 2016 bookings outlook to $26.5 billion plus or minus $500 million. This $500 million increase to the prior range is driven by strong demand from our global customers and positions us well for 2017. This marks our second consecutive $500 million quarterly increase to our bookings outlook. We expect international to be about a third of total bookings for the year.","On page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see the fourth quarter for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations. We still expect fourth quarter sales to be in a range of $6.4 billion to $6.7 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. It's important to note that the fourth quarter of 2016 has four fewer work days than the comparable period last year, which has an impact to sales of approximately $100 million per day. EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in a range of $1.68 to $1.78, reflecting the timing of performance improvements we achieved earlier than previously expected.","Now turning to next year. As we've done in the past, we intend to provide detailed 2017 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. As we sit here today, we currently see strong sales growth for 2017 of 3% to 5% over the midpoint of our 2016 outlook. We expect segment margins to be up for 2017 compared to 2016, excluding the TRS transaction in 2016, which contributes about 70 basis points. We are well positioned going forward, with further margin expansion over time, both on the domestic side, as new development franchise wins transition to production, and on the international side as large production programs move through their life cycle.","We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30% in 2017. In addition, we expect solid operating cash flow in 2017, slightly lower than 2016, as improvement from the businesses as expected is offset by higher cash taxes and required pension contributions. Of course, I want to caveat all this by saying our assumptions are based on the defense budget being approved in Washington before year-end, thereby avoiding an extended CR or a government shutdown.","Before moving on, I want to point out, consistent with our public filings, that we plan to early adopt the new revenue recognition standard in the first quarter of 2017. We do not expect the impact of adopting the new standard to be material to our results.","So if you could please move to page 11. We have provided a FAS\/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2017, as we've done in prior years. As a reminder, the range of outcomes shown are estimates. Actual results will be based on factors that are not determined until year end, in particular, the final discount rate, the actual asset returns and the long-term return on asset assumption, all of which could impact the estimates on this matrix.","As we sit here today, the discount rate is approximately 75 basis points lower than it was at the end of 2015, and would be roughly 3.75%, and our return on assets through October 25 is a little above 5%. In addition, we have been seeing downward pressure on our long-term return on asset assumption, driven by the most recent capital market expectations. Based on this, we currently see a potential reduction from 8% to a range of 7.25% to 7.5%. I would note that for each 25 basis points change in the assumption, down to 7.25%, we'd expect an additional $55 million reduction to the FAS\/CAS adjustment for 2017 compared to what you see on the chart.","On page 12, we have provided an updated net cash from pension outlook as well as the prior outlook that we provided to you in January, using the same discount rate and return assumptions. It's worth noting that the net cash from pension in 2017 is now expected to be better compared to our prior outlook. And given our CAS prepayment balance of nearly $7 billion, we continue to expect CAS recovery to exceed contributions well into the next decade. Said another way, we expect pension to be a net positive contributor to cash flow over the next 10 plus years under current assumptions.","Please note that all of these assumptions exclude us making any potential discretionary pension contributions. And just to be clear, the final discount rate, the actual asset returns and the long-term return on asset assumptions won't be known until we close out 2016. We'll provide a more detailed pension outlook on our January year-end call.","In summary, we saw a solid performance in the third quarter. Bookings were strong. Our sales and EPS were at or above our expectations. And our strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow us to continue to drive value for our customers and our shareholders. We are well positioned for continued growth in 2017.","With that, Tom and I will open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, gentlemen.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Carter.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Tom, I was thinking \u2013 or hoping you could kind of decompose the Forcepoint results and outlook, and kind of help us here since it's a bit different from what we're normally looking at. I noted in Toby's comments that the strength ex-Stonesoft was federal products and services. And you noted in the strategic review the emphasis on very large enterprises; assuming those are commercial. I know the web filtering business is now down to a pretty low level. But I'm just wondering if you could kind of explain to us the sub-components there in terms of what's growing in sales and how that fits in with the strategy. And then clearly the implied guidance for Q4 suggests a pretty big margin step up back up there for the unit. So just wondered if you could give us some color on the moving pieces and help us with...","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yes, Carter, let me do that. And actually we're very excited about Forcepoint because we are starting to see some significant moves in the marketplace. I mean yeah, the solid foundation they have, you mentioned it already. They probably have one of the largest federal groups of any of the competitors out there. In fact, I think a lot of the competitors I wish they had as much federal access as we do into the cybersecurity market. And we sell in that federal group as a commercial company. That's one. We also did mention the next generation firewall that they have that is off and running, getting a lot of traction on that. And you can see the sales on that is up. And then also in the core business, the TRITON Cloud work is \u2013 we're also starting to see significant movement in that.","The area that I was trying to point out in my discussion is one of the other areas where we've taken \u2013 I would call it our defense grade capabilities into the commercial cybersecurity marketplace and that's really on the insider threat. And so we took essentially our product which was, we call it the SureView product. We're tying that together, integrating that with the data loss prevention capability that Websense brought along, and some analytics on top of that and providing an unbelievable capability to the marketplace relative to the advanced insider threat.","And as you've probably been reading in the press, there is quite a bit of insider threat issues that are going on across the commercial industry and along different verticals. So we're extremely happy with the performance. And Toby is here, he's got the details and he can just run you through what we saw here in the third quarter and what we're seeing in the future.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, Carter, so on the numbers side for Q3 and Q4, even though I did mention the federal and some of the services, when you peel this back and decompose it, the legacy TRITON business also saw significant growth of about 18% in the quarter as well. So we really saw growth across the entire portfolio, with the exception as we expected, we've been talking about the legacy web filtering business, which did continue to decline.","Along those lines, I do want to take a second, and as Tom talked about, and as we are evolving our strategic position to align with the cybersecurity market where we see the greatest opportunities, the legacy delineation, when we've talked in the past about TRITON and the web filtering, even though I just kind of gave you some color on it, it is becoming less meaningful to us given our changes in the organization and our go-to-market approach around that.","But again, growth across the entire portfolio where we're focused strategically. If you roll that forward to Q4, from a top-line perspective, we'd expect growth rates similar to Q3 on a year-over-year basis and margin that is higher. To your question, we'd be looking at margins in the 16%-plus range for the fourth quarter. Obviously, we didn't change the outlook for the year, so we feel good that the team has a path forward there.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the color, guys.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Thank you.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Yeah. Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, George.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Hi.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Question I got is really an explanation. Is it, if I look at the book-to-bill at like you said, it was 1.15, but bookings were $900 million above sales. But if I look sequentially, funded backlog was actually down by around $400 million and total backlog was only up by $500 million. So a big discrepancy. I mean I imagine some of it reflects the mark-to-market from the weaker currencies, but is there anything else going on? Or just kind of explain how they all went together.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. I mean on the funded backlog, that can obviously be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, right, depending upon what's happening there. So, I don't think there's anything different than we may see in any given quarter. From an overall backlog point of view though, you are right, we do have every quarter backlog adjustments for various reasons, including the currency. In the third quarter of this year it was about $400 million that we had as backlog adjustments.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. And if I just follow up, IDS sales were much less than I was looking for and I know probably less than you, because you lowered the top end of the guidance by $100 million. Is that reflecting slower startup of the new programs and the high margin reflecting margin pickup because some of the older ones are ending?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. So you kind of have it right there, George. As I said in my comments, we knew about some certain radar programs and one international communications program that was winding down. So that was what we'd assume going back to the beginning of the year, but we are seeing a little bit of timing impact on a couple international programs. We now expect either late Q4 or early Q1. So that's what's driving primarily the change, what happened in the quarter relative to the revenue, the sales and then also for the total year.","From a margin point of view, I think what you're seeing is consistent with what we've been saying, that IDS towards the back half of the year has some of the \u2013 and I wouldn't say they are completing. I would say some of the major production programs that we've booked over the last couple years are from an execution point of view moving through their life cycles. They're at points where we obviously feel comfortable in increasing the booking rates there.","You saw a strong margins from IDS back in Q2, excluding the TRS gain. We see it again here in Q3. So I think things from our perspective, things are playing out on the margin line at IDS pretty much as we would have expected and if anything a little bit more favorable timing. I think some of the improvements we saw in Q2 and 3, if we go back three or six months, we would have said, would have been in Q4 and 3. So things have maybe even accelerated within the year by about 90 days. But all good news from our perspective.","George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC","Okay. Thanks very much, Toby.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","All right. Thanks.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Thanks, George.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, good morning everyone.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Jason.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Hi.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Toby, just a quick clarification question for you, Toby. Can you talk a little bit about the cash flow dynamics in the fourth quarter, and what allows you to have that steep ramp? And then Tom for you, can you just talk a little bit about the contracting environment, generally speaking? And kind of the puts and takes you're seeing there from a pricing perspective, contract terms, anything that's changing either here domestically or on the international front that we should be aware of that would impact how the business is going to perform a few years down the road. Thanks.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, Jason, I'll hit the cash flow real quick here in the fourth quarter. For us nothing's really changed there. If anything we're a little bit ahead from a cadence point of view on a cumulative basis on the overall cash flow compared to when we started the year. So if anything, that ramp up in Q4 is a little less than it was going back to January. I think you all know, we traditionally have a cash profile that's more back-end weighted. There is nothing different this year. And the underlying driver is not one individual thing, but it's primarily some significant milestone collections, really across pretty much the entire portfolio of programs. So nothing unusual from our perspective.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. And Jason, I'll break it in, your question into two parts. I'll take the domestic. In terms of terms and conditions, we're really not seeing any changes in our contracting with the department or with the U.S. government. The department, as you know, is pushing more towards a fixed price incentive fee construct on I would call production type programs than they have in the past, something we were used to many years back. It's kind of rotated back in. So I think going through the initial iterations and making sure everybody understands that kind of a construct and sets it up in a way that provides the contractors an incentive to do well. I think we're going through a little bit of transient on that but it seems like it's settling out pretty quick.","On the international side, we again on the FMS contracts, we're not seeing much difference there relative to terms and conditions. Again, there is some issues relative to fixed price incentive fee on production contracts that's actually being debated in the halls of Congress. And right now, the NDAA has some language in it about the international production type contracts at being firm fixed price versus fixed price incentive fee. And that's the only area that I see that's different. And our direct commercial sales, no difference there than we've had in the past.","Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein & Company.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Doug.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I wanted to see if you could give us a perspective on the discussions you're having and I would say internationally and that's in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Asia. When you look at priorities in those areas and you try and parse out say long-term priorities. For instance, we saw Saudi earlier this year back away from littoral combat ship. It's expensive and longer term. And you look at the near-term things, which certainly precision guide and munitions would fall into that category. Can you talk a little bit about how you see these customers making trade-offs, when they sometimes have fairly constrained budget these days?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Yeah. Let me attack that, Doug. And I think what I want to do is go back to this concept of buckets, and we're seeing these three demand areas. One is counter-terrorism, counter insurgency. The other bucket is deterrence, deterring a threat from taking action. And then there's a third bucket out there, which I'm going to say it's third offset strategy type stuff, worrying about near-peer nation threats with advanced technologies.","In Europe, I think the big one there is deterrence. We're seeing Eastern Europe very concerned in that area, and so they're looking for systems that will provide in that kind of a deterrence capability. And so we're seeing a lot of action on things like the Patriot System and then also our NASAMS system that we have at the nation's capital and we had a sale in Oman and several other countries out there. So we're seeing significant pull for those deterrence type systems in Europe.","As we move to the Middle East, you're correct. I would say it's a little different in Middle East. It's demand from both the counter insurgency, counter terrorism bucket, and then also the deterrence bucket. And on the counter insurgency, I think you can understand that. That's some of the demand, OPTEMPO pull here, for precision weapons and some other ground systems that we have.","On the deterrence side, I mean there is a concern, there is neighbor of the GCC that the GCC is concerned about and so you're getting into deterrence there and therefore you see the demand for systems like Patriot across the whole region, and so that's the deterrence bucket. And if we go over to the Asia-Pacific region, it's clear that it's most of the effort there, demands signals is again coming from this deterrence bucket, looking for solutions like Patriot advanced weapons, radars to be able to see things, ballistic missiles before they hit them and so the Asia-Pacific region is in big demand on the deterrence.","The third bucket is really coming directly from the Department of Defense, obviously for all regions in the global area to be able to essentially come up from 20 years of fighting wars of insurgency to now dealing with near-peer threats that potentially have capabilities that are at or potentially in some cases maybe better or perceived to be better than what the U.S. has, and so it's a big catch up area there. I mentioned, we did mention on the call about a significant increase in classified work. I think that's really addressing that bucket and to help the Department of Defense regain in some cases its superior capabilities over near-peer threats. And that's it.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So when you look at, when you look at -","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Does that help?","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, that's a lot obviously, so.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Well I'm thinking about it every day, so.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, I know, I know. But what I am getting at is, when you look at certain things that may have greater urgency, if you turn this all into what does it mean for your outlook, are you seeing over the next few years a greater urgency in some of the areas you just said and perhaps less in some long-term programs? Has it changed the way you've looked at these markets?","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","I think what's different here in my entire career is each of those buckets is overflowing, and so the demand signals have never been as strong in each of the three buckets and across those three regions. And you're seeing that in our book-to-bill, the 1.15 for the third quarter, 1.14 year-to-date and then over the trailing four quarters, 1.16. We wouldn't be having those book-to-bills if the demand signals isn't as high as it is and across three regions and across three buckets.","So, I have a very favorable outlook in terms of where we're going. We did mention on the call, we believe in 2017, just based on the book-to-bills we have, we'll clearly be in the 3% to 5% sales growth in 2017. And you can look to the future, but what I always go back is I look at our book-to-bills and our backlog and base our future outlook on that plus the demand signals we're getting. And I'm personally getting demand signals to go visit those regions from leaders in those countries. So this is real and so we're very, very bullish and positive in the future.","Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. So, the midpoint of your new bookings target would imply fourth quarter book-to-bill a little bit under 1. That would be the first time in about seven years. And you've just talked about how terrific the demand signals are. Is that a conservative number? And maybe give us some color on, could we have any surprises so we go above the upper end of your guide? Thanks.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Look, let me start, and maybe more with the numbers part of it and everything. And obviously we give a range, right, as you know of sales and bookings, right. So if you look and if you go to the high end of that range, the book-to-bill would be over 1. It would be about 1.05 give or take. To you point, the midpoint of the range is a little bit under 1. It's not a signal one way or the other from my perspective. We're very pleased. The fact that we've been able to for two quarters in a row effectively cumulatively add $1 billion to the outlook for the year further strengthens the bookings and the demand that Tom was talking about. And I think as we all know the bookings \u2013 in any given quarter, we can have some ups and downs or, not my favorite word, but some lumpiness there. So we're very pleased with what we've seen through the first nine months and the outlook for the total year and how it positions us going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies","Thank you very much. I'm not a fan of talking about pension, but Toby, you sort of set us up a little bit here. If we go through the math, from a cash flow perspective, it would appear year-on-year you're going to do just fine in 2017 and beyond. But from a reported EPS basis, based on sort of where we were a year ago and now, where we look at sort of the midpoint in the chart, it looks like you have a little bit of headwind to earnings. Can you elaborate on that? And is there anything that you can do to address that?","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, no, so again, I'll repeat a little bit here, Howard. The estimates that we gave you were to try to provide sensitivity around the variables that affect both the P&L side and the cash flow side of the equation. As a reminder, we will update all of this at year end based upon how the year plays out, and things could be different compared to what we outlined today. But we did want to be transparent and let everybody know what we were seeing, both between the discount rate, where the current year return is and based upon forward looking, relative to capital markets, where the longer-term ROA would be. And I don't know that I can really add anything beyond the sensitivity that I gave in my prepared comments.","You're right. The cash flow is going to continue to be positive from pension. There were a lot of questions earlier this year and concerns about overall cash flow, because of the higher required contributions in 2017. That's gotten better based upon our current estimates by close to $200 million. Our overall cash flow for the company next year, as I mentioned earlier, may be slightly lower than where we're looking at for this year, but still very, very strong.","And I think if you look out over time, while near term we may have some headwind on pensions from a P&L point of view, for an EPS point of view in 2017, we'd expect that over time even under those lower rates that I talked about, that we would see improvement in that profile, a pattern that would be similar to what we were seeing in the past, where year-over-year the EPS would improve all else equal based upon even revised assumptions in 2017, 2018 \u2013 beyond 2017 into 2018 and 2019. So I think I'll leave it at that and we'll move forward here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much and good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Seth.","Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I wonder \u2013 good morning \u2013 if we could talk a little bit about IDS, and in the fourth quarter, we've got some elevated sales implied by the guidance and we saw somewhat higher sales last year as well. But can you talk about sort of how much that reflects timing versus how much that reflects sort of a new run rate? And then similarly, it looks like the guidance implies for the fourth quarter sort of a lower margin. But if we just look back over the past couple years, seasonally the fourth quarter seems to be fairly strong, so maybe some of the dynamics around sales and profitability in IDS in Q4.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah sure, Seth. So when George asked, I told him what kind of happened in Q3 and why we lowered a little bit the range of sales for the year, driven by the timing of some new awards that now we're expecting later in Q4 or early next year. But for Q4 from a sales point of view, even with that narrow guidance, we do expect solid growth in Q4. We have some other awards that we are anticipating we'll be starting up, which are contributing to that growth, as well as some continued ramp on some international Patriot programs that are already in our backlog as they move through their life cycle there. So we have a path forward relative to the growth in IDS on the top line.","From a margin perspective, I'll reiterate, we are really pleased with the margin at IDS both in Q2 and in Q3 here. As we had talked about before, we were expecting an improvement in the margin at IDS more in the back half of the year. We've accelerated some of that into Q2 and here again in Q3, we did raise our margin guidance by 20 basis points on the high end at IDS to reflect our solid performance to date.","And we continue to expect solid operational performance in Q4, about in line where we are year-to-date, okay. If you want to think of it this way, when you adjust for the TRS transaction, the improvements we're seeing, they can be lumpy as well, right, because they're specifically tied to programs, the execution of those programs, and the timing of those events which in some cases, if not a lot of cases aren't \u2013 out of our control. And what we feel that we've done is, we've d-risked that fourth quarter in the ramp that if you go back 90 days, 180 days, the ramp that we would have had in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein. Your line is now open.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Sam.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I want to ask you a little bit about the capital deployment. I know you talk about having a balanced deployment out there, but you've also in the past talked about not necessarily wanting to chase the stock. And I don't expect you to talk about individual M&A, but certainly you've been talked about out there with regards to something in the order of $1 billion size in the Forcepoint area. And so just want to know how you're thinking about deploying capital in today's world.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, Sam, from my perspective, nothing around our thought process here has really changed. As we've talked about in the past, a balanced approach has worked well for us. We're continuing to use that here today and going forward. The underpinning to being able to do that is obviously strong cash flow generation and a strong balance sheet, both of which we have and we're focused on.","And then, so specifically from a kind of a priority perspective, we're always looking to invest in ourselves, in the business to drive growth where it make sense. That's not going to change. We'll pursue targeted acquisitions. I think Tom mentioned in his opening comments, ones that fill technology, market access, market channel type of gaps. I won't comment on rumors out there in the marketplace. But what I will say generically, we don't have as part of our plan to go after big deals, okay, that would be something strategic and opportunistic.","We want to provide the right level of return to our shareholders, somewhere as we target 80% to 90% of current year cash flow that includes a competitive and sustainable dividend and a buyback, obviously to continue to reduce the diluted share count over time, and we do as you know make from time to time discretionary pension contributions. That said, let me reiterate, because it has come up in the past relative to the thought about any large acquisitions, whether it be on the defense side, and\/or the commercial cyber side, that is not in our plan. So rumors are rumors that are out there and I'll leave that at that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thank you, good morning.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Hunter.","Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC","Tom, you highlighted obviously you've strengthened your classified bookings of late and then obviously separately strengthened Forcepoint. But I'm wondering if you can talk about maybe the dynamic as much as you can about how Forcepoint might be able to play in classified. And specifically I'm wondering what the mix is now of classified if any, and if that's a growth market. Do your people out there have TS\/SCI level clearances for example, or does the commercial nature of this business really preclude you from sort of marrying those two together, sort of like a super engine of growth? Thanks a lot.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","I'll hit it in two ways. One is I'll talk about Forcepoint and then I'll talk about the rest of the company. So on Forcepoint, it does have a federal group or a federal division. So the folks in the federal division do have the clearances so that they can go work with the different departments in the government and agencies and they can actually go into their facilities and help install the capabilities. And so that's I would call it a very special capability that Raytheon has relative to taking I would call it these commercial products into the U.S. government.","On the Raytheon side, we do a significant amount of I would call it government related cybersecurity work with the different departments in the Department of Defense and then also with the different three-letter agencies. And so we essentially handle the highly classified work through the Raytheon Company, the taking off commercial products into the government through the Forcepoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Richard Safran with Buckingham Research.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","Good morning, Richard.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Good morning.","Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Tom, Toby, I had a bit of the strategic question for you here. In addition to the bomber program, there is a lot of new starts out there like the trainer. We talked about J-STARS recap before. There were also though a number of new sensors like Air Missile Defense Radar, Next Generation Jammer, et cetera. I wanted to get your perspectives on this. Number one, from where you sit right now, do you see the Pentagon getting sufficient funding so that we can actually have a major recapitalization of military platforms and sensors?","And also as with the trainer, should we be expecting Raytheon to becoming more of a platform prime, or is that more of an exception and you're thinking about being a major system prime on sensors and weapons? If we're on a long-term trend towards increased defense spending, I'm just trying to get a sense of how you guys are thinking about positioning Raytheon in that area.","Thomas A. Kennedy - Raytheon Co.","So let me hit the first question and that is does the government have enough money for all these things. I think that was the first question. And a lot of this hinges on the election and what's going to move forward. And right off the bat, both candidates, both parties are pushing for a strong defense. So that's obviously a good sign, both parties and positions are that they want to remove the Budget Control Act caps and so which will be required to be able to fund this, you called it a recapitalization. But it's also some new capability needs as part of this third offset strategy.","We are seeing funding going into that area, We did see in 2016 the BCA was lifted and also in 2017 is looking good in terms of its budget moving forward. The question was what will happen in 2018, 2019 and beyond, and if that's really going to be the output of this election, again both parties are significantly supporting a strong defense moving forward. So as long as the funds are there and we have the Congress supporting it, I see that we'll be able to support most of this recapitalization. It will have to be timed out, so that they have enough money to cover it over the multiple years that these new systems take to come on board.","Todd Ernst - Raytheon Co.","Tracy, we have time for one more question please.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for squeezing me in. Hey Toby, I was hoping you could add a little bit more color to the margin commentary for 2017. You said I think adjusted for the 70 basis point one-time gain, margins would be up, but maybe you can give us a little bit more clarity on an unadjusted basis, how much would they be down. Or if you don't want to go that far, is the run rate of IDS you're seeing here ex the charge in the first quarter and ex the gain a good run rate to be using for next year? Forcepoint's got some structural benefits in the next year. Just more color because that 70 basis points, just squaring it out to expectations might help.","Anthony F. O'Brien - Raytheon Co.","Yeah, Myles. I'll address margin, but let me maybe give you and everybody a few comments on 2017 a little bit beyond what I mentioned earlier. And if I start at the front end of the business, we do continue to expect to see a solid book-to-bill ratio next year over 1, even on the higher sales volume as I mentioned, which we see growing in the 3% to 5% range. I will say that this growth is more heavily weighted towards our missiles and SAS business, then followed by IDS and IIS, and we also see growth again both domestically and internationally next year.","On the margin comment, I'm kind of going to stick to where I mentioned earlier that in 2017, when you adjust for the TRS transaction this year at the segment level, we see segment level margins improving. That said, obviously we're not giving details by business at this point, but since you asked about IDS and historically, there has been a lot of focus there. What I will tell you is, we do see meaningful improvement in the IDS margin next year, again excluding the 2016 impact of TRS. Although I will say that for IDS, if you're thinking of 16% or above next year, that's probably too aggressive and I'll just kind of leave it at that.","I mentioned cash flow is going to continue to be strong. We do expect higher cash from the businesses partially offsetting pension and higher cash taxes. On our tax rate, if you recall in 2016, our effective tax rate is impacted by the TRS transaction, and the gain on that of just under $160 million was tax free. So when I look at the tax rate for 2017 right now, think of it around 30%, which is more in line where 2016 would be excluding TRS. And then you mentioned Forcepoint. I think what I'll say on Forcepoint, we still expect double digit growth and double digit margins from them next year. Obviously, our goal today relative to 2017, we'll just give you a high level look where we're headed, we're still working through our process internally to finalize our views on 2017 and in January we'll update you on that including details by our businesses.","Todd Ernst - Raytheon Co.","All right. We'll have to leave it there. Thank you everyone for joining us this morning and we look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter conference call in January. Tracy?","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Mark, and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed sir.","Todd Ernst","All right. Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our fourth quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call, and the slides that we'll reference are available on our web site at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our web site.","With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby, and then we'll move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?","Tom Kennedy","Thank you, Todd. Good morning everyone. I am very pleased with both our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, and I'd like to begin by touching on a few highlights.","Our total book-to-bill ratio for the year was 1.09. This reflects strong global demand for our Advanced Solutions, and positions us well going into 2016. We finished the full year with top line growth of 2%, driven by our growth in our international business, which more than offset a slight decline in domestic.","Company segment margins in 2015 were as expected, at 13.1%, as the team delivered solid operating performance. Cash flow was also solid, providing us the opportunity to return the majority of our cash flow to shareholders, while also funding our pension plans and investing in our future growth. So all in all, the company is performing very well, and we are confident in our future.","As you can see from our 2015 results and the 2016 outlook, the global threat environment continues to drive demand for Raytheon solutions. I would also add that, in my conversations with our global customers, it is clear that short term shifts in economic growth factors have taken a back seat to ensuring the sovereignty and security of the nations that face these security threats.","In particular, let me highlight what we are seeing in three regions. In the Middle East, demand signals increased last year, despite the decline in oil prices. Tensions within the region are driving demand for missile defense, long range radars, modernized command and control systems, sensors, cyber security and precision munitions; areas that align with our core strengths.","I have been asked many times if oil prices have impacted demand. From our viewpoint, we have not seen a negative impact, and here is one of many examples why. Over the past year alone, Patriot has intercepted more than a dozen ballistic missiles fired in the region. Missiles that otherwise could have caused significant casualties and damage to critical infrastructure and defense sites.","In the Asia-Pacific region, customers are also updating their missile defense systems, sensors and other capabilities in light of recent developments there. Increased tensions related to territorial disputes and evolving economic interests are motivating allies in this region, to invest more heavily in deterrent capabilities, to protect their national interest. As you may recall, South Korea awarded us a significant upgrade to its Patriot systems in 2015.","Looking forward in 2016, we see opportunities across the region in tactical radars, ship-based radars, missiles, force protection systems and precision munitions.","And in Europe, we are seeing renewed and increased interest from a number of countries, in acquiring integrated air and missile defense solutions, providing additional opportunities for Patriot and NASAMs.","Domestically, we were pleased to see the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act, which adjusted the defense budget caps higher for fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2017, including a 15% increased in modernization funding in fiscal year 2016. These changes provided much needed funding for our armed forces, while also improving visibility and predictability for the defense industry. This will yield a positive impact on our results beginning in 2016, and then continuing into 2017. Even as we emerge from several years of declining U.S. Defense budgets are now beginning to see growth, the environment remains competitive.","To ensure Raytheon's long term competitive advantage, we have increased our independent research and development, capital expenditures, and other investments to fund the development of the advanced game changing technologies of the future. Ranging from hypersonics and cyber security to directed energy. As expected, IR&D reached 3% of our sales in 2015, a similar level is expected in 2016. ","Now let me give you some more details about our 2015 results; strong demand from global customers drove bookings of $25.2 billion for the full year; a 5% increase over 2014. Domestic bookings were strong, with a full year book-to-bill ratio of 1.04. This sets up a better than originally expected domestic revenue growth outlook for 2016, which I will discuss more in a moment. International comprised 34% of our total bookings in 2015, and our international book-to-bill ratio was a very robust 1.19 for the year. ","Total backlog at the end of 2015 was $34.7 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion over 2014. Again, providing a solid foundation, as we move into 2016. International ended the year at 43% of total backlog, compared to 40% at year end 2014. Successful execution of our growth strategy and increasing demand from our global customers resulted in return of growth in 2015, a year earlier than we had originally expected.","Our full year 2015 international sales increased 9% over 2014, reaching 21% of our total annual sales, a new company record. In addition, for the second consecutive year, we saw good growth in classified sales, which increased about 6% in the year. In this environment, we are also continuously looking for more ways to lower our costs, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers.","A few examples include, executing our strategic sourcing strategy to reduce costs in our supply chain; leveraging our centralized global business services organization to more efficiently provide back office support to their businesses, and reducing our footprint, taking out a gross total of 1.9 million square feet in 2015. In addition, we have kicked off a new complexity reduction initiative to reduce costs and simplify business processes across the company.","Looking forward to 2016, we expect to see continued strong demand, that should ultimately drive our bookings to the $25 billion to $26 billion range for the year. This would translate into a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.05. Key bookings for the year include Qatar early warning radar, the EMD phase as a next generation jammer, and SM3. More than ever before, demand from our global customers is broad-based and diversified.","Along with the strong bookings we experienced in 2015, this continued strength should position us well to deliver revenue growth of between 3% to 5% in 2016, which is better than what we had mentioned when we provided our initial outlook during the Q3 earnings call.","I would add that this includes an expectation of 2% to 4% growth from domestic customers. This would be the first time we have seen growth in our domestic business since 2009. Further, cash flow from operations is expected to increase significantly in 2016, from solid 2015 levels.","The strong fundamental performance provides a foundation for the continuation of our balanced capital deployment strategy, with the objective of creating shareholder value. Our number one priority remains executing our growth strategy and investing it ourselves. Beyond this, we remain committed to providing a competitive dividend. We also continue to see value in our stock and expect to continue the share buyback at the 2015s robust levels.","Part of our growth strategy is bringing our advanced cyber security capabilities to government and commercial customers around the world. In 2015, in support of this strategy, we increased our presence in the commercial cyber security market in a meaningful way, with the formation of Raytheon Websense. And earlier this month, we changed its name to Forcepoint to more effectively brand and position our broad cyber security capabilities in the market.","We further strengthened Forcepoint by completing the acquisition of Stonesoft at the close of the fourth quarter. The small acquisition, which is consistent with our M&A strategy that we have articulated over the past several calls, provides next generation firewall technology that fills an important technology gap and broadens our cyber security capabilities. The Stonesoft acquisition will become part of the Forcepoint business segment. We are excited about the breadth and depth of the product offerings at Forcepoint, that places us in a strong competitive position.","I'd like to close by thanking the Raytheon team for a great year, and for the dedication and all the efforts that went into returning the company to growth ahead of schedule, while continuing to deliver for our global customers.","With that, let me turn it over to Toby.","Anthony O'Brien","Okay. Thanks Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and full year results. Then I will discuss our outlook for 2016. After that, we will open up the call for questions. During my remarks, I will be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on our web site.","Okay, would everyone please move to page 3? We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in both the fourth quarter and the full year, with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all consistent with or better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the fourth quarter, at $7.9 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.24, and for the year, we had bookings of $25.2 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.09. This sets the stage for continued growth in 2016, which I will discuss in more detail in just a few minutes.","Sales were $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 3%, led by our missiles, IDS and Forcepoint businesses. International sales grew 16% in the fourth quarter, and for the year, sales were up 2%, ending at $23.2 billion. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.85 for the quarter, and $6.75 for the full year, which I will give a little more color on, in a few minutes.","We also generated strong operating cash flow of $813 million for the quarter and $2.3 billion for the year, after a $200 million pre-tax discretionary pension contribution, which was not in our prior guidance. Additionally, during the quarter, the company repurchased 2 million shares of common stock for $250 million, bringing the full year 2015 repurchases to 9 million shares for about $1 billion. As we have previously disclosed in the fourth quarter of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion of the company's outstanding common stock. The company ended the year with a solid balance sheet and net debt of approximately $2.1 billion.","Turning now to page 4, let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. As I mentioned earlier, we had strong bookings of $7.9 billion in the quarter and $25.2 billion for the full year, resulting in a year end backlog of $34.7 billion. The company ended 2015 with a funded backlog of $25.1 billion, an increase of $2 billion from year end 2014. Its worth noting that both IDS and Missile Systems had outstanding bookings performance for the full year 2015.","For the quarter, international orders represented 27% of our total company bookings, and for the full year was 34% of total bookings. And as Tom mentioned earlier, at the end of 2015, approximately 43% of our total backlog was international.","Turning now to page 5; we had fourth quarter sales of $6.3 billion, up 3% over the same period in 2014. This was at the high end of the guidance range we had set in October.","So looking now at the businesses; IDS had net sales of $1.7 billion in the quarter, and they were up 5% from the same period last year. Primarily due to higher sales on certain international Patriot programs and on the Air Warfare Destroyer program. Net sales at IIS were $1.4 billion in the quarter, down from the same period last year, primarily due to lower sales on an international classified program.","Missile Systems had fourth quarter 2015 net sales of $1.9 billion, up 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher sales on Paveway. SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion in Q4, the change was spread across numerous programs, with no one significant driver. And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense, which we completed in the second quarter of 2015. As a reminder, fourth quarter 2014 included the results for Raytheon cyber products only.","For the full year, sales were $23.2 billion, up approximately 2% over full year 2014 consistent with expectations. International sales growth more than offset the slight decline in domestic sales.","Moving ahead to page 6; we delivered solid operational performance in the quarter and the full year. Looking at business margins in the quarter, as expected, in the fourth quarter of 2015, IDS received a contract modification to restructure the AWD program, essentially separating our incentive fees from the shipyard's performance. This resulted in a favorable $53 million adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2015 for IDS. Missile Systems and SAS margins both exceeded the guidance range that we provided back in October, while both IIS and Forcepoint met our guidance.","Turning to page 7, we had solid operating margin performance for the year. Segment margins were 13.1%, which was consistent with our expectations, and as a reminder, this included $181 million for the eBorder settlement earlier in the year at IIS, worth about 80 basis points.","On page 8, you will see both the fourth quarter and full year EPS. In the fourth quarter 2015, our EPS was $1.85 and for the full year was $6.75. EPS for the quarter was strong and above the guidance we provided you in October; even after accounting for the extension of the R&D tax credit. As a reminder, the R&D tax credit was worth about $0.11 and was not in our prior guidance.","Moving on to our 2016 guidance on page 9; we see sales in the range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business. Our 2016 outlook for the deferred revenue adjustment is $67 million, and for the amortization of acquired intangibles is $121 million.","Its important to note, that effective January 1, 2016, we reclassify amortization of acquired intangibles and the deferred revenue adjustment. This change affects all businesses other than Forcepoint, which had already been reporting that way. These non-cash items will no longer be reported within the business segments. Instead, these will be reported in separate deferred revenue adjustment and amortization of acquired intangibles lines, that we have provided for you here. A reconciliation that walks you from the prior method to the current one is in Attachment G to the press release.","As for pension, we see the 2016 FAS\/CAS adjustment at a positive $428 million, which I will discuss in just a minute. We expect net interest expense to be between $220 million and $230 million. We see our average diluted shares outstanding to be between $296 million and $298 million on a full year basis, a reduction of approximately 2% to 3%, driven by the continuation of our share repurchase program, which we expect at levels comparable to 2015.","We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30%. Our 2016 tax rate is higher than 2015, primarily due to the $0.29 per share favorable tax settlement we received in 2015. Its important to note that our 2016 tax rate includes the R&D tax credit, which was permanently extended at the end of 2015.","In 2016, we see our EPS to be in the range of $6.80 to $7. Our operating cash flow for continuing operations for 2016 is expected to be between $2.7 billion and $3 billion, compared to $2.3 billion in 2015.","As we sit here today, we do not anticipate making a discretionary contribution to our pension plans in 2016. As we previously mentioned, we did make a $200 million discretionary contribution in 2015. ","Before moving on to page 10, I want to mention that we expect our 2016 bookings to be between $25 billion and $26 billion, driven by demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers, and we expect stronger bookings in the second half of the year, similar to the last several years.","Continuing on to page 10, before I cover the 2016 guidance by business, its important to note that effective January 1, 2016, we reorganized the IDS and IIS business segments to move certain air traffic systems, border and critical infrastructure protection, and highway tolling programs from IDS to IIS. We did this to more efficiently leverage our capabilities within the businesses. To assist you with your modeling, you will find the recast segment data in the attachments provided at the end of the earnings release.","Now moving to our initial 2016 guidance by business; at the midpoint of the sales range, we expect to see growth in all of our businesses in 2016. With respect to segment margins, consistent with our prior comments, we expect 2016 margins to continue to be solid in the 12.4% to 12.6% range, which is in line to slightly up when you compare to 2015 excluding the eBorders settlement.","And similar to 2015, our 2016 segment margin outlook assumes that IR&D is approximately 3% of sales. I would also like to point out, that when it makes sense, we have and will continue to make opportunistic investments in specific next generation U.S. programs to better position the company for longer term organic growth. Investments which we believe will create value for our shareholders.","At IDS, we see margins in the 15.9% to 16.1% range. I want to point out, that our full year 2016 guidance includes operating income at IDS related to an expected exit from certain business ventures later in 2016, which you can think of in the $100 million to $125 million range. Excluding this, the change from 2015 is driven by mix, most notably, we are continuing to ramp up on several new programs, including on a couple of Patriot awards that we received in early 2015 from South Korea and Saudi Arabia.","As you know, we typically see lower margins at the inception of longer duration programs, which can increase over time, as we retire risk and drive operational efficiencies.","We expect IIS margins of 7.4% to 7.6%. This is in line year-over-year when you adjust for the 2015 eBorders settlement. We see missiles margins in the 13% to 13.2% range, consistent with 2015. SAS margins are expected to be in the 12.9% to 13.1% range, down from 2015, driven by mix as a result of completing some international programs, as well as from higher business investments in 2016. And at Forcepoint, we expect margins to be in the 11.5% to 12.5% range, this includes the impact from the Stonesoft acquisition that Tom discussed earlier. Without this impact, margins would be approximately 15%.","If you now turn to page 11, we have provided you with our 2016 outlook by quarter. You notice that sales ramp up throughout the year, and on page 12, as we have done in the past, we have provided a summary of the financial impact from pensions in 2015, as well as the projected impact for 2016 through 2018, holding all assumptions constant.","As I mentioned earlier, we see the FAS\/CAS adjustment in 2016 at a positive $428 million, which reflects our investment returns in 2015 on our U.S. pension assets, which were flat, and the December 31 discount rate of 4.5%. The discount rate is up 40 basis points from last year. Looking beyond 2016, keep in mind, each 25 basis point change in the discount rate drives a $70 million to $80 million change in FAS\/CAS. ","And finally on page 13, we have provided an updated three-year outlook of the acquisition accounting adjustments, to help you with your long term modeling. Please note that you will see a significant decline in the deferred revenue adjustment over the period, and the amortization of acquired intangible assets will begin to decline more significantly, after 2018.","Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earning calls, with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet at our current credit rating going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans, as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, making smaller targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs, and from time-to-time, making discretionary contributions to our pension plans.","Let me conclude by saying that in 2015, Raytheon again delivered solid operating performance, with bookings, sales, earnings and operating cash flow, on or ahead of expectations. Book-to-bill was strong, and our international business grew significantly. We have a strong balance sheet, which gives us flexibility and options to continue to drive shareholder value, and we are well positioned to grow in 2016 and beyond, both in our international and domestic business.","So with that, we will open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Jason Gursky from Citi. Please proceed, sir.","Jason Gursky","Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the call here. I was wondering if you could just walk through the cadence for the year in a little bit more detail. Perhaps talking a little bit about opportunities and risks through the cadence for the year, what would cause things to come in a little earlier? What would cause things to get pushed out, and just kind of how you generally view the risks and opportunities for the cadence for the year, that would be great?","Anthony O'Brien","Hey Jason, it's Toby. So I think if we step back from this and look at a high level on the cadence, what you see from the revenue profile, it's not too dramatically different than last year. It's influenced by, as you would expect, the timing of awards, especially in 2015 and we had a strong back half to the year. So we see an influence to the ramp-up in the second half of the year, in part, driven by the growth and the timing of the awards we saw in late 2015. That flows through obviously to the EPS cadence, and the other thing I would add, the exit of business ventures at IDS that I talked, that's planned to be in the second half in Q3, which has an influence on the back half cadence from an EPS point of view as well.","Jason Gursky","And are you willing to offer a little bit more granularity on the businesses that you're exiting?","Anthony O'Brien","I think I'd put it this way; we constantly look at our portfolio. We talked on the call here about a couple of things, one which is just moving up some of the businesses from IDS to IIS, because we think its going to drive some more efficiencies, given how those products have matured, they are more of a service-support model. Where in the past, IIS had actually performed a lot of work on it. So we think we will get more efficiencies out of that.","I can't get into too much detail right now, beyond what I said, for the exit of the business ventures at IDS, just because of the confidentiality around it. But we certainly can talk more about that, once that is concluded -- as we said here, we expect by the third quarter.","Jason Gursky","Okay. Thank you very much.","Anthony O'Brien","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please proceed.","Doug Harned","Yes, good morning.","Tom Kennedy","Good morning Doug.","Doug Harned","I am interested in IDS, because if we go back a year ago, when you were looking forward, you were expecting some margin expansion that you would see operating margins up in the 15% range. And it seemed, as the year went on, you looked at new awards coming in, that pushed out in time, that margin expansion. But now, as you look at 2016 and if you make adjustment for the exit from those businesses, it seems like you are still at a lower margin level than one might think and one might have expected. Can you talk about how you look at that IDS trajectory now? I know you mentioned a couple of the new programs, which may put some pressure on margins in the near term. But I am trying to understand, when we can expect to get, kind of the full margin advantage one might expect from a mature set of international programs?","Anthony O'Brien","Sure Doug. Let me kind of walk through that, and try to give you some more color on that. So as I mentioned and you alluded to, we do have $100 million to $125 million in the 2016 forecast for IDS related to the exit of a business venture. I will note at IDS in any given year, in part because of the nature of their programs and the size of them, we have had favorable profit adjustments, that were significant. Maybe about the half of the size of this, if you look back over time. So this pickup is a bit larger, but it does help to offset, 2016, some of the mix that we have been talking about that you just referred to, with the ramp up of these programs that are in the early stages.","Further, as we have talked about at both IDS and across the company, we are investing more, particularly in strategic areas, where we do see significant growth opportunities. We also continue to execute on some lower margin programs at IDS, such as AMDR, the Qatar ADOC, the classified radar program that we won last year, and all this taken together is a key component of our growth story. But in the near term, it is impacting our IDS margins as well.","At the end of the day, even with the IDS margin, we have been able to maintain a solid company margin position and deliver top line growth due to the strength of the portfolio, and we continue to be focused on driving down our costs, over head and other costs for the last several years, and as you know, we have seen significant improvements from a number of different initiatives there around facilities, reductions, factory automation, strategic sourcing, expanding our shared services, working on our organization structure when we have collapsed from six to four businesses, and as we have talked about, internationally, we changed our model on how we approach international business, and that is clearly paying off from a growth perspective overall and internationally. As we now are resuming growth, we will continue to drive costs down with an objective to improve and grow earnings through both top line and margin improvement.","As far as the cadence of IDS margins going forward, I would think of it this way, as you said, if you were to adjust for the exit of the business venture, I think as we said in the past, we would expect year-over-year and continue to see IDS margins improve incrementally. Again, adjusting for the impact of the business venture, as these larger production programs that run five years, kind of get into the sweet spot into 2017 and 2018, which would drive that improved margin at IDS.","Doug Harned","So if I have this right, then you are saying that you still expect with these attractive international contracts that you can get up to the margins, the sort of high 16s maybe margins we have seen in the past. But if this has just taken longer than you probably would have expected, six to 12 months ago.","Anthony O'Brien","So I am not going to give you beyond what we have put out there for 2016, margin expectation for IDS other than directional indication or cadence. But yes, we really haven't changed our thinking around this. You got to keep in mind, as we said; in the case of Patriot, these awards generally run five years, and a couple big ones that I mentioned in the prepared comments, those are -- we are only a year into those, and its usually into plus or minus the third year of those programs which will be starting in 2017, when we normally see the opportunity to retire risk, drive efficiencies. We also had, if you recall, at the end of 2014, a major award for Qatar. Again, that will kind of be hitting the sweet spot when we get into 2017. So I won't put a specific margin bogey out there, but we definitely would see improvement in 2017 and improvement over that in 2018, driven by these large programs.","Doug Harned","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please proceed.","George Shapiro","Yes. Toby, the cash flow, even if you add it back to $200 million, came kind of at the low end of your guidance, and then you have a bigger increase in 2016. Was some of that -- something was missing [indiscernible] or you just explained kind of the walk [ph] from the 2015 number of say 2.5, to get to the 2.7 to 3?","Anthony O'Brien","Yeah so, the way to think of it, George, you're right, we came in towards the low end, when you adjust for the discretionary pension contribution. When I look at the change year-over-year, its primarily driven by a combination of our net pension funding and lower cash taxes. From an operational or program level, we see things kind of in line with the cadence that we saw in 2015.","George Shapiro","Okay. Then one quick one, what was the organic growth if we looked at Forcepoint and put it in the acquisition, so what would it have been year-over-year?","Anthony O'Brien","For the company?","George Shapiro","For Forcepoint? I mean, if we put in the acquisition you made and we put in Websense for last year?","Anthony O'Brien","So if you'd normalize -- on a normalized basis for the full year, the topline would have been roughly flat, which is what we have been expecting. You are talking 2015, right?","George Shapiro","I am talking 2015, then I was going to ask the 2016 comparison?","Anthony O'Brien","Sure. For 2015, for Forcepoint normalized on a full year basis, the revenue growth would have been flat. That would have been, higher sales of the new products, the Trident platform, offset by a decline in the legacy products on the web filtering, which is consistent with what we have been expecting.","If you roll it forward to 2016, and exclude the acquisition that Tom talked about for the next-gen firewall, we'd be looking at high single digit growth on a normalized basis.","George Shapiro","Okay. Thanks very much.","Anthony O'Brien","Okay, George.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.","Robert Stallard","Thanks so much. Good morning.","Tom Kennedy","Good morning Rob.","Robert Stallard","Tom, you mentioned you're getting quite a few questions about the potential impact of the oil price on your defense export sales. I was wondering if you could size the proportion of either your backlog or your sales of going into the Middle East? And whether you have seen any signs from those customers of any changing priorities or deferrals of orders or deliveries or anything in particular? And then secondly, do you think this is the peak as a percentage of exports in your backlog? Thank you.","Tom Kennedy","That's an excellent question. Number one is, I just did come back from the Middle East visiting our key customers in multiple countries. So my statement in the script was really based on communications that I had directly with the leaders of these countries. And what I am seeing -- at least what I am hearing from these leaders is, their number one priority is to protect the sovereignty of their nation. And then words they use, I have mentioned this before and I heard it again just several weeks ago, is that a strong defense is a strong deterrence. And in fact, during my trip, we uncovered or told about several other opportunities in the region. So if anything, we are seeing a stronger demand than a slowdown, and that's my words were, that we are not seeing an impact relative to the price of oil at this time.","I hope that gives you a complete answer, but that's what I am seeing directly from the leaders of these countries.","Robert Stallard","And just to follow-up on the backlog percentage, do you think this is about as high as you are going to get, at 43%?","Tom Kennedy","Not based on any opportunities we are seeing out there. There is always opportunity to grow, and its just a matter of bringing those opportunities across the goal line.","Anthony O'Brien","Hey Rob, so I'd maybe just add a little bit on that, just to put a little context. We expect strong bookings internationally to continue into 2016, roughly 35% plus or minus of the bookings that we -- that the range that we gave you. We expect it would be international. Keep in mind, we are projecting 2% to 4% growth domestically, as a subset of the three to five at the company level. And would expect international sales to be roughly at the same level in 2016 as 2015. So we continue to see, as Tom said, momentum in that area.","Robert Stallard","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. Please proceed, sir.","Sam Pearlstein","Good morning.","Tom Kennedy","Good morning Sam.","Sam Pearlstein","I was wondering if you could talk just philosophically about the decision you made to pull the amortization of intangibles or deferred revenue out of the segment? I am just wondering, when it comes to acquisition opportunities, doesn't that make the segments willing to pay a little higher price than they would have otherwise? How do you make sure that, now you have got the pricing right and the hurdle rates?","Anthony O'Brien","I will give you the answer, my view here in two parts, right. First of all, why we did it; if you recall back, April-May of last year, when we announced the Websense deal for that acquisition, we started with that convention, but only limited to that acquisition. And at the time, we contemplated doing it completely across the portfolio, but we didn't want to mess with the pure nature of the numbers around Websense. So we purposely deferred that to the end of the year, to have kind of a clean break going into 2016, and it obviously puts both of those elements on the same basis consistently across the company. So that's part one, why we did it.","As far as the second part of your question, are we concerned about the businesses running or willing to pay more, even if that were to be the case, we have got a pretty disciplined process here at the company. We have got a core team and an acquisition review team, that all acquisitions have to go through. I am on that, Tom's on that, as you would imagine, a few others, and through that, we spend a lot of time around valuation, looking at it two three different ways. And I won't get into any stats, but I would tell you, there are plenty of deals in the past that we lost, because we wouldn't get higher. We lost on price, for a lack of a better way to say it. So I think we got the right controls and process in place within the company, to make sure that we continue to only bid and pay what is a fair value for any property.","Tom Kennedy","And just to follow-up, the decisions on acquisitions are done at the corporate level, not at the business level.","Sam Pearlstein","Okay. Thanks. And if I could just follow-up Toby, if I just look at the first quarter, you have got the most working days, but clearly the lowest earnings. And I know you mentioned one of it was from the exit of those businesses later in the year. But how is it that earnings are so low that early in the year?","Anthony O'Brien","So you're right. There are more days, calendar days in Q1. That said, we still show growth in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. I think as you know, in any given quarter, some of our revenue depends upon, not just the number of days, but the timing of material, which is a significant portion of our cost base. We are guiding to 3% to 4% growth over last year's first quarter, and that puts our 2015 sales per day, roughly in line for the quarter.","So we don't see anything abnormal about it, and part of it again, I think back to Jason's comment around the cadence, with the strong bookings we saw in the second half of the year, especially domestically, we'd see more of a ramp on that towards the back half of the year on our programs.","Sam Pearlstein","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Please proceed.","Howard Rubel","Thank you very much. I want to talk maybe philosophically for a second also. I think I heard you or Tom say that you are willing to make some strategic investments in programs. And if I look at one of your competitors that has reported, they acknowledge taking a charge in LR\/DR, and I also am aware that you have been challenged a little bit in a classified program at IIS. So could you talk a little bit about, what you are doing in terms of balancing growth opportunities, versus making sure you build a -- call it a wall of strategic advantage in your businesses, Tom?","Tom Kennedy","So I think, number one is, we do invest inside the company relative to ensuring that we have the right discriminators and differentiators to compete across all our businesses, and not only just to compete, but obviously to win. So those investments come through the avenue of IRAD, some capital investments, also people bringing on the right talent, so that we can go and win those major competitions, because they are the future franchises for the company.","And that has been our overall strategy over the years. We look at programs that are going to have runs for decades. You know, what's the next Patriot, one of the examples is Air and Missile Defense Radar, that's going to be our next major franchise coming to fruition here in the next several years, next generation jammer win, the [indiscernible] win, these are all franchise programs, and we made sure over the years, that we have been investing in the right IRAD and the right capital to support those projects, and then also in having the right talent onboard. And that's just something that we do as part of the company moving forward.","And the good news is, we are seeing the results of those investments. And again, the results for these franchises that we won over the last couple of years, and that we intend to continue to win, as we move forward, and we see a lot of opportunity here in 2016, 2017 to 2018 already in terms of new franchise opportunities.","And so Howard, I think the bottom line is, we are making the right investments and we are seeing the right results relative to these new franchises.","Howard Rubel","Maybe just to follow-up, I want to make sure that you are not seeing the business becoming so competitive or changed the costs to -- I will call it to sustain your growth or to improve your position is becoming more costly, or more risky?","Tom Kennedy","I am not seeing it any different in the past. What I am seeing, which is nice, is I am seeing more opportunities in the last couple of years, than I saw in the prior years. So the bottom line is, there is a lot of opportunities out there, and we -- I would say, had a pretty good crystal ball, in making sure we made the right investments to be prepared to win those opportunities.","Howard Rubel","Thank you, Tom.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.","Hunter Keay","Hi. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.","Tom Kennedy","Good morning Hunter.","Hunter Keay","Good morning. Maybe a little bit of a follow-up sort of contextually to Howard's question. But we saw the German [indiscernible] obviously over Patriot last year, and it sort of baked the question about your expectations for patriot over the next few years? And I was wondering if you could talk about that, maybe in the context of how much you have invested into things like facilities and R&D and headcount, in anticipation of Patriot win? And would it require you to maybe get a little more aggressive on price, in the event that you sort of need the volume to cover some of those investments that you have made, in anticipation of the awards, on Patriot specifically?","Tom Kennedy","Well, I think on Patriot, I think the investments have come through contracts, and then the other capital investments that we have made, the normal investments we make to, essentially being able to operate our factory in a lean and efficient manner. So that's -- I'll put that in context, and let me put together, the opportunities for Patriot in context. There was just a recent announcement by the new Minister of Defense, Macierewicz in Poland, relative to his support of pursuing the Patriot program with the U.S. government. In fact he even kind of did a joint announcement with the U.S. Ambassador to Poland on that subject, with an objective to be able to get something going here this year. So that's a really good news for us, that's a very large potential program for Poland there.","And just as I mentioned earlier, I just returned from the Middle East and there is strong demand for additional Patriot assets there. I mentioned in my script, a number of -- over 10 intercepts by Patriot against ballistic region, just in that region of the Middle East. So there is a strong demand across Eastern Europe and also the Middle East for additional Patriot assets, but also for upgrade. For example, there is -- just in the upgrade area alone, there is an opportunity to upgrade 72 fire units, just to configuration of 3+. So there is upgrade potentials, and then there is also the new potentials for countries like Poland, and adding additional fire units to other countries in the Middle East region.","And I am sure you are reading the newspapers, the information that I am getting, especially of all the Asia-Pacific activities that are going on. In fact today, there was an article relative to Fed in Korea, where we also have just gotten an award on Patriot there too.","So the bottom line is, there seems to be a significant demand out there across multiple areas, Eastern Europe, Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East for Missile Defense, and Patriot is the System that's proven, and is the system of choice for these nations. That's where it stands.","Hunter Keay","And maybe Tom if you could, since you mentioned, can you maybe help us size the market opportunity for some of the retrofit work, maybe for 360 degree radar. Any context you can give us to sort of help think about it?","Tom Kennedy","Well you just [indiscernible] what I didn't mention, so that's part of the upgrade activities also. But there is definitely over $5 billion just on upgrades to configuration of 3 plus. There is opportunities on the radars that are -- its in the billions of dollars there, in terms of adding these 360 radars. By the way, that was one of the requests that I had in several of my meetings with key leaders in the Middle East. It was a desire to have our new lease, a 360 system added to their configurations. So I think that's getting out there. That capability is available, and we are hearing -- getting demand signals from customers on that.","So the bottom line is, is Patriot is a franchise. We continue to evolve it, we continue to upgrade it and increase it's capabilities, add new technologies, and its -- we are seeing increased demand across those three major areas of the world. Again Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific, and also the Middle East.","Hunter Keay","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Cai von Rumohr","Yes. Thank you very much. So Tom, I think you guys said you expect international to be 35% of bookings in 2016. That suggests that really if you do 25.5, you do about $9 billion up from what looks like 8.7. You have the Qatar award, but other than that, you don't seem to have as many identified large individual awards, as you did in 2015. Could you give us some more color of what would be driving that number that high?","Tom Kennedy","Well, you mentioned one of them, which was the Qatar EWR. We also have international Patriot greater than $1 billion worth of bookings that are in play. We have other activities in Qatar which we are pursuing, and we believe are accessible this year. There is a whole FMS in the area of AEGIS, supporting Aegis Ashore, and also upgrades on some ships in the international marketplace. For those who don't know, we do the Aegis radar and all the components and the subsystems for that radar. That alone is, for example, over $300 million. And then in the whole area of missiles, both air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, a significant demand of greater than $3 billion, across multiple missiles, so there are multiple contracts. There is no one contract and missiles that's going to do it, but that's our portfolio. We have a very diverse portfolio that allows us to add these systems.","International ISRO is over $700 million; and then we have our normal airborne radars and ISR, EO\/IR systems, that's probably pretty close to $1 billion. So I think what's different this year than others is, we are seeing demand signals across our whole portfolio on the international side, and you'd say, why is that? While we mentioned before, that we are changing our strategy. About two years ago, we went from a regional strategy, to a country strategy and into that country strategy, we focused not on the one or two customers we have had in the past 30 years, but we expanded that, and now we are seeing that. But these other customers are buying that in the order of $500 million to $1 billion programs, not just $2 billion program.","So bottom line is, our portfolio which is diverse, is now the first in international marketplace, and that's -- these opportunities are coming across multiple of our products.","Cai von Rumohr","So Tom, you have said that it takes three years to hit the margin sweet spot on five year Patriot contracts. The turn time, I would assume is going to be shorter missile programs, and some of these other programs. So should we start to see this later in 2016, in your margins or 2017? The non-Patriot programs?","Anthony O'Brien","Cai, it's Toby. I will jump in on this one. I think you'd really want to think about that out in 2017, and the other thing to keep in mind, with our international missile programs, they are essentially FMS and not direct commercial sales. So while they -- relatively speaking, have some incremental margin compared to our domestic business, it is different than if it were a DCS type of sale.","Cai von Rumohr","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Tom Kennedy","Sure.","Anthony O'Brien","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne Agee. Please proceed.","Peter Arment","Yes. Good morning Tom and Toby.","Tom Kennedy","Good morning Peter.","Peter Arment","Tom, I guess I have a question, kind of an up tempo. Its good to see your return to growth domestically in 2016, but we are also seeing a step-up in the op tempo in the Middle East, and Raytheon's position is good as any, in terms of a lot of the air-to-surface missiles, and the ground support missiles that are being utilized. I mean, how does that impact Raytheon in terms of a bookings perspective? Do you see, is it a big long lag effect, or do you actually start to have those conversations?","Tom Kennedy","No. We just went through that, and the bottom line is, we expect a range next year, an increase in our international bookings. Its going to be $8.5 billion to $9 billion range next year, which is up from 2015. So we are seeing that increased demand, and its coming, again, across our whole portfolio, not just Patriot.","Peter Arment","I guess, I was referring to the domestic activity, in terms of the Army and Air Force, spending a lot of, what is the activity in ISIS, etcetera?","Tom Kennedy","You will start to see. That's part of the range growth we talked about on the domestic, 2% to 4%. Which is interesting, we mentioned, as we haven't grown domestically since 2009. In 2016, we will see 2% to 4% growth, and that's significant for us, and its coming because of the op tempo internationally, but also in the pent-up demand that the department has in refreshing a lot of their systems. Including, some new starts in the area of radars and other systems.","Peter Arment","Okay. Thank you for the clarity on that. Thanks.","Anthony O'Brien","And Peter, I think the way you can see that translate through, if you look at the -- our missiles business, right, they had pretty good growth in 2015, as we started to see the effect of that, and even better growth that we are guiding to for 2016. So that's the start of the flowthrough, from a revenue point of view, of what Tom just talked about from a demand perspective.","Tom Kennedy","Bottom line, growing internationally, we are growing domestically. And that's pretty good.","Peter Arment","Good to hear.","Todd Ernst","Okay. I think we are going to have to leave it there. Thank you for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter conference call in April. Mark?","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day."],"17994":["Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 26, 2012  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Todd B.

My name is Deanna and I'll be the operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations.  Please go ahead.","Todd B. Ernst","Thank you, Deanna. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our second quarter conference call. The results we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.","With me today are Bill Swanson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Wajsgras, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Bill and Dave, and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill. Bill?","William H. Swanson","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon reported strong or solid second quarter operating performance, driven by great execution across the company. I'm pleased with our performance in the quarter. We continue to focus our efforts on driving efficiencies across the operations and leveraging our portfolio of advanced technologies to capture new business.","Bookings were solid in the quarter, with a book to bill of over 1.0, driven largely by our domestic and classified business. Notable bookings include awards for the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle, Standard Missile-6, domestic and foreign training and several classified contracts. Funded backlog increased by over $600 million year-to-date and by approximately $2.1 billion compared to the second quarter of 2011.","Our international pipeline remains robust. At Farnborough International Airshow earlier this month, I had the opportunity to meet with a number of our international customers. And what I can tell you is that there was considerable interest in Raytheon solutions from a broad set of both existing and new customers.  Overall at this year's show, we hosted 30 delegations and had over 600 meetings within a short time frame. I'm encouraged by what I've heard from our international customers. They continue to look to us for solutions in the areas of missile-defense, radars, ISRs, cybersecurity, Air Traffic Management and training.  In the international market, we continue to set the pace among our peer companies, and in the quarter, international represented approximately about 25% of our total sales.","I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight an important achievement in the quarter. Our Standard Missile-3 had 2 successful intercept tests, one on May 9 and the other on June 27. These intercepts, which have been compared to a bullet hitting a bullet outside the atmosphere, demonstrate a critical capability for the United States and our allies. And they\u2019re an example of how Raytheon continues to provide some of the world's most advanced technologies to meet our customers\u2019 most pressing needs.","In terms of contract awards, we received an order for the next block of Multi-Spectral Targeting System for the U.S. Air Force Reaper, UAV in the quarter. The MTS-B, as it's called, is a multi-use electro-optical infrared sensor that also provides target acquisition. This is basically the round ball that many of you see on the predator and reaper drones, and it's just one of the many products across Raytheon that leverage our core EO\/IR capabilities.","This follows an order received for the dismounted detection radar, DDR, in the first quarter, also for the reaper. DDR is a synthetic aperture radar pod that can be used to detect ground moving targets in all weather, day or night, and it's a product of our core RF capabilities being applied in innovative ways to meet the demands of the war fighter. These products reflect our strong position in the ISR markets, alignment with our customers' priorities, and demonstrate our platform-agnostic strategy at work. This strategy gives us the flexibility to place products on multiple platform vehicles and systems.","I would be remiss if I didn't address sequestration. On this topic, there isn't too much enthuse to report from where we were at the end of the first quarter. Congress continues to look at alternative courses of action. However, the reality is this is an election year, which makes coming to a final agreement more challenging. Further, the Office of Management and Budget has not rendered its interpretation of the legislation and the Department of Defense has not indicated its plan for implementing sequestration. So in this context, we continue to plan for a range of potential outcomes. And like we do every day here at Raytheon, we're focused on reducing our costs, optimizing our resources so that we can provide the best value for our customers. Whether sequestration happens or not, it's ingrained here in our culture, and you can see that reflected in our performance. It's a product of our heritage that goes back 9 decades.","This month, we're celebrating our 90th anniversary. Back when we were founded in 1922, few could have imagined or envisioned the idea of intercepting a ballistic missile in space. It was basically the realm of science fiction. Today, it's a reality. Certainly, many other things have changed since our founding but what is steadfast is Raytheon's consistent focus on excellence in technology and innovation and tackling some of our customers\u2019 really hard problems. It is what we're known for around the world and why our customers know that they can count on us today and in the future.","I'd like to thank all of those who helped make Raytheon into the company it is today, past and present. Thanks to them and today's world-class team, Raytheon remains well positioned for the future.","With that, like to turn it over to Dave.","David C. Wajsgras","Okay, thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks starting with second quarter highlights and then we'll move onto questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.","So if everyone could please move to Page 3. As Bill noted, we did perform well in the quarter. Our adjusted EPS of $1.55 was up 13%, driven by continued operational improvement and capital deployment actions.","Adjusted operating margin was 13.6%, up 130 basis points compared to last year's second quarter, reflecting strong performance across the company. For the quarter, total bookings were $6.2 billion and sales were $6 billion, both of which I'll discuss further in just a moment.  We are increasing our full year EPS guidance and cash flow outlook, which I'll address further in a few minutes along with other updates for 2012.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 4 million shares of common stock for $200 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 11.9 million shares for $600 million.","If you move to Page 4, let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Our total company bookings for the quarter were $6.2 billion, and on a year-to-date basis were $11.3 billion. As I mentioned previously, we continue to see the order book back-end loaded this year and as a result, we expect the book-to-bill to expand. We estimate a full year book-to-bill range of between roughly 1x and 1.05x. Notable bookings included $687 million at missile systems for the EKV contract for the Missile Defense Agency. MS also booked $348 million for Tomahawk for the U.S. Navy and international customers and $302 million for the production of Standard Missile-6 for the U.S. Navy.","Technical Services booked $568 million for domestic training and $90 million for foreign training programs in support of the Warfighter FOCUS program. Space and Airborne Systems booked $205 million to provide Multi-Spectral Targeting Systems for UAVs to the U.S. Air Force.","Integrated Defense Systems booked $134 million to provide advanced Patriot air and missile defense capability for an international customer. And Network Centric Systems booked $90 million on the STARS program for the FAA, and $82 million on the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System for the U.S. Army.  In addition, IIS and SAS booked $458 million and $462 million, respectively, on a number of classified programs.","Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $33.9 billion compared to $35.3 billion at the end of 2011. And as Bill mentioned, on a funded basis, our backlog is up over $600 million from the end of 2011, and up approximately $2.1 billion from the same period last year.","If you now move to Page 5, sales were in line with our expectations. When we first talked about 2012, we said the sales cadence would improve as we progress through the year in part due to the timing of the international awards that we received in the back half of 2011.  Basically, our view of how we see the year playing out hasn't changed.","By business, IIS, missiles and SAS had sales essentially in line with the same period last year. IDS had second quarter 2012 net sales of $1.2 billion. The change from prior year was primarily due to lower volume on a U.S. Navy program. NCS performed as expected, with net sales of approximately $1 billion. The change in net sales was primarily due to the planned decline in production of the U.S. Army programs. And Technical Services had net sales of $821 million, down slightly from the comparable period a year ago primarily due to the completion of the Polar contract in the first quarter of 2012.","Moving ahead to Page 6. We're pleased by our overall company margin performance. Once again, showing year-over-year increase, which is driven by operational improvements. Our adjusted margin was 13.6%, an increase of 130 basis points. And on a year-to-date basis, our adjusted margin was 13.3%, up 90 basis points over the comparable period in 2011. The strength in our underlying margin in the quarter was due to our continued focus on execution. We benefited from labor overhead and material efficiencies across the company, some of which were expected in the back half of this year.","During the second quarter, a few of the businesses exceeded our targeted improvements on a number of international programs which we don't see recurring in the second half. We continue to move forward with our productivity initiatives driven by Six Sigma: rationalizing our supply base, improving our direct to indirect ratios, finalizing our common business systems implementation, reducing our real estate footprint, as well as implementing overhead and administrative cost improvements across the company. These actions continue to drive value for our shareholders and our customers.","So looking at margins by business. IDS, IIS, missiles, SAS and Technical Services margins were all up in the quarter compared to the same period last year. At NCS, the change in operating margin in the second quarter of 2012 compared to second quarter of 2011 was primarily due to a change in contract mix. NCS margins in the second quarter were in line with our expectations for the year. Overall, the company continues to perform well.","So if you'd now move to Page 7. Second quarter 2012 adjusted earnings per share was $1.55, up 13%. The increase was driven by operational improvements and capital deployment actions, specifically share repurchases. And on a year-to-date basis, adjusted EPS was $3.01, up 10% from the same period last year.","On Page 8, you'll note that we raised our full year 2012 EPS guidance by $0.15 to a range of between $5.15 and $5.30, and on an adjusted basis, to a range of between $5.70 and $5.85. About 2\/3 of the increase is driven by the performance improvements in the business that I spoke about a moment ago, and a little less than 1\/3 is due to the recently passed pension legislation.","We repurchased 4 million shares of common stock for $200 million in the quarter and have now narrowed our diluted share guidance for the year.  And as I discussed a few minutes ago, we've increased our 2012 guidance for operating cash flow from continuing operations by $100 million to between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion due to the recently passed pension legislation. The new law will not have an impact on our 2012 FAS\/CAS expense. In addition, we continue to see the cadence of cash generation weighted to the back half of the year. Essentially, our view of the cadence of cash flow from operations for the year hasn't changed.","And as you can see on Page 9, we've included the change in our guidance by business. The increase in margin guidance at IDS and SAS reflects solid overall program performance.","On Page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations for the balance of 2012.","I'd like to take a minute to touch on how we're preparing for the future here at Raytheon. Technology and innovation, along with our people, continue to be our cornerstone, and these are areas where we continue to make the right investments. Some good examples of this are RMS's factory of the future in Tucson, and a new all-up round facility in Huntsville, both of which should improve production efficiency and quality.","In addition, our new cyber center, which we call the code center, has come online in the Washington, DC area. It incorporates our latest cyber technologies to better serve our customer needs across the company.","We continue to directly invest in R&D in such areas as multi-function wideband systems, pulse weapons, automatic target recognition, smaller and more precise missiles, resilient networks and cyber products, just by way of example.","Before we open it up for questions, let me summarize.  We saw solid performance in the second quarter and it exceeded the EPS and margin guidance we provided back in April, even as the environment remains challenging. Our book to bill was above 1 and our sales were in line with expectation. As we look to the balance of the year, the pipeline of international and domestic opportunities remains robust.  We continue to move ahead with our efficiency initiatives and are confident at our outlook for the year.","With that, Bill and I will open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Joe Nadol, JPMorgan.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Wanted to get a little color, if you wouldn't mind, David, just on the cumulative adjustments in the -- for performance in the quarter, what are you going to disclose in your Q? And is there anything you're going to call out in particular in terms of programs? And whatever you can tell us about IDS in particular would be helpful.","David C. Wajsgras","Okay, so, right. The Q will have all the disclosure that you just suggested. The EAC adjustments, I think this is what you're getting at, in the second quarter, were about $175 million, a little under a $60 million improvement from the second quarter last year. That was driven by a couple of key factors, but there's obviously a multitude of adjustments given our 8,000 programs and 15,000 contracts. From a missile systems standpoint, they improved about $21 million as the result of improvements in a land combat systems program. There was also material and other cost efficiencies in the international tactical radar product area at SAS. On a year-to-date basis, the EAC adjustments amount to about 2.6% of revenue. So in general, we run about 2% to 2.5% of EAC adjustments relative to sales, that's been the historical pattern over the last 4 or 5 years. The first half was on the higher end of the range. We do expect it to be lower in the back half. That's primarily driven by the acceleration of cost efficiencies that I mentioned earlier, much of these were originally planned for the back half of the year. I do want to point out something else on the margin profile because it's driven by a number of different factors. You have the mix of programs, meaning the stage of completion, international versus domestic, development versus production, and fixed price versus cost by contract. So if you're looking at the margin going forward, you need to consider all of these factors. From a business perspective, the opportunities are weighted toward our production and international programs over our cost and service type programs. So a way to think about this might be, if you look at Technical Services or IIS, these businesses have a higher mix of cost and service programs so they don't offer the same level of opportunities as some of the other businesses. Now for IDS specifically, the strength of the second quarter margins were due to continued focus on execution, again, some of which we had expected in the third and fourth quarters. We also achieved better-than-expected results on a few performance milestones. IDS did exceed our internal performance targets on some international programs, and again, we don't see this recurring in the back half of the year. Given the order book, particularly in the international area, we do see stronger volume from IDS and continued solid performance, particularly from factory operations.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Doug Harned, Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about international orders for the year and what you see as the timing over the next 2 quarters? And then related to that, Bill, you talked about Farnborough in some of the international discussions you had, could you talk about what you're hearing with respect to events in the Middle East and how that might affect demand for different capabilities that you have now?","William H. Swanson","Sure, be happy to. I'll run through a few international. Notification on Kuwait is taking place as we speak. We expect approval of that by the end of August. Kuwait will be for 2 to 4 fire units, roughly. We're figuring the first tranche at about $1 billion there. Turkey, because of what's going on in Syria, and so forth, was supposed to have their decision this summer. It looks like it'll be at the latter part of this year so we expect to hear their decision now at the latter part of Q4. Oman will be purchasing a ground-based system that\u2019ll probably be in $1.5 billion range. We expect that Q4 time frame, maybe Q1. We have precision munitions, in the category of Paveway, we expect about $500 million cumulative in Q4 there. Air traffic control radar is probably $200 million to $300 million between now and the end of the year. We expect missiles, TOW, SM and the other things we build, probably around $500 million, plus or minus $100 million for that. Training in the $150 million to $200 million. And international C4I, we finished negotiations in an area there and we expect that one to probably be in the Q3, early Q4 time frame. So as you can see, a rich pipeline there. The airshow was interesting for us, it was a great opportunity for me. I always call it a target rich environment because all our customers are there, and you get to spend time with them in a different kind of atmosphere, and talk about some of their problems. Clearly, for the Mideast, missile-defense is important whether you look at Saudi, UAE, Qatar, Oman, those are all areas for us that have interest in providing air defense for a number of reasons given the issues they have in that part of the world. You didn't mention the Pacific Rim, that's also very active for us when you look at the threats that they have and various countries either trying to disrupt navigation or control navigation on the seas there. So that has an effect internationally. It also has an effect domestically as people try and think about keeping the United States out of the shipping lines. So for us, we look at both of those areas and what they were talking to us about right in our wheelhouse. And they come to us to help them provide full solutions, not just products. So that's one of our strengths. So I felt very good about the airshow this year.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","As you look at this, I mean these issues have been there for some time, I'm just curious. The discussions you're having now, have you seen any change in the last 6 months?","William H. Swanson","Yes. I would say the changes were pulling out of Iraq, Afghanistan. So the U.S. has had a big presence there for the last, what, 10 years. And if the U.S. is pulling out then various countries realize that they have to do more and I think they're thinking about that and taking action very seriously.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel, Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Bill, you've talked about the challenging environment, you talked about international a little bit. Can you sort of talk about how else you've changed the aperture of the company? And also, can you discuss how you are going to be able to take advantage of sort of these, I'll call it, lower cost efficiencies going forward so that you share fairly with your customer as opposed to give it all back?","William H. Swanson","Yes. I think, Howard, I'd describe it in a number of ways. It really -- I think your question goes to the heart of sequestration and we've got 5 months to avoid it, between today and first part of January. We\u2019ve spent time assessing the various outcomes that could take place, where the cuts would come from. When you look at all of that, for us, I think I've said it before, I'm not in charge of the administration, I'm not in charge of Congress, but what we all are in charge of here is our own destiny. So how do we make sure our program performance is flawless? How do we shorten our timelines? How do we reduce our costs? How do we keep our focus on companywide productivity and efficiency? And we do it across the board. I think Dave done a nice rundown or summary of that from our design activity to supply chain to our factories. And for that, that makes us better. We compete every day and for us, we believe we have to do that in best value which means our technology and innovation has to be the best. But we also have to have the right cost structure. And what I learned from the '90s is you need to get ahead of that and I think that's what we're doing. And from that standpoint, the department will either take 3 courses of action when they do this: They'll take a peanut butter approach, they might have a programmatic plus peanut butter or they might be able to do it on a project basis. The one thing I know, the Secretary of Defense needs all the flexibility he can have because his strategy matches the funds the way they are today. So if you go and take out more money, then the strategy doesn't match the funds and it creates a problem for him and he needs flexibility. For us, that'll happen in '13. When you go to '14, it will become discrete again. They'll do it at the program level rather than at the R1s and P1s on a percentage basis. And from there, we'll know where our customers are headed. We believe they're going to be headed in the areas that the Secretary always outlines for us which is the ISR world, missile-defense, EW, command and control and support. While at the same time, I think what's important is that we are continue to invest. We are probably the largest CRAD house in the country. That's part of the fuel that goes into our engine of technology. And every quarter, we get new things like the air-soldier-personal-electronics computer and display system, we won that. So helicopter pilots and others will get information right to the source. Programs, one I thought you'd pick up on with the MORPHINATOR, which has probably got the best name yet, it'll get voted this year. But that gives us the cyber technology to be able to address the Internet Protocol with hopping in the Battlefield, so it keeps people from understanding what we're trying to do. Those are the things I think from our standpoint that, if I was a sailor, our ditty bag has a lot of programs and technology in there. That this is a cyclic business. When it comes out of this cycle, you want to be lean, mean and to have things and tools available to you. Probably the most important, and this is a long answer but it's a thoughtful question. Is that one thing that we learned from the '90s, and I learned it oh so well, is when the cuts come, the plants or facilities where you want the work doesn't have it and the places where you're not as good gets the work, and then you can never balance your workloads. Here, as you know and others know, our business systems allow us to win anywhere, design anywhere, produce anywhere. And that's the real key. When you go to the future, do you have the ability and the agility, and do you have speed? And speed is something we're working on. We're not there, in my opinion, and we're trying to get there every day. That will help us adjust to that environment better than anybody else. Okay, did I get it?","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Well, we -- it was a little different from what I had wanted but...","William H. Swanson","Well, what'd you want me to say?","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Well, no, it's not what I want you to say. I mean, the only pushback I have is these are terrific margins today, maybe just a little bit differently. They're terrific margins today, and if you can deliver a 1.05 book-to-bill, are we kind of seeing that you're being able to position yourself to grow a little bit of the business, putting aside the sequester issue, so that you could actually show improvements all-in as we look out rather than hit a wall?","William H. Swanson","Yes. Howard, I don't think we're hitting a wall, if that's the question. And from our standpoint, when I went through the international, that gives us opportunities. We still have to work hard, manage the programs. As you know and others know, international always has risk, and the way you perform is to retire the risk. I think this company does very good at that, given our large international base and given our returns. So one thing I got out of Farnborough that I can -- that I took home is that our customers are confident when they do business with us, we are going to deliver and give them the product they want. That kind of confidence and that kind of trust and respect, you can't buy.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of George Shapiro, Shapiro Research.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","Dave, I got my usual couple of questions here. What was the international growth year-over-year in the quarter? The classified growth and how much did classified account for sales? And then what happened to domestic?","David C. Wajsgras","So look, from a domestic and foreign standpoint, we said this early on that we are weighted to the back half of the year and we're continuing to track to that pace and cadence. In the second quarter, international sales were down about 5%, again, as expected given the ramp up of the international orders that we received in the back half of '11. So again, it is in line with what we had talked about on previous earnings calls. From a domestic standpoint, we were down about 2.5% on the quarter. So on the first half, the company is down about 3% in sales. Now moving forward, domestic, we expect in the back half of the year to be about break even, plus or minus 2%. And from an international standpoint, we see sales growth of 8% to 12%. This was mentioned just a moment ago, we do see the book-to-bill for the year from a company perspective to be between about 1 and 1.05. International, as a subset of that, will be about 1.1 to 1.17. So again, we do see continued growth from an international perspective and domestic continues to perform fine.","William H. Swanson","Dave, let me jump in here a little bit to provide a year-end. We expect international bookings to be 28% to 30% for the year, and the sales, as Dave mentioned, to be around 26% which means the volume will be up about 3% to 5%. And on the classified side, so far this year, bookings have been running about 21%. We expect the year to be around 15% but we expect the growth in classified to be about 20%. So we're feeling pretty good about the classified side of the business.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","And the classified in the second quarter, was that up also about this 20% you're expecting for the year?","David C. Wajsgras","Now, George, from just a pure sales standpoint, the classified was down about 2.5%, in line with the other domestic business. But again, we expect that to pick up in the back half of the year. We booked just under $1 billion in classified sales at 2 businesses in the second quarter, so again, that business continues to remain healthy.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky, Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Dave, I wanted to spend a few minutes on pension, if you wouldn't mind. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that perhaps as much as 1\/3 of the EPS guide up was related to pension. So I was wondering if you could provide a bit more detail on that. And then the second question, also on pension is just some commentary from you around CAS Harmonization, the ruling went into effect at the end of last year. We've got, since February 27, the ability of the industry to begin passing on higher rates to the government. So I was wondering if you could just give us an update on how that process is working for you and whether you're passing those higher CAS comps on and everything is going as planned.","David C. Wajsgras","Sure. So in 2012, the FAS\/CAS adjustment is expected to be just under $285 million. Looking further out, there are a number of variables that impact the adjustment and the funding requirements. As you know, these include the discount rate, the return on assets and some other actuarial assumptions, and the new CAS harmonization rules, as well as the new pension funding stabilization law. So while the discount rate environment is currently lower than it was at the end of 2011, our -- the FAS\/CAS is not adjusted for 2012 and it's difficult at this point to predict how that plays out in 2013. As a general rule of thumb for Raytheon, every 25 basis point change in the discount rate has roughly a $60 million impact on the FAS\/CAS adjustment. It's probably important to note as well that the re-timed contribution levels resulting from the Pension Funding Stabilization Law do increase the FAS\/CAS expense adjustment by between $60 million and $80 million. But again, a lot of these variables, other variables have to be considered when you're projecting that out. So let me just get a little more specific. Like I said a moment ago, the 2012 FAS\/CAS adjustment doesn't change. For 2013, given the 8.75% return on asset assumption, as well as a 5% discount rate assumption, we see the FAS\/CAS adjustment going from what we had projected before at about $45 million to just over $100 million. And it's difficult to predict after that at this point. Again, this will all be subject to change as we close out the year. From a cash standpoint, these are essentially re-timed contributions into the pension plan. On a gross level, that impacted the contributions by roughly $500 million in '12, and about $400 million in '13. After you take into account the contract reimbursement and tax impact of those contributions, it impacts the company from a cash flow standpoint of about $100 million in 2012 and about $300 million next year. Lastly, you asked about CAS harmonization, that impacts us favorably by about $200 million in 2014 and improves from there over the next few years, 2015, '16, '17. We are continuing to focus on our cost efficiencies and productivity. I spoke about that earlier, Bill addressed it earlier, and we will remain very competitive from that perspective.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And just to follow up, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that this year's EPS guidance, 1\/3 was related to pension? I'm not sure that I caught exactly how that might be.","David C. Wajsgras","Well, yes, there's a -- from the tax standpoint, the cap on the domestic manufacturing deduction is adjusted as a result of the pension contributions. Following that, the tax posture from the company was improved.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk about one of the businesses, in particular, which is SAS, in terms of just what's going on that's different there in that you saw year-over-year growth there, where everybody else has been declining? And the margins are coming in well ahead, and really why should they soften as we go into next year? And they also had a nice increase in orders as well, so just talk a little bit about what's happening at SAS.","David C. Wajsgras","Well, sure. This is actually something we've been talking about for a while. The demand for our international tactical radar programs continues to be strong and there is increasing demand for the ISR sensors that support the growing requirements for full motion video in theater. So the product lineup at SAS is healthy across-the-board. The classified business continues to be strong. And from an operational perspective, Rick Hughes and the team out there continue to do an excellent job from a contract execution standpoint. There's nothing new from a perspective of where we were seeing the business about 6 months ago.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, Dave, you've talked about that we were going to see a moderation in the buyback activity as the year progressed. Is this a good run rate that you're comfortable with for the remainder of the year or do we see it step down further as we start to head into the risk of a CR and the sequestration?","David C. Wajsgras","So we've updated our full year diluted share count guidance. I'd rather not get specific on the dollar spend on buyback. I think what's important is that we continue to have an overall balanced capital deployment strategy. Bill and I see that as the best approach for driving shareholder value over the long term. We do continue to see strong cash flow. We've performed well, historically. If you look at the 2-year average, we're still about $2 billion a year from an operating cash flow generation standpoint on a normalized basis. And we continue to invest in all the right areas from a company perspective. It's probably worth noting, again, that we did increase the dividend in the first quarter, 16% and that was our eighth consecutive dividend increase here at Raytheon.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard, Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Bill, you mentioned allusion to what happened to the early '90s in the last defense expansion. We saw quite a lot of defense consolidation in that period. I was wondering if you were seeing other people maybe in a distressed situation looking to sell at this stage, whether you might be interested in picking up something?","William H. Swanson","For us, our M&A strategy has been about the same. We continue to pursue targets that -- technologies that augment our strategic position, and we continue to pursue this strategy. For us, we think it's the best one for shareholders. The difference between now and the '90s is the '90s had a lot of consolidation at the top and our customers have been pretty explicit on what they expect on the top. The mid-tier and lower tier, there hasn't been a -- I think, your question is more on the reflection of the prices and what's out there. I think most companies still view that they have beachfront property and that it hasn't moved into suburban property yet.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Strauss, UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Could you give us an update on DDG 1000? I think you guys had talked about it coming down pretty significantly this year but then ramping back up in '13 and '14? Is that how things still look?","William H. Swanson","Yes, I think so. The -- we're working with the Navy now to finish out the third ship and get that under contract. I think that the good news is the lead ship is doing well. The software, the hardware, at least, from our end, has come together nicely. And up at the shipyard, they're making progress, building this for ship and all of us associated with it feel pretty good about where it's going. We think it's a game changer. What people need to remember is the manpower on this ship is about 1\/3 of what we're using today. So in a constrained environment, having a ship that operates with 150 personnel, plus or minus a few, and has the capabilities of the DDG 1000 is a good thing. And so we can't wait for it to get in the water and do its thing. And the new CNO has spoken very highly about this ship given what the environment we're staring into. The -- no change in plans, other than we see a reaffirmation of what we told you by the actions of the Navy.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Sorry, so up $100 million to $200 million for the program the next couple years?","David C. Wajsgras","From where we are in '12, I would say, if you look at it over a 3-year period, that's about right.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, Dave, in terms of -- you have this slide where you break out sales and EPS expectations by quarter. Could you specifically comment on the fourth quarter? Obviously, you're talking about sales bouncing back there, I know the comp's easy but then it looks like you're implying a pretty low margin in the fourth quarter. Is there anything special that's going on in the fourth quarter that would see margins drop off as far as what you're implying?","David C. Wajsgras","No, it's really addressed with the timing of these cost improvement actions that we had talked about. When we began the year, we had scheduled some of these to be completed as we closed out 2012, and we were able to pull those forward into the front half of the year. So there's nothing remarkable going on from an operational standpoint and it's really timing within the 4 quarters.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Robert Spingarn, Credit Suisse North America.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I have a couple of questions. Bill, if I could throw one to you, and then one for Dave. I think the Secretary, Secretary Panetta met with industry leadership on Monday. Did he have a message on a 1-year sequestered delay? Meaning that is he in fact, looking to shift toward near-term relief in lieu of a compromise on the more difficult to negotiate 10-year plan?","William H. Swanson","I think he outlined a number of scenarios. One of those scenarios could be, could we take the time, depending on what happens in November, to be able to think through this issue? And one way to do that is to pay down part of the first year. If you pay down part of the first year, that buys you 12 months. The Secretary would like a couple years to be able to redo the strategy, to fit into the funding that this is what we're going to go do. The problem is that -- and I'll say it this way, sequester is self-imposed. We put this crisis on ourselves. It's not a natural disaster, something that happened. We picked a date and we picked a process that was horrible to both sides. What people haven't written about is what happens outside of DoD? What happens to Education or Labor or the State Department or the other agencies in the government, and people have not realized that in aerospace, we'll probably affect about 2 million jobs out there; our own plus jobs that have the multipliers. Our economy doesn't need another reset just when we're trying to get through this. So the Secretary's philosophy is, is that we need the time to go through this thing, 24 months would be nice, but if we could do 12 months, that gives us the time and let's buy down part of the requirement early. So he just outlaid the various options and reiterated that this affects the industrial base, as well as affecting the department. Both of them are outcomes that he doesn't want because the strategy that we have today, he can do what he's been asked to do. You take $55 billion out, that gets split. The way it's defined, it affects him and affects others, and we need to think through this horrible thing that we've done with sequester.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Was there any sense that this other approach is getting any traction?","William H. Swanson","Yes. If you go to Washington and you talk to the leadership, my take is the preponderance, if not all, don't want this to happen. The real problem is, is when you ask what the solution is, you don't get it. But I think more and more people are thinking through, can we get to the $1.2 trillion or $1.4 trillion? If we can't get there, can we at least get to the first year and buy it down and give us some time to think about it. And the hard part is, is come November, people aren't sure about the results. And so that kind of keeps everybody from doing something. And then if you think of the period between November and January, there aren't that many working days in Congress, and what's on their plate is a full year's worth of work that has to be done in 18 or 20 days. So the probability of that happening isn't there. And so my opinion, we're going to see a CR. CR will probably be like last year's CR, at least that's the way we planned for it. But within that CR, they could do things in an ominous bill that could take down and pay down the first year's worth of savings that are needed. So it's still a jump ball. I wish I could tell you the answer. All I can tell you is the discussions are more along the line that nobody wants it to happen but I can't give you the solution.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And the CR comment leads me into the question for Dave which is -- and this came up in a prior question, which is there's a lot happening here in the back end of the year. You've got potentially fewer days but a lot of cash flow coming and if you could speak to that, is there any risk here that cash has difficulty flowing out of the Pentagon and receivables billed? And if you could speak specifically to your revenue guidance on MTS? Because given the army pressure, I'm wondering how that recovers so that you get better than half your sales in the back end of the year.","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. From a cash standpoint, we are confident with the guidance we provided this morning. We continue to work very well with the customer and I don't see any meaningful risk from a cash flow guidance perspective for the back half of the year. NCS is performing fine. We do have expectations for the back half of the year with respect to international bookings, as well as domestic. Some of the international specifics Bill spoke to earlier, there's a C4I program that's currently being finalized, and we expect that award here in the near term. There's virtual simulation programs that we've discussed and some other Homeland Security programs. The book-to-bill, and this is important, we expect to be in the range of 1.05 to 1.1. Again, we remain confident with the guidance for NCS, a strong leadership there from Dan Crowley, and we, from an overall company perspective, are very comfortable with what we addressed earlier today.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Myles Walton, Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Dave, first a clarification question, and you answered a pension question pretty fully but just wanted a kind of a detailed clarification. The December or January slide you put out had about $1.5 billion of required pension contribution for the '13 and '14 each, what happened to that as the result of the Transportation Bill?","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. So the -- it's difficult to speak beyond '13. But from a gross basis, the contributions came down in '12 by about just under $500 million and just under $400 million or say around $400 million for '13. It's probably more important to see how that ultimately impacts the company. So when you take the contract reimbursement and the after-tax basis of the contributions, the shift is an improvement of about $100 million in cash flow for 2012 and $300 million in cash flow for 2013. So just one more note here, pension contributions from a tax standpoint are on a different timeframe, so you address 2013 pension contributions that are made through September in your 2012 tax return.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","See, and I thought that was a straightforward clarification. No, that's a good answer. Bill, the real question for you is on the planning that the DoD would do as they look to submit their, essentially their initial comps to OMB for passback. I mean what kind of scenarios are they going to get from OMB? And what kind of trial balloons rhetoric do you expect to have to deal with over the next 3 to 6 months? Or are they simply not going to plan the -- see the sequestration as a scenario?","William H. Swanson","OMB has basically stated, I think, that they are not going to provide guidance till after the election. So for us, we're going to be in, I guess you might call it, the Never-Never Land and have to react to the press of what's written on this subject. But until there's guidance from OMB in the interpretation of the law, then it makes it really hard. So from our standpoint, we've read the law, the Budget Control Act. The Budget Control Act actually goes back to 1985, for those of us that have been around that long, to Gramm-Rudman, to when that was implemented. And if you look at it, it basically says that at the controllable level, at the R1s and P1s, there's probably 2,500 programs that are controllable. After that stage, it probably -- the department has discretion, but that's my opinion, that's not OMB's opinion. So when you look at it, that's why I said it's probably a combination of a percentage cut and then it's discrete after that. But that's Bill Swanson's opinion and OMB will tell OSD what to do. What I think people lose sight of, and this is also my opinion, this is not a DoD issue. This is a federal issue. It's a federal issue in a sense that it affects all the government and the cuts come out of the entire government. DoD is just more active because they do and have a real budgeting process that goes through this because the size and the nature of labor and material that they control. And other agencies don't have material, they have labor. So the cuts will have to be interpreted in how they do it. So it is a complicated problem and my bottom line answer is, I don't expect anything on guidance till after the election. That's why I think the Hill is talking more about what did they do and do we buy some time here so we can think through this, if that helps.","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. Thank you. We're going to have to leave it there. Thank you for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter conference call in October. Deanna?","Operator","Yes. Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you again for your participation.

My name is Jeff, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relation. And you have the floor, sir.","Todd B. Ernst","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our first quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of the call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and the printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.","With me today are Bill Swanson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Wajsgras, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Bill and Dave, and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill","William H. Swanson","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon's off to a good start in 2012. First quarter sales, adjusted margins, EPS and cash flow were all ahead of expectation. ","Our continued solid operating performance was once again driven by our strong execution. As a result of this performance, we're raising our EPS guidance for the year. Overall, I'm pleased with how the company is operating. We remain focused on delivering the best value across our broad portfolio of programs and technologies, and we're well-aligned with our customers evolving requirements. We are adapting our proven technologies for new and innovative applications. ","As an example of how Raytheon is able to leverage cost-effective solutions that can be brought to the market quickly is a recent contract we won to develop the Accelerated Improved Intercept Initiative, or as we call it AI3. This system will detect and destroy incoming rockets fired at forward-deployed forces, and it adapts Raytheon's proven missile and sensor technologies for new application in a rapid fashion. ","Another example is our Multi-Function Radio Frequency System Radar, which we affectionately call MFRFS. This system was originally developed as part of the Army's future combat system program. Now in response to an urgent operational need, we received an award to develop a Ku Band version to help better detect rocket, artillery and mortar threats. Both of these are truly life-saving capabilities for our men and women in uniform. ","On a different note, given the ever evolving nature of technology, our ability to develop innovative counter technologies remains key to keeping our defense capabilities on the cutting edge. Part of our strategy is continue to invest and develop new capabilities for cybersecurity and electronic warfare applications that are aligned with our customers' requirements. We're doing all of this, while at the same time continuing to improve our operating efficiency. ","As many of you are aware, an advantage for Raytheon is our strong position in global markets. Our International business represented 25% of our total sales and 27% of our bookings in the quarter. Emerging threats are driving demand for our products around the globe, in particular the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions. Our opportunities range from large integrated air and missile defense systems to precision weapons and missiles, to intelligence and information systems and to a wide variety of ISR solutions for both military and civil markets.  In the quarter, we have strong classified bookings, which represented 26% of the total bookings. This is yet another example of how the diversity of Raytheon's portfolio contributes to our overall success.","For the company, total backlog was up approximately $600 million year-over-year, and on a funded basis, our backlog is up over $500 million from the end of 2011 and up approximately $1.2 billion from the same period last year. ","Overall bookings in the quarter were in line with what we had expected. This follows a very strong fourth quarter where we had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11. As we mentioned on our last call, we expect bookings in the back half of the year to be better than the first half. ","Last month we announced a 16% increase in our dividend per share. This is the eighth consecutive year in which we increased our dividend, and as a contributor of our overall balance capital deployment strategy and reflects our confidence in our cash generation potential and the strength of our overall financial portfolio.","From a broader perspective, we recognize that the prospect of sequestration continues to affect the visibility of the longer-term DoD budget outlook. The risk associated with implementing this legislation have been well-articulated by DoD leadership and by many on The Hill. Whether or not it ultimately occurs won't be determined today. The debate's not settled and it will likely continue through the year. Given that backdrop, we're focused on the things we can control, and we're managing the business to maximize value for all our stakeholders. Whatever the environment and if one looks back at our track record of financial performance, you can be assured that this is what we'll continue to do. ","More recently, a key driver of our performance has been our supply chain initiative. About 1.5 years ago, we started talking about our strategic sourcing and centralized procurement efforts. We're now taking the next step, which is to optimize subcontractor management, which should allow us to drive further improvements over time. ","Before I turn it over to Dave, I'd like to talk about the company's sustainability effort with Earth Day having been on Sunday. For us, sustainability is part of our DNA. Focusing on sustainability is not only the right thing to do, it also has a positive impact on our bottom line. We've worked hard to improve our performance in this area and our efforts are yielding results. Since 2008, we've reduced our water consumption by 21%, our greenhouse emissions by 16% and our energy consumption by 9%. We're proud of these results, but we're not stopping here. Our goal is to continuously improve in this area and further reduce our environmental footprint. As I mentioned before, we finished last year with the best safety record in the company's history. Through our best-in-class programs, we lead our industry and workplace safety. ","I'm pleased with our overall performance in the quarter. The Raytheon team continues to work diligently to deliver outstanding products to our customers and to deliver value to our shareholders. I'd like to thank the team for their efforts and continued dedication. ","And with that, let me turn it over to Dave.","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks starting with first quarter highlights and then we'll move on to some questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. ","So if everyone would please move to Page 3. As Bill noted, we're pleased with the solid performance in the first quarter. And once again, both International bookings and International sales were strong. Our adjusted EPS of $1.46 was up 7%, driven by capital deployment actions and continued operational improvements. ","Adjusted operating margin was 13.1%, up 60 basis points compared to last year's first quarter.  Sales of $5.9 billion exceeded the high end of our expectations, which I'll discuss further in just a moment. Operating cash flow from continuing operations of $111 million was better than our prior guidance due to the timing of collections previously expected in the second quarter. ","During the quarter, the company repurchased 7.9 million shares of common stock for $400 million. In addition, our Board of Directors approved an increase to the company's annual dividend rate by 16% to $2 per share. We've now increased the dividend for 8 consecutive years. ","Our full year 2012 guidance for EPS has now increased by $0.10, which I'll discuss in more detail in a few minutes.","Turning now to Page 4, let me start by providing some color on our first quarter results. Our total bookings for the quarter were $5.2 billion. As I mentioned on the January call, we continued to see the order book back end loaded, ramping up in midyear. From a cadence standpoint, we expect the book-to-bill to expand as we move through the year, resulting in an estimated full year book-to-bill range of between roughly 1x and 1.05x. ","Notable bookings in the first quarter included $182 million at IDS to provide Patriot engineering services for the U.S. and international customers and $90 million to provide engineering services production and support for the Aegis weapon system for the U.S. Navy. ","Missile Systems booked $497 million for the newest version of the AMRAAM missile for the U.S. Air Force and international customers. MS also booked $172 million for the AIM-9X sidewinder short-range air-to-air missile for the U.S. Navy and international customers, and $171 million for the development of SM-3 for the Missile Defense Agency. ","NCS booked $81 million on the Navy multiband terminal program. Space and Airborne Systems booked $159 million to supply radar spare parts on the APG-63 for an international customer, $99 million on a radar performance-based logistics contract for international customers, and $77 million for the production of radar warning receivers for the U.S. Navy.","Technical Services booked $119 million for foreign training and $68 million for domestic training programs in support of the Warfighter FOCUS program. In addition, IIS and SAS booked $284 million and $925 million respectively on a number of classified programs.","Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $34.3 billion compared to $35.3 billion at the end of 2011. Our backlog at the end of the first quarter of 2012 was approximately $600 million higher than the same period last year. And as Bill just mentioned, on a funded basis, our backlog was up over $500 million from the end of 2011 and up approximately $1.2 billion from the same period last year. ","If you move to Page 5, sales were ahead of our expectations, driven by international customer demand. Booking at sales by business, 5 of the 6 businesses had sales essentially in line with the same period last year. NCS had net sales of $1 billion in line with our expectations. The change in net sales was primarily due to the planned decline in production of U.S. Army programs.","Moving ahead to Page 6, we're pleased by our overall company margin performance, once again showing year-over-year increase driven by operational improvements. Our adjusted margin was up 60 basis points to 13.1%. Our focus on execution, productivity and efficiency across the board continues to be reflected in our financial results. ","So looking at the business margins, IDS, IIS, MS and SAS margins were up in the quarter compared with the same period last year. At IIS, margins were up 120 basis points over last year's first quarter, excluding the U.K. BA letters of credit adjustment. I do want to point out that IIS also benefited from $8 million related to an insurance recovery for legal expenses.","At NCS, the change in operating margin in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the first quarter of 2011 was primarily due to the production program efficiencies last year.","And the Technical Services, several minor favorable items in the same period last year drove the difference in operating income and margin. These included a contract modification, contract extension and a legal settlement. Overall, the company continues to perform well. ","So turning to Page 7, first quarter 2012 adjusted EPS was $1.46, up 7%. The increase was driven by capital deployment actions, specifically share repurchases, and operational improvements, partially offset by a higher tax rate due to the expiration of the R&D credit. As a reminder, the R&D tax credit is not included in our guidance this year. ","On Page 8, you'll note that we raised our full year 2012 EPS guidance by $0.10 to a range of between $5 and $5.15, and on an adjusted basis to a range of between $5.55 and $5.70. I'd like to point out that the increase is primarily driven by operational improvements.","We repurchased 7.9 million shares of common stock for $400 million in the quarter. We expect the quarterly repurchase amount to moderate for the balance of the year, which is reflected in our share count guidance.","And as you can see on Page 9, we've included the change in our guidance by business. The increase in margin guidance reflects the results from our continued efforts on productivity and efficiency initiatives. Importantly, we continue to pass along substantial savings to our customers. ","On Page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, earnings per share and operating cash flow from continuing operations for the balance of 2012. ","We saw a good performance in the first quarter compared to both Q1 2011, and also the initial outlook for Q1 2012 that we provided in January. To put this in perspective, we were able to implement improved productivity and efficiency initiatives, along with accelerated volume tied to customer demands on a number of programs. This resulted in an improvement in our performance and our outlook.","Okay, so now let me summarize our overall performance in the first quarter. While the environment remains challenging, we had solid sales and strong margins, EPS and cash flow. As we stand back and look over the last 4 quarters, there are several items I think that are important to highlight. Our bookings have been strong, with a trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio of 1.08x. Our operational performance has also been strong, with adjusted margin exceeding 13% over that same time period. We're in a good financial position with net debt of just over $1 billion. We raised our dividend 16% in the first quarter and are raising our EPS guidance for 2012. ","We remain well-positioned in key areas and are aligned with the priorities of our global customers. And we continue to drive the business to maximize value for our customers and shareholders. ","With that, Bill and I will open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Dave, I was wondering if you could just walk through the rest of the year and the cadence. And maybe offer up some qualitative comment around why we're seeing a bit of a degradation in both revenues and earnings relative to the guidance that you gave earlier this year. Is it just a bit of conservatism based on the environment that we're in today?","David C. Wajsgras","No. We are feeling very positive about the results in the first quarter. From a sales standpoint, we exceeded our initial guidance by about $200 million, and that was primarily driven by increased customer demand for certain of our programs. You'll recall that the end of last year, we received some large international air and missile defense programs, and we're off to a good start in that area. Let me just kind of put things in perspective. So if you look back, 2011 was a strong year, and we discussed in January the results of last year. We expected margins to moderate in 2012. Q1 came in stronger than we expected. This was partially due to some timing and a few small non-recurring items. Without these items, we're still posting margins in the high 12% range. I'll repeat some of what I went through a few months back that I mentioned on the fourth quarter call. There is a shift in our backlog and our sales profile this year versus last year, and it's weighted more toward international customers. And within the International business, we're also seeing mixed impacts driven by the stage of maturity of some of these programs. We want -- like I just said, we want some large programs at the end of last year. These are longer in duration and slower to ramp up, and typical domestic awards of similar size. So we're be impacted by mix in 2012, along with the continued completions and wind down of some later stage production programs in our domestic backlog.  So with all that said, we are accelerating the ramp up of some programs, and this is resulting in a shift in our sales cadence compared to prior guidance, as well as some efficiencies from a margin standpoint, in particular at IDS.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays Capital.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have 2 bigger picture questions, one for each of you. Dave, I wondered if you might speak to some of the things you and your peers, and for that matter, the DoD customer might begin doing; the sort of contingency planning exercise for the sort of looming wall of sequestration. I'm sort of interested in things around workforce planning, past management, contracting. What sorts of things are you guys envisioning as having to do from a contingency planning standpoint if this gets closer and we sort of progress through the year?","David C. Wajsgras","So I'll start, and I'm sure Bill wants to mention a few things. We've talked about this on the last couple of earnings calls. First of all, we've gone through a number of different planning scenarios, and I think the best way for me to put this is we are prepared to operate effectively under any given industry conditions. So without getting specific, because at this stage it's inappropriate, just given where we are and all the discussions taking place in Washington, we are confident that we'll continue to perform well, irrespective of how this actually plays out. It's important to keep in mind we have a very broad portfolio. Close to 40% of our backlog is international. That's obviously, I think, an important differentiator and competitive advantage for the company. We have over 8,000 different programs and technologies. And we continue to manage the business in a very cost-effective manner. We talked about this in the past, we have -- 7, 8 years ago, we embarked on a strategic initiative to implement company-wide information technology systems from a factory standpoint, from an HR standpoint, from a supply chain standpoint and from a people standpoint. So that gives us a platform to be very flexible, irrespective of how things play out. So, yes...","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just to kind of expand on that, just in one area, as you think about cash management, is it something where you want to preserve cash as we get later in the year and protect in case -- should you decide to sell fund some contracts? Or how should we think about cash management in the latter part of the year?","David C. Wajsgras","Right, so we've provided our cash guidance, and again, this was thoughtful and talked about on the last call. From an environmental standpoint, not much has changed from the last call, so we wouldn't expect any change from our capital deployment plan all things considered.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, and one for Bill. Bill, I think there's something like 6 cyber-related bills making their way around Congress this week. And I wondered if you might tell us what, if anything, this means for the future of this domain from your perspective. I mean, does any of this legislation have a chance of passing? And if it did, does it signal new areas of risk or opportunity, or if nothing else more funding?","William H. Swanson","One, I think what I would say is it's a good healthy debate that's taking place in the cyber arena of what to go do. And for me, I always remember something that Secretary Gates had said that when he first went into office, he really wanted to get a definition of what to go do in cyber. And some 4 years later plus, there still wasn't direction of what to go do. And clearly, we now see some of that direction taking shape of who calls the ball and what action to take at least from what I'll call the sword aspect of cyber, which is the attack or counterattack. And for me, it's taken a while for this to gel, but I'm encouraged that Congress is looking at it or having a debate. They're talking to all aspects, whether it's Facebook or Twitter or the people from Google or Microsoft, and they're talking to us and they're trying to take responsible action. The good news is there is attention to this problem, and we need attention and I think attention is healthy. And so I view it as positive.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMC.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Start with NCS, and we know that's where much of the Army exposure has been and the supplemental exposure. I was wondering if we could step back and look at the sector today, where it is today with the $1 billion of sales in the quarter, maybe the profile and how it's changed the last couple of years and what you see going forward.","William H. Swanson","While traditional sales of Army products have declined at NCS, consistent with the drawdown, I believe NCS is well positioned on our Army's new platforms, such as the ground combat vehicle, the modernization of their electro-optic sights, we're going from second gen to third gen on the existing vehicles and fielding advanced battlefield radars and the new radars, which are really sense and warn radars like MFRFS, which is important in the MFRFS radar for your benefit if you didn't know, or if you do know I'll just repeat it, is that radar is really the primary sensor to help execute the Army's new Counter Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar, C-RAM mission. And as I mentioned in my remarks, the AI3 program, that particular missile uses a MFRFS radar to help it in the counterattack. So we look at that part of the business. As the Army transitions, we're going to transition with them. The next area where NCS works in is in the satellite terminal business. There, the Army SMART-T program has been on track, and we're ramping up deliveries. The Navy's multiband terminal program has been awarded the production, and that's starting to ramp up for us. And of course, the Air Force's MMPU program positions us well in the satellite terminal business. And we see NCS positioned well where others have ran into trouble in that area. We've just recently completed our NATO air command and control system, we call it ACCS, which is the largest software program of its type in the world. And we just got awarded an initial Q1 award to add missile defense capabilities for NATO into that. So that's bodes well for Europe and our systems there. And then recently, as you probably know, the U.S. government decided to pursue alternatives to JTRS, the ground mobile radar and airborne maritime fixed radios. And that's created a real opportunity for us in our ARC-231 radios and our MAINGATE mobile ad hoc networking radio gateway. For us, we believe in the future here. One of the discriminators is passing full video across the battlefield and supporting large node networks. And none of the current JTRS radios can do that, but MAINGATE's able to do it. And then the other thing I would point out is NCS is one of our -- they win most of the CRAD work within the company. So we see the transition that has taken place with the Army, changing their focus, going more to smaller and on the run. And NCS is adapting with them, and we see the back half of the year being where that starts to change. So everything's kind of consistent with what we saw in the transition, and they've been performing well from an operational point in doing that with no surprises at all, if that helps.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Would you say that we're much of the way through that transition? And if this was close to a $5 billion business, a couple of years ago, obviously the war spending was a big part of that. Margins were over 14%. So margins come down as you shift towards some of the newer programs and sales are coming off, but are we in the fourth inning or the eighth inning if we -- over a multiyear period of time?","William H. Swanson","We're probably in about the sixth or seventh inning in that, probably standing up and looking at where we're at. We expect some awards here in the second and third quarter, which bode well for them as they start to do it. So everything is consistent. We went through this, if you'll remember, because you followed us long enough. Our TSE transition through one of these and came out of it very strong, and we expect the same thing for NCS. And that's the nature of our portfolio. You look at it. We'd love for everything to be hitting on all 8 cylinders, but it doesn't happen all the time. So what you have are other businesses that carry the load and as you adjust. And that's why we love our portfolio.","Joseph Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Just a quick one for Dave, if I might. On IDS, you're -- you got 3 really solid margin quarters now in a row, 17%, 18%. You boosted your guidance, but it's still below where you've been in the last 3 quarters. I'm sure there's been some risk reduction there. Can you just give us a sense as to whether there's -- those contracts that you've been booking, the positive adjustments, are those falling off now or is there still more opportunity the next couple of quarters?","David C. Wajsgras","No, that business is performing well. It is the business that it focuses on the larger radars and the air and missile defense systems. I'll repeat what I said a little bit earlier, they did -- they were able to secure some large awards, both domestically and internationally at the end of last year. The team over there continues to focus on the productivity side and on the cost efficiency side. They have posted, I would say, very strong results. We were very pleased with how the first quarter played out. Some of this was due to timing. The timing of some of the productivity initiatives being pulled ahead to the first quarter that were anticipated later in the year. But with that said, I would suggest the higher end of the margin range is probably the appropriate way to think about IDS for the balance of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Actually, I guess, Dave, I wanted to just follow-up on that last comment, which is just relative to January, a lot of improvement in terms of the margin outlook for the different segments, and it may only be 20 basis points here and there. But can you talk about things that you had been worried about that you've retired in terms of risk and why things would've changed so much in just a couple of months?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, we had strong results in the fourth quarter of last year, as I'm sure you recall. And there is a broad company-wide focus on execution, and on again, I'll repeat it, the productivity initiatives. And we are seeing some strong and positive results as a result of this focus by all areas of the company. Supply chain is doing an outstanding job and has implemented a number of new initiatives, both with respect to material procurement and subcontractor management. And we've continued to take cost out of our G&A and general overhead structure. And this is resulting in a margin profile that is slightly exceeding what we had initially anticipated. As we move further along with some of these programs, and we're off to a good start and solid launches, we're able to retire some early program risk. But by and large, it's around the execution side from a productivity standpoint.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then you mentioned in one of your earlier comments about some onetime items that did help, can you quantify the insurance recovery in IIS, and was there anything else that you would consider onetime?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. So the IIS insurance recovery was about $8 million. It was worth about 100 basis points to IIS. But let me make this point because I think it's important, when you normalize IIS operations for the letter of credit last year and the insurance recovery this year, they're up about 20 to 30 basis points operationally. From a non-recurring or onetime event standpoint, the only other item of note would be a consolidation of a couple of related contract in SAS, where we were able to realize some material and labor efficiencies that was originally planned for the second quarter. And we were able to affect that in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","Bill, the usual question I ask, I mean, can you give us the international sales growth in the quarter, the classified sales growth, and then by deduction, how much the domestic x classified change?","William H. Swanson","Let me take a shot at the international. As I mentioned, 27% of the bookings were international and about 25% of the sales were there. We still think for the year that bookings are going to be around 30%, plus or minus. Sales should be 26%, plus or minus and that'll probably internationally mid-single-digit kind of growth for us as we look at it. Classified, as I said, was strong for us with 26% of the bookings. We expect classified to be around 15%, plus or minus a little bit there, which will be double-digit growth year-over-year. Sales will probably be on the flattish side on the classified, but pump is really getting primed here so we'll feel better about '13 as we look at it and go into it. And so from our standpoint, the international is offsetting kind of the weakness that we see in the domestic, which is kind of related to inflation being that percentage of inflation taking a negative. It's kind of how I look at it if that helps.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","Yes. So do I conclude that mid-single-digit growth in international was for the quarter, as well as what your expectation is for the year?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. So George, this is Dave. So let me just get a little more specific. So sales overall were down about 2% quarter-over-quarter. Domestic -- overall domestic was down about 3% and foreign or international was up about 2%. Within the domestic, classified business, was slightly less than breakeven. So it was down about 1%, and all other domestic was about 3.5% down.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","Okay, that's good color, Dave. And then I just wanted to ask a more general one. I mean, this is like the first quarter in a long time where you've actually been better than what your sales projection is. I guess my question is, is that due to being overly conservative because of missing last year, or are things somewhat better so that your reach is still being conservative by not raising the sales guidance for the year? Or it's just the mix that you talked about in your conversation?","William H. Swanson","That was a lot of questions there, George. I think easiest answer for us is we saw strong demand and we see some customers asking for things even earlier. So we have the ability to ramp that up, and I think Dave covered that in his remarks. It's not about being conservative. It's just that there's some good demand for the product.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Bill, another high-level question, if I may.","William H. Swanson","Sure.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","As we've looked forward, it seems like OSD is actually starting to think about the possibility of a sequester. Sec Def [Leon] Panetta talked about officially looking into it, preparing in the summer, but I suspect they're starting to do that now. And even if we get a negotiation or decision from Congress in the lame duck session, it may be too late to avoid some impact to Q1. So on that basis, from what you're hearing about what's going on in D.C., do you think they're contemplating this across-the-board type scenario? Or are they starting to compartmentalize areas of focus?","William H. Swanson","Yes. I would tell you that, at least my views on The Hill, no one likes sequestration, no one has a plan that everyone likes to avoid it. So therefore, I don't see anything happening to November. Come November, everybody's got everything happening during a lame duck session. I don't see the lame duck session being able to do everything that everybody's asking it to do, so we end up in the January timeframe much like you've just articulated. And the one thing that we've got to think about is that this is not only defense. This is state and education and housing and energy, and their budgets get completely whacked. And so my view is that we're going to go into a holding period come January, and then we're going to take a timeout for about 12 months to figure out what to go do. And the outcome is not anything that anybody wants to live with. The other part that I think we lose sight of is we're in an industry that does not change dramatically overnight. There are -- you have to look at companies' backlogs, you have to look at programs, and I don't see and I've never heard anybody talk about a peanut butter approach to this problem. If they're going to solve it, they're going to have to solve it with some very hard programmatic cuts, and they'll be after things that are large in nature not across the board, because everyone has learned or at least if you've been in business or been associated with our budgeting process, that when you use the peanut butter, all you do is push the problem to the right and the problem gets bigger. And I've been encouraged that I have not heard that as a solution, if that helps.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, well -- and then for my follow-up, if we can just bring this now down to the Raytheon level. When you take what you just said and then throw in the possibility of a fiscal '13 CR in Q4, how would you and\/or Dave assess your risk essentially to the guidance by segment toward the end of the year?","William H. Swanson","I think the way I would answer your question is, is that CRs have become a way of life. And in our guidance, we have planned for what we think is what happened last year, you go down to the wire and then something happens. So that's kind of got to be the norm. Everyone I've talked to on The Hill, no one wants to repeat going all the way to April of the following year with the CR. I think everybody's experienced that pain and what that causes. So I would tell you, we're planning the kind of activity that we saw happen last year, and we put that into our thinking caps and into our guidance as we look at it. The other thing that I want to point out is you all know we're a process company. So we have plans in place if something went up, if it stayed flat and if it went down. And one of the things that I'm extremely proud of is our workforce planning. It's something that we think is world-class, and it helps us be able to -- they've started to articulate our IT systems, but the way I like to think of it is we can win it anywhere, we can perform it anywhere and we can deliver it anywhere. And that's how we've kind of set up the company to make sure, during these headwinds, you have the flexibility and that you don't end up with your work in the wrong places.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Bill, which segments have the greatest amount of variability, though, as this plays out?","William H. Swanson","Oh, boy. If I thought about it, you have to look at the funded backlog of each of them. And if you look at the international, those aren't affected by it. So you've got to take out 26% or 30% of our business. And so, it really makes it hard. I don't know how to answer your question in that way because what I'm now going to start speculating on is what programs get cut and what don't. And that's really our proprietary information, I guess I'd say it.","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. And I think you need to consider the way the various customers are going to plan through fiscal '13 and beyond. So it's difficult to handicap which product areas are affected more than others or less than others, because much of it will depend on the situation within that particular customer group.","William H. Swanson","And Dave, I want to go back. We have the fiscal '13 budget right now today. There were no surprises for us. We're not hearing anything that deviates from what we have in our plans. Our programs are performing, and we've got to remember that ISR, EW, Cyber are areas where the department is focused well on and there's not going to be changes there. And the other thing that happens is when something gets cut, there's still a need. So something has to go back in its place. And a good example of that is when Enlows [ph] had its issues, Griffin now has come back in and filled it. So it's not a static world. It's dynamic. And so when you look at what happens over in A, you react in B.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Bill, you mentioned the 26% bookings were classified. It seems really high. So I'm just kind of curious, is that a monolithic one or 2 programs or is this a release of classified bookings? And then conversely, I guess, the implied nonclassified domestic bookings looked -- the run rate there looked to be relatively light. Can you just talk about the 2 dynamics there? Maybe there's some sort of reclassification of what's classified or not.","William H. Swanson","No. I think it's on the call in January, we talked about this being the year that was back end loaded. And so when you look at it, the back end loaded is not only international, but it's also domestic. But on the classified side, we had a few good programs that came in, in the quarter that the timing of them is plus or minus a month or 2 here or there but they all stacked up and they came in nicely and they've primed the pump for a couple of our businesses really driven by SAS and IIS.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just a clarification on the international sales and the sequestration, do you actually have kind of full clarity that FMS sales won't essentially be handicapped by the fact that they have to go through the DoD from a contracting perspective?","William H. Swanson","No, I don't see that. I actually see good help from our DoD partners on the FMS side, because you have to think about it in a way. For us, the FMS helps keep our rates in check and in control because if we can put these systems into our plants, they carry a burden of the overhead and help our domestic customers from a rate point of view. So we've got sophisticated domestic customers that understand that. So it's in their best interest to help us say, on Patriot or other programs, that our FMS for us or in our missile programs, they help load our factories and give us a good competitive advantage.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess I was just thinking mechanically, a lot of the contracts are going through the same program offices who are going to be under massive amounts of stress for various reasons. I'm just curious if you think that they'll be able to essentially prioritize to the FMS where the money is.","William H. Swanson","Yes, I do because these things are not pop-ups. If you saw the planning that we go through on, say, a TPY-2 radar sale to UAE, it's in conjunction not only with the country but with the Missile Defense Agency, with the State Department, there's a lot of coordination on that. And you lay it out so you look at your workflow and you determine your peaks and valleys. And we all try and work in unison to understand that flow and give some insight on both sides. So I think this is where we've got a great working relationship.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Robert Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So on the export, I was wondering if you could give us any updates on the timing of some of your large awards, because sometimes these can move around, and whether you've seen any progress in the U.S. with regarding opening up more military product for export.","William H. Swanson","Two-part question, the international for us, the big one's still out there, or -- probably second half are Kuwait relative to some new fire units for them. We expect here sometime in the third quarter, fourth quarter on Turkey, on their decision. We've got ground-based air defense in Oman that will be in the last half of the year. We've got Paveway awards throughout the year that represent $400 million to $500 million in business. Air traffic radars are $200 million to $300 million, they're sprinkled throughout the year. Missiles, we expect some short-range missile sales, maybe in about the $600 million range, mid 3 quarters of the year. Training will happen in the second half, probably, say $400 million. And then we've got some international C4I that we're hoping to bring in this quarter. If not, it'll be the first part of Q3. Relative to releasability, we see some attention there. It moves slowly. But I think as the domestic budget gets under pressure, as I was just talking about a minute ago, we see our customers view the international business as being good for them too, because it helps control the price or the cost of their programs that run through our factories, if that helps.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Dave, I want to go back to sort of your comments you talk about mix and performance as sort of being the driving factors pretty much across the board for all of the businesses. And Bill talked a lot about mix. Could you talk about, again, some of the initiatives that you're undertaking and what it means when you say productivity? Does that mean more outsourcing, does it mean a change in the way you're speeding processes? Could you elaborate a little bit? And what kind of a runway do you continue to see with these items?","David C. Wajsgras","Sure. So obviously, Howard, it's a multitude of different areas, and I think a very good question to put some color on this. From a -- there is the basic, such as looking at our G&A structure. We look at the travel and outside services and the way we manage those types of areas and cost-reduction opportunities from that standpoint. We continue to expand our shared services activity and become more efficient on -- or with respect to a number of what I would term back office activities. Much of this is underscored by our approach we take, which is -- I spoke about this earlier, which is driven by our Six Sigma approach. And these bear out continued results quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. From a manufacturing standpoint, we continue to improve factory process across the board through both lean initiatives, as well as Six Sigma initiatives. Our touch labor continues to improve. I think the best way to look at this is what we call our wrap rate, which is basically the overhead dollars that are applied to our products. We have essentially held that flat, and in many areas, decreased it for the last number of years, and we're seeing that trend continue as we go into 2012 and 2013. There is a meaningful amount of the cost structure that is tied to our material space, both direct material, indirect material and subcontractors. We embarked on a number of initiatives a couple of years ago. They continue to bear out fruit. I may have mentioned earlier that we've gone from roughly 30,000 suppliers a few years ago to about 12,000 suppliers today. And we continue to gain both quality and economic improvements from that initiative. We are now working closely with our major and even our smaller subcontractors to take a meaningful cost reduction and embark on meaningful quality and delivery improvements. They're already doing a fine job and we're suggesting that they begin to implement the same type of initiative that we did a number of years ago.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Sort of -- part of it's like, for example, you're reducing the number of trailers that supported Patriot in the past. So there's a whole host of might've been 3 trailers and now it's one. I mean and there's a number of things like that. Is that sort of also -- which really is more engineering driven? Is there a whole initiative on that, that continues as well?","William H. Swanson","Howard, let me jump in here. If you remember the old Patriot, we can basically clearly get all of those 3 trailers and one trailer now and have room left over. So one of the things that engineering does is the tremendous job of taking technology and adapting it to make our products more affordable and more capable. I look at a JSOW missile, for example. What we used to be able to do and what we do, we can adjusted it in flight today and have it communicate back awareness. And that never existed before and you do it in the same airframe at a lower cost. So yes, a lot of it has to do with the engineering productivity in our designs.","Todd B. Ernst","Okay, we'll have to leave it there. Thank you for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter conference call in July. Jeff?","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Chanel, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations.  Please proceed.","Todd B. Ernst","Thank you, Chanel. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our third quarter conference call. The results we announce this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.","With me today are Bill Swanson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Wajsgras, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Bill and Dave and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Bill, I would like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.","William H. Swanson","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another solid quarter. Our operating margin, EPS and cash flow were above expectation. Overall, the businesses executed well in the quarter. We remain focused on reducing our costs, improving our productivity and delivering innovative, affordable solutions to our global customers. As we said on the last call, we expected bookings to ramp up in the last half of the year, and our third quarter orders came in strong at $7.3 billion. Notable awards included more than $1.2 billion for the Standard Missile-3, which follows on 2 successful intercepts that we had in the second quarter. Our classified book-to-bill was approximately 1.2 and has been above 1 every quarter this year. We also received significant awards for domestic and international training.","In addition, I'd like to highlight one of Raytheon's core market areas, C3I or command, control, communications and intelligence. Within this area, we're a leading provider of strategic communication terminals. We currently are providing the Navy Multiband Terminal or NMT for the Navy, as well as the Secure Mobile Anti-Jam Reliable Tactical Terminal, also known as SMART-T to the U.S. Army. Adding to our success in this area, during the quarter, we are awarded a $70 million competitive development contract for the FAB-T program. This is a significant effort, and it enhances our secure communications position within the U.S. Air Force as well. FAB-T will allow communications between military aircraft, ground sites and the new higher data rate satellites, and like the systems for the Navy and the Army, it will allow secure protected communications for our customers' most sensitive missions.  Also, during the quarter, the Air Force awarded us a steady contract to help define the next generation of tactical protected SATCOM systems. These wins, plus our existing franchise, positions us well for the future.","Our international pipeline is strong, with Kuwait Patriot completing the congressional approval process in late August, and we expect to book an award by the end of the year. Other international opportunities are proceeding through the process, including a large precision munitions award, a C4I system, a Rolling Airframe Missile, and just -- these are just a few among many others that we are pursuing in the fourth quarter.","Over the past years, we've pursued a strategy of growing our international business, and I'm encouraged and pleased by the increasing number of international opportunities for the company. At the same time, as we know, the timing of international awards is always a factor. It's the nature of the business. The bottom line is, for 2012, combining our strong domestic orders and our substantial international opportunities. We remain confident about achieving the $25 billion plus or minus $500 million booking objective we set in January of this year.","At the end of the third quarter, congress passed a continuing resolution for the fiscal 2013 defense budget that runs through the end of March next year. They've become a way of life, essentially in this fiscal environment. This one is a little different in that it extends past the January 2 sequestration implementation date.","While the CR does not preempt sequestration, it does provide a mechanism for continued funding through the end of March, should sequestration be delayed. Although we continue to believe a resolution could occur after the election, we're planning for a variety of potential outcomes. As you've heard me say on prior calls, we're focused on the things we can control. This includes operating the business as efficiently as possible and delivering value for our customers and our shareholders, regardless of whether sequestration happens or not.","We believe that Raytheon's large international market presence, portfolio of programs, technology and focus on high-priority areas should help to mitigate some of the potential overall impact the sequestration has implemented. Importantly, over the past several years, we've made the investments in common systems and infrastructure across the entire company. This enables us to be more agile. We can more effectively balance workloads. We can win work anywhere, design it anywhere and build it anywhere across the company. This allows us to respond quickly in this dynamic budget environment that we're currently experiencing.","I'd like to thank the Raytheon team for their hard work and dedication. In an environment marked by higher-than-normal level of complexity and uncertainty, the team has remained focused and has executed well. We're prepared for the future and stand ready to continue to deliver value to our customers and our shareholders.","With that, let me turn it over to Dave.","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the third quarter highlights, and then we'll be move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning.","Okay, if everyone could please move to Page 3. As Bill noted, we reported solid operating results in the third quarter. The company had strong bookings in the quarter of $7.3 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.21. Our adjusted EPS of $1.60 was up 15%, driven by continued operational improvement and capital deployment actions.  Adjusted operating margin was 13.8%, up 80 basis points compared to last year's third quarter, reflecting strong performance for the company.","Sales were $6 billion in the quarter, down slightly from last year's third quarter. We delivered strong operating cash flow from continuing operations of $1.1 billion better than expected, and primarily driven by the timing of collections. We've updated our full year 2012 guidance, which I'll address further in a few minutes. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for $125 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 14.1 million shares for $725 million.","Turning now to Page 4. Let me start by providing some detail on our third quarter results. Our total company bookings for the quarter were $7.3 billion, and on a year-to-date basis were $18.6 billion, representing a year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 1.04. We continue to see our book-to-bill range for the full year 2012 of between roughly 1 and 1.05x. Notable bookings in the third quarter included $1.2 billion of missile systems for SM-3 for the Missile Defense Agency. MS also booked $350 million on a multi-year TOW missile contract for the U.S. Army and Marines, $101 million for Phalanx Weapon System for the U.S. Navy and an international customer and $87 million for MALD, our Miniature Air-Launch Decoy for the U.S. Air Force.","Technical Services booked $246 million for work on the Air Traffic Controller Training contract, ATCOTS, for the FAA. CS also booked $252 million and $137 million, respectively, for domestic and foreign training programs in support of the Warfighter FOCUS Program. Intelligence and Information Systems booked $170 million on a contract to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support to the U.S. Air Force. Integrated Defense Systems won a competitive award of $123 million for the upgraded Early Warning Radar System for the MDA and the U.S. Air Force. IDS also booked $84 million to support air and missile defense capability for the U.S. Army. And as Bill just highlighted, Network Centric Systems received a $70 million award for the Family of Advanced Beyond Line of Sight Terminals program for the U.S. Air Force, a key competitive win for the Raytheon team that positions us well to address the Air Force's need for secure, protected communication by leveraging proven technology that we've also provided to the Army and Navy. IIS and SAS booked $559 million and $382 million, respectively, on a number of classified programs.","Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $35 billion compared to $35.3 billion at the end of 2011. On a funded basis, our backlog is up over $400 million from the end of 2011, and up approximately $1.2 billion from the same period last year.","If you'd now move to Page 5. Sales were slightly below last year's third quarter. By business, IIS, missiles and SAS had sales essentially in line with the comparable period last year. IDS had third quarter 2012 net sales of $1.3 billion, an increase of 8% on a year-over-year basis. The increase from prior year is primarily due to stronger international sales on Patriot programs and the TPY-2 radars.","Technical Services had net sales of $785 million, down a little more than $30 million from the comparable period a year ago due to the completion of the polar contract in the first quarter of 2012.","NCS had net sales of $963 million in the quarter. The 13% decrease in net sales was primarily due to the decline of some U.S. Army production programs. Some international programs, which we had expected to book earlier in the year, have moved to the right and we have updated our guidance accordingly. It's notable that NCS' book-to-bill was greater than 1 in the last 2 quarters, driven by both domestic and international orders. For the full year, the business is expected to achieve a book-to-bill of between 1.1 and 1.5x.","Moving ahead to Page 6. We're pleased with the overall company operating margin. The year-over-year improvement was driven by operational performance. Our adjusted margin was 13.8%, an increase of 80 basis points. On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted margin was 13.5%, up 90 basis points over the comparable period in 2011. The strength in our company margins is the result of our planning process, including our continued focus on improving productivity, strong execution across the company and contract mix. We are realizing the benefits from reduced cost in our administrative functions, improved efficiencies in our factories and increasing value from the implementation of strategic supply chain initiatives. As we have said in the past, Raytheon's Six Sigma efforts are driving tangible results for the company.","So looking at business margins. Several international Patriot programs, including Taiwan and Saudi and an international missile defense radar program have now moved into full-rate production at IDS, and they are executing well. The favorable performance on these programs is being driven partially by the benefits realized from the economies and efficiencies of increased volume flowing through the factory. This, along with a change in mix, has favorably impacted the IDS margins.","Missiles and SAS margins were up in the quarter compared to the same period last year. Solid overall program performance drove improvements at both businesses, as well as favorable mix at SAS.","NCS delivered solid margins in the third quarter of 2012 but were lower compared to the third quarter of 2011, primarily due to a change in mix driven by higher net sales on long-term production programs last year, and as we have already discussed, the timing of international awards. And the Technical Services' third quarter 2011 operating margins benefited from efficiencies realized on some programs that completed last year. So overall, the company continues to perform well.","Turning now to Page 7. Third quarter 2012 adjusted EPS was $1.60, up 15%. The increase was driven by operational improvements and capital deployment actions, specifically, share repurchases. And on a year-to-date basis, adjusted EPS was $4.61, up 12% from the same period last year.","If you could please move to Page 8. I'd like to briefly comment on our updated outlook for 2012. We've lowered and narrowed the range for full year 2012 net sales, primarily due to the timing of awards at NCS. We now expect sales to be in the range of between $24.3 billion and $24.7 billion.","As we have done in past years, during the third quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of the update, FAS\/CAS pension expense for the year decreased by $32 million from $284 million to $252 million. We increased our adjusted EPS guidance for the year by $0.10 to reflect the strong performance through the end of the third quarter. We see adjusted EPS of between $5.85 and $5.95. You should note that we also increased our 2012 guidance for GAAP EPS to between $5.36 and $5.46, which includes the expected margin improvement for the year, as well as the updated full year FAS\/CAS pension expense.","As I mentioned earlier, we generated strong operating cash flow in the quarter, which is primarily the result of timing of collections. A portion of this is expected to increase our cash flow for the year. As a result, we've increase our 2012 guidance for operating cash flow from continuing operations by $100 million to between $1.8 billion and $2 billion. Overall, our updated outlook for 2012 reflects our ability to drive results through performance improvements.","If you move to Page 9. I'll discuss some detail on our full year guidance for 2012 by business. So let me start with sales. We've increased the IDS full year sales outlook by $100 million as a result of strong growth in international programs. We tightened the full year sales range for IIS, missiles and SAS. We also lowered and tightened NCS' full year sales range to reflect the timing of new international awards and TSS' full year sales range due to delays on domestic training and logistics programs.","Now turning to margins. We've increased the range and expect higher full year operating margin performance for IDS, IIS, missiles, SAS and Technical Services. The strong year-to-date results exceeded our prior estimates.  We lowered the range of our full year operating margin guidance for NCS, driven by a change in mix due to delays in a few international awards, one of which we expect to receive in the fourth quarter. You should be aware that the fourth quarter outlook also includes costs related to potentially terminating a supplier agreement.","From an overall standpoint, Raytheon remains well positioned going forward. We continue to invest in critical technologies. We relentlessly focus on execution, and we have a broad and balanced portfolio of programs. We will continue to improve productivity and deliver value to our customers and shareholders.","Now turning to next year. As we did last year, we intend to provide 2013 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January. So if you could please move to Page 10, we have provided a FAS\/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2013, as we've done in prior years. And just to be clear, the discount rate and the actual asset returns won't be known until we close out 2012. It is worth noting that given the current interest rate environment with discount rates at historical lows today, we expect to see improvement to the FAS\/CAS pension expense in 2014 and beyond, assuming even a modest increase in rates in the future.","Before we open it up for Q&A, let me summarize. We had a solid third quarter and exceeded the operating margin, EPS and cash flow guidance we provided back in July. Our book-to-bill was 1.2 or put another way, our bookings exceeded our sales by 20%, once again highlighting how our innovative and affordable solutions are aligned with our global customer priorities, and providing a solid foundation for the future. We continue to move ahead with our efficiency initiatives, which importantly, have provided savings for our customers and driven solid financial performance for the company. We are confident in our outlook for the year.","With that, Bill and I will open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Nadol, JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to start out -- I hear you on the international items, and thanks for the detail you gave there. So wondering if you guys have formally adjusted your expectations of the components of those bookings for the year or if you're just kind of sticking with what you have so far since you're keeping your overall number. And then also, Bill, just any color you can give on the hold up? Is this end-market related? Or is this the FMS process in Washington that's holding it up, et cetera?","William H. Swanson","Yes, Joe. Let me try and frame it first from the top. We still expect bookings to be in around the 25% to 28% of our total bookings. So from our standpoint, we feel pretty good that what we said we were going to do in January, we're doing. The good part on the international is no cancellations, and we're just being cautious as we look at the market, getting into it. We said the back half of the year was where our activity was going to be, and we brought in over $7 billion worth of bookings, and we expect Q4 to be strong. Maybe what I should do is give you some color the way I think about it if I look at the Q4 bookings. We expect IDS to bring in about $2.5 billion worth of bookings. 60% of that is international. Kuwait Patriot will drive that. We have a congressional notification that's been approved. That total award is in the $1.2 billion range, but we probably expect $750 million to $800 million in that because they'll buy the fire units first, and then they'll go to buy the spares and the services shortly thereafter. The balance of what they're going to bring in is domestic orders. Those are mainly in the naval area, and they've got a few other international contracts there. IIS will bring in about $750 million. These are all plus or minus a little, and they're mainly in the classified area. If I think about missiles, they have bookings of around $1 billion; 2\/3 of what they're going to bring in is international. The largest there is a munition program, Paveway. We expect to get that approval, and we expect it to happen and the balance will be domestic. In NCS, our bookings there will be about $1.5 billion. As Dave mentioned, we've signed and expect the customer to sign momentarily an award, and are probably around $600 million to $700 million, in that range, and the balance there will be domestically as we look at it. SAS, we expect bookings there of about $1 billion. About 60% of those are international, and the biggest piece is related to Tactical Airborne radars. Classified, probably a couple hundred million there. And TS bookings, we estimate around $300 million, and that'll be in training and logistics program, about 60% of those internationally. So overall, we see a strong Q4 bookings around $6 billion to $7 billion. And from our standpoint, over half of those will be international. I think that gives you a pretty good color of what we're trying to do and to finish out the year.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, that's very helpful, Bill. Just any color on the FMS process and if that's creating any delays or it's normal?","William H. Swanson","Yes, it's -- there's a little bit of a delay there. I mean, we have to go through the congressional notification process. Things are moving. I'm not pointing any fingers at anything, but we'd sure like the process to be quicker if we could move them. These are international sales. They're good jobs here domestically, and we'd like to keep pushing as hard as we can, but we are in an election year, and we kind of looked at this at the beginning of the year and knew something would happen, but we're getting great support out of the building and people are trying here, but it's taken us just a little bit longer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. One, I noticed that the share repurchase was a little bit less in Q3 than you'd done earlier in the year, at least, it looked like that. Was there any just sort of conservatism, given the budget uncertainty that we're dealing with as we head into the back half of the last quarter of the year? And with sequestration sitting there next year, did that weigh on your share purchases in the quarter?","David C. Wajsgras","So back in January, Carter, we had talked about moderating our share repurchases for 2012, going forward, relative to prior years. So frankly, we're executing along those lines, and the way the cadence has played out was something that we had essentially anticipated back in January. I think, importantly, we feel very good about the cash flow generation, both on the quarter and year-to-date. And I think it's worth noting that we've increased our guidance to between $1.8 billion and $2 billion of cash on the year.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great, that's what I recalled. I just wanted to make sure there was no sort of difference in message. And the second question, Dave, is one of -- a more mechanical one. We're all struggling to figure out what sequestration is going to mean for 2013 as you are as well, and I'm sure you're evaluating lots of scenarios, but putting the topline impact aside, if you were to think about the mechanics about how you will evaluate the impact of sequestration on margins, given that we'll already be done with Q4 and you'll probably be closing out your EAC shortly thereafter and we won't know really what's going to happen with contractual actions by the time you report Q4 results, and may not know by the time you report Q1 results. When is it realistic in the sort of mechanical process of how you're going to set EACs and determine profit rates, that you'll have a realistic read on what the impact of sequestration could be for your margin rates?","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. So I will try to answer the number of questions that you just put forward. There are many factors to consider when you're thinking about this, and frankly, at this stage, it's hypothetical. So the speculation isn't all that easy. Now with that said, a lot of this depends -- for various companies, not just Raytheon, but if you stand back, a lot of this depends on how companies' programs are going to be impacted overall. So for example, if the decreases are tied to a dedicated facility, and that's not a situation that we would want to be in and frankly, we don't find ourselves in that situation, the cost associated with the facility could have a negative impact on the margin profile. It also depends on whether a program or programs are being canceled or stretched out, whether they are funded or unfunded. The overall program mix of the company and whether or not you have offsets, things like international business, and again, from Raytheon's perspective, we believe that's a strength. I think most importantly is our ability to react quickly to any type of reductions from a cost structure standpoint. We know how to react in this regard, and you can see that especially if you look in the rearview mirror. Just look at the facts and look at the results we've posted and the margins we've been able to achieve. We do have a broad portfolio of programs, and the fact that we have company-wide systems, again, which we've talked to in the past, it does provide us with a lot of flexibility to help mitigate any kind of pressure on the margin profile. I hope that answers the question.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It does. As kind of a follow-up to that, is it fair to say that it will take an extended period of time into 2013 before we'll really have a decent handle on what some of those impacts might be?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, again, it depends what kind of guidance we get from the customer and if and how sequestration is actually implemented. So it's -- my crystal ball is a little foggy this morning. It's a fair question, but it's very difficult to answer in the hypothetical.","William H. Swanson","Yes. Just a little color to what Dave said. We do not expect the department to cancel programs starting in January. At least some of the discussions have stated that they'll plan their way through it, as Dave said, and for us, we'll do our planning based on both scenarios, a normal -- just a normal year, you'd call, what we're in, versus a year of sequestrations, and what's important is we have a healthy funded backlog.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gursky, Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","David, a quick question for you, and then one for Bill. Dave, you mentioned that there were going to be some costs related to the termination of a supplier agreement. Can you give a little bit more detail about, a, what that is, and b, what the extent of the costs might be? And then Bill, if you could share a little bit about cash deployment going forward and kind of update us on your current thinking on priority.","David C. Wajsgras","Sure. So relative to the NCS supplier agreement, we are in negotiations, so there's not a lot we can say. What we've done is essentially set up a worst case scenario for the fourth quarter and have assumed a $30 million adjustment to NCS's earnings. That's from a company standpoint in the fourth quarter. From a fourth quarter margin perspective, that's about 50 basis points, but again, it is a worst case scenario, and the team is working through the situation, and we are working hard to not have this happen. But we did think it was appropriate to put that into the guidance in the fourth quarter, so that's Part 1. Part 2, you asked about capital deployment. At this point, we don't see any wholesale changes moving forward. We have a balanced approach. We have moderated our share repurchases in 2012 when compared to 2011. We had a meaningful dividend increase earlier in the year, the eighth consecutive increase on an annual basis. We feel comfortable relative to the funding profile of the pension. You can see, as you dig into the details of our financial results, that we continue to invest in ourselves, particularly in the R&D area. Going forward, we'll continue to -- we'll continue with the acquisition strategy that we put in place a few years ago, adding critical technologies to the overall portfolio. So the short version would be, I wouldn't expect meaningful changes as we look ahead to the next couple of years. I do believe that the company has done an exceptionally good job from a cash performance standpoint and converting earnings into cash, and that puts us in a very good position and gives us a lot of flexibility as we look to 2013 and '14.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned, Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I wanted to talk a little about NCS, and my understanding had been that you were pretty much done with the impact from decline in war-related activity, and that what was left could be offset by growth elsewhere in the unit, particularly international. That didn't appear to be the case this quarter. I mean, backlogs are holding up well, but do you think we're at the bottom yet with respect to the impact from the decline in Army programs?","William H. Swanson","Yes, I think so, Doug. At least, from what I see, their book-to-bill was above 1 this quarter. We expect it to stay above that. Going forward, I think, for us, NCS went through the transition. They've got a strategy of the power of the network, really, with network-enabled solutions. They're tapping into that for our customers and working it across the business base here in the company. The Army drawdown, they've transitioned from what I'd call single-mission army products to network solutions, bringing actionable intelligence to the individual soldier. That's where we see the Army going. They need to accomplish that on the move. You've heard me talk about MAINGATE, [indiscernible] and Command View and PSDS2, are things that we can do to broaden NCS and help the Army get in there. There are large Army and Navy satellite communications programs. I talked about that earlier on the call. We see that as a real strength for them. And then, of course, I mentioned they'll be getting a sizable contract here in the fourth quarter. We really feel good about it. It's all buttoned up. We just got to wait for the final signature here. We thought we would announce it, but things move a date or a day around here at times. So we feel good about that. And then the thing that's really exciting is our air-traffic business. Demand is there. They're partnering with the FAA to -- of all the terminal automation systems to be interoperable with the FAA and DoD to provide a common operating picture and increase capacity. In short, to implement and deploy NextGen. So we feel pretty good about where they're at, and we look to the vector to be up as we go forward.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then, regarding bookings more generally, in Q3, it looked like a lot of your large awards were heavily U.S. awards this time, and did you see any of the strength in bookings as DoD efforts to get things done before the end of fiscal 2012?","William H. Swanson","No, Doug. We haven't seen a delay, and we've not seen an acceleration. The guidance DoD has is business is normal, obligate the funds and proceed forward. So from our standpoint, it feels normal on the DoD side and kind of what we expected as we looked at things.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I have a long-term question about margins. In both IDS and missile systems, you're entering new territory in terms of profit rates. I think many of us are trying to figure out whether something really structural is taking place that can allow these type of margins to become a new baseline or whether we're just kind of at a crest to the cycle. I think -- if you could help us think about that structurally in terms of both the contracting dynamics and product cycles, that would be helpful.","David C. Wajsgras","So let me start off with kind of the near-term view and then address the longer-term view. So for IDS, the third quarter margins were higher than the guidance that we had earlier provided. That's really the result of the strong execution in our factory operations. So on a quarter-to-quarter basis, if you're looking at Q4, it actually moderates a little bit relative to Q3 and year-to-date, but that's the result of the timing of the efficiencies that we spoke to earlier, combined with the overall schedule acceleration on a number of international programs. Looking forward, we would continue to see strong margins in IDS. I'd suggest, of the 6 business areas, likely the strongest margins for the group, driven primarily by the strength of the international business, specifically, in the air and missile defense area, as well as continued performance on a number of domestic programs as we look ahead. From a missile system standpoint, structurally, there isn't anything too remarkable. I would suggest that the third quarter performance was again driven by a number of areas of focus on the efficiency side and the productivity side, as well as overhead reduction efforts again that we spoke to earlier. Going forward, I'd suggest that margins would be in the general range that we expect for 2012. Again, I'm extrapolating over the next couple of years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard, Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Dave, I was wondering if I could ask a couple of questions on your favorite topic of pensions. So I thought, first of all, if you could give us an idea of where your returns are year-to-date, and what the discount is that you're looking at, at the moment, say, out of this 30 of September.","David C. Wajsgras","Sure. Returns year-to-date as of last night were just above 10% from an asset plan standpoint. If you were to put a stake in the ground today, we would be looking at around 4.25% discount rate. And I'll remind you, and I recognize you're aware of this, that the discount rate will be set on the last day of the year based on a hypothetical bond portfolio that mirrors the liabilities of the plan. So it's obviously difficult to handicap where that's going to end up. But again, if you're looking at today, we would suggest about 4.25% discount rate. So let me answer your next question before you ask it. If you're looking at the FAS\/CAS impact of '13 versus '12, we see that likely increasing by about $50 million, 2013 to 2012, and you can see that if you just look at what's on the pension matrix.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Actually, the next question I was going to ask was something different, was whether you'd assumed any material change in your contributions moving into next year?","David C. Wajsgras","At this stage, we don't see any material change in our contributions. Let me just give you some specifics. From a gross pension funding standpoint, we'll be at around $750 million in '12. And after the CAS reimbursement, we're actually positive, about $100 million. That's the same neighborhood as we look at '13. It's about just under $900 million gross, but again, positive, about $100 million from a cash flow standpoint. I do want to just mention one other thing before we close out this subject. If we look at a 2014 from a FAS\/CAS expense standpoint, we see that number being in the neighborhood of -- on an absolute basis, of about $50 million negative, so there is a fairly significant movement in the numbers from '13 to '14.","Operator","Our next question comes from Howard Rubel, Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two things I want to just ask about. One is, Bill, as you look at sort of your bid and proposal and opportunities that you're going after, what sort of percentage would you say in general terms is new things that you don't currently have, so that they, in effect, represent market share opportunities?","William H. Swanson","Howard, I don't know if I've broken it down that way. But if I think about it from a technological point of view and where we make our investments and where we're heading, we're seeing more technology and where we're focusing in to upgrade systems. If you take older devices, there's a great opportunity to go from what I'll say are the old maggies [ph] or tubes to solid-state. There's a way to go from gallium to GaN, and so there's a push for us in that area. The other thing that we see an opportunity and you saw this in the EW World, that where you could take multiple systems and go to multi-function systems, and that's an area where we see that taking place. And of course, the last one is that we believe you need technology to be able to reduce manpower. And we think, going into the headwinds, that's something important. So from our standpoint, that's kind of our focus. We see, as our military gets smaller and tries to be more agile in their strategy, we see ourselves going there. And then the other part that something I've talked about before is our CRAD. Our development is running at about $1 billion to $1.5 billion for us, and that's really all the seed corn stuff we see in the company that leads to new programs. And you know, of course, for us, EW, advancing AESA radars on older platforms and so forth are just examples of things we're trying to do. But I don't have a percentage, and I hate to swag it, but it is something I'll go look at, see if I can get an answer.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then just to finish, is that -- part of all of this pressure on defense is obviously units and things like that, but part of it's also process at the customer. Have you been able to be effective either in coming up with some notable solutions or examples that you can take from one business unit to another, where you're contracting costs and processes to deliver the good is really...","William H. Swanson","It's a great question. I've talked about it in B and P funds, bid and proposal. Clearly, for us, we have and are sharing best practices across the company. The number of programs we're bidding on is going up. We're opening the aperture, and one of the things we've found is some of our businesses have got some very creative ways to be able to bid more with no more, and we pass that around the company. The other thing I should have mentioned, back to your original question, in cyber, what we're encouraged about now is we have the ability to work cyber from the network to the cloud to the desktop, to the laptop, to all forms of mobile, and we believe that's an opportunity for us that we haven't had before as we've added some niche acquisitions in here, and I should have mentioned that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Loomis, Stifel, Nicolaus.","William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just looking at -- you did a good job giving us an overview on NCS. But just on IIS and TS, when I look into your guidance for the year and the fourth quarter, it really implies margins in those 2, lower margin units, anyway, going into the low 7s. Is there anything unusual there or conservatism? How do you explain that?","David C. Wajsgras","No. Well, for IIS, I think if you just cut through everything, I would expect the full year margins to be at the top end of the ranges that we've provided. There's nothing unusual or remarkable going on in IIS. They continue to perform well. They're winning a lot of new business. We are very pleased with the way they have delivered results for the company for 2012, and we expect more of the same in 2013. They're particularly strong in the classified area. From a Technical Services standpoint, we talked a little bit about the timing of training and logistics programs shifting to the right. From a margin perspective, the comp to last year's third quarter is a difficult one because we had a number of programs closing out at our customized engineering and depot services area, and that resulted in some margin pickups that otherwise would have occurred later in the year. The roughly low 8% range is about the way to think about that business. They're continuing to perform well. And again, I know I sound a little bit like a broken record, but there's nothing too remarkable happening in that business either.","William R. Loomis - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And just one quick question on NCS, on the $30 million worst case scenario on the supplier agreement, if I -- I guess if I just add that back to my model based on your implied fourth quarter guidance, you have actually a very good margin in NCS. Is that -- how is that factored into the guidance specifically?","David C. Wajsgras","It's just a -- think of it as directly off the bottom line. It's a $30 million -- it's not a reserve in the accounting sense, but it's a reserve in the guidance that we've built into our projections, and again, we're working hard to not take that impact, and we'll see how things play out over the next month or 2.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Dave, maybe you can help me with this. You talked about the strong order activity. You had orders kind of $1 billion higher than sales, but when I look at your funded backlog, it actually declined since June. So can you just talk about how things end up going into total backlog versus funded backlog?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, the funded backlog, I think the place I'd like to start would be relative to where we were in this period last year, and that's up about $1.2 billion. With respect to the overall backlog as well as the funded backlog, Sam, there's always timing elements to this, and there's nothing to read into it. Again, quarter-to-quarter, things will ebb and flow. We do feel that the backlog from an overall mix standpoint is very strong. The international backlog is in the high 30% range, and we expect that to increase over time. The average funded portion of the overall backlog runs about 55% to 60%. So again, I don't think -- there's nothing significant to report. There is obviously timing from quarter-to-quarter.","William H. Swanson","And I would add, it's Bill, that at least one customer base, not DoD, is on a monthly funded basis rather than a quarterly funded basis. So the number could even be or should even be higher, so it's caused a little bit of a spike, but we feel pretty good about our funded backlog going into next year.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then Dave, if I can follow up just on the cash flow, you were $400 million or $500 million more than you said you were going to be in terms of cash flow from ops. You said a lot of it's timing, but is this going to imply the fourth quarter is actually below the third quarter? I can't recall you doing that in quite a while, so why are we going see that reverse next quarter?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, again, we did suggest that much of this was timing. I am comfortable with suggesting the higher-end of the cash flow range for the year, and that is a little bit different than what we had been suggesting in the past. Obviously, cash is measured on the last day of the year, so it's always difficult to handicap. But again, I wouldn't say there's anything unusual going on there either.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Arment, Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Bill, I want to get your thoughts on just kind of -- you mentioned kind of the changes there or navigating with sequestration, but your thoughts on kind of M&A? We saw, I think, a big announcement last month with the ADS and BAE and obviously, that's not going forward. How -- what's your -- any change in your approach there? I know you guys have been very consistent, but I wanted to get your updated thoughts.","William H. Swanson","Yes, consistency is a good thing and transparency is even better, and no surprise this is the best. And so from our standpoint, I think we think about it the same way. First of all, can we invest in ourselves? If we do that, then we know the kind of margins and returns we're going to get. The next part, can we partner with someone that helps if they have the capability? For us, we have a good record teaming with universities on some of these smaller jobs and programs that we have as we go forward. Dave talked about share repurchase and dividends, how we look at that, and the next part is the M&A, and we're very comfortable with the type of M&A activity we have. We just announced Teligy. That's a strategy, really, there to broaden cyber even further for us. They specialize in wireless RF communication, vulnerability analysis, reverse engineering and rapid prototyping. We're thrilled to have this firm join the Raytheon team, and they just give us more capability in this very complicated cyber world that continues to get more attention. But the bottom line is we have not altered anything, and I can't comment on the transaction other than those are hard to do in this environment.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Right. And just regarding the smaller niche, Teligy, are you seeing --- are there more opportunities or -- for you where you feel like you have technology gaps? It feels like you already had a very big base to work from in the cyber.","William H. Swanson","Right, we do, but one of the things you have to look at cyber, it evolves. It's a threat that is basically, depending on whether you're right-handed or left-handed, a click of the mouse. And from our standpoint, we've always had this vision of being full service to our customers, and to us, we want to make sure that we can handle not only the network, but the cloud, the desktop, the laptop or what we see. The whole world's going mobile, and that's very vulnerable and as an engineer, I realize that an aperture is a door, and that door can be opened or closed, and we want to be able to provide that service to our customers that we have full knowledge of the spectrum, and that's kind of how we think about it. And oh, by the way, I should point out, as we add these firms, we have a very nice transition plan here in the company, where they become part of it, and what I'm really thrilled about is the acquisitions we made, talking to those leaders, how they feel about joining the company and being able to broaden their capabilities too.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Myles Walton, Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Maybe, first, Dave, on cash, just a clarification. Coming into 2012, they did have some tough comps on customer advances from 2011, and I think at the time you talked about 2013, kind of showing a nice rebound. Kind of thinking about it conceptually between the 2 years, is that still about the right way to think about '13 as you go forward?","David C. Wajsgras","So '13, it's a little early to talk about the guidance. We did come into the year with a balance that was, I would say, high relative to prior years, specifically around customer advances, international customer advances, which is being liquidated in 2012 and 2013. As you know, we have improved cash performance and the guidance that we had suggested back in January. I'll provide more details this January on how we see '13 playing out. But given just the number of moving pieces for '13, I think it's just a little bit early. What I would feel comfortable conveying at this stage is that the cash flow expectations for next year in a general way should be in line with what we're seeing for '12.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And Bill, a question for you on communications, on the defense landscape, it seems like JTRS has been restructured and now is inside of a new program office. And I know Raytheon's engaged on the software side, but it seems like the hardware side is opening up opportunities for you as well. Can you touch on where you think Raytheon fits in that? Are you competing on the vehicular radio competition?","William H. Swanson","Yes. No, we are in -- from my standpoint, I really don't think of it as a radio business anymore. I really think about it is a software business. That's where communication's going, not only in wave forms and so forth, but the other thing that we're going to see a real push on is in secure communications, how do you move data around the battlefield in a secure way. And if you think about it, it's no different than I think what U.S. industry is going to have to think about how corporations move around big data and information in an encrypted format. So from our standpoint, we see that as something that's really important to us, and where part of our focus is here, as you move, think about data from an airborne or a satellite platform, down to a ground station, and then you move that information around. That information has to be secure, and it's secure, really, through software and through wave forms.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But specifically, on the JTRS vehicular radio, have you been able to get a placement in that competition?","William H. Swanson","Yes, we have. And the other thing is MAINGATE really puts a hole in everything there, if you think about it. And we'll be participating -- I think they call it the NIE. Let's see if anybody around here at the table...","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Network Integration Exercise, yes.","William H. Swanson","Yes, you got it. That's good. I'm impressed, but we're participating in that big time, and we're looking forward to demonstrating what our hardware can do, and that's a great environment for us to operate in because we don't believe in [indiscernible]. We believe in hardware.","Todd B. Ernst","Okay. Thank you for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter conference call in January.

My name is Glenn, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Todd B. Ernst","Thank you, Glenn. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our second quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of the call, and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.","With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Wajsgras, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Dave, and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas A. Kennedy","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Earlier this morning, we reported solid second quarter results, with company sales, margins, EPS and cash flow higher than our expectations. Bookings were strong, driving a book-to-bill ratio of 1.19 in the quarter, with exceptionally strong bookings in the domestic business. Our bookings in the second quarter increased by approximately $1.4 billion over the second quarter 2013.","Looking to the balance of the year, we have a significant pipeline of opportunities, including several large international programs. Over the past couple of months, I've traveled to meet a number of our international customers, including 2 trips to the Middle East, as well as to the Farnborough Airshow last week. Overall, at the Farnborough this year, the company hosted delegations from over 30 countries, totaling 700 meetings, with 1,200 customers and partners. Based on these meetings, I can say with confidence that our global customers continue to look to Raytheon to provide advanced solutions to meet their evolving requirements.","And demand remains strong, especially in the areas of integrated air and missile defense, C4ISR, cyber, critical infrastructure protection, and training. As always, the timing of international awards can be difficult to predict, but demand is clearly there.","In the second quarter, international sales comprised 29% of Raytheon's total sales. International bookings were 24% of total bookings and were up 21% year-over-year. These bookings were primarily driven by the international TOW and the Canadian North Warning System opportunities we mentioned on the last call, as well as other missile and training awards. We continue to make progress on several international air and missile defense opportunities, which we've discussed on prior calls.","After the close of the quarter, Qatar signed a letter of agreement with the U.S. government for the Patriot system, and we expect a booking later this year. Qatar was -- will become the 13th nation to have chosen the Patriot integrated air and missile defense system to defend their country. In addition, we expect Qatar to move forward on an air defense operating center for approximately $300 million, which we anticipate will result in a booking at the end of the year.","During the quarter, we made progress on another international Patriot opportunity. This approximately $2 billion opportunity continues to move forward and is now at the final stages of the approval process. We expect the booking in the second half of the year.","We have recently received good news about 2 other large potential international opportunities. In late June, Poland announced that Raytheon had been down selected for the next competitive phase of its medium-range missile defense system. We are now the sole U.S. competitor for the contract and believe we have a strong offering, with world-class technology that provide significant value to Poland. Patriot is fielded and is being continuously upgraded with leading-edge technologies, which is a key competitive discriminator in this competition. A final decision on the Poland award is expected in 2015.","And just after the close of the quarter, we booked $160 million for upgraded Patriot missiles for South Korea. This is the first step of a 2-step process. The next step is a systems upgrade to Configuration-3 plus for South Korea's firing units for several hundred million dollars, which also is planned for next year.","Overall, our international business remains strong. We are expanding into new markets, and broadening our presence in existing markets. As we do this, we are continuously enhancing how we do business internationally so we can create and capitalize on even more opportunities.","One of my top priorities is to foster this focus on global growth. To achieve this, we are taking a different approach in certain countries. We are increasing our direct engagement, utilizing more local resources and expanding our global supply chain. We believe this commitment will provide us with the ability to create more international opportunities and increase our competitive advantage.","Looking now at the domestic environment, we saw strong bookings in the quarter, which increased nearly 30% year-over-year and resulted in a domestic book-to-bill of 1.27. This bookings achievement was driven by various sensor, training, missile and classified bookings.","I've had the opportunity to meet with numerous representatives from Congress and the Department of Defense over the past several months, and the feedback regarding the important capabilities that Raytheon products bring to the Warfighter continues to be positive. In the defense bills making their way to through Congress, Raytheon programs are faring well despite continued budget pressure. Congress is proposing increases for several programs, including Tomahawk, SM-3 and EKV, and most other Raytheon programs are funded at or near the President's request.","Another issue of significant interest to Congress is homeland defense. In June, we achieved a successful test to the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle, which incorporates the latest hardware and software upgrades. This successful test keeps the United States on track to significantly increase its ground-based interceptor inventory.","And also in June, Raytheon won a nearly $300 million production competition for the FAB-T program. This program allows a short communication between military aircraft, ground sites and the new higher data rate Advanced EHF satellites. Our secure communications position with the U.S. Air Force is enhanced by this win. It also builds on our leading position in the protective SATCOM market, where we provide a Navy Multiband Terminal for the U.S. Navy and SMART-T for the Army. The bulk of this award will be booked next year.","The FAB-T win underscores the value of our continued investment in advanced technology to strengthen our competitive advantage across multiple products.","During the quarter, we also marked several milestones related to corporate responsibility, which reflects our values and strong company culture. We released our new Corporate Responsibility Report, highlighting our efforts, investments and accomplishments in the many areas that define corporate responsibility at Raytheon. We were recognized by the EPA with our seventh consecutive ENERGY STAR Sustained Excellence Award for continued leadership and protecting our environment through superior energy efficiency. We were, again, ranked on Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens list, illustrating our strong commitment to corporate citizenship.","In summary, we had a solid overall performance in the quarter. Bookings were strong, and we have a number of large opportunities included in the Qatar Patriot in the remainder of the year. I'd like to thank the Raytheon team for their continued dedication and focus on delivering value for our customers and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Dave.","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I have a few opening remarks starting with the second quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that were issued earlier this morning. So if everyone would please turn to Page 3.","We're pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the second quarter, with sales, EPS, margins and operating cash flow all better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the second quarter at $6.8 billion and sales of $5.7 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.19. Operating margin was solid at 13.3% and on an adjusted basis was 11.8%. And our EPS from continuing operations was $1.59. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $1.41. Operating cash flow of $153 million was better than our prior guidance, driven by the timing of collections that were previously expected in the third quarter.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock for $250 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 4.6 million shares for $450 million.","We ended the second quarter with $560 million of net debt. I'd like to point out that on May 12, Standard & Poor's Ratings Service upgraded our long-term senior unsecured credit rating from A- to A, reflecting our strong financial position.","If you turn to Page 4, let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Our total company bookings for the quarter were $6.8 billion, an increase of about $1.4 billion compared to the second quarter 2013, and on a year-to-date basis were $11.1 billion, an increase of approximately $2.1 billion over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing 4-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.06x.","For the quarter, international was 24% of our total company bookings and on a year-to-date basis was 30%. For the year, we continue to expect international to be in the range of 35% to 40% of total bookings. And as we mentioned on the April call, our full year 2014 bookings are expected to be $23.5 billion plus or minus $500 million for a book-to-bill ratio of between 1 and 1.05x. And as Tom just mentioned, we have several significant international opportunities that we expect to book in the back half of this year.","Now notable awards in the second quarter included $764 million of Missile Systems for TOW missiles for the U.S. Army, U.S. Marines and international customers. Missile Systems also booked $289 million for Standard Missile-6, $259 million for AIM-9X Sidewinders, $179 million for AMRAAM, $130 million for Phalanx Weapon System, $81 million on MALD, $79 million on Rolling Airframe Missiles, and $75 million for SM-3. Additionally, MS booked $140 million on a classified program.","IIS booked $515 million on domestic training programs and $160 million on foreign training programs in support of Warfighter FOCUS activities. IIS also booked $521 million for a U.S. Air Force program and approximately $160 million to provide operations and maintenance services on an international radar system. And Space and Airborne Systems booked $129 million to provide radar subsystems for the U.S. Navy. In addition, IIS and SAS booked $379 million and $431 million, respectively, on a number of classified programs.","Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $33 billion, and funded backlog was $23.6 billion, up $1.4 billion compared to the same period last year. It's worth noting that approximately 38% of our backlog is comprised of international programs.","If you now move to Page 5, for the second quarter 2014, sales exceeded the high end of the guidance we set in April, primarily due to timing at both IIS and SAS. For the second quarter, our international sales were approximately 29% of total sales, and all of our businesses were at or above our expectations.","IDS had second quarter 2014 net sales of $1.5 billion. The change from Q2 2013 was primarily due to the completion of production phases on a couple of international Patriot programs and lower sales on a combat tactical radar program. There was also an unfavorable $38 million impact from the Australian Air Warfare Destroyer program, which I'll address in a little more detail in just a moment.","In the second quarter 2014, IIS had net sales of $1.5 billion. Compared with the same quarter last year, the change was primarily due to lower volume on our training and mission support programs, partially offset by higher volume on domestic and international classified programs. Missile Systems had second quarter 2014 net sales of $1.5 billion. We saw lower sales for U.S. Army programs in this year's second quarter compared with Q2 2013. And SAS had net sales of $1.5 billion. Lower volume on intersegment sales related to a combat tactical radar program for IDS and classified programs drove the change versus last year. It's worth pointing out that excluding the reduced intersegment sales of approximately $50 million, SAS would have been down about 4%.","Moving on to Page 6, our overall company margins were solid. Our reported operating margin was 13.3% and on an adjusted basis was 11.8%. On a year-to-date basis, our operating margin was 13.8% and on an adjusted basis was 12.2%. As a reminder, our second quarter 2014 adjusted margin excludes the favorable FAS\/CAS adjustment, which was worth about 150 basis points, or $0.18 per share.","So looking at the business margins, at IIS, missiles and SAS, margins were relatively consistent with the same period last year. And at IDS, the change was primarily driven by a decrease in estimated incentive fees on the Australian Air Warfare Destroyer program. This program is structured as an alliance made up of Raytheon, an Australian government-owned naval shipbuilder, and the Commonwealth of Australia. It's a cost-type contract and our fee has a guaranteed amount, but also a variable portion that's contingent upon the aggregate cost performance of the alliance. Now although Raytheon's performance continues on plan from both a cost and schedule standpoint, the shipbuilder is now estimating an increase in their cost to complete the program, which drove the decrease in the estimated incentive fees. Excluding this impact, IDS' margins would have been 16.2% on the quarter. So overall, the company continues to perform well.","Turning now to Page 7. Second quarter 2014 EPS was $1.59 and on an adjusted basis was $1.41. EPS for the second quarter 2014 was better than expected, primarily driven by the timing of sales and program performance improvements that were previously expected in the third quarter.","On Page 8, we are reaffirming the company's financial outlook for 2014 that we provided in April for net sales, EPS and operating cash flow. We continue to expect our full year 2014 net sales to be in the range of between $22.5 billion and $23 billion. Our full year 2014 EPS is expected to be in the range of between $6.74 and $6.89, and on an adjusted basis, within a range of between $5.76 and $5.91.","We have not included in our 2014 guidance either the potential extension of the R&D tax credit or the potential enactment of pension stabilization as part of the extension of the Highway Trust Fund. These would be essentially offsetting if both were enacted.","We repurchased 2.6 million shares of common stock for $250 million in the quarter and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 312 million and 314 million shares for 2014, which would be a 3% reduction at the midpoint.","As I mentioned earlier, operating cash flow in the quarter was strong due to the timing of collections previously expected in the third quarter. We continue to see our 2014 guidance for operating cash flow to be between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion.","And as you can see on Page 9, we've adjusted the margin guidance for 3 of our businesses. We've lowered IDS' margins to reflect the adjustment for the Air Warfare Destroyer program and the timing of international awards, which is offset by improvements at missiles and IIS. For the company, we continue to see adjusted operating margin to be in the range of between 12.6% and 12.8% for the full year.","On Page 10, we provided some directional guidance on how we currently see the quarterly cadence for sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations for the balance of 2014. For the third quarter, we now expect sales to be in the range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion. Further, we expect margins in the third quarter to be in line with year-to-date performance, in the low 12% range on an adjusted basis. This drives our third quarter EPS guidance of $1.53 to $1.60. We continue to see a ramp in sales in the fourth quarter, which is being driven by awards we were expecting both this quarter and next, including Qatar Patriot and another significant international Patriot award. This increased volume, combined with favorable program mix, drive EPS to a range of $1.75 to $1.83 in the fourth quarter of this year.","Now before we open it up for Q&A, let me summarize. We had solid second quarter performance. Our book-to-bill was 1.19 in the quarter and on a trailing 4-quarter basis was 1.06. As we look to the balance of the year, the pipeline of international and domestic opportunities is strong. Our balance sheet position gives us continued flexibility to drive shareholder value in the future, and we remain confident in our outlook for the year.","So with that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask about margins. Dave, you just talked about this, and you alluded to the orders in the quarter that are going to drive sales, the international orders in the second half. I wanted to ask about pricing on these orders and pricing in general, because we have seen segment margins come down here now. I think it's 3 quarters in a row sequentially. And I'm wondering -- you talked about a couple of the puts and takes at IDS. But I'm wondering if just in general, are we seeing lower pricing come into the backlog?","David C. Wajsgras","So it's a fair question, but we have not seen any pressure on fees or margins from a backlog perspective. We still have a healthy book of business with respect to our international profile. We're continuing to perform well for our domestic and international customers. I think it's probably fair to point out that the second half margin profile is higher than the first half margin profile on -- at the company level. And we do see improvement in the overall margin guidance for both IIS and missiles. And SAS continues to perform quite well, frankly, as does IDS. If you were to exclude the AWD situation that I just explained, margins in Q2 for IDS would've been about 16.2%.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So if pricing's locked in for the second half, should we see -- is there any execution risk that might be higher than normal? I just want to get a sense that we don't see a repeat, really, of the first half.","Thomas A. Kennedy","Rob, let me just jump in here. Right now, we do not see any issues relative to execution moving forward. In fact, we've a full-court press on getting more efficiencies out of the business, where you have the second half of the year, significant work in taking out square footage. We're also working our strategic sourcing across the second half of the year as we've done in the first. So we actually see, actually, I would say a stronger foundation relative to margins in the second half with the activities we've put in place. So bottom line is we do not see that pressure that you're talking about.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just quickly, Tom, your latest view on M&A versus buybacks?","Thomas A. Kennedy","Well, first of all, and we talked about this before, it's -- first priority remains in growing the company organically. And then we, on the domestic side, we're focused on the hot spots, that includes missile defense, C4ISR, also heavy involvement in cyber. And then we're addressing the international markets, as we discussed in both my script and also in Dave's script. So we're seeing a very large pipeline of organic growth opportunities, both on the domestic side and on the international side. At the same time, we do always look continually for value-added investments outside the company. We continue to look at them in the cyber area and several other areas in our business domain. And as we go forward, we are looking at it in a disciplined approach way. And I can tell you that we, as part of that evaluation, we are looking at what adds value to the shareholders. And if it is a good fit, we will move forward. And as time goes on, we'll let you know as we progress.","David C. Wajsgras","So let me just add 1 or 2 things to what Tom just went over. I mentioned earlier, and I think everyone's well aware of our strong balance sheet position, especially with respect to cash and liquidity and the strong cash flow performance we've had historically and the strong cash flow performance that we see going forward. So we have, as one of our priorities, returning cash to shareholders, but it's one of multiple priorities. I think we're in such a strong position that one doesn't necessarily preclude the other. We don't see fundamental changes in our capital deployment plans going forward. We do see a continued focus on growing the company, as Tom just mentioned, but that will not preclude us from continuing to have, what I would term, a shareholder-friendly capital deployment plan.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Dave, I wonder if you would just walk us through the various opportunities and risks to the guidance for the rest of the year. Where might we see upside if things go well, and where might we see some downside if things don't go well?","David C. Wajsgras","Right. So again, it's a good question. On balance, we're very comfortable with the range of guidance that we put out there that incorporates what we would consider all the known risks and opportunities. From an international perspective, these are factored bookings. So I would suggest that if these were to play out as we anticipate, at a full value, we would see some upside from a bookings perspective, which could translate into some other positives from a sales and earnings standpoint. The risk of -- we talked about the CR before. We've built that into our guidance in the fourth quarter. We would expect a short-term CR toward the end of this year. But even if it were to continue into the first part of next year, I wouldn't see that having a major impact on our results. Those are the ones that are sort of top of mind.","Thomas A. Kennedy","Yes, I'll jump in on one, and this is -- there are some potential opportunities in the first quarter of 2015 that could pull into the year. As always, we're always working to pull those opportunities in as soon as possible so we can convert. And I would say that the team is doing a good job on those. And so we look at those as upside potential that we're trying to harvest.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Dave, how much fee is still at risk on AWD, I mean, if it goes to 0?","David C. Wajsgras","No, Cai, I'm glad you asked that. So let me just talk about AWD very briefly, okay? So we're a top-tier contractor in Australia to the Australian government. The alliance-based contracting approach for this program was the Commonwealth's preferred method of contracting for the 3-ship AWD program, the Air Warfare Destroyer program. This award provided Raytheon with an opportunity to expand our naval combat system expertise and capabilities to a new customer. So strategically, it's positioned us well for future mission systems work on both surface and subsurface platforms with literarily multi-billions of dollars of opportunity over time. Now first, the customer recognizes Raytheon's good performance on our portion of the work. The Australian government's committed to working collaboratively and constructively with Raytheon and other stakeholders to implement a reform strategy to stop the program's growing cost and schedule overruns, again, from the shipbuilder. And while it's difficult to predict the exact timing of when this ultimately plays out, we don't expect the process to conclude until sometime in 2015. Now with all of that said, inception to date, we've recorded incentive fee of about $80 million. We wrote off about $38 million in the second quarter. So the exposure, the upside, the -- kind of the worst-case exposure at this stage would be about $40 million.","Thomas A. Kennedy","Cai, let me jump in on that to kind of explain that contract versus one of our DoD contracts. It's essentially, it's a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract with an incentive fee on top. So as Dave was saying, our maximum exposure is just the incentive fee. I don't know if that helps or not, but that's...","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, no, no, no. That's very clear. That was terrific. Your bookings plan is unchanged and you said 35% to 40% international, and you're clearly under-running that. So even to get to the lower end, it looks like you need like $5.2 billion close to what, $5.8 billion, something like that, in international bookings in the second half. How do you expect that to kind of phase between Q3 and Q4? Because you got a lot of Mid-East customers. And usually, with Ramadan, they don't get around to doing things toward the end of the year.","David C. Wajsgras","So, Cai, the quarterly cadence, as you know, is very difficult to predict. We are very confident with our back-half outlook relative to international bookings. We can't get specific as to exactly where we are in the various stages of completion. Qatar, for example, that was -- recently, the LOA was executed, could be the end of Q3, maybe early Q4. I don't want to get into much more detail on the other large Patriot program that we've been talking about, because it's the customer's request that we don't get into much detail at this point. There's other opportunities as well out of our missiles business and out of our SAS business. But in total, we're looking at about 40% to 50% of our bookings in the second half from international. And I'll repeat it again, we're quite comfortable in our outlook.","Thomas A. Kennedy","And so, Cai, let me just jump in there. Let me add on the Qatar. When you add in the Patriot and the A dock, that covers over half, half of that value you discussed. And there's several other opportunities that will fill in the rest. They're factored. So we feel very confident that we'll be able to achieve that number of about $5.5 billion of the international in the second half.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Terrific. And the last one, your pattern of the Q3 and Q4 is really something of a hockey stick. As you pointed out, low 12s margins and then a strong ramp in the fourth quarter. Could you give us some color on like what -- why is it that low? Why does it move up in the fourth quarter, just in a general sense? Is it sort of overhead pressure from bidding this stuff, not getting the contracts? What are the key issues?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes, so, Cai, a lot of it has to do with the cadence of the bookings. We had a very strong quarter in missiles, like we said before. We have strong bookings in the back half of the year, particularly international. There's really nothing too remarkable relative to the margin cadence. It's, frankly, not very different than what we were anticipating when we gave guidance on the January call. The performance improvements that were pulled from Q3 into Q2 probably -- are probably worth noting. But again, there's nothing too remarkable with respect to the cadence. The fourth quarter is going to be strong, similar to what we've seen in prior years, and that's just the nature of the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Dave, could you give the positives and negatives EAC adjustments gross?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes, sure. You mean for the second quarter?","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, please.","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. The -- well, the net change was $88 million favorable, and that was about 1.5%. But if you exclude the AWD situation, it was about 2.2% overall. So -- and again, we provide some of the details much... I'm sorry?","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, just in -- I'm sorry, just in dollars, the positives as you give them in every 10-Q.","David C. Wajsgras","The gross favorable was in line with -- actually, it was a little bit better with respect to comparing to the first quarter. It was about $20 million better, just under $270 million.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I'm just -- what I'm trying to get at is you've called out the Australian radar last quarter. You called out a little bit this Patriot item, the refurb, I guess. I'm just trying to get a sense as to whether these truly are, particularly this quarter, one-offs that stand out. Or every quarter, you guys have positives and negatives, just like every other defense company. And how much of this is really unusual versus you're calling it out because it's the biggest negative you have?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, I would say the -- clearly, the AWD Destroyer situation is unique. There's no other contract like that within the company. But again, it's worth reiterating. It's a tremendous growth opportunity and something that plays to our strengths. So I would say that is unique, a unique situation. We talked a little bit on the first quarter call about an international Patriot program. It was a refurbishment program. I think we are continuing to see meaningful improvement in that program. And we believe, going to the back half of the year, that the major issues are behind us.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and then just over on the Patriot program, could you describe a little bit what you're doing from an industrial standpoint? My sense is that you've had some international programs that are kind of completing and running off, and you were expecting to get some of these 2 big orders that you're just obtaining in the second half earlier. So is there a line break? Are there people that are -- are there layoffs there or people being moved to other areas temporarily? What are you doing? And how much work are you doing in anticipation of these 2 contracts that you're inventorying right now?","Thomas A. Kennedy","Let me take that, Joe. Number one, as you can remember, in the first half -- early first half of the year, we did book a Kuwait deal. So the Kuwait deal is our bridge into the Qatar and then this other opportunity, international opportunity that we talked about. So I think we -- right now, we have the factory level loaded. We continue to perform well. And it is a strong, I would say, producer and supporter of our margins moving forward on the Patriot line, especially on the production aspects of Patriot.","Operator",".","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Your Missile Systems backlog was very strong. And if you look over the last 3 years, we've seen very strong missile demand for Raytheon, for Lockheed, for MBDA. What do you see driving this high level of demand, and where do you see it heading from here?","Thomas A. Kennedy","Well, Doug, I mentioned that I just got back after 2 trips to the Middle East and spending some time at the Farnborough Airshow talking to quite a few of not only our international customers, but also our domestic customers. One of the themes that we -- I heard consistently from leaders of countries across the Middle East, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region was the following, and it's because of all the uncertainty that is out there. They used the same words, slightly differently, but it was the same across. And that was a strong defense is a strong deterrence. So what we're seeing is across all these nations is that they're looking to build up their defenses. They're looking at the weapons they need. And they're making sure they have the right stockpiles to support this deterrence capability so that they can defend their nations. And it's -- so the uncertainty in the world is driving that demand cycle.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But -- do you see this focused perhaps more on missile demand than maybe in other areas? Because it really does stand out, I think, in terms of growth.","Thomas A. Kennedy","Yes, missile demand, and it's also the overall Patriot systems and the air defense systems. If you remember last year, we booked a system, our NASAM system, in Oman. That, again, is a defensive-type system and, by the way, also happens to use AMRAAMs. But that's the end game here, is that these countries are strengthening their defenses to provide a deterrence against the situations they're seeing in the regions they're located. And that's where the uptick's coming from.","David C. Wajsgras","And I think what you're seeing is a strong pull demand for both the tactical missiles as well as our strategic programs. And when those come together, it bodes quite well for our Tucson operation, which, as you well know, we are the largest missile maker in the world and there is a lot of demand, both domestically and internationally, for the full spectrum of products that we're offering out there.","Thomas A. Kennedy","And we're seeing strong demand for air-to-air. We're seeing strong demand for air-to-surface. And strong demand for surface-to-surface and surface-to-air across the board. But when you roll it all up, it's all about these nations wanting to provide strong defense for their country. And the reason they want that strong defense is they want to make anyone out there think twice before they do anything. And that's driving the demand, and it's just based on personal contact with the heads of the militaries of these countries.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then before, you talked a little bit about the importance of organic investment. And if I have this right, I mean, your intent is to increase that investment, as many of your peers are, in, presumably, both R&D and CapEx. But can you talk a little bit about the scale of organic investment you're looking at and the time frame over which you determine the business case when you make these investment decisions?","David C. Wajsgras","So let me just start out briefly and then we'll add some -- Tom will add some color. But I do want to remind everyone that back in January when we gave our initial guidance, we talked about strategic investments that we were going to embark on for the company both in 2014 and beyond. I think we talked at that point about 20 basis points' worth of investment to strategically and organically grow the company. We're continuing down that path and have been. We see that as a critical tool to grow the company organically. And again, it's part of our overall thinking on the best way to deploy our capital.","Thomas A. Kennedy","So I'll jump in on that. A key element to our win on FAB-T and, last year, on Next Generation Jammer and AMDR, was our investments in technology to bring the best possible capabilities to our customers. So we continue to invest to achieve a competitive advantage in the marketplace, both on the domestic side and also on the international marketplace.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And is there any time frame that you tend to focus on when you make these decisions in terms of when the returns would likely come?","Thomas A. Kennedy","We break it up into almost 3 areas. I mean, there is -- we look as far out as 10 years out in terms of where we think technology is moving. We want to make sure that we're in the right spot at that time. And I'll -- then my example to that is the GaN technology we have talked about in the past. It was about a 10-year investment process in that to set us up to win some major programs like AMDR and also Next Generation Jammer. We also look out about the 5-year period in terms of what's changed and making sure that we're focused in that area in terms of what investments we need to make to be prepared to win business in that area, or keep our products relevant. For example, on Patriot, we continue to invest in Patriot to make it relevant in the latest technologies so that we're competitive in the global marketplace. And then we also look in the near term, the 1 to 2 years, to see what tweaks we need to make in terms of our technology investments to ensure that we're competitive on, I guess, the relevant competitions that are going on in that time period. Hopefully, that helps. But it's not just tomorrow. It really is kind of broken down into these 3 major time chunks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Guys, Raytheon has done a great job positioning itself for a lot of these international opportunities, and we can see that in international sales as a percentage of revenue and what you said about bookings. I'm just curious, what inning do you think we're in, in terms of this pretty significant international growth cycle?","Thomas A. Kennedy","I really appreciate the question. So let me tell you why. We reset the game. So we're back -- we've reset it back to the first inning, and let me explain that. We've recently made some major changes in our international structure and focusing on a set of countries and looking at countries in a different way, international countries. And the way we're looking at them is each country as a market and understanding what elements of that country need solutions that Raytheon can provide and can provide in a better way than our competitors. And that's starting to pay off and it's filling the pipeline for the future. And I would say we have a lot of upside potential in the international marketplace because of this focus and this strategy we have. We've been, for example, in the Middle East for 48 years, I may have talked about this on a phone call before, but we give out something called a service award pin. And a couple of years back, I was in Saudi and gave out the 2 40-year service pins to 2 Saudi nationals. So we're heavily engaged in the Middle East. We've been in Japan, for example, for over 50 years. And we have a very strong brand internationally. And I think that all together our time in these places, the fact that we have operated successfully on programs -- in many cases, you can check our records on some of these international programs we have. We've taken over from our competitors who have not been able to complete the programs. So we have the solid reputation and brand. We are leveraging that into essentially set the clock back to the first inning and putting more folks on the ground. We're also doing much more work in localization. And we've significantly increased our global supply chain here over the last several years. The bottom line is we're essentially repositioning the company to move beyond our 30% revenue for this year in terms of international. I don't know if that helps, but you -- we just can't let -- keep going inning -- inning to inning. You got to reset the game every now and then. And this is -- in the last 6 months, we've been off resetting the game.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's very helpful. And when we think about the company big picture, could we get to 40% international sales as a percentage of revenue? Are those types of targets realistic long term?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. I would say that they're absolutely realistic long term. I'd rather not give a specific time frame. But if you just simply look at where we will likely end up from a backlog perspective at the end of this year, we will be in the 40% range plus or minus, depending on how exactly things play out. But I would say longer term, you should be thinking about the company as a 40-plus percent international company and view us more from a global perspective than just a domestic exporter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Dave, I was wondering if you could help me with this. And I know somebody asked somewhat earlier. But if I look at the first quarter, which was higher, the second quarter was comfortably ahead of the 21.5% of the year's earnings that you projected. You're buying back at a higher rate year-to-date than you had been running. I guess, why aren't you in a position to be talking about a higher guidance? What's the risks in the second half that maybe I'm not seeing?","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. So we are tracking to the guidance that we provided back in January. There's strong program performance at both missiles and IIS, and that offsets the shift in the cadence at IDS for some of the international awards that we addressed earlier. These moved from sort of first half to second half, is the best way to think about it. And we also had, again, the AWD impact. We're continuing to see strength in the second half at SAS, particularly from a sales standpoint. Now I think I understand what you're getting at. We had a strong earnings quarter in the second quarter. We exceeded the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance by about $0.11. But the improvement is driven by volume and performance improvements that were largely expected in the third quarter. So again, we do feel good about the year. In particular, we see strong second half bookings. And sequentially, sequentially now, we see low single-digit sales growth from the first half to the second half. I think when you stand back and you go through the numbers flow that is associated with what I just described, I think you would reach the same conclusion. I'll point this out for probably the fourth or fifth time: We do see a strong second half of this year.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just looking on the P&L, why was G&A up in dollars as a percentage of sales in the second quarter? Is there something unusual, or is this the right level to be thinking about?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, there's a couple of things going on, and we had some public disclosure on this. There's a new stock compensation program. And the accounting was such that we recorded that in the second quarter, and that's in G&A. The CAS harmonization that we've been talking about for a while is also part of the G&A line. We are awaiting -- there's a timing, with respect to an insurance recovery for some property damage that we had that shifted into the fourth quarter and came out of the second quarter. So by and large, I would say, again, there's nothing too remarkable. But with the CAS harmonization and some of the other things that we've talked about, G&A will likely be higher than what it's been in the past. But I do want to point out that when you stand back and look at the overall cost structure of the company, that is continuing to improve. It's just where these expenses and expense reductions are taking place.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and last question for Tom is just, I don't know if you addressed Turkey in terms of the Patriot, but it's been quite a turnaround for that opportunity. And recently, I get there was a down select. How should we size that opportunity to think about where that goes from here?","Thomas A. Kennedy","On Turkey or Poland? Which one do you want?","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Turkey was what I was thinking, because you talked about Poland.","Thomas A. Kennedy","So on Turkey, I mean, there's -- they're in discussions with the Chinese. There was lot of press out there. They have not concluded the negotiations. They have asked us to extend the validity of our proposal, which we have done. As you may know, the U.S. government and NATO have significant concerns relative to a Chinese solution for Turkey and being able to tie that Chinese solution into the NATO system. So they've -- both the U.S. government and NATO, have raised this issue to the highest levels of Turkey's government, and that is being worked in the background. But we continue to stand ready with our Patriot offering. We believe we have a solid offering that includes coproduction and some co-development in Turkey to enable the Turkish government to essentially increase their integrated air and missile defense capabilities for their nation. So we stand ready for the next steps.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Maybe one for Dave. I just wanted to kind of get a little more color on CapEx. Last year, you were about $330 million in CapEx spend, which was below guidance. This year, I think between PP&E and software, your guidance is about $450 million according to the last Q. I was just wondering, are you still tracking to that number? And then directionally, as you think about footprint reductions, should we think CapEx is headed up, down, flat as we go forward? Just some color on that area, please?","David C. Wajsgras","Sure. So we've talked about investing in ourselves, and we're continuing to do that. Tom spoke before about strategic and technology investments. Some of that is part of what you're seeing in our increasing capital this year. We are continuing to make good progress on utilization improvements. We're tracking to about a 2% reduction this year. We talked about a goal of a 10% utilization improvement over the next 3 to 5 years, and we have plans in place and are moving towards those objectives. So I would say from a -- if you stand back and look at what's going on from a capital spend perspective, I think we are driving value the right way through those type of investments.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So, Dave, is this kind of like new tooling to [indiscernible] system?","David C. Wajsgras","I'm sorry. This is like new -- say it again?","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","So these type of investments is an example of sort of new tooling for [ph] better utilization? I'm just trying to understand why -- what was really driving the need for the investment.","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. So we talked about the R&D-type investments, right? The technology and strategic investments. Some of these may be building prototypes and things like that going forward. With respect to real estate, when we're consolidating facilities, we have to build out new space with skips and additional sort of special things that we use at our business. So some of that is built into the capital. But again, I would say that these are all things that we're doing today to improve the business going forward.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I understand much better. And are you approaching peak, or is there still more to go?","David C. Wajsgras","I would -- I'll talk a little more about that probably on the third quarter call. At this stage, you probably want to think about it as flattish as we go into 2015. This isn't formal guidance, but kind of an early perspective is we're going to continue to do the type of things that we've embarked on in '14. So I would say to think about it as flattish, that's probably the best path forward here.","Operator",".","Your last question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","International versus domestic sales growth that you've got baked in for the second half of the year, how does that break out?","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. So in the second half of this year, we're seeing domestic sales growth probably down maybe 1% to 5% or 6%. From an international perspective, we're seeing sales growth of maybe 2% to 5-plus percent on the back half of the year. And then if you take in combination, we're essentially in line with where we were in 2013.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, Dave, I have to ask you on pension.","David C. Wajsgras","No pension questions today. It's a sensitive subject [ph].","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. I know you have your annual update in Q3. The last couple of years that's been a positive upper for you. Can you talk about that? And then everything else pension-related, CAS and mortality and all of that, what's kind of changed relative to 3 months ago?","David C. Wajsgras","So you're right, we'll talk about it in a little more detail in the third quarter. And it's very difficult to forecast how that's going to play out with respect to truing up actuarial assumptions. With respect to the new mortality tables that are going to be used in the future, I mentioned on the last call that we have already taken that into account in our earlier assumptions and started to do that next year. So we don't see a -- any kind of significant impact from a pension standpoint on that or from that. We mentioned a little earlier about the legislation with respect to pension interest rate stabilization. It was first enacted in 2012. And there's a bill that's, right now, in the Senate, not enacted yet, but it could be going forward. Now there's a lot of moving parts here with respect to stabilization. Initially, it affects funding, CAS expense and taxes, and then going forward also impacts that FAS expense. So we're evaluating our funding strategy under the legislation. And we also have to take into account the discount rate environment, demographics, return on assets. I did mention in my earlier remarks that if the House bill were enacted in its current form, it could impact us by about $0.10. But we see that being offset by the R&D tax credit, which is also worth about $0.10 assuming that's enacted. Again, we'll provide further guidance on the Q3 call and give a little more detail then.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And last one on the international side, the bookings strength that you're talking about in the second half of the year, you're anticipating in the second half of the year, what would that do from the perspective of bringing in advances in the back half of the year?","David C. Wajsgras","It would be a plus from an advance standpoint.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Any sort of quantification?","David C. Wajsgras","No. I'd not rather not get too specific on that at this point. I appreciate the question, but we can't get too specific. Again, these are factored, and the advances are also factored.","Todd B. Ernst","All right. Thank you all for joining us this morning.

My name is Tawanda and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed sir.","Todd Ernst","Thank you, Tawanda. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our second quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and a slide that will reference, are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website. With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby and then we'll move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are non-historical facts, particularly comments regarding the Company's future plans, objectives and expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discuss in detail in our SEC filings.","With that I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?","Tom Kennedy","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with Raytheon's strong second quarter performance. Our global growth strategy continues to drive our results, with second quarter revenue up 3%. Our operating performance in the quarter was solid with a strong increase in sequential margins and cash flow generation in the second quarter was well above our expectations.","Given our performance in 2016 to date and how we're seeing the balance of the year playing out, we're raising our EPS and cash flow guidance for the year. Further, based on strong demand that we're seeing from our global customers, we also have raised our outlook for bookings. Toby will walk you through the details in a few minutes.","During the second quarter, I visited a number of country leaders in the Asia-Pacific region. And earlier this month we hosted several hundred customer meetings at the Farnborough Airshow. There was a remarkable level of consistency among these conversations. That is customers are interested in capabilities to address two key missions, one, support global counterterrorism campaigns and two, maintain deterrence in a charged geopolitical environment. More specifically we continue to see strong demand for integrated air missile defense solutions, precision munitions and C5 ISR capability. This demand has been broad-based across the European, MENA and Asia-Pacific regions.","Further, this year there's been an added sense of urgency. I can't think of a time when our international pipeline of opportunities was more robust than it is today. Our international model which looks at countries as markets, is paying off. Let me just give you a few examples. One of our larger international opportunities over the next several months is the Qatar upgraded early warning radar. This radar will significantly improve Qatar's long-range situational awareness capabilities and represents a $1 billion opportunity for the Company. This follows on the country's previous order for ten PATRIOT fire units and an air defense operating center.","We also see further opportunity in-country for TPY-2 radars as part of a THAAD system later in 2017 or 2018. This is consistent with how we've been thinking about the progression of opportunities in the country for some time. Another large upcoming opportunity for the Company is Poland Patriot which is also progressing well. Government to government negotiations are ongoing and we've achieved key milestones with Polish industry on work share, including signing a letter of intent to work with Poland's largest defense contractor, PGC. We anticipate that this multi-billion dollar opportunity will be awarded sometime in 2017. We also see additional opportunities in Poland, including short-range air defense systems related to our NASAMS product line.","Looking at second quarter, our bookings were strong with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.18. Strength in the quarter was driven by the billion-dollar next generation jammer booking at the beginning of the quarter, a nearly $500 million upgrade to Kuwait's six PATRIOT fire units, as well as several notable missile bookings for AIM-9X, Paveway and SM-3. You may recall that we also had a strong bookings in the first which together with our 2Q results drove a year-to-date book-to-bill ratio of 1.13. This strength in bookings lays the foundation for future growth and bolsters our confidence in our outlook.","In the second quarter international represented 31% of total Company bookings. I'd also point out that with the Kuwait Patriot booking, this is the second consecutive quarter where we have had a significant award, from the MENA region. At the end of the second quarter, 42% of our total backlog was from international customers. Our sales growth in the second quarter was ahead of our expectations. Domestic sales increased slightly, while international increased approximately 8% in the quarter, showing that our global growth strategy remains on track. Overall, international represented 32% of total sales in the quarter.","As we look at future growth drivers for the Company, I would like to take a minute to highlight a couple of our many examples. In the second quarter, we delivered the first air and missile defense radar to the U.S. Navy's Pacific missile range facility ahead of schedule. AMDR is the next-generation integrated air and ballistic missile defense radar for the U.S. Navy's DDT 51 Flight III destroyers and fills a critical capability gap for the surface fleet. This delivery is the latest in a series of milestones achieved for AMDR as it advances through the engineering and manufacturing development phase which is now close to 80% complete. AMDR will soon transition to low rate initial production and remains on track for initial delivery in 2019.","Another example of a future growth driver for the Company is Small Diameter Bomb II which we continue to test with the U.S. Air Force. Small Diameter Bomb II features a highly advanced tri-mode seeker which includes infrared imaging, millimeter wave radar and laser guidance to find and attack targets from rages that can exceed 40 Miles.","Testing will continue the summer as the program moves through low rate initial production. Small Diameter Bomb II represents a $4 billion opportunity over the lifetime of this franchise program. Before closing, I'd like to take a moment to briefly touch on the FY '17's defense budget. As most of you know, both the House and Senate have marked up their respective bills and there are significant differences between them. these differences will need to be reconciled before the budget is finalized. Given this and the fact that it is election year, we're anticipating that there will be another continuing resolution which will probably extend beyond the election in November. This assumption is considered within our financial guidance range.","Overall, I'm very pleased with the team's performance in the second quarter. Simply put we had an outstanding results, a solid growth and strong execution. I want to thank the team for all its efforts which continue to deliver for our Company and global customers.","With that, let me turn it over to Toby.","Toby O'Brian","Okay, thanks Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the second quarter highlights and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning. If everyone would please turn to page 3.","We're pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in the second quarter, with bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow all better than our expectations. We had strong bookings in the second quarter of $7.1 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.18. Sales were $6 billion in the quarter, up 3%, led by our space and airborne systems and missiles businesses. Our EPS from continuing operations was $2.38 which I'll give a little more color on in a few minutes. We generated strong operating cash flow of $746 million in the second quarter which was better than our prior guidance, primarily driven by the timing of collections. Second quarter 2016 operating cash flow was higher than last year's second quarter, primarily due to the timing of payments and cash taxes, as well as lower required pension contributions.","During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1.6 million shares of common stock for $202 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchase to 4.8 million shares for $602 million. I want to spend a minute talking about the recent ThalesRaytheonSystems transaction that was concluded at the end of June. Raytheon Thalas concluded an agreement to transition the stakeholder positions each Company held in the TRS joint venture structure. With Raytheon acquiring 100% of the TRS U.S. operations and Thalas acquired 100% of the French operations. As a result of the transaction, Raytheon made a net cash payment to Thalas in the amount of $90 million and recorded a tax-free gain of $158 million at IDS or $0.53 per diluted share in our second quarter financial results.","Important to note that we had previously forecast this to occur in the third quarter of this year at about $150 million. I also want to point out that we're raising the EPS and operating cash flow guidance that we provided in April, reflecting our strong performance to date. I'll discuss guidance further in just a few minutes.","Turning now to page 4, let me start by providing some detail on our second quarter results. Company bookings for the second quarter were $7.1 billion and on a year-to-date basis were $13.3 billion, an increase of approximately $1.3 billion over the same period last year. It's worth noting that on a trailing four quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.11. For the quarter, international was 31% of our total Company bookings and on a year-to-date basis was 29%. For the year, we expect international to be about 35% of total bookings.","As Tom just mentioned, we booked several significant awards in the second quarter, including about $1 billion for the next generation jammer program for the U.S. Navy, $574 million on domestic and foreign training programs in support of war fighter focus activities, $487 million to provide advanced Patriot air and missile defense capabilities for Kuwait and approximately $300 million a piece on both AIM-9X, Sidewinder, short range air-to-air missiles and Paveway. Backlog at the end of the second quarter was $35.3 billion and on a funded basis was $26.1 billion, both up approximately $800 million compared to last year's second quarter.","We now move to page 5. As I mentioned earlier, for the second quarter 2016, sales exceeded the high end of guidance we set in April, primarily due to timing within the year and better-than-expected performance across several of the businesses. For the second quarter, our international sales were approximately 32% of total sales.","Looking now at sales by business. IDS had second quarter 2016 net sales of $1.4 billion. As expected the change in net sales for the quarter was primarily driven by the recognition of previously deferred pre-contract cost on an international Patriot program in the second quarter 2015. In the second quarter 2016, IIS had net sales of $1.6 billion, up 3% compared with the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to our cyber security and special mission programs. Missile systems had second quarter 2016 net sales of $1.7 billion. The 6% increase from the second quarter 2015 was primarily due to the Paveway program.","SAS had net sales of $1.5 billion. The 9% increase versus last year was driven by higher sales on classified programs. And for Forcepoint, the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Websense which we completed at the end of May 2015.","Moving ahead to page 6. Overall the Company continues to perform well. Our operating margin was 15.9% for the total Company and 14.8% on a business segment basis. It's worth noting that the impact of the TRS gain that I discussed earlier was essentially in-line with our prior expectation and was worth $158 million or about 260 basis points at the Company level for the second quarter of 2016.","So looking now at the business margins. The increase in margin at IDS included the results of the TRS transaction. Without the transaction, the IDS margin in the second quarter would've been 15.5%, reflecting their strong operating performance. IIS operating margin was in-line with last year's second quarter. Missiles margin was up 170 basis points in the quarter compared with the same period last year, primarily driven by higher net program efficiencies and a favorable change in program mix in the second quarter of 2016. The decrease in margin at SAS in the quarter, compared with the same period last year, was primarily driven by a change in program mix.","And at Forcepoint the second quarter 2016 operating margin was higher than last year's comparable quarter, primarily due to the acquisition of Websense. Forcepoint's Q2 margin improved from Q2 2015 and as expected, was impacted by integration and transition costs. As we discussed on past calls we remain focused on margin improvement going forward. We're continuously looking for ways to lower our cost, enhance our competitiveness and improve affordability for our customers. In the second quarter one of the key drivers of our margin improvement was the payoff from our investment in factory automation and equipment upgrades and we also saw productivity gains from increased operating leverage.","Turning now to page 7, second quarter 2016 EPS was $2.38, better than expected, primarily driven by higher sales and productivity as well as from the timing of the TRS transaction which as mentioned earlier, was previously forecast to occur in the third quarter. As expected, second quarter 2016 also included the tax benefit associated with the new accounting standard for stock compensation which we previously adopted in the first quarter, worth about $0.10. Of note, the second quarter 2015 included a favorable $0.29 non-cash tax settlement.","On page 8, as I mentioned earlier, we're updating the Company's financial outlook for 2016 to reflect our improved operating performance to date compared to our prior guidance. We still expect our full-year 2016 net sales to be in the range of between $24 billion and $24.5 billion, up 3% to 5% from 2015. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international business.","We've increased our full-year 2016 EPS by $0.20 from our prior guidance and now expect it to be in the range of $7.13 to $7.33. The increase is driven by our improved performance in the first half of the year, as well as a slight improvement to the effective tax rate and slightly lower interest expense.","Turning to our share repurchase, for the end of the second quarter we repurchased 4.8 million shares of common stock for just over $600 million and continue to see our diluted share count in the range of between 296 million and 298 million shares for 2016, a 3% reduction at the midpoint of the range. Also, based on our strong performance to date, we've increased the range for our 2016 operating cash flow guidance by $100 million and now see it between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion.","And as you can see on page 9, we've included guidance by business. We left the sales unchanged from prior outlook. Looking at margins, we've increased the margin guidance range for the Company and now see operating margin to be in a range of 13.2% to 13.4% for the full-year, up 20 basis points from our prior guidance. At the business segment level, we now see the operating margin in a range of 12.6% to 12.8% for the full-year, driven by higher expected operating margin at IDS and SAS. Before moving on to page 10, given our year-to-date bookings strength and our expectation for a strong back half of the year, we're now raising our full-year 2016 bookings outlook to $26 billion, plus or minus $500 million. This $500 million increase to the prior range is driven by strong demand from our global customers.","On page 10, we have provided guidance on how we currently see the third quarter for sales, earnings-per-share and operating cash flow from continuing operations. We still expect third quarter sales to be in a range of just under $6 billion to $6.1 billion, consistent with our prior guidance. EPS from continuing operations is now expected to be in a range of $1.57 to $1.62, lower than our prior guidance due to the timing of the TRS transaction which we had previously forecast in the third quarter. Some of this impact has been offset by the timing of performance improvements previously expected in the fourth quarter.","Before concluding, as we have discussed on past earnings calls, with regard to our capital deployment strategy, we expect to continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain a solid balance sheet at our current credit rating going forward. We remain focused on deploying capital to create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth plans and productivity improvements, as well as returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. Making small targeted acquisitions benefit our technology and global growth needs these and from time to time, making discretionary contributions to our pension plans.","In summary, if you stand back and look at the quarter, we had strong performance. Our bookings, sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations were all higher than expected. Based on this performance and our near term expectations, we increased our 2016 guidance for EPS, operating margin and operating cash flow.","With that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Cai von Rumohr","Given the strength in the quarter really across-the-board and the good cash flow, how come you cut back on your share repurchase from the first quarter and what's your thinking going forward regarding cash deployment?","Toby O'Brian","Let me address that one. So we had planned and we front loaded the share repurchase based upon the timing of our cash flows, okay? And we always had Q1 in excess of the balance of the year, where more than halfway through what we had targeted at the beginning of the year. That said related to the repurchase, we still continue to see value in our stock.","At our last call we indicated a target of 80% to 90% of free cash flow going back to shareholders. Right now we probably see it maybe at the bottom of that range pending market conditions and if we continue to see strong movement in the stock, we're not going to chase the stock price. Share repurchase will still continue to be a core part of our capital deployment strategy, you know, with the stated goal of reducing the diluted share count over time and that hasn't changed. But we will continue to be disciplined when it comes to the allocation of our capital.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.","Carter Copeland","Just a quick clarification for you Toby and a question, Tom. Toby, on the TRS transaction, is there equity income to consider that will be missing going forward? I just was unsure of the accounting implications there but wanted to make sure we all got it modeled correctly. And then for Tom, just on the Forcepoint competitive landscape, I know that during the quarter obviously the purchase of Blue Coat by Symantec. I wondered if you could talk to what implications that has for that marketplace and how you think about the landscape post that announcement?","Toby O'Brian","Yes, sure. I'll address, Carter, the TRS one. There are a few moving pieces with the remaining venture going forward that impact both IDS operating income and at the Raytheon level net income, but they essentially offset each other and are not significant to our results so we shouldn't see an impact one way the other going forward.","Tom Kennedy","And on the Forcepoint, you're absolutely correct, Carter. You know, commercial cyber is a dynamic and rapidly evolving environment and you did mention competitive landscape and it's going to continue to shift, Raytheon continues to invest in R&D to ensure that we have the best products and capabilities for customers and that's where we're getting the feedback from our customers on.","I would add one thing is that you probably saw that the multiples and valuations for Blue Coat acquisition do reflect the premium value and growth potential that this commercial cyber market currently has. Just a quick status on Forcepoint, we have integrated Websense in with our Raytheon cyber products group. It's substantially complete. It was a seamless transition to the new organization and now we're working to complete the transition of the Stonesoft acquisition into the overall Company and we see considerable upside potential as we move forward based on this business we have put together.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed. ","Jason Gursky","Tom and Toby, I was just wondering if you could just walk us through what you think these bookings that you've been getting here over the last year or so tell us about the cadence of revenue. So over the next several years, it's going to be linear growth? Do you have some visibility on when all of these bookings are going to actually convert into some revenue streams?","Toby O'Brian","Jason, you know the nature of our business. The majority of these big awards have about a three-year or five-year cycle, in that range. So traditionally, I mean, we lighten up the first year. If it's three year, we lighten up the first year little bit, lighten up the last year and the middle year is the main. But normally it's about a three-year duration in terms of revenue generation out of the majority of the bookings. IIS does have some quick term, one-year type turn business, but majority of the business and a majority of these major awards that we brought in, are three- to five-year type revenue generators.","Tom Kennedy","And I would just add, you know, obviously we're not giving guidance for 2017, but from when you convert that strong pipeline to a financial perspective, the backlog we had entering the year on the heels of a 1.09% book-to-bill, strong book-to-bill through the first six months, strong four quarter trailing book-to-bill, as Tom mentioned in his comment, a pipeline that we haven't seen of this magnitude for quite some time. We expect to continue to grow that top line, taking all that into account into 2017 and drive margin expansion as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed.","Doug Harned","I'm interested in on the same topic in missiles. Now missiles you've had really nice growth in backlogs, margins have been quite good. Can you comment on the both what it is in the trends in the U.S.-international mix and do you see the growth trajectory in missiles as a secular one or are we seeing kind of a temporary jump up on things like Paveway that we may not see continued growth there in the same way we have?","Tom Kennedy","Let me hit that, Doug, real quick. It breaks into three buckets. The first bucket and I actually mentioned in my prior comments, was the counter-terrorism and that's driving the sales on the precision weapons across-the-board at missiles. The other bucket is deterrence and that's essentially driving a lot of the work relative to our Patriot missiles and our Patriot systems and then the last large bucket is, I would call it and these were the third offset strategy or the future in terms of upgrades to new missiles and capabilities. In the middle bucket on the deterrence, there is a large -- when you saw that in terms of awards on our standard missile product line. The bottom line is, is that missile company is getting significant uptick in each of those three major areas and we should see that going out for a sustained period of time, at least over the next five years.","Toby O'Brian","And Doug, I would just a little bit more nearer term, if I take that op tempo bucket around our consumables and then the rest of the business that the other two buckets that Tom described, think of it this way, for the growth this year is split roughly half-and-half between, you know, driven by the op tempo and consumables and the other half through the rest of the business and as Tom said, based upon the demand we're seeing across the board there, we would expect all aspects of the missiles' business to contribute to growth over the next 12 to 18 months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. ","Sam Pearlstein","I was wondering if you could talk about the $500 million increase you had in the bookings. Is that any one program or is that across-the-board? And I guess somewhat related is I know there's been an RFI out for the new increment of the next jammer, next-generation jammer, I'm wondering if winning on the first one positions you well for the next one or if it's kind of starting over from the drawing board","Toby O'Brian","Let me address the $500 million. The $500 million is multiple opportunities for bookings for the rest of the year. So we're not just hanging our hat on one big award to be able to bring that on board. Relative to next-generation jammer, that program is moving ahead excellently, it's on schedule and we're very happy about the performance of that program.","Obviously our customer, the Navy, is also very happy with the performance. We're working with the Navy in terms of the next, I call it next-generation jammer II or another implementation of a next-generation jammer. And we're well on our track I believe to have a solid offering for the Navy on that program.","Tom Kennedy","I think just to add to Tom's point about the $500 million increase, Sam, you know across multiple programs as Tom said, a lot of the, you know, bookings, the favorable bookings we've seen so far is timing, but within SAS is where we see a lot of those opportunities playing out. They've had a real strong first half of the year between the international classified booking in Q1, JPSS and next-gen jammer that we mentioned, so across multiple opportunities. But the growth would mostly be in the SAS business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed.","George Shapiro","Yes, I was wondering, Toby, if you could kind of give us what the discount rate impact would be on CAS as if we drew a line today like we've heard from other companies?","Tom Kennedy","Yes George, so at this point it is too soon to predict where we think things will go between now and the end of the year. You know, we will give everyone an updated outlook as we typically do on the third quarter call. That said, let me give you a little bit of insight to a few things. Year-to-date our asset return is about 4 1\/2% and due to asset smoothing any type of actual return would have to be significantly different than expected at year end in order to have a meaningful impact on 2017 THAAD CAS and\/or net cash.","That said, assuming all other assumptions remain the same, every 25 basis points change in our discount rate has about an $80 million impact on 2017 THAAD CAS and net cash would be unchanged because it continues to be based upon a 25-year average discount rate. So a few variables there that you all can use and model but again, with half the year left to go, a little too early to predict what exactly next year may look like and we'll update you hear at the end of October on our third quarter call.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please proceed. ","Hunter Keay","Tom, you talked about the $4 billion opportunity for SDB II. I'd kind of like to talk about that program for a minute. I think there's still I believe some unknowns around which planes and maybe specifically which variants of planes will be equipped with that in the future and maybe to that extent which countries have interest depending on cost and other things like test results.","So can you share with us some of the assumptions that are behind maybe the install base and adoption that got you to this $4 billion number and would you categories that as either conservative or aggressive as we sit here or is there may be upside to that and when you'll hit it?","Tom Kennedy","So first of all, Small Diameter Bomb II, it's definitely going on the F-35s. So that's going to -- all the F-35s, both the domestic and international, have an opportunity to be able to use that very sophisticated precision weapon. So I think that's the main aircraft now. It also goes on F-15s and F-16s and it's up pretty simple system to integrate on to an aircraft, so we will be working to put that on any aircraft that we're allowed to go put it on. But the bottom line is, is that forecast assumes just the F-35, F-16s and F-15s. A majority of it being domestic, so we have still significant upside from that number on the international marketplace","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed. ","Howard Rubel","I just want talk maybe a little bit about either risk reduction or margin, however you want to define it, but IDS numbers were pretty good, IIS numbers both had very strong revenues and margins and maybe you could talk about where you are on terms of improving some of the risk management and achieving some of the milestones. Because it looks like those were factors in the results. If you could be a little program-specific that would be helpful.","Toby O'Brian","Yes, so let me take that and then if Tom wants to add any color he can and I'll start, Howard, with IDS, right? So we've been talking about IDS for a while, but we obviously continue to see opportunities to expand margin further in the second half of the year. You know we did raise our margin guidance based upon the results through the first half of the year, up by about 40 basis points, half of that was because of a little bit higher of gain on the TRS transaction and the other half was from productivity we're seeing because of the leverage of the volume going through our factory, the investments in factory automation equipment upgrades, as we mentioned before.","And, you know, I talk about our third quarter guidance and how it was from a timing point of view impacted by TRS moving into Q2, but we did offset -- that was worth about $0.50 -- we did offset about $0.12 of that, primarily driven by further opportunities for net program efficiencies to drive more margin. Those are moving in from Q4 to Q3, not just at IDS but at other businesses. So we feel real good about where we're headed going forward from a margin perspective. We would expect to continue as we've been saying both at the Company level and specifically at IDS, to continue to expand margins going forward beyond 2016 into 2017 as well.","From an IIS perspective on the sales, they had a good quarter. Their sales were up to 3%, driven by cyber security and special-mission programs. For the second half, we see their sales in line with last year's second half despite having four fewer workdays and we still expect growth for the year at IIS in the low single digits.","Tom Kennedy","I'll just cap that off, Howard, with the fact that both our Andover plant and IDS and also our Tucson plant, there is -- and on the Tucson plant we tripled production on several of the missiles there without having a significant need to [indiscernible] capital expenditures to be able to do that and also at the IDS plant, because I know you've been at before, the parking lot is overflowing which means there's -- and that's not just a one shift, that's on multiple shifts. So both of those factories are chugging along at very high capacity rates that obviously gives a strong signal and strong support for high margins moving forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Buckingham Research. Please proceed. ","Richard Safran","You know I heard the comments at the outset of the call on international in the quarter. I also know you're not giving out a 2017 guide, but I wanted to know if you could talk on maybe expectations or maybe comment directionally on international demand for next year, given the strong bookings you're seeing. And as the second part, earlier this year there were concerns about oil prices, Brexit, things like that, that might do to international demand for defense equipment. Could you maybe comment about those concerns and tell us [indiscernible] systems?","Tom Kennedy","Let me hit on the international side right off the bat here, is that we have 2017, I did mention the Pit Bull and Patriot opportunity and we also have the THAAD TPY-II radar opportunity in 2017 also, 2017\/2018. But that's kind of two big ones for 2017, but there are a also significant number of orders for precision munitions that will be coming in, in 2017 and some other areas in terms of missionized aircraft that we believe will be coming in 2017 also. So we believe at bottom line that a strong pipeline of international awards in the 2017 timeframes.","Toby O'Brian","And I think, you know, you mentioned Brexit and I'll make more of a general comment rather than specific to your question about international. You know, we don't see any significant impact at all from Brexit. Just to put it in perspective, the British pound is the functional currency for only about 2% of our sales, so not a major impact at all to the Company and to the business. And I think on the Middle East, you know we mentioned the order for Kuwait Patriot upgrade for about $0.5 billion here in the quarter.","I think Tom also mentioned in one of his prior comments back in Q1 we had another significant order for about $650 million for an international classified customer and we've been pretty consistent over the last couple years, you know, with our customers, our nations that produce oil, that they have a demand for our products because they're looking to protect their citizens and their sovereignty and we're seen no change to that sitting here today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. ","Noah Poponak","I wondered if you could dive a little deeper into what's driving the booking strength at SAS. It looks like that's been actually the strongest book-to-bill in the first half and I know there's' some nice exposures in their between space and Intel and unmanned and some other growth areas, but if you could get a little more specific there and then related, it looks like the guidance for revenue for the segment implies revenue would decline a little bit in the second half, despite those very good bookings and the trend you're on in the first half, if you could sort of explain that, that would be helpful.","Tom Kennedy","Noah, we'll split the question here. As we talked about earlier, we had a major award in the first quarter and that was at SAS for an international product which set them up for a good year in terms of conversion of that revenue in essentially 2016, 2017 and 2018. They've also done quite well in the classified domain in terms of new awards and of converting those new awards into revenue.","They also are working in completing up on the next-generation jammer P&D program which is in full swing, another significant revenue generator for the overall business. And I can tell you they're operating on all cylinders relative to all the other programs that they have in there and it's a good healthy mix. I would call it new programs coming onboard, programs that are I would call it in their mature stage and then programs that are starting to fall off. So they have a very good, I would call it a very healthy mix of programs that should be good revenue generators here for the next five years.","Toby O'Brian","And as far as your question on the, you know, the sales in back half of the year, so sales were up 9% in the quarter and 8% year to date, driven by classified programs at SAS. The second half will be driven by both domestic and international classified programs. Obviously they're off to a good start and we see ourselves ending the year closer to the higher end of their sales range. What may be distorting it a little bit here for you is, you know, we give it to you in one of the attachments, our workdays are a little different this year where the back half of the year in Q4 in particular has four fewer workdays than we saw in 2015. If you normalize for that, they would be showing some growth in the low single digits in the second half.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Please proceed. ","David Strauss","Question on cash. Toby, maybe if you could touch on the major components, specifically contracts in process continues to bill. When does that growth slow or level off and then cash taxes, whether there's been any improvement there in terms of what you're looking for and then the potential to maybe smooth the pension cashette that you've talked about in 2017. Thanks","Toby O'Brian","Sure. So let me start with the CIP. You're right, we have seen a build up in our CIP balance. This increase was in line with what we're expecting. It was primarily driven by our sales growth, along with the timing of program milestones and collections, including the ramp-up on some of the more recent awards that we've had last year and into the early part of this year. It's also, you know, important and I would note that our expected cadence is similar this year to prior years, with the buildup of CIP in the first half and then a decrease in the second half, really driven primarily by the timing of certain milestones and collections.","If you look forward to the end of the year and I think we talked about this back in Q1, we would expect our CIP balance to be up compared to 2015 but more in line with what our balance was at the end of Q1 of 2016 and this is in-line with our growth profile and again driven by the timing of program milestones. As we move to the back half of 2016 and into 2017, we will continue to focus on driving working capital improvements and cash flow generation across the business. You know, we obviously saw strong cash flow here in the quarter. Some of it was timing, David, right? But some of it was permanent improvement for the year which is why we raised the outlook for the year by $100 million to the new range of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion.","As far as cash taxes go, I think that was your second question, no change from a total year point of view from what we were previously expecting there. We still think cash taxes will be paid a little bit over $900 million for the year. The net of refunds, a little over $750 million for the year as well. I think your third question was around the cash impact in 2017 from the required funding of the pension, you know, so look as we've said previously there, when we hold all the assumptions constant, we see our CAS increasing, going from 2016 to 2017 as we transition fully to harmonization and then remaining relatively flat beyond that.","In 2016, the pension cash flow is a bit of an anomaly. It's up from 2015, but then again after 2016, the cash flow from pension, it's still expected to be positive but more as we've said at a normalized rate, plus or minus $700 million, net positive. We do see improved cash flow in our business as programs continue to progress through their life cycles and achieve significant program milestones that will improve the cash position and our continued focus on working capital including cycle time and payment term reductions with our customers will also drive some cash flow which could and will offset part of that increase.","You know, as reminder that increase is really driven by the plans coming out of full funding from a PPA point of view and again primarily having to fund the annual-service cost. As we always do, kind of last point here, you know we'll continue to monitor all aspects of the pension and you know, we will consider making it, if it makes economic sense to the Company, to the shareholders, we'll consider making discretionary contributions, you know, before the year's over that could potentially have a further impact on the cash flow profile in 2017 and beyond.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. ","Robert Spingarn","I guess I missed it the first time but was on another call. I wanted to ask for a clarification or on polling, Tom and then another question, but is it still this Polish competition, is this for a full-up system or is it a shorter range smaller system?","Tom Kennedy","There's actually two pursuits or two programs that polling is pursuing. One is a system that the Patriot system satisfies and as you probably have seen in the press, the minister of defense is moving forward with the Poland acquisition. And so it's working government-to-government and also Raytheon is heavily involved in that procurement.","And then there's another program which is being competed and it's a shorter range system that ties directly in with the capabilities of our NASAM system, the system that protects our nation's capital. It's also the system that we sold to Oman and about four other countries outside the United States. So that's the two. We're obviously positioned on Poland Patriot and we're working to make sure that we're in a good position on the short-range system, too.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please proceed. ","Joseph DeNardi","Just on a the IDS guidance, seems like the revenue's ramping up in the back half of the year but margins are coming down a little bit, so can you just talk about some of the puts and takes there and whether the exit rate on the revenue side is a good way to think about IDS growth in 2017?","Tom Kennedy","Yes, so from a revenue point of view, for the total year, we see IDS sales, you know, roughly in line with 2015, with as you said the cadence improving as we move through Q3 and Q4. And that's due primarily to the start up of some new awards this year, as well as the continued ramp-up on some of our international Patriot programs as they move through their normal lifecycle. You know, from a margin point of view, as I said earlier, we still see opportunities for margin expansion. We were pleased with the results in the second quarter. The 15.5% margin that IDS delivered, excluding the TRS gain.","As I mentioned, part of that was from accelerating net program efficiencies, profit improvements, from the back half of the year into the second quarter. We see a little bit more of that in the third quarter. We upped the margin guidance by the 40 basis points, half of which was attributable to operating performance, the other half to the gain. And we would expect to continue to see margin improvement at IDS beyond 2016's rate normalized for the TRS gain, we'd expect to see improvement continuing into 2017.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed. ","George Shapiro","Yes, Toby, I just want some clarification. The $0.20 increase in earnings, the way I look at it, maybe $0.03 from the little higher gain in IDS, a $0.05 from taxes. So $0.12 from operations, even though operations you said were $0.20 better in the quarter, so just looking for some reconciliation","Toby O'Brian","Yes, so the $0.20 and maybe it's just the definition of the buckets here, so you got the $0.03, right? On the gain, right? That's about $0.03 higher, a $0.05 on tax, about $0.09 from the business operating margins, okay? And then there was, I mentioned interest was a little better, that's about $0.01 and then we had some corporate operating items that was another $0.02. So you can bucket it a lot of ways, but around $0.12 out of that $0.20 from operations and about $0.08 from non-operating items.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. ","Myles Walton","I was wondering if you could touch on a couple competitions. One is the T-X and your T-100 offering there with Alenia. And kind of the progress you're seeing and the type of relationship you're having where it seems like a relatively low investment but a good way to kind of enter adjacent markets and then the GBSD program, as that kind of gets into gear over the next few years, how your go-to-market strategy is in the context of that as well. Thanks.","Toby O'Brian","Miles, what was the second program you were asking about?","Myles Walton","Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent.","Tom Kennedy","Okay, let me hit the first one here on T-X competition and a little bit about our approach to the competition. We're treating the program as more than just an airplane, flying an airplane. It's really about preparing the pilots for the mission success in advance and we're looking at for their ability to deal with multi-faceted and increasingly complex battle space and so what we're bringing to the table is our industry-leading capabilities in training and also next-generation mission systems and believe we're well-positioned to provide the Air Force a comprehensive solution to their training needs here.","Our offering is the Alenia M-346 in any configuration and it's already training fourth- and fifth-generation pilots from Israel, Singapore, Italy and Poland. It is a complete system and the classroom to simulators to the aircraft, it is operationally proven. It does provide high degrees of confidence in both schedules cost and performance based on its proven capability. Our T-100 solution incorporates also our team's expertise in live virtual constructive training and again that's to drive efficiency and enhance affordability.","In terms of timing, it is our understanding that the Air Force does plan to release an RFP by the end of this year and to award a contract by the end of next year. So we're working this very heavily. It's an important program to Raytheon. It's also an important program to the Air Force and we believe we have the best solution on that.","Todd Ernst","Okay, we're going that leave it there for the day.

The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we\u2019ll reference are available on our Web site at raytheon.com.","Following this morning\u2019s call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our Web site. With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Toby O'Brien, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Toby and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I\u2019d like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the Company\u2019s future plans, objectives and expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?","Tom Kennedy","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon had another great year of performance in 2017, and our growth strategy continue to deliver results for our shareholders and customers. Sales were up 8% in the fourth quarter and 5.1% for the full year, and we set a new company record for annual sales of $25.3 billion. We continue to see strong global demand for our innovative solutions, illustrated by our book to bill ratio of 1.26 in the fourth quarter and 1.09 in the year. This drove an increase in backlog of $1.5 billion year-over-year and positions us for a strong 2018.","EPS exceeded our expectations in the fourth quarter and for the full year after adjusting for the impact of tax reform and our discretionary pension contributions. We continue to drive strong cash flow and I was pleased with our better than expected cash in the quarter and full year. This allow us to make a significant discretionary contribution to the pension of $1 billion. Toby will review additional details about the fourth quarter and 2018 guidance in a few minutes.","Our international business continue to be strong. 2017 marked the 14 consecutive year of international sales growth for the company with sales up 8.4% in the fourth quarter and 6.2% for the full year. In fact, Raytheon achieve record international sales of over $8 billion for the full year, which represents approximately 32% of sales. Our differentiated international strategy is working, and we are encouraged by the broad based demand we are seeing across Europe, Asia Pacific and MENA for our advance capabilities.","In Europe, we are pleased to see the commitment or plans in place for NATO countries to meet their obligation to spend 2% of their GDP on defense. Also, in early November, Sweden announced that it selected our combat proven Patriot Air and missile defense system capability. Sweden is expected to sign an LOA in mid 2018, which is an approximate $1 billion opportunity. And in late November Romania signed an LOA with the U. S. government to purchase Patriot, which paves the way for the U. S. government to begin contract negotiations with Raytheon.","We would expect the booking in 2018, making Romania the 14th country to depend on Patriot to protect its citizens and armed forces. And we continue to make progress with Poland and another European country on their acquisition of Patriot capabilities. We also continue to see strong Patriot demand from existing customers. After the quarter, in early January, we booked a new direct commercial contract for Patriot capabilities worth over $1.5 billion.","In the Asia-Pacific, Japan is set to expand its ballistic missile defense capabilities. On December 19th, Prime Minister Abe Cabinet approved the procurement of two land based Aegis Ashore missile defense systems, and a budget is up for approval that includes funding for standard missile family, including SM2, SM3 Block 1B, SM3 Block 2A and SM6. The budget also includes funding for AMRAAM and AIM-9X missiles.","Turning to the Middle East. In December, I was in the United Arab Emirates to help Raytheon mark its 30th anniversary of our partnership with the nation. At that time, we announced the formation of a new wholly-owned subsidiary, called Raytheon Emirates, which is incorporated and headquartered in Abu Dhabi. Through this agreement Raytheon is committed to helping the UAE achieve its economic goals, while providing trusted innovative solutions that support the nation's defense and security requirements.","Also last year, Raytheon announced a similar agreement in Saudi Arabia where we have been doing business for over 50 years. Although, both of these subsidiaries are in the early stages, they demonstrate Raytheon's differentiated international strategy.","Turning to our domestic business. We saw an acceleration in growth in 2017. Domestic sales were up 7.9% in the fourth quarter and 4.6% for the full year. And we expect our domestic growth to continue to be strong in the future as our domestic book to bill ratio in 2017 was 1.11. Our IIS segment, which has the highest percentage of domestic business, grew its backlog almost 15% in 2017. For the Company, key domestic bookings in the quarter were for AMRAAM, Tomahawk, Warfighter FOCUS, Domino and a classified program at missiles.","Looking to 2018 and beyond, we see continued growth and strong demand signals in the areas of counter-insurgency, counter-terrorism, Deterrence and response to peer nation threats. While we touched on this areas on past calls, I'd like to spend a few minutes today discussing trends we are seeing in each area and the ways in which these trends continue to positively impact our growth. First, the counter-insurgency counter-terrorism area, is driving a significant demand for precision weapons in ISR assets across the globe. A good example of that demand can be seen in our missile business, which grew bookings in the fourth quarter 23% year-over-year, mainly driven by an increase in precision weapon contracts.","In 2018, we expect this demand to continue across a number of our missile franchises. The second area with strong demand signals is Deterrence, where our customers are focused on deploying technologies and solutions that can deter a threat from taking action. This area continues to drive strong demand for integrated air and missile defense capabilities. We've seen Deterrence demand grow in Europe where nations are concerned about protecting their sovereignty and are looking to our Patriot Air and missile defense system to provide advanced Deterrence s capabilities.","And as I mentioned, in 2017, we saw demand for Patriot from Sweden, Romania, Poland and another European country. Beyond Europe, Deterrence is also getting additional growth opportunities for our systems in Japan and the Middle-East.","Lastly, countering pure nation threats with advanced technologies is a rapidly developing growth area for Raytheon, especially in our classified business. Peer nations are working to close the gap with U.S. capabilities, which is driving strong demand from our U.S. customers. Demand that resulted and a new company record for classified sales in 2017. Looking ahead, our next generation solutions and technologies, such as the Long Range Standoff, the Long-Range Precision Fires, high energy lasers and hypersonics will continue to fuel growth in this area as he U.S. looks to maintain its operational and technical dominance.","Turning to Washington. Last week, Secretary of Defense, Mattis, released a national defense strategy. The strategy is subtitled, sharpening the American militaries competitive edge summarizes his intent clearly. Secretary Mattis calls for urgent change, a significant scale to content with the high end threats that are directly characterized as essential challenge to U.S. prosperity and security.","Investment priorities are clearly articulated as is the need for accelerating defense exports to improve interoperability between U.S. and allie forces. Providing sophisticated capabilities to our customers is essential to the growth strategy Raytheon has been executing. Our current capabilities and investments are aligned with secretary Mattis\u2019 modernization priorities and we look forward to helping the defense department execute its strategy at the speed of relevance as secretary Mattis says.","For the U.S. defense budget, we continue to see strong congregational backing for missile defense, cyber and other areas where Raytheon has a leadership position. And we remain optimistic that congress will pass a fiscal year '18 budget that provides our military the resources, technology and training necessary to protect United States and support our allies.","This strong growth environment creates the benefit of a strong jobs environment. And in 2017, we added over 1,000 new jobs to our payroll. These are noble jobs, rewarding, good paying jobs that allow our employees to buy homes, raise families and save for retirement, all while serving a lager purpose of helping to make the world a safer place. The demand signals we see in our key growth areas, combined with the implementation of tax reform making us more globally competitive, creates a positive environment for continued business and jobs growth, going forward.","In summary, 2017 was another great year for Raytheon. For that, I want to thank all of the members of the Raytheon team worldwide. They keep raising the bar on our performance and they are passionate about engineering a safer world with the innovative solutions we provide for our customers. I couldn\u2019t ask for a better team.","And let me turn the call over to Toby.","Toby O'Brien","Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and full year results. Then I'll discuss our outlook for 2018. After that, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. During my remarks, I'll be referring to the Web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on our Web site.","Okay, would everyone please turn to page three? We are pleased with the strong performance the team delivered in both the fourth quarter and the full year. We have strong bookings in the fourth quarter at $8.5 billion, resulting in a book to bill ratio of 1.26. And for the year, we had bookings of $27.7 billion, with backlog up 4%. This sets the stage for continued growth in 2018, which I\u2019ll discuss in more detail in just a few minutes.","Sales were $6.8 billion in the quarter, up 8% from the same period last year. We saw growth across all of our businesses. For the year, sales were up 5.1%, reaching a new company record of $25.3 billion. Our EPS from continuing operations was $1.35 for the quarter and $6.94 for the full year. I will give a little more color on EPS in a few minutes, including the impact from both tax reform and the discretionary pension contribution. We also generated strong operating cash flow of $1.6 billion for the quarter and $2.7 billion for the year, which included the $1 billion pre-tax discretionary pension contribution that was not in our prior guidance. It\u2019s worth noting that excluding this discretionary pension contribution, we exceeded our operating cash flow guidance by approximately $800 million at the midpoint and achieved a new company record for operating cash flow.","Additionally, during the quarter, the Company repurchased approximately 540,000 shares of common stock for a $100 million, bringing the full year 2017 repurchase to 4.9 million shares for about $800 million. We reduced our share count in 2017 by 2%. Also, as we previously announced in November 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion of the Company\u2019s outstanding stock. The Company ended the year with a solid balance sheet and net debt of approximately $1.7 billion, which provides us financial flexibility for the future.","Turning now to page four. Let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. As I mentioned earlier, we had strong bookings of $8.5 billion in the quarter and $27.7 billion for the full year, resulting in the year-end backlog of $38.2 billion. This is an increase of $1.5 billion over year-end 2016 and provides us with the solid foundation for 2018.","Worth noting that both Missile Systems and IIS had outstanding bookings performance for the full year 2017, up 23% and 19% respectively. For the quarter, international orders represented 40% of our total company bookings and for the full year, were 31% of total bookings. At the end of 2017, approximately 40% of our backlog was international.","Turning now to page five. We had fourth quarter sales of $6.8 billion, an increase of 8% compared with 2016\u2019s fourth quarter and in line with our prior expectations. As Tom just mentioned, international sales continue to be strong, representing 32% of our total sales for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2017.","So looking at the businesses, IDS had net sales of $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 6% from the same period last year, primarily due to higher net sales on an international early warning radar program. IIS had net sales of $1.6 billion in Q4. The increase was primarily driven by higher net sales on a U. S. Air Force program and classified programs. Net sales at missile systems in the fourth quarter were $2.2 billion, up 15% compared with the same period last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales on AMRAAM, SM-3 and Paveway. As I said net sales of $1.7 billion in Q4, the increase was primarily driven by higher net sales on airborne radar programs. And at Forcepoint, we saw 9% growth.","For the full year, total company sales were $25.3 billion, up 5.1% over full year 2016, both our international and domestic businesses contributed to the sales growth.","Moving ahead to page six. We delivered solid operational performance in the quarter. And as expected. at the total company segment level, margins in the fourth quarter were impacted by the timing of productivity improvements we recognized earlier in the year and program mix.","Turning to page seven. We had strong solid operating margin performance for the year. Total company segment margins were 12.4%. It's worth noting that the impact of the gain from the TRS transaction in 2016 that we\u2019ve discussed in the past was worth about 70 basis points at the company level. Excluding this gain, our margins in 2017 were slightly higher year-over-year.","On page eight, you'll see both the fourth quarter and full year EPS. In the fourth quarter 2017, our EPS was $1.35 and for the full year, it was $6.94. We had solid operating performance from both the quarter and full year. Both were impacted by a couple of notable items that I wanted to spend a minute talking about.","First, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 had an unfavorable $171 million or $0.59 provisional tax related impact. This related to the re-measurement of our net deferred tax assets, as well as a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings. This resulted in a 550 basis point increase to our full year 2017 tax rate. Note this is a preliminary estimate and we will finalize the number by the end of 2018. And second, as a result of the $1 billion pre-tax discretionary pension plan contribution that we made in the fourth quarter of 2017, there was an unfavorable tax related impact of $0.09 because the contribution lowered the benefit of our domestic manufacturing tax deduction. This lowered EPS and was not included in our prior guidance.","Turning now to page nine. Before moving on to our 2018 guidance, it's important to note as we discussed on our third quarter call that effective January 1, 2018, we adopted a new retirement benefit standard, ASU 2017-07, which moves all components of the FAS pension and post retirement benefit expense except for FAS service cost from operating to non-operating income. The adoption of the new standard has no impact on our net sales, EPS or operating cash flow. It affects our reported operating income as you'll see in the recaps numbers. To assist you with your modeling and for comparison purposes, we provided the recast data for 2016 and 2017 and the attachments at the end of the earnings release.","Now looking at our 2018 guidance on page nine. We see sales in the range of between $26.4 billion and $26.9 billion, up 4% to 6% from 2017, which is better than our initial outlook that we provided in October. The increase is driven by growth in both our domestic and international businesses.","Our 2018 outlook for the defered revenue adjustment is $10 million and for the amortization of acquired intangibles, is $118 million. As for pension, we see the 2018 FAS\/CAS operating adjustment at approximately $1.4 billion of income and the other pension expense, which has now reported in the non-operating, at $958 million.","We expect net interest expense to be between $180 million and the $185 million in line with 2017. We see our average diluted shares outstanding to be between $287 million and $289 million on a full-year basis, driven by the continuation of our share repurchase program. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. Our estimated tax rate in 2018 is lower than 2017, primarily due to enactment of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In 2018, we see our EPS to be in the range of $9.55 to $9.75. Our operating cash flow from continuing operations for 2018 is expected to be between $3.6 billion and $4 billion. This compares to $2.7 billion in 2017, which as we previously mentioned, included $1 billion discretionary pension contribution.","Before moving on to page 10, I would like to mention that we expect our 2018 bookings to be between $27.5 billion and $28.5 billion, driven by demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. And we expect stronger bookings in the second half of the year similar to prior years.","So if you move to page 10, here we have provided our initial 2018 guidance by business. We expect to see growth in our IDS Missile systems, SAS and Forcepoint businesses in 2018. At the midpoint of the sales range, we expect IIS sales in 2018 to be in line with 2017. As we've discussed before, this is driven by the planned ramp down on the Warfighter FOCUS program. Excluding Warfighter FOCUS , we expect IIS to grow in the low to mid-single digit range, driven by domestic cyber security and classified programs.","With respect to segment margins, consistent with our prior comments, we expect 2018 margins to continue to be solid in the 12.5% to 12.7% range. This is up about 20 basis points over 2017 at the midpoint. At IDS, we see margins in the 16.4% to 16.6% range, which is also up from 2017. This change is driven by favorable program mix as we ramp on some recently awarded programs and increased productivity, driven by efficiencies from our investments and factory automation and equipment upgrades.","We expect IIS margins of 7.6% to 7.8%, which is up 30 basis points over 2017 at the point. We see missile\u2019s margins in the 13.1% to 13.3% range, up versus 2017. SAS margins are expected to be in the 12.3% to 12.5% range. And as I mentioned on the October call, down year-over-year primarily due to program mix. And at Forcepoint, we expect margins in the 6% to 8% range.","It\u2019s worth noting under the new retirement benefit standard, our margins at a total company level recast for 2017, are 16.7%. For 2018 at a total company level, our margins are expected to be in the 17.1% to 17.3% range. This increase is driven primarily by both the improvement at the business segment level and a higher expected FAS\/CAS operating adjustment.","We now turn to page 11. We\u2019ve provided you with our outlook for the first quarter of 2018. Excluding the impact of tax reform in Q4 2017, we expect the cadence for the balance of 2018 to play out similar to 2017 with sales, EPS and operating cash flow ramping up in the second half of the year.","Turning to page 12. Given tax reform and to help you with your modeling, we provided you with a long-term view of how we see our cash flow outlook over the next three years. We are pleased with our strong cash flow going forward, which is better than our prior expectations. We see our cumulative operating cash flows to be approximately $11 billion to 412 billion from 2018 through 2020.","And on page 13, as we have done in the past, we\u2019ve provided the summary of the financial impact from pensions in 2017, as well as the projected impact for 2018 through 2020, holding all assumptions constant. For comparison purposes, we\u2019ve provided you with the pension tables under both the old and new retirement benefi standards.","As I mentioned earlier, we see the 2018 FAS\/CAS operating adjustment at approximately $1.4 billion of income and the other pension expense in non-operating at $958 million, which reflects our investment returns in 2018 of 15% on our U. S. pension assets, the December 31st discount rate of 3.7% and a long-term return on asset assumption of 7.5%. And finally, on page 14, we have provided an updated three year outlook of the acquisition accounting adjustments to help you with your long-term modeling.","Before concluding, I wanted to touch on our capital deployment strategy, especially in light of tax reform. As I just mentioned, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and maintain a strong balance sheet that provides us the financial flexibility. We remain focused on deploying capital in ways that create value for our shareholders and customers. This includes internal investments to support our growth, paying a sustainable and competitive dividend, reducing our share count, making targeted acquisitions that fit our technology and global growth needs and making discretionary contributions to the pension.","Let me conclude by saying that in 2017 Raytheon again delivered strong operating performance. Sales grew 5.1%, and our backlog was up 4%. We have a solid balance sheet, which gives us flexibility and options to continue to drive shareholder value and a strong outlook for cash. We are well positioned to grow in 2018 and beyond.","Before moving on to Q&A, I'd like to welcome Kelsey DeBriyn, who recently joined the Investor Relations team as a Senior Director. As Todd transitions to his new role as Vice President of Corporate Development, please feel free to reach out to Kelsey with follow-up questions after the call.","So with that, we'll open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu, please proceed.","Sheila Kahyaoglu","Just I guess on margins for missile systems going forward, maybe if you could elaborate on that a little bit. Given your signal pick up in our short type of business with precision weapons and strong bookings, maybe can you talk about the mix impact there?","Toby O'Brien","So we do expect to see higher productivity and operational efficiencies at missiles this year. But as you mentioned, given their portfolio and their mix, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that that is a broad portfolio. We've seen considerable growth in both development and classified programs that can and are impacting the margin a bit, particularly early on so that's a bit of a headwind right now. But overall, we're very pleased with the portfolio, the mix of programs and it really supports and bodes well for the continued ability for the missiles business to grow going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Cai von Rumohr","So you've given us a lot of detail on the Tax Act impact, the P&L and those items. Could you maybe walk us through the impact on 2018 cash flow, I mean breaking out items of the repatriation, the lower tax rate any other items that are relevant. Thank you.","Toby O'Brien","So I'll start with the repatriation right. So that doesn't have any impact on our cash flow. That was cash that was already on the books. What that does do, it gives us some flexibility to bring cash back over to the U. S. to deal with some ebbs and flows of needs domestically versus internationally. I think beyond that, what I would say is within our cash outlook for 2018, we\u2019ve got a little over $400 million as it relates to tax reform overall as a benefit compared to our prior expectations. We have that offset a little bit maybe about $150 million $200 million related to some tax initiatives that we got the benefit of from a cash tax point of view in 2017 that we don\u2019t see repeating in 2018. But overall, we\u2019re pleased with tax reform. As Tom mentioned in this comments, it provides us the benefit to be more competitive and it does provide some additional financial flexibility for us.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Robert Spingarn","A follow-up or clarification type question on Missiles, well really revenue question Tom on SM-3 and SM-6. Wondering if you could see the air force and the navy doing combined buy there, may be a multiyear. And then the second question is just the Forcepoint margin. What's going on there?","Tom Kennedy","Yes, let me start off with missiles. We are working with the department to -- and looking at multiyears for the standard missile family, and combining SM-3 and SM-6. So there is activity looking at that. I can tell you that the demand signals for the SM-6 and SM-3 are at an all time high. So we feel very strongly about those two franchises and actually SM-3 had multiple franchises within it, both domestic and international.","Moving over to Forcepoint, we said that this year at Forcepoint would be a rebuilding year. We did there do a major change and its back office and also a major change, and it's a sales force. The area here is what we\u2019re trying to drive, is a move from the sneeze, small to medium size enterprises into the large enterprises and very large enterprises. And then also there was couple of acquisitions that have worked out very well for us, and putting them in the place. But we really looked at the 2017 as a rebuilding year for Forcepoint and essentially structuring it as the $600 million year revenue business that it is.","Toby O'Brien","And Rob, maybe I'll just add a little bit to Tom\u2019s comments on Forcepoint. So they did fall short of our expectations in the quarter. They didn\u2019t end where we want them to be. That said, following on what Tom said, we have made the appropriate investments in the business. And what we're seeing is they\u2019re just taken a bit longer to play out and translate into both sales growth and margin expansion, and we still believe that's attainable. The outlook, the guidance we provided for '18 reflects the outcome we saw in 2017 and again, the latter timing of the pay off of our investments.","I\u2019ll reinforce on the positive side, we are seeing a growing and stronger pipeline. Tom talked about acquisitions are proving to be beneficial. And we do have solved and demonstrate the capabilities and solutions in the business. I'll also point out for '18 at Forcepoint specifically, we do expect a stronger back half of the year compared to the first half. And because of that, we would expect an operating loss at Forcepoint in the first couple of quarters similar to what we saw in Q4 with volume building into the second half along with the profitability and higher margins.","Beyond \u201918, we still expect the business to be able to deliver double-digit growth in margins. Just real tactically on Q4 '17, the margin was just impacted by lower volume. To put in perspective, it was about $12 million of sales that moved into '18 from '17 as Tom mentioned really just longer gestation period on deals with large and very large enterprises, it was about four, five deals ranging from $1 million to $4 million that move that caused the sales and margin shortfall in Q4.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed. ","Douglas Harned","You\u2019ve been having a lot of success with Patriot lately, and I\u2019d like to understand a couple of things on it. One is, when you look at the outlook for Patriot, how do you see the outlook for the Missiles used. In other words, perhaps you could say a little bit about the SkyCeptor program. And I would add into that, when you go to 360 degree radar, what do you expect this will do in terms of affecting the market and the demand for the system?","Tom Kennedy","So let me take that, Doug. First of all, I think what\u2019s key about Patriot for folks to understand is that there is multiple countries that own and utilize the Patriot system. With the addition of Romania that will be 14 countries. And then with Poland, that will make it 15 and then with Sweden, that will make it 16. So relative for example to the 360 radar, there is a market of these 16 countries for an upgrade to their Patriot systems. So it\u2019s actually provides the built-in market for the Patriot capabilities. We had seen some significant demand for our GEM-T missiles in the Middle East that this system is being used quite a bit by both the Emirates and then also by Saudi Arabia, to essentially knock down scuds that are being fired out in Yemen, so high demand signal there for GEM-Ts and then very successful in that region.","I think the bottom line is that Patriot has a lot of upside potentially here over the next several years. The main area here is a concept that Deterrence that I talked about, that nations want. This capability protects their sovereignty and we\u2019re seeing that big demand pulls in actually three regions in Europe, in the MENA region and also in the Asia Pacific region. So I think Patriot is going to a solid franchise here definitely for at least the next 10 years then with the refresh of the 360s radar that takes out another 20 years.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Richard Safran of Buckingham Research. Please proceed.","Richard Safran","Tom, on the subject of franchise, because I thought I would ask you about two. I was reading and I wanted to ask you about the hypersonic comments in your opening remarks. I was reading that there could be an award this year possibly in March for a hypersonic weapon. So wanted to know, you\u2019ve been talking about this for some time, one pillar of your strategy. Are you being considered the prime on the program? Do you think there isn\u2019t award that could be made this year? If possible, can you talk about the size of the opportunity? And on the second part here, Harpoon replacement, so you\u2019ve had Lockheed and Boeing trucked out. We\u2019ve talked about this. Are we going to get that contract signed as soon as the CRs end and we have an FY 2018 spending bill? And if you could discuss how quickly that program might ramp?","Tom Kennedy","Rich, first of all back on hypersonic. We\u2019ve been on the hypersonic path here for many years. In fact, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s in our second pillar of our four pillar strategy. We actually say that we\u2019re heavily investing and working in the hypersonic area. We have already gotten multiple hypersonic contracts with the Department of Defense. So one of the larger ones is a program called Hawk, which is with DARPA and it is -- essentially it\u2019s a sensory hypersonic missile and we are the prime.","There are several other, I would call, pursuit activities relative to hypersonic. So we are engaged in those hypersonic missile pursuits and as a prime across the board. So we do believe that hypersonics is the next wave of technology related to advanced missile systems, and that's our significant opportunities out there and we've positioned ourselves year over multiple years to be ready to go capture those opportunities. And we felt very positive about that.","On your other question relative to naval strike missile, you're absolutely correct. We are heavily engaged in that pursuit. There is press out there that does say that both Boeing and Lockheed have dropped out. We are pursuing this in a competitive way despite that. And you also are right it does take the CR to be removed for us to be awarded the contract here. Number one reason is the fact that they can't award a new start under a CR. So we're very, I\u2019d say, motivated to see the CR finally resolved here in the February time frame.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Carter Copemann with Millius Research. Please proceed.","Carter Copemann","Tom, a couple for you, one on the Forcepoint commentary, and the performance relative to your expectations. I mean there's clearly a trust element in the plan and the performance improvement you expect there, but there's also a decision at some point in the future about whether or not you want to keep that asset or not. Is there a period of time that you're considering or you think we should consider is reasonable to expect that performance improvement to show up that we should wait and see or not. And then secondly on the commentary Toby you made around tax reform, and wanting to be balanced. Is there any -- and clearly there's an incentive. But is there any opportunity for internal investment that you can identify or even just areas of investment that you guys might want to put incremental capital to work, especially given the share repurchases for you and a lot of the other peers in the space have come off a little bit from where they were. Help us think through if there's really anything material there. Thanks guys.","Tom Kennedy","So let me take the Forcepoint first. And the bottom line is that the team is focused on executing its growth strategies. And Forcepoint is all about growth. One of the other elements we haven't talked about is how Forcepoint fits into our overall cyber strategy at the company level, and the synergies that we get, especially in international market and working with other governments in terms of being able to leverage the technologies out of Forcepoint, which has helped us essentially grow our entire cyber security capability within the company.","We are, again, this year was a rebuilding year. We're going to be, I would call it, next year is a transient year coming off the rebuilding year and into what we consider to be a year to be able to drive and meet our expectations moving forward. So I think this year 2017 was the rebuild year, 2018 is a transient year, ramping up into where we expecting to be with the double digit growth and also double digit margins in 2019. That's essentially how we are looking at it. And in meantime, we are leveraging Forcepoint in all of our international pursuits relative to cyber security with industrial partners and then also with governments around the world.","Toby O'Brien","And then Carter, I'll maybe go little bit broader and try to answer your question on the -- around capital deployment. So I won't repeat what I said in the script about how we're thinking of it from a high level point of view. But I will reinforce that we continue to target 80% of our free cash been return to shareholders. And sitting here today, we still see that is the case in that 80% range plus or minus. But one thing that we have done, you mentioned capital investments in ourselves to continue to grow.","So last year our CapEx and software spending was $611 million. In 2018, we expect it to be in the range of $910 million to $950 million, so more than a 50% increase. And what we're doing there, where we're making those increases, we're looking to invest in infrastructure or high technology production facilities demonstration capabilities, more factory automation. The combination of which helps position us better to grow and drive productivity improvements. IR&D as well, we\u2019re looking at about 3% of IRAD at sales here in '18, and given or take, would expect that to continue ongoing forward. I would say that the tick-up in capital, think of that as kind of a one-time step-up. And going forward in '19 and beyond, the way to think of thing is more give or take 3% of revenue.","And then last thing that I would mention, obviously, we made the $1 billion discretionary contribution to the plan in '17. And given tax reform, we continue to evaluate potentially making an additional contribution before September 15th and will provide more details on that later in the year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed.","Pete Skibitski","I was just hoping to get a little more clarity on Patriot, on a couple of items. The recent greater than $1.5 billion Patriot sale. Was that a new customer with just modernization program or brand new fire units? And I was wondering if you could maybe at least give the regional location of the customer. And then separate from that, Tom, it sounds like there is maybe an additional customer in Europe that's new beyond Poland or maybe in Sweden. I was wondering if you could maybe give us sense of the size and timing there.","Tom Kennedy","So the bottom line is on this $1.5 billion Patriot order we received in the first week of January of this year that was an existing customers acquiring more fire units. And so we are seeing, again this is the across Europe and across MENA region and across Asia Pacific region, it\u2019s a significant demand for the capability of the Patriot system from new customers, as we mentioned and then also from existing, who already have fire units. And so the bottom line is the system is performing and these nations are recognizing that. And there is a demand signal and demand signal is based on these the concern of these countries in protecting their sovereignty. And this fits into the bucket of Deterrence that I talked about. In terms of the next country, in Europe, I'm afraid I can't disclose it, except to say that it's in Europe.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities.","SamPearlstein ","I guess, just a couple of questions if I can put them all together. But missile systems, I know you\u2019ve talked productivity improvements and things of that where it came earlier in the year. But just overall, the year ended below what you originally planned. So I guess, I was wondering if you could just talk about what might have come in, whether that\u2019s the mix, whether it\u2019s performance, anything of that sort. And then separately, what changed from October when you talked about 3% to 5% growth, it\u2019s now 4% to 6%. What got better?","Toby O'Brien","Relative to missiles and the end to the year, the lower margin is really primarily due to two things; little lower program improvements than we were expecting; and a change in program mix as well. So it was combination of those two things. We don\u2019t look at the lower productivities as any trend or anything, just the timing related to the recognition of the improvements. And as we talked about, we see their margins improving in 2018.","As far as the overall top line growth going up to the 4% to 6%, really two things. As we talked about, it\u2019s our normal process. We work it up through the end of the year. But we also exceeded our expectations in 2017 on the high end relative to bookings, and combine that with we\u2019re off to a quick start with the $1.5 billion Patriot order that Tom just talked about. They were really the two big drivers that led to the increase.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please proceed.","Robert Stallard","I am looking at slide 12 in the pack, Tony or Tom. If you achieve the top end of your operating cash guidance for 2018, this would imply that you\u2019re not going to have any cash flow growth in 2019 and 2020. I was wondering if you could maybe explain that situation given the strength of the bookings and the revenue outlook. And whether there is any weirdness in terms of cash consumption or advances or things like that? Thank you.","Toby O'Brien","So there is obviously a bunch of things that affect cash flow, including the revenue growth and the flow through on the profitability. But keep in mind, including what drove some of the strong performance in 2017 compared to our expectations we do from time-to-time get some significant advances. We were favorably impacted in \u201817. So you have the program activity that plays into it. But the other thing I would mention, taking a look, especially 2018 versus 2019 that in 2018, the 2018 cash is the tax benefit of the 2017 discretionary contribution that we made, that we\u2019ve talked about. And if you were to exclude that benefit in \u201818, we\u2019d expect 2019 cash to be more in line to maybe slightly up with \u201818. So that\u2019s a big driver along with some of the timing of the program activity.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Gregory Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed.","George Shapiro","I\u2019ve been called a lot of things, but Gregory is not one of them.","Tom Kennedy","We certainly missed your name, sorry about that.","George Shapiro","One, Toby my usual one, but looking at it for the year, the bookings were 2.37 above the sales and the backlog is up $1.5 billion, so a sizable disconnect there you might spell out what caused the difference. And then the second one, Tom, this kind of just gets to another question on Forcepoint. But the reality is this business is disappointed from when you initially got it. So my question is at what point do you really worry that your strategy is not working out the way you think and then what actions do you take.","Toby O'Brien","George, I'll address the first one. And as we talk about in the past, we do have backlog adjustments, particularly as we under run cost side programs. And we did see a couple hundred million in Q4 and around $900 million for the year. I will say we do work with our customers in these cases to bring in new work, new scope, when we do under-run on current programs, which obviously result potentially in new bookings. And as you saw throughout the year, we did increase our guidance every quarter. So overall, we're pleased with our bookings performance and the resulting backlog. Again, our backlog grew 4% year-over-year and 2018 bookings outlook for the year of $27.5 billion to $28.5 billion set the stage real well for continued sales growth.","Tom Kennedy","George, let me hit your Forcepoint question. So back to what the goal, the goal was in establishing a commercial cyber security business as part of Raytheon. And the main reason for that was to unlock the value of our cyber security capabilities and provide them to the commercial marketplace. So we have done that. We have created several commercial products. They are being integrated into the Forcepoint set of product solutions and we are getting some significant demand for those products.","Those demands for those products are in the large enterprise and very large enterprise area. And that is why we are restructuring the sales force of Forcepoint from the SME sales force, which had heavy reliance on VARs, value added resellers, to more of an internal sales force and structure. So I think we are on plan. Relative to where we want to go in the big scheme of things, I agree with you. We're disappointed. We're not getting there as fast, but we are seeing the signs that show that the strategy can work, will work.","One point I would like to make and we haven\u2019t really made that a lot about Forcepoint is the synergy for Forcepoint with the rest of our cyber security pursuits. We had a significant book-to-bill ratio in the cyber security area this past year 1.4 book-to-bill. And one of the main reasons for this is the customers are recognizing that we have the entire, from the beginning all the way to the end relative to cyber, essentially we cover and this is one of our themes that we cover all sides of cyber, all sides of cyber security, all the way from supporting governments, all the way from supporting industrials, and now even into the commercial marketplace. And this gives us significant credentials.","When I go, for example, to the Middle East and I meet with the heads of state there, one of the questions they have about cyber is; how do we have all these capabilities; how do we have the ability to support governments; how do we have the ability to support the industry verticals. And the reason is because we have all these, these capabilities within the company, including commercial capability. So it does help us in our overall sales force of cyber all around.","You are right. It's going slower than we expected. There're some things that we learned along the way. And one of the big areas is that lot of the products that we can leverage into Forcepoint are really fit in the domain of the large enterprises, and the top 500 companies in the world. And that's the companies that we're focusing on, but we do need to build the sales force to be able to continue to grow our capability with them.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.","Peter Arment","Tom, just a bigger picture question on missile systems, I mean it continues to be a great story with all the growth. I mean, when you look at all the franchises there, I mean how are we viewing in terms of the long-term growth? I mean, you look at a lot of these franchises. Do you expect it to level off that when we've had this big step up the last few years, or just maybe give us some color on that? Thanks.","Tom Kennedy","We\u2019re very excited about the missile company and its future. And you are right, we do have quite a bit of franchises. So I think one of the things that we've done is we haven't just let those franchises stay idle, we've continued to make significant investments in those franchises over the year. So they are relevant, relevant relative to the mission, relevant relative to the technology that is incorporated in those franchises. But we are not just standing still on those franchises. We're pursuing next generation systems.","And also, next generation systems that may actually make some of those franchises -- put those franchises out of business, likes for example in the area of hypersonics. We won some significant programs in hypersonics. We're seeing an uptick and demand signals for hypersonics, back in line with our area of calling the been able to address peer threats, also we saw that in the new and national defense strategy out of secretary Mattis relative to addressing those threats. And so we\u2019re going to see increased demand in the area of hypersonics. So whole new growth area for the missile company that wasn\u2019t there before.","In addition to the existing franchise demands, we just talked a little bit about and was brought up on the on one of the questions relative to navel strike missile. This is a program that replaces the Harpoon system. The last run of Harpoon was called the Harpoon 2. It was over 7,000 harpoons built, and it's a global weapon. So that has international lag, so this will be a brand new franchise out of the gate potential $8 billion opportunity over 10 year period, and it has international legs. So a brand new one entering and it's -- and the way we've developed this system in partnership with Kongsberg. This system is not going to go through a 10 year development cycle, it already exists and it's ready to enter production almost immediately upon award of the contract.","So lot of great news for the missile company and we\u2019re very excited about it. The demand signals are there. We happen to have the technologies. We made the right investments at the right place. And always see as upside potential moving forward.","Todd Ernst ","Okay, we\u2019ll have to leave it there. Thank you for joining us this morning.

My name is Deanna, and I'll be the operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.","Todd B. Ernst","Thank you, Deanna. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our fourth quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides we'll reference are available on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.","With me today are Bill Swanson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Wajsgras, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks with Bill -- by Bill and Dave, and then move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.","William H. Swanson","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon delivered solid operating results in 2011. Looking back at the year, I see a company that capitalized on global market opportunities and also successfully managed the challenges of an evolving economic environment. Our margins, earnings and cash flow were all better than expected, and bookings and backlog were strong. ","In this environment, we focused on the things we could control and what we do best. We executed our strategy. We continued to implement efficiencies across the businesses, lowering our cost. We provided more affordable, innovative solutions to our customers. And this, ultimately, allowed us to deliver solid returns for our shareholders. ","A bright spot and a key driver of our bookings strength was the international business, which represented 29% of the total company's bookings for the year. A couple of highlights included 2 large awards in the fourth quarter. The United Arab Emirates ordered 2 TPY-2 radars, which are the world's most advanced forward-looking mobile radars, and a key-sensing component of the THAAD missile defense system. This represents the first international sale for this product. The other highlight was Taiwan's order for additional 3 Patriot fire units. ","I mentioned some of the larger ones, but there are also hundreds of smaller bookings across a number of product lines and the 81 countries where we do business. This drove the international backlog to 37% of our total backlog and demonstrates the alignment of our advanced technologies with the evolving needs of our global customers. It also points to continued success of our international strategy.","On the domestic front, we started off the year under a continuing resolution. And even after the budget was signed in mid-April, the funding was slow to start up. Coupled with this, we finished the year again under a CR through December 22. With all this in mind, we're encouraged by the fact that Congress avoided another extended continuing resolution and moved forward on the fiscal year '12 defense budget. The outcome contained few, if any, surprises. I'm proud of Raytheon's team's performance and our ability to deliver in this environment. We expect the fiscal '13 budget shortly. We expect some changes. In this environment, we're focused on the right areas and have a strong portfolio in electronic warfare, ISR, cyber and missile defense, which are priority areas for our domestic and international customers. ","Regardless of any external uncertainty, the Raytheon team will remain focused on what we do best: delivering innovative products while reducing our cost and operating with improved speed and agility. We remain committed to delivering the best value for our customers and our shareholders. Our company remains strong, and we're well positioned for the future, with a proven strategy and solid financial foundation.","I'd like to take a minute to highlight a couple of the achievements of last year. In recognition for our development of top leaders, Raytheon was named the FORTUNE's 2011 North America Top Companies for Leaders list for the second consecutive year. Further, we finished 2011 with the best environmental health and safety performance in the company's history. Our safety performance is world class and industry leading, and our sustainability program continues to be recognized. ","Before concluding, you've heard me talk in the past about our company-wide integrated enterprise platform and common processes and systems that span all our major functions: finance, supply chain, contracts, human resources, as well as manufacturing and engineering. This has been a multiyear strategy, with over 85% of our business transactions, supply spend and manufacturing volume now supported by our integrated enterprise platforms. ","We also achieved key milestones for our engineering common Product Data Management, PDM, and our Manufacturing Requirements Planning, MRP, systems. PDM, for example, is being deployed across the company to enable us to manage, share and use product data more effectively. Having these platforms helped drive our cost-efficiency efforts, the results of which are reflected in our performance. ","I want to thank the Raytheon team for their hard work, dedication and focus on customer success that makes our solid results possible for the ongoing commitment to our customers, our company and our shareholders.","With that, let me turn it over to Dave","David C. Wajsgras","Okay, thanks, Bill. Good morning, everyone. I have a few opening remarks, starting with fourth quarter and full year results, then I'll discuss our outlook for 2012. And after that, Bill and I will open up the call for questions. So during my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on our website. ","Okay, if everyone could please move to Page 3. Strong operational performance, including cost-reduction efforts across the company, drove our margin, EPS and operating cash flow results during the quarter. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $1.74 was up 12%, and for the full year was $5.90, up 7%, primarily the result of operational improvements and capital deployment actions.","We also generated strong operating cash flow of $1.3 billion for the quarter and $2.2 billion for the year after making a fourth quarter $750 million discretionary contribution to our pension plans.  Additionally, during the fourth quarter, the company repurchased 7 million shares of common stock for $313 million, bringing the full year 2011 repurchases to 27.1 million shares for about $1.3 billion. As we've previously disclosed, in the fourth quarter 2011, the company issued $1 billion in long-term debt. The company ended the year with a strong balance sheet and net debt of just over $600 million.  I'll talk to our strong bookings, particularly in the fourth quarter in just a moment.","And finally, during the quarter, we announced that we had acquired 2 companies, Pikewerks Corporation and Henggeler Computer Consultants, further extending our capability to serve the cybersecurity, enterprise architecture and systems engineering needs of our customers in the intelligence community, as well as in the Department of Defense. Both companies have become part of our Intelligence and Information Systems business.  These acquisitions are on top of the 2 we completed earlier in the year, Applied Signal Technology, which is now part of our Space and Airborne Systems business, and Ktech, which is now part of our Missiles business. All are performing well.","Turning now to Page 4. Let me take you through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. We had strong bookings of $7.1 billion in the quarter and $26.6 billion for the full year, resulting in a backlog of $35.3 billion and a book to bill of 1.11 in the quarter and 1.07 for the year. 33% of our bookings during the quarter and 29% of our total bookings for the year were from international customers.  And also of note, 3 of our businesses, Integrated Defense Systems, Space and Airborne Systems and Technical Services each had record bookings for the full year of 2011.","Notable bookings in the fourth quarter included just over $1 billion at IDS for TPY-2 radar contracts for the UAE Missile Defense Agency and U.S. Army, $560 million to provide advanced air and missile defense capability for Taiwan, $243 million on the Zumwalt-class destroyer program for the U.S. Navy and $177 million to provide consolidated logistic support for the MDA. ","Missile Systems booked $383 million for the development of Standard Missile-3 for the Missile Defense Agency, $131 million for the production of Paveway for international customers and $128 million for the production of evolved Seasparrow missiles for the U.S. Navy and international customers. SAS booked $212 million for the production of AESA radars for the U.S. Navy. And IIS and SAS booked $433 million and $177 million respectively on a number of classified programs. Backlog for the year increased a little better than $750 million over year end 2012.","Turning now to Page 5. Fourth quarter sales came in at $6.4 billion. Comparing to our guidance, sales came in slightly below the low end, primarily due to the company's ongoing cost-reduction efforts. When comparing the prior year, it's important to note that there were 5 fewer workdays in the 2011 fourth quarter. Our average 2011 sales per workday was approximately $100 million.","Looking at the businesses, Integrated Defense Systems net sales were $1.3 billion in the quarter. The change was primarily due to lower sales on Zumwalt and on an international Patriot program. As many of you are aware, during the quarter, IDS received U.S. Congressional and State Department approvals on a $1.7 billion direct commercial contract to upgrade the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Patriot Systems to the latest Configuration-3.  ","Intelligence and Information Systems net sales were $753 million in the quarter, driven by lower sales on domestic programs which were impacted by the continuing resolution.  Missile Systems net sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter. The change was driven by the Rolling Airframe Missile and SM-2 programs.","At Network Centric Systems, net sales were $1.1 billion in the quarter. The change in net sales was primarily due to U.S. Army programs, which are nearing completion. Space and Airborne Systems had net sales of $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 3%, driven by sales related to Raytheon Applied Signal Technology. ","Technical Services had fourth quarter 2011 net sales of $886 million. The change was primarily due to the lower sales on programs nearing completion, including a DTRA program and a TSA program.","If you'd move ahead to Page 6. We delivered strong operational performance and executed well on our cost-reduction initiatives, both in the quarter and for the full year. Our adjusted operating margin was up 220 basis points in Q4 and up 70 basis points for the full year.  Each business had solid performance, with year-over-year margin expansion. There were a couple of items that I do want to point out that did have a positive impact on 2 of our businesses. At IIS, we had a $9 million recovery of an insurance claim; and at Missiles, we had a $21 million favorable contractual resolution. When you compare our fourth quarter margins to our prior guidance, all of our businesses performed better than the high end of the range that we had provided in October. We clearly saw meaningful improvements from our productivity efforts.","As I've been saying all year, we're focused on cost control and productivity improvements, which will ultimately benefit our shareholders and our customers. Just to put some color on this, our efforts on efficiency improvements cover the full spectrum of our cost structure. We are continuing to drive savings across the supply chain. We are streamlining our factory operations, improving our direct to indirect ratio and driving down overhead costs. The positive swing in margins reflects these efforts.","Now let me just briefly describe our supply chain initiatives. The objective is to deliver cost savings, improve efficiencies and quality, while building stronger, longer-lasting strategic relationships with our supplier partners. By way of example, our centralized strategic sourcing effort allows us to identify key suppliers with the right capabilities and capacity that meet our requirements. As a result, we've taken our supply base from approximately 30,000 several years ago to about 12,000 today, even as we increased our total spend on supply chain, in line with the company's growth. ","We are seeing real value and cost efficiencies. We're leveraging our resources more effectively, with a smaller, more strategic group of suppliers that drive the quality and product affordability that our customers expect from Raytheon. In large part, we're in a position to effectively implement these types of enterprise-wide productivity programs as a result of the strategic investments in our Information Technology area. As Bill just mentioned, we're in the final stages of a company-wide MRP platform implementation, allowing us to improve visibility into our supply chain across the company and better respond to market conditions and customer requirements. ","Additionally, we're moving forward with an enterprise-wide product data management system which will allow us to seamlessly collaborate on product design across the company with our suppliers, while integrating with our MRP system for realtime resource planning. These are significant, competitive discriminators and will become increasingly important going forward.","If you'd move to Pages 7 and 8. You'll see both the fourth quarter and full year adjusted earnings per share. In the fourth quarter 2011, our adjusted EPS was $1.74, up 12%, and for the full year was $5.90 versus $5.51 in 2010, an increase of 7%. The increase for both periods was driven by operational improvements and capital deployment actions, specifically share repurchases.","The company generated stronger-than-expected operating cash flow of $2.2 billion in 2011 after the discretionary $750 million cash contribution to our pension plans. This was the result of our continued focus on working capital management and customer advances.","Turning now to Page 9. In the first quarter of 2012, we sold the remaining operating assets of RAAS, Raytheon's residual turbo-prop commuter aircraft portfolio, at a slight gain. And all its operations have ceased. And there are no contingent obligations. The results from RAAS are required to be reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods, including our -- including prior periods, beginning in the first quarter of 2012. We provided historical data for this reclassification in the attachments that accompany the press release to help you better understand the impact to our historical results.  This completes the sale and closeout process of our 515-plane portfolio that we began a number of years ago.","Moving on to our 2012 guidance. We see sales in the range of between $24.5 billion and $25 billion. As for pension, we now see that FAS\/CAS Adjustment at $284 million, which is more favorable than we assumed on the third quarter earnings call, primarily due to the $750 million discretionary cash contribution we made in the fourth quarter. ","In addition to the discretionary contribution, our 2012 FAS\/CAS Adjustment was also impacted by the discount rate environment and our asset returns in 2011, which were slightly negative for the year. Our end-of-year discount rate was 5%.","We expect net interest expense to be between $190 million and $200 million, which is higher than 2011 due to the new debt that we issued in the fourth quarter. We see our average diluted shares outstanding to be between $334 million and $340 million on a full year basis. As for our effective tax rate, we see this coming in at approximately 32%.","In 2011, our effective tax rate was 29.5%. If you adjust for the 2011 third quarter tax-related benefit and the R&D credit, 2011 would've been approximately 32.5%. Also, and just to be clear, in the past, we've included the R&D tax credit in our guidance. However, for planning purposes, we've not included the possible extension of the R&D tax credit in our 2012 guidance. If the legislation passes, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 100 basis points and is worth about $0.07 in EPS.","In 2012, we expect EPS to be in the range of $4.90 to $5.05. We see our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.45 to $5.60. Our operating cash flow guidance is expected to be between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion which is down slightly from 2011. ","However, it's important to note that we received the cash advance at the end of 2011, which is expected to liquidate as we move through 2012. And we also made a sizable discretionary pension contribution in 2011, which is not anticipated for 2012. When you normalize for these items, cash flow decreases slightly, driven by higher cash taxes, as well as the strong performance we saw in Q4 2011.  And finally, we expect our return on invested capital to be between 12.3% and 12.8%. ","Continuing on to Page 10. I'll briefly comment on our outlook. From a sales perspective, we see our International business offsetting the softness in our domestic business. We expect 2012 margins to continue to be solid but will be impacted by a change in program mix, contract completions and a workdown of more mature products in our domestic backlog. And again, our improved cost structure gets repriced into our new contracts as they get awarded throughout the year.","If you'd now turn to Page 11. We provided you with our 2012 outlook by quarter. You'll notice the improvement in sales cadence as we go through the year, which reflects program timing in the current environment. It's also important to note that there is a slower ramp of our longer-duration international business, specifically associated with some of the larger bookings we received at the end of 2011.  We expect bookings to be back-half-loaded, similar to last year.","Finally, on Page 12, as many of you have requested, we've provided a summary of the financial impact from our pensions in 2011, as well as our assumptions for 2012 through 2014. We believe this will help you better understand our company over the next few years.  I do want to point out that holding all assumptions equal, 2011 represents the inflection point with the FAS\/CAS Adjustment continuing to improve in 2012, ultimately turning positive in 2014. ","With respect to CAS harmonization, the rule was published late in 2011 and primarily increases the CAS reimbursement in 2014 and beyond.  For this outlook, we've held the 5% discount rate constant over the forecast period, notwithstanding possible increases in the interest rate environment.","So let me conclude by saying that in 2011, Raytheon delivered strong operating performance with margins, earnings and operating cash flow all ahead of expectations despite the challenging economic environment. Book to bill was strong and total backlog increased year-over-year. We will continue to expand our already substantial international business. Our balance sheet remains solid, with net debt of less than $1 billion. ","Given our strong financial position, our diverse portfolio of innovative and affordable technologies and our continued focus on driving efficiencies across the business, we remain confident in our future and in our ability to continue to deliver improved value for our customers and our shareholders. ","So with that, Bill and I will open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Heidi Wood, Morgan Stanley.","Heidi R. Wood - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions for you guys. Actually, just awash in paperwork here, so I'm trying to find the questions. First of all, on the international sales outlook, Bill. As we look forward, can you highlight us -- for us where the areas of opportunity are going forward? I mean, has the Asia-Pacific market sort of flattened out? Or do you see opportunities in Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi? Where is that coming in from? And also highlight for us what percentage of international sales will they be in 2012 versus '11.","William H. Swanson","Okay, let me start with 2012 first. We expect about 30% of our bookings to come internationally and about 26% of our sales. And we expect probably mid-single-digit increase in the environment. Clearly, for us, Asia and the Middle East are important and are still growing, and we don't see those being flat. And we actually -- given some of our products, they're all around the world. If you take our traffic control business and radars and systems, those have got markets everywhere. We've got C4I opportunities not only in Mideast, but other places in the world. And of course, in our missile business, those continue. Patriot, probably one of our biggest drivers. We've got Kuwait probably in the second half for 2 to 4 fire units. Turkey should be making a decision probably in the first half and an award in the second half. We've got activity in Oman for air defense. We've got Paveway around the world. Mentioned ATC. Training is growing for us internationally. We've sold some virtual simulation equipment, initial sales, and that looks like it's going to proceed to other parts of the world. And we see South America actually warming up as we go forward. If all that helps.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Troy Lahr, Stifel, Nicolaus.","Troy J. Lahr - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","You guys talked a lot about some of the restructuring efforts that you're going through. But how much of these are you actually able to hold on to? Are you giving back all these to the customer once you guys reprice this? And can you just maybe give me some clarity on that, because we're seeing margins kind of decline a little bit in 2012. So I'm just wondering, even longer term, how much do you guys are trying to keep?","William H. Swanson","Let me take part of it, and I'll turn it over to Dave. One, I would not use the term restructuring. For us, part of what we do every day is continue to take costs out of our business. We do that a number of ways. So Dave went through the Integrated Systems and what we're doing. What we basically try and do in this company is fundamentally lower our cost across the board in all businesses. And for us, we can say that, because all 6 businesses did very well in improving their margin performance. So we look for sustaining in that effort. For us, clearly, 56% of our contracts are fixed price and about 44% are cost plus. So you take that into account when you go forward. Some of those savings immediately go right to the customer, which is good for them, because they want us to do more with no more. And I think we're demonstrating that. And on the fixed price, some of those contracts have a long duration, so you keep it. Some have a short duration, where you bid year-over-year. And where it's year-over-year, we reflect those savings, and then we start again and go look for more savings as we go forward. So for me, having done this for a long time, you never run in place. You're always conditioning yourself to be able to run longer and faster, and that's what we're trying to do here. So with that, I'll turn it to Dave.","David C. Wajsgras","So I talked a little bit about this in the opening comments. Raytheon does have a competitive advantage in many areas. Here, specifically, we're addressing the strategic investments that we made in our Information Technology systems that began a number of years ago, and we're in the final phases now. I provided a little bit of color on the supply chain and what we're doing to improve our efficiencies there, along with our supplier partner base. Going forward, we see these type of initiatives continuing, because, again, based on the broad range of company-wide systems that we're able to leverage as we approach cost structure improvements. I agree with Bill. It's more of the way we do business, and I think characterizing it as a restructuring is not the right way to look at our cost and productivity initiatives. Going forward, I would suggest that this continues to be the case. It's something we've talked about for a while. If you are looking at '12, the biggest driver there is the mix of our business, primarily from an international perspective. We have some longer duration, large international programs that are beginning to ramp up and some other international programs that are in the final phases of production, and it's more of a typical cycle. But with that, we do see ourselves continuing to support the customer in their effort to reduce costs and improve affordability. And also, ultimately, it's in the benefit of our shareholders.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland, Barclays Capital.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a quick question and one sort of clarification on the cash flow. For Bill, I wondered if you might speak to the ministerial changes in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and what you see that meaning for the world's largest defense export market? And how we should be thinking about that transition, and if it means anything to you and even to some of your peers? I'd love some of your insights there. And secondly, for Dave, just a clarification on your cash flow comments. You said that in Q4, working capital and customer advances were a contributor to the strong performance. And then you called out cash taxes being a headwind in '12, but then you said that '12 cash flow will be down slightly after correcting for, I think, the advances, but not the cash taxes. I'm just trying to figure out, is working capital a reversal in '12 as well? Or is this just the advance reversal and cash taxes?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes, it's -- okay, so let me just answer the last question, and then I can clarify whatever you'd like. So as you go forward into '12, what I was trying to do is -- there's a lot of activity, right? We had discretionary pension funding as we move forward from '11 to '12. We had that $750 million pretax, $500 million aftertax. Then if you separate that out, there is a slight increase in the cash taxes year-over-year. The balance of this is we had strong cash performance in Q4, particularly toward the latter part of Q4, which obviously improved 2011. And that's going to be difficult to replicate as we go into 2012. The largest portion of the change between the working capital and the advances is the liquidation of the advances.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Okay, I think I got it.","William H. Swanson","Okay. Let me try and remember the question you gave me. First of all...","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","About KSA and ministerial change.","William H. Swanson","No, no, I remembered, I was just being a little facetious. For Raytheon, we've been there since 1965. So that's 47 years. I've been doing business there for about 32 years, so good portion of that time. We've seen a lot of change in the kingdom. The change has been positive. They have a very good succession planning process. It's laid out, and they've let us know where the changes are going to be. And so for a company that's been there for 47 years and has probably one of the best relationships, I'll be a little bit biased here, we feel very comfortable with what takes place there. And they count on us to do what we say we're going to do and to do a little bit better. And our plan is to continue to delight them. And they're a big customer of ours. And that's about the way I think of it. I look at it as very stable.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So no significant change in how we should think about contracting? And there's no -- there's really a seamless transition is what you're saying?","William H. Swanson","Yes, for us. I mean we've been there. What I tried to -- maybe I'd explain little bit. We've been there so long that we understand it, we feel part of the fabric. And we continue to get contracts there across the board, across all the ministries, whether it's Ministry of Interior, whether it's MODA, whether it's the SANG, the National Guard, we really enjoy our relationship. And I don't see any change in that going forward from a Raytheon perspective.","Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But it sort of implies it could be different for some of your peers.","William H. Swanson","Well, if you don't perform, it will be really different.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Dave, I wanted to just go back a little bit on the cash flow and see if you can maybe quantify some of this, is that if I look at your year-over-year cash from operations, it looks like it's down kind of $400 million to $500 million. You've showed in the slide that you're going to have about $700 million less in cash going into pension. And so I'm just trying to think about how much of that could really be the cash taxes. And then separately, can you just give us a CapEx number for '12 versus '11?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes, CapEx for '12, let me start off with that, including the software portion, is about in line with what we -- where we ended for '11. So there's no big swing item in that area. And if you look at kind of '11 to '12, because of the year-end performance, in combination with the advances, the way I would suggest, Sam, looking at our cash flow is really over a 2-year period. And I think if you normalize it, you'll see more of the normal pace and cadence from our company perspective. The change is between the advances. And the performance in Q4 is in the neighborhood, year-over-year, of $700 million, $800 million. But again, this is all due to the timing of what happens when. It could happen on the last day of one quarter versus the first day of another. So I think it's better, and analytically, if you're going to try to look at the company and understand the company to sort of average this over a 2-year period.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","But if I see -- if I just look at the advances line, it's up $500 million from the September quarter to the December. So that's what you're talking about in terms of the advances. And then I'm just trying to just get a quantification of cash taxes in '12 versus '11. How big of a shift is it?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes, the shift in cash taxes to '12 is about $100 million, $150 million. Now that's excluding the impact of the cash taxes from the discretionary pension contribution. If you take that into account, it's $350 million. So I'm trying to just walk that down. I was isolating the tax benefit associated with the discretionary pension contribution.","Operator","And the next question will come from the line of Robert Spingarn, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about the organic sales expectation by domestic and international, Bill? And then perhaps offer your bookings expectation for the year.","William H. Swanson","Yes, I think the way I look at this is I expect domestic to be down, probably down because of inflation, because we'd look at it being flat with inflation taking it down. And then on the macro part, we look at the international offsetting that to kind of keep us at, I'd say, level as we look through it. At the same time, if the international happened at a faster rate, then the international would really offset the domestic. And so, we're pushing hard on some big jobs internationally to see if we can begin to move to left a little bit, which would be better for the home team, as I look at it. And so that's where our real push is. And as Dave mentioned, we had some come in at the late part of the year a little later than we wanted. But the good news is they came in. And for us, internationally, we're not having losses. It's just a delay. So I feel really good about our international posture of where we're going. And then the other thing, domestically, we're seeing a good uptick in the classified. For us, total year, we had about 12% of our bookings and about 15% of our sales in classified. And next year, we expect bookings about 13% or 15% range. And we expect sales in the 14% or 15%. So we expect a high single- or low double-digit growth in the classified area. So that's a positive on the domestic side that we expect to see more of that, especially where we think the department is going in '12, '13, and '14.","Robert Spingarn - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Bill, can we put some more specific numbers to those though? Would we have like -- what would your book-to-bill expectation be across the company for the year? And then on the organic growth decline domestically, what does that look like, given that you've got sort of flattish sales with the acquisitions and the international growing?","David C. Wajsgras","Let me kind of set up a little perspective, and I'll answer your question very directly. So you start out with a bookings cadence in 2011. Bookings in the first half of the year were about $12.5 billion. The balance of a little bit better than $14 billion was in the back half of the year. It's following the same sort of pace and cadence as we go into '12, just say, roughly speaking, 40%, 45% in the first half. The balance in the back half of the year. That's kind of from a company-level viewpoint. So you take this down, what does it translate into. For -- from a domestic sales standpoint, full year basis, we see ourselves being down in the low single digits, say 2%, 3%-ish. From an international standpoint, mid to high single digits, and then you kind of run through the math. And that takes you to about flat on the year, maybe plus 1% to down 1%. And if you want a book end, the book-to-bill ratio today, again, it's early in the year, but you could be anywhere in the say, slightly under 1 to maybe upwards of 1.04, 1.05, right in that neighborhood.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Strauss, UBS.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Bill, how are you thinking about the potential for the sequester? And how do you plan for that, given that it's unlikely anything's going to be resolved until post the presidential election?","William H. Swanson","Well, what we do here is since Modeling and Sim is a good part of our business, we look at both the upside and the downside and what it means. And the other thing that we look at, I mean, the key things are the versatility of our portfolio. I've always been trained when one door closes, another door opens. Here, the way we talk about it in our company is trying to figure out the second and third order effects of every decision. So for us, what we look at is we still have to figure out how to train, fight and equip, and we have to do it in this new environment. And given that we've got 8,000 programs and 15,000 contracts, we go through a pretty good analysis of figuring out, okay, this is what the normal budget would be, and if we did go to sequestration, what would they do and how would we handle it? Where do we offset it? Clearly, for us, if I think about what the SecDef says, he still wants to have the strongest military in the world. He believes the forces will be smaller but still significant. He wants them agile, flexible, rapid, et cetera. He wants to focus on the balance of global posture, which is really the Pacific region, MENA, and he wants to work on partnerships. So if I think through that part, our international strategy really ties in nice. We also tie into the front part, and he wants to be able to confront multiple aggressors and wants to continue to invest in defense technology. And so, when I think of all the things that he wants to do in the current environment and what sequester would do to them, we'd look at it and make sure that we see the telltale signs of it as things happen, and that as a company, we have plans in place to be able to handle that. And so from our standpoint, we know what to do, if the worst happens. Spending my time on The Hill, we're not hearing about the worst happening. They're trying to figure out ways around this, but we'll see what will happen. But in any case, plus, middle or down, I can assure you the company has plans in place to be able to handle that.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, but just to be clear in terms of your forecast, as it stands say, revenue forecast, it doesn't incorporate any impact from the sequester coming -- actually coming through this year.","William H. Swanson","Right, because if you look at it, the fiscal year '12 and '13 budgets have the Budget Control Act built into them. The only thing that could change that is if somebody decides that they're really going to go through -- go in and throw the knife and make it happen. Then I think we'll start to see that in '14 and '15. But there could be some cancellations in '13.","David E. Strauss - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. As a follow-up, can you just give us an idea on DDG 1000, where that stands now in terms of a revenue run rate? How much does it come off? And what's the outlook for it over the next year or 2?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. So right. If you go back to '10, the program from a Raytheon standpoint drove about $800 million in sales. You roll the reel forward. The program was retimed out a few more years than we originally had anticipated. And in 2011, we had about $450 million in sales from that program. And that'll come down to about $300 million in '12 and then start to rebound about $100 million a year after that. In other words, it'll be up to about $400 million in '13.","William H. Swanson","And I would add something to what Dave said, as there's going to be a pretty good debate going on now between what Zumwalt can do and what the 51 can do. There's a GAL report out that is asking for a pretty good analysis to be done, because some of the decisions that were made back when really didn't have all the information to what the Zumwalt can do. So we're looking forward to seeing that first ship go in the water with its capabilities. And we think it's going to be eye-watering when people see what this new hull can do and the electronics in the ship. And if you look at it, manning, you go from 450 people down to 150, if I remember my numbers right. So it should be some exciting times for Zumwalt coming up here.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky, Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was wondering if you could, on a more book-peaking-type question, update us on the percentage of overall company sales that you might get from your largest contract at this point, and maybe from your top 10 contracts?","William H. Swanson","Yes. Let me talk a little bit about composition and diversification as -- since the numbers are very important to us. Only 36 of our contracts had sales greater than $100 million last year. Only one contract had sales greater than $500 million. Only 31 contracts made up 25% of our sales. The next 25% were 132 contracts. The remaining 50% is driven by 15,000 contracts. So I'll give you an idea of the diversification of our portfolio and how we look at the company. And one of the reasons why I feel sorry for all of you, because it's really hard to model us, when you look at it, when you have that many contracts in the mix. But the good part about it is that it really speaks to the strength of the portfolio of smaller forces, how do you be significant, agile, flexible and rapid. And we can do that. And then it's -- you give me an opportunity to do a little bit of my thing. I like to talk about tech wins that no one ever reads about. And some of the wins we're having are phenomenal, where we have strategic social interaction, where we really look at helping the military understand how you engage with others, with cultural differences, just to give you an idea of the versatility of what we get into. We have another program called Sirius, which is a learning environment of how do you mitigate cognitive base -- biases. So when analysts look at things, you have built-in biases, and we're working with gamers and others to help analysts understand how you get those biases out when you look at data or information. And then we have our high-frequency Surface Wave Radar systems, where we can do coastal defense and with unbelievable area coverage far enough out. I mentioned our virtual simulation. We had an international award there, but now countries are realizing they can do training in a different way, especially when you realize the youth is very comfortable with virtual worlds. And then we have work we do for the Automated Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast capability, ADSB, which is the air traffic control work that we're doing there. And then we've got railgun pulse forming networks. We kind of see those in the movies, so Transformers and stuff. But that's the stuff this company's involved in. So broad based portfolio, lots of tech wins going on that help us here in the future. If that helps.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just one quick follow up. If we look at margins out of the next several years, Dave, I think you mentioned that international, as far as the revenue rate, they're kind of picking up into the back half of the year, I'm guessing that moves into 2013 as well. Can you confirm or just give us some color as to what margin rates do when international becomes a greater mix of your overall business to be able to stay at current levels or actually move higher as that mix moves more towards international.","David C. Wajsgras","Well -- so we performed well in '11. Understand that's in the rearview mirror. That was the result primarily of controlling and managing our cost structure. And we'll continue to do that as we move forward. As we shift more toward international, we do see that benefiting the company from a return standpoint. So I would suggest that we will continue to focus the group on return on sales and managing the cost structure and capitalizing and leveraging on our international business. One of the things that you have to keep in mind is -- and we've said this in the past, the numbers that you see are the company average. So there's a lot of programs that are to the left of that average and some programs to the right of that average. And internally, we continue to focus on programs that are to the left of center and continue to try to drive the company toward improving overall returns for the company as we move ahead. Hope that helps.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr, Cowen and Company.","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I follow the company for over 25 years. Nice to see you break out single-line item total Patriot orders. I always thought it was like 25 programs. Nice to admit that it's really one major area. So anyway, so you had $3.1 billion of orders, and it looks like your book to bill was well over 1. And you indicated that DDG is coming down this year. But we've gone 2 years with book to bill at IDS kind of over 1.1. The rebound of DDG next year, I mean, in 2013 -- I mean, and the growing backlog on Patriot. I mean, is there any way we're not going to have a good sales gain at IDS in 2013?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, it's -- I like your analysis. We're not talking about 2013, but I would suggest that if you stand back and look at the performance of IDS and the large awards and the duration of some of these contracts as they start to ramp up, I think we'll see a good, solid year for IDS in '13 on top of a strong year in 2012 .","Cai Von Rumohr - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","But then you projected that margins are going to be down, and yet you have this big incremental backlog add from the Patriot. And the Saudi work is your second Config-3 customer. So shouldn't the profitability be at least as good, if not improving?","David C. Wajsgras","There's a lot of moving parts, and you have to, firstly, keep in mind that the margin, by and large, as we look again in the rearview mirror, was driven by the productivity actions, and those at some point in time, either realtime or in a fairly short period of time, get repriced in the contracts. So that's part one. Part two is the larger programs that were recently awarded in IDS and some of the ones that we anticipate being awarded this year are longer-duration, ramp-up programs. And as a result, given the initial risk in opportunity profile, we have to take all that into account with respect to our booking rates and how we see these programs from a return perspective. So in 2012, you're starting to see the ramp up of some new programs, and you're seeing the final phases of some longer-term production programs. As we move into '13 and '14, we'll continue to push on margins, not only at IDS but across the company.","Operator","And the next question will come from the line of George Shapiro, Access 3:42.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","Dave or Bill, I'm just wondering, you usually give how much international sales grew in the quarter and how much domestic came down, and what classified it. But unless I was sleeping on -- I didn't hear it this time.","William H. Swanson","Let me try to do some of them, and Dave can chime in here. I think I mentioned on the classified, they represented total year about 12% of our bookings and 15% of the sales. It was about the same thing in Q4, in that, and classified grew about 9% year-over-year. And we expect similar growth next year in the 8% to 10% range. On the international, for the total year, they were 29% of the bookings and about 25% of the sales. And for the quarter, it was about 33% of the bookings and 25% of the sales. And that was about a 7% increase year-over-year. In '12, I think I mentioned bookings should be about 30% sales around 26%, and we expect mid-single-digit increase.","David C. Wajsgras","So George, one of the things -- and I'll provide a little more color. One of the things that's important to keep in mind is there were 5 fewer workdays overall on the quarter. So year-over-year, from a company standpoint, adjusting for those days, we would have been up about 2% from an overall standpoint. But when you just run the pure math, and you don't normalize for days, classified would've been down about 5%, but it's not a good comp, because you're comparing a little bit of apples and oranges. And I think that's maybe what you were looking for.","William H. Swanson","And the one thing I'd add that we didn't chat about that cyber continues to grow for us. We both have the white and the black world here, or classified, and unclassified, but the good news is the way we look at classified and the way we can, but we can't report on it. But clearly, for us, we saw double-digit increase last year in cyber, and for your all benefit, the RFPs are starting to see an uptick in this world. So we're feeling pretty good about where cyber's going. And to kind of put it in perspective, I think we got about 2,000 people -- professionals, working on the 1s and 0s side and an equal number working on making sure that our solutions are inside our products as we go. So that's why it makes it hard for us compared to anybody else. We do it in the product and services, plus we do it internally.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","So Dave, putting it all together, how much was domestic down on both adjusted and unadjusted basis?","David C. Wajsgras","In the fourth quarter, I can give you the unadjusted. It was down just a little under 7.5%. But again, George -- and this is important, so I'll reemphasize that those 5 days have a big swing in all of these numbers. And if you want to do it analytically, you can. I'll leave that to you, which is fine, but just on an arithmetic basis, it was down a little under 7.5%. Again, that's  not a good comp because of the 5 less workdays.","George D. Shapiro - Access 3:42, LLC","And then just one slightly different question. You're projecting NCS sales in '12 to be down to flat to down a little bit after declining by 9% in '11. Given the sharp declines we're seeing in the Army and the high focus of that business it -- in the Army, why won't that revenue number be down by more?","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. So NCS was historically aligned with Army requirements, as you just suggested. And priorities have shifted. So when we look at C4I, they have 1 or 2 meaningful international prospects in 2012, and we would expect them to ramp up during the year. It's also important to note that they have some real opportunity to expand in the Homeland Security area. So I guess the summary is they're ramping down in the second-gen EO Army business and shifting more towards international areas of C4I, Homeland Security and virtual or simulation training.","William H. Swanson","Plus, I'd add their Air Traffic Control Radar and Systems business is picking up, because international air traffic is growing. And for us, we see Homeland Security increasing. I think last year, we had sales around $760 million. If you go back a couple of years ago, that was about $532 million. And we expect Homeland Security to grow in the low single digits. And that's one of the strengths of NCS.","Todd B. Ernst","We're going to have to leave it there today. Thank you, all, for joining us.

My name is Glenn, and I'll be your event manager for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Todd B. Ernst","Thank you, Glenn. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our third quarter conference call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our website on raytheon.com.","Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of the website.","With me today are Tom Kennedy, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Wajsgras, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Tom and Dave, and then we'll move on to questions.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Tom?","Thomas A. Kennedy","Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. This morning, Raytheon reported solid quarter results, driven by strong operational performance across the company. Notably, our margins in the third quarter improved over last quarter due to solid program execution, and our book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.07 as a result of global customer demand for our diverse range of solutions.","Raytheon's broad and deep portfolio of advanced systems continues to be a key strength for the company. Overall, we performed well in the third quarter and continue to position the company for long-term growth.","In the quarter, domestic bookings were solid and drove a book-to-bill ratio of 1.15. Demand in the third quarter came from across our domestic portfolio, including significant bookings from the FAA and other civil customers in addition to core defense. I would note that this is the second consecutive quarter with domestic book-to-bill ratio above 1.","Turning now to the international market. The shifting geopolitical landscape and the evolving global threat environment are driving demand for our advanced solutions. And as we mentioned on the last call, Qatar signed an LOA for $2 billion Patriot integrated air and missile defense system with the U.S. government in early July. Since this is an FMS deal, the next step is for us to get a contract with the U.S. government. We are currently working through the process to finalize our agreement with the U.S. Army, and we expect to book an order before year-end.","Another international booking opportunity we see in the fourth quarter is also for Patriot System. This is a $2 billion opportunity for 6 fire units. As we mentioned on the last call, we expect to book this before year-end.","As we look beyond this year into 2015, we see continued demand for our core capabilities from our global customers, which highlights our alignment with our priorities. For example, there are a number of upcoming domestic opportunities in electronic warfare, including the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement program, which is an EW system for ships; and the radio frequency countermeasures program, which is a Jammer receiver to protect special operations aircraft. These pursuits, along with other opportunities, represent meaningful future electronic warfare growth potential for the company.","For cyber, we're winning new business and see significant opportunities developing in both our domestic and international markets. As we've discussed on prior calls, we expect a couple of large international Patriot decisions next year. These are for Poland's integrated air and missile defense system and South Korea's upgrade of their existing systems to Configuration-3 plus. These opportunities reflect ongoing global demand for our advanced integrated air and missile defense solutions.","Domestically, we are in a competition for the Missile Defense Agency's long-range discrimination radar, a large radar to be utilized for homeland missile defense, which we expect to be awarded in 2015. We are well positioned for this competition.","These are just a few of the many opportunities that we see developing in the year ahead. To position the company for long term, we continue to make investments in game-changing technologies. Today, Raytheon is a global leader in the effects market. By leveraging our world-class talent and focusing our IRAD efforts on developing the next generation of weapons systems, we are winning early technology programs now to remain at the forefront of this market in the future.","We see 2 key areas where our customers are seeking more sophisticated capabilities: directed energy and high-speed weapon systems. In directed energy, we received a contract award in the third quarter to develop a vehicle-based, high-energy laser weapon system for the U.S. Marines capable of defeating low-flying threats. The Raytheon-built, high-energy laser will be packaged to meet the customer's demand in size, weight and power requirements for the weapon system.","In high-speed weapons, the increasing importance of standoff strike capability and speed to target are driving customer interest and we are heavily engaged in this developing area. Raytheon has won a position on 3 key programs: hypersonic air-breathing weapon concept, the tactical boost glide and the conventional prompt strike. The first 2 are DARPA programs and the last one is for the U.S. Navy. While initial orders in both of these areas are relatively small, they are the seed corn for significant long-term prospects.","Our investments in technology have been yielding results. For example, after the close of the quarter, the U.S. Air Force awarded Raytheon a contract for engineering and manufacturing development of the Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar or 3DELRR, a new mobile radar that will detect, identify and track drones, missiles and aircraft. It's a versatile system that can be used for both ISR and missile defense missions. We believe 3DELRR has significant domestic and international sales potential over the next 2 decades. To win the competition, we leveraged many of the technology and manufacturing investments that we have made over the last 10 years. I should mention that this competitive award is currently under protest. But as we said before, that seems to be the new normal.","In today's environment, while having advanced technology as a key discriminator, providing it at an affordable cost is just as crucial. To that end, we continue to aggressively implement lean manufacturing initiatives, execute our strategic sourcing plan across our supply chain, optimize our global shared services and reduce our footprint. The bottom line is that we are focused on driving cost savings and affordability for our customers and returns for our shareholders. This also helps us drive competitive advantage.","In summary, I'm pleased with the overall results in the quarter. We are executing our strategy. We are delivering the performance and solutions our customers need. And we are building the foundation for long-term global growth.","I'd like to thank everyone on the Raytheon team for all of their efforts in the third quarter and as we work to finish out a strong year.","With that, let me turn it over to Dave.","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. Thanks, Tom. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the third quarter highlights, and then we'll move on to questions.","During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slide that we issued earlier this morning, so if everyone could turn to Page 3. We're pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the third quarter. Bookings were $5.9 billion and sales were $5.5 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.07. Operating margin was strong at 13.9%. EPS from continuing operations was $1.65 and was reduced by $0.06 per share to reflect the retroactive year-to-date impact of pension funding stabilization as part of the highway bill enacted in August and actuarial updates related to our pension plans. And just to be clear, the $0.06 per share is comprised of $0.11 per share due to lower CAS expense, partially offset by $0.03 per share for the favorable impact from the reduction of the effective tax rate and $0.02 per share for the actuarial updates that I just mentioned.","On an adjusted basis, operating margin was strong at 13.2%. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.57. We also generated solid operating cash flow, $423 million for the quarter. The highway bill lowered cash flow by about $50 million in the quarter and will impact full year by about $150 million.","During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock for $200 million, bringing the year-to-date share repurchased to 6.8 million shares for $650 million.","Turning now to Page 4. Our total company bookings for the quarter were $5.9 billion, an increase of about $200 million compared to the third quarter 2013. And on a year-to-date basis, bookings were $16.9 billion, an increase of approximately $2.3 billion over the same period last year. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.08.","For the quarter, international bookings were 24% of total new awards and on a year-to-date basis was 28%.","For the year, we continue to expect international to be in the range of 35% to 40% of total company bookings. As Tom just mentioned, we have significant international opportunities that we expect to book in the fourth quarter. We continue to see our full year 2014 bookings to be in the range of $23.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million. This would result in a book-to-bill ratio of between 1.0x and 1.05x.","Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $33.2 billion, up $1 billion compared to the same period last year and funded backlog was $22.9 billion, up approximately $700 million, again, compared to last year's third quarter.","Now on Slide 5. For the third quarter 2014, sales were $5.5 billion and year-to-date were $16.7 billion. International sales were approximately 30% of total sales in the quarter and were up just under 4% compared to last year's third quarter.","IDS had third quarter 2014 net sales of $1.4 billion. The change from Q3 2013 was driven by the completion of the production phases on a couple of international Patriot programs.","IIS net sales of $1.5 billion in the quarter were relatively consistent with the same quarter last year.","Missile systems had third quarter 2014 net sales of $1.5 billion. As expected, we saw lower sales from U.S. Army programs. Sales were also impacted by the planned transition from development to production on Standard Missile-3 in this year's third quarter.","And SAS had net sales of $1.5 billion. Lower volume on intersegment sales was the primary driver when compared to last year's Q3. Excluding the reduced intersegment sales, SAS's sales were in line with the third quarter 2013.","Now moving to Page 6. Overall, the company margins were strong and exceeded our guidance. Our reported operating margin was 13.9% and on an adjusted basis was 13.2%. On a year-to-date basis, our operating margin was 13.8% and 12.6% on an adjusted basis.","As most of you know, recent pressure on the Defense budget has been driving the Defense Department to look for innovative ways to deploy resources more effectively. One of these ways has been the rollout of DoD's better buying power initiatives. Along these lines, we continue to find ways to reduce the total price of our offerings, leverage exportability and strengthen competitiveness. We're making thoughtful investments in technology with the objective of lowering program development and production costs and positioning Raytheon to further expand internationally, while improving our global competitive posture. We're doing this while maintaining a focus on strong margins.","So looking at the business margins. All were up sequentially from the second quarter. Strong operating performance across our businesses, combined with our focus on execution productivity and efficiency, continues to be reflected in our financial results.","At missiles and SAS, margins were higher than the same period last year. Solid overall program performance drove improvement at both businesses. At SAS, we experienced strong material and labor efficiencies, particularly with tactical airborne systems production.","The change in IDS was primarily driven by a few international air and missile defense programs nearing completion. And at IIS, we saw higher net program efficiencies in last year's third quarter. Overall, the company is performing well.","Turning now to Page 7. Third quarter 2014 EPS was $1.65 and on an adjusted basis was $1.57. EPS for the third quarter 2014 was better than expected, primarily due to the improved tax rate and overall margin performance.","On Page 8, we are updating the company's financial outlook for 2014, which now includes the recent enactment of the highway bill. Based on our performance year-to-date, we've narrowed our sales range guidance, raising the low end by $200 million. We now expect our full year 2014 net sales to be in the range of between $22.7 billion and $23 billion. And we have -- and as we have done in prior years, during the third quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension plans. As a result of this update and the enactment of the highway bill, the FAS\/CAS adjustment for the year decreased by $59 million from $346 million to $287 million or $0.12 per share.","We repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock for $200 million in the quarter and have narrowed our diluted share count to be in the range of between 312 million and 313 million shares for 2014, which would be a 4% reduction at the midpoint compared with full year 2013. Now I'll address the updates to our EPS and changes to our tax outlook in just a minute.","As I mentioned earlier, operating cash flow in the quarter was solid and we expect it to remain strong in Q4. I do want to point out that our updated 2014 guidance for operating cash flow is slightly lower, reflecting the implementation of the highway bill, which is expected to have an approximate $150 million net cash impact. This is due to both the lower cash recovery and higher cash taxes, which together, more than offsets the lower required pension contributions. We now expect our 2014 guidance for operating cash flow to be between $2.15 billion and $2.35 billion.","Turning now to Page 9. We've provided you with a walk, showing the change to both our GAAP and adjusted EPS outlook for 2014. You'll note that we raised our full year 2014 adjusted EPS guidance on the high end by $0.10 due to the lower expected tax rate for the full year. And given our confidence level, we've narrowed the range. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be between $5.91 and $6.01 for 2014. As a reminder, we've not included in our 2014 guidance the potential extension of the R&D tax credit.","The change in GAAP EPS includes the $0.10 for the tax improvement and also includes the $0.12 reduction in the FAS\/CAS adjustment that I've mentioned a moment ago. We now expect full year 2014 EPS to be between $6.77 and $6.87.","Now if you'd move to Page 10. We've raised SAS margins to reflect the stronger year-to-date performance, narrowed the range for IIS and missiles and lowered IDS's margins to reflect business performance year-to-date. With that said, the fourth quarter for IDS is expected to be strong. For the company, we see adjusted operating margin to be in the range of between 12.7% and 12.8% for the full year.","Before moving on to Page 11, I wanted to make you aware that we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a privately held company in our core defense business for approximately $400 million. We expect the closing next month after completing normal regulatory reviews and approvals. Given that this acquisition is still under regulatory review and subject to a nondisclosure agreement, we're unable to comment further until it closes.","So if you could please move to Page 11. We have provided a FAS\/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2015, as we've done in prior years. It does include the estimated impact of the highway bill. And just to be clear, the discount rate and the actual asset returns won't be known until we close out 2014.","As you can see on Slide 12, we've provided an outlook for required funding and CAS recovery that include the impact of the highway bill compared to our prior outlook from last January. Required pension contributions are decreasing from both the prior outlook as well as sequentially from 2014.","CAS recovery still increases, although at a slower rate. This has a favorable impact on our pretax net cash flow over the forecast horizon. Again, markets are volatile and asset returns will change before year-end, which will affect these estimates. We'll provide a more detailed pension outlook on our January year-end call.","Before concluding, let me take just a moment to bring you up-to-date on e-Borders. As we announced on August 15, we received a decision from the arbitration tribunal in connection with the proceeding between Raytheon Systems Limited and the U.K. Home Office that the UK Border Agency unlawfully terminated RSL. As a result, we were awarded approximately $300 million. The Home Office has since filed a challenge to the decision. Payment of amounts awarded to Raytheon is now pending resolution of the challenge. As such, we have not included the impact in our third quarter results or in our full year guidance. Due to the ongoing legal matters, we cannot comment further at this time.","So in summary, we saw solid performance in the third quarter. We have strong bookings and strong margins. We expect to close out the year with a number of new awards that establishes a solid foundation for the future. Combined with our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we believe we're well positioned to continue to drive value for our customers and our shareholders.","With that, Tom and I will open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I would love to ask you more about your $400 million acquisition, but I know you said not to do that.","David C. Wajsgras","I know you would, Joe, but we just can't talk about it.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, I understand. But you said it was in your core defense area. I noted that one of your competitors made an acquisition in the last week or so, a $200 plus million acquisition in the commercial cyber area, which is something that you guys have expressed some interest in. And talking about BAE, just to be specific, Tom, I was wondering if you could update us on your thoughts on that area.","Thomas A. Kennedy","Yes. As we mentioned on past calls, our first priority is growing the company organically. And I did talk on just prior to this, relative to all the technology investments that we have made over the last 10 years and they're coming to fruition now in terms of the wins. We just -- I talked about 3DELRR and I mentioned it's in protest. But I think that was a big win for Raytheon and we'll work through the protest. But also in the last year, we also won Next Generation Jammer, Air and Missile Defense Radar and also FAB-T. So this focus on the organic growth is working. The other areas -- we are looking in taking a disciplined approach for acquisitions in our core markets. And one of our core markets is cyber. And so we are looking at that area. And we'll continue to look at acquisitions to fill gaps in our core markets as we proceed forward.","David C. Wajsgras","So Joe, we have talked about our focus on growth. Tom has made that a top priority for the company. We are firstly focused on organic, but growth through acquisitions where it makes strategic and economic sense will also be part of the equation. So this really shouldn't come as any surprise. We have a very healthy balance sheet, strong cash balances, continue to see strong cash flows. So this is just one of our -- one of the elements of capital deployment that we've talked about, certainly, over the past year, 1.5 years.","Thomas A. Kennedy","And Joe, just back to your question on cyber. We mentioned that on an earlier call, that we had gotten a major award from an international customer. So we have gone into the international marketplace relative to cyber, government cyber work. We also received an announcement here internally kept, but for another international customer this quarter. And so we are off and running relative to strong cyber work in the government arena on the international side as well as the domestic.","Joseph B. Nadol - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just one more, which is on the IDS side. You took down your margin expectation a little bit for the year and you mentioned it was just based on what you've done year-to-date. I was wondering if you could give a little more color. Is that based on -- largely on timing of the Patriot awards that you expect here soon that are coming a little later in the year than maybe you originally thought? Or is there something else there?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. So that's a fair question. IDS's fourth quarter margins are expected to be in the high 16% to low 17% range. So as I said a few minutes ago and Tom alluded to as well, it's a very strong quarter for IDS. For the full year, we've lowered the IDS margin range to between 15.7% and 15.8%. And as you just mentioned, it's primarily based on year-to-date performance. More specifically, within the fourth quarter, we see stronger margins than the year-to-date run rate, driven by some customer and program milestones related to risk retirement. Mix isn't a significant factor. I'll tell you this again, mix is not a significant factor in the fourth quarter, as we have some mature production programs nearing completion that are offset by the impact of the new starts. So again, we're seeing a strong fourth quarter, strong margins, good productivity. It's just slightly lower than what we had expected earlier.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just continuing on IDS. You talked about the fact that you're ramping down on some international missile defense-related contracts and you're going to be ramping up on others. And then in the meantime, you certainly have U.S. missile defense sales that often, I think, fill in gaps of there. But how should we expect the profile of these revenues to look? I mean, should we see a lull of new work starts? Or can this stay pretty constant through new programs?","Thomas A. Kennedy","Yes. I think IDS -- I mean, it actually had a very good quarter. And so we're definitely pleased with their performance and that they also had strong bookings sales and are looking forward into the fourth quarter and 2 large international bookings that will be coming in on the fourth quarter. So we -- bottom line is IDS is very strong. And we see the revenue maintaining through the fourth quarter and then into the next year. So I think bottom line is, we believe IDS is solid moving forward.","David C. Wajsgras","So let me just add a little bit to what Tom just mentioned. So third quarter sales were down from the prior year and slightly down, which is what Tom was alluding to, from our expectations. We had assumed that Qatar Patriot award at the end of the third quarter and it's moved into now the fourth quarter. We do see a quick ramp on the Qatar program in Q4 as well as the other international Patriot award that Tom again mentioned just a few minutes ago, which combined, drive the fourth quarter sales growth. We've been working with our supply chain to prepare for these awards. And you'll note that we did build some inventory over the last couple of quarters. We've built ahead and we've done this before, and we'll recognize the revenue upon award during the fourth quarter before year-end. So I hope that helps.","Douglas S. Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","No, that does help. And then related to this, when you look at some of the positive trends out there -- but this is probably terrible to refer to as positive. But you talked about the global threat environment and how this is something that Raytheon can -- is going to increase demand for Raytheon products potentially. Could you give a little more clarity on that? In other words, when you look at some of the situations in the world right now, such as in the Middle East, are these things that lead you to believe there may be more demand in the near term for -- within some of your business units?","Thomas A. Kennedy","Let me start in Eastern Europe. And I mentioned on my discussions upfront that we're in a major competition in Poland for an integrated air and missile defense system, and that's had a heightened sense of urgency in Poland relative to the activities going on in Eastern Europe, especially relative to Ukraine. So we do see that kind of coming, moving a little bit to the left into 2015. As we move over to the Middle East, I mean, it's -- you see this in the paper every day, ISIS is right now the big overarching threat and it's more of a tactical-type threat and more effects based. And it was released in the newspaper about a quantity of Tomahawks that were used in the initial days of our efforts there. So in the area of effects, we would see a need in the future to replenish the effects that were used. The -- as we also look at the Middle East, we do see a strong sense in having -- and this is based on my visits to a majority of the countries in the region here in the last 3 months. I think it kind of sums up in the following words, and I heard it in all these different countries from senior leaders of the countries, and that is a strong defense is a strong deterrence. And they were using that in light of integrated air and missile defense. And so you'll see that we completed a major effort in the UAE on Patriot upgrades. We are now into working with Lockheed on the THAAD system and other TPY-2 radars in that country. We move over to Saudi, we're working several projects in Saudi Arabia relative to improving their defense posture. You heard about the Qatar deal, which the first part of it is the Patriot. The second part of it is an early warning radar. And then there's also an air defense operating center that's in there. And then eventually, they'll buy THAAD, which has TPY-2 radars in it. So again, a strong position in Qatar moving forward. And bottom line is the -- we are well positioned in that region for growth relative to our core products. So I don't know if that helps, but it's -- our business is driven by the threat. There is a threat. And that's increasing -- it's increasing demand for our proven technologies and also new technologies, as we see in the awards that I mentioned earlier on the call.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Dave, I thought we'd kick it off on the cash front. It looks like you're having $1 billion of cash over the next couple of years. What do you intend to spend it on?","David C. Wajsgras","You picked right up on that, Rob, didn't you? Yes. So look, the company doesn't anticipate any wholesale changes to the way we've talked about capital deployment. We've had, I think, a policy that has served the shareholders well with respect to a balance around capital deployment, with respect to dividends and share repurchases. We've funded the pension plan, from our perspective, appropriately. We've invested in our sales. Tom mentioned a couple of technology investments we've made. We're going to continue to do that as we move forward. There is a cost obviously associated with consolidating footprint or improving utilization. So we'll continue to invest in ourselves from that perspective as well. I mentioned to one of your colleagues earlier, relative to acquisitions and smartly investing in acquisitions that make strategic sense and importantly, financial sense, both in the near and longer term. So the short version is we understand our cash position quite well, and we continue to look for ways to best drive both near-term and long-term shareholder value.","Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up. Your book-to-bill has been over 1x over the last 12 months and year-to-date. When do you expect this book-to-bill to actually translate into revenues?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. So we've talked about this in the past. We have, even as far back as last year, we had seen the back half of '16 and as we go into 2017, as the reversal of the trend that the sales line has been on over the last 3 or 4 years, we still anticipate that being the case. The bookings are coming in quite strong, both domestically and internationally. So over time, we see growth returning to Raytheon. And again, this is almost exactly what we had said about a year ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First, a question for you, Tom, and one for Dave. Can you just talk a little bit about the structural outlook for the margin...","Thomas A. Kennedy","Yes, could you repeat that?","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. Sorry about that. So first about outlook for margins and the fact that you are guiding to 35% to 40% of your bookings this year coming from the international marketplace. What does that portend for margins structurally as we move out over the next 3 to 5 years, let's say? Are we looking at a margin rate that should be -- the bias should be a little bit higher than where we are today?","Thomas A. Kennedy","I would say, right now, you hit it right. On international -- part of our international work in terms of percent of sales has been increasing. And right now, we're -- about 30% of our revenue comes from international. We also have a backlog to date of 37% international, which we believe will end the year greater than 40% of our backlog will be international. Traditionally, our international has been a higher margin business. Right now, we are looking conservatively to the future, even taking that in consideration. And we are looking at our margin performance continuing as it has been in the past. Margins are very important to us. We drive them in the business. We really look at trying to take to take as much cost out of the business. And we really work on the type of contracts that we go after and pursue to make sure that they will be profitable programs. And that's, I would say, a #1 priority for the Raytheon Company, and we will continue to support that position.","Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then -- that's helpful. Dave, for you, just going back to the prior question about cash flows and spending. Can you also just loop in your updated thoughts here on the balance sheet as well? I mean, obviously, you have a very strong balance sheet. How do you -- where do you sit relative to the optimal capital structure, your view on your debt rating with the agencies? And how should investors think about the cash flows that you're generating and the potential use of cash -- excuse me, the balance sheet to support all of these potential activities that you've got out there?","David C. Wajsgras","Sure. So a strong balance sheet is one of the issues that I don't see a problem dealing with, okay? We're pretty pleased that it's not the other end of the spectrum. So understanding that, we -- the rating -- the target rating for us would not go any lower than a BBB+ as we sit here today and look out. I know the rating is slightly above that, given the strength of the balance sheet and net debt position, the outlook for cash flows. Going forward, again, I'm not going to repeat everything I just mentioned a moment ago on capital deployment. From a leverage position, we think we're in a relatively good position today. Could we afford some more leverage on the balance sheet and maintain the rating? Yes, we could. So I think the way that investors should view Raytheon is we're in a strong position financially. We're not going to sacrifice the strong position financially. It gives us the ability to pull multiple levers to drive value from an investor's perspective without putting too much risk on the company, risk from a financial perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Godyn with Morgan Stanley.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Dave, to one of the prior questions, you made the comment that deals need to have an impact in the near and the long term. I was hoping that you could just sort of take the opportunity to remind us what you've either said in the past or maybe offer some new commentary on the broader framework for M&A. It doesn't seem like M&A will be going away necessarily anytime soon. When you typically think about a deal, how quickly do you hope that they're accretive? How do you think about return hurdles versus maybe the internal hurdles in the company? How do you think about synergies, risks, deal size? Any -- the broader philosophy here, I think, would be helpful.","David C. Wajsgras","Sure. So -- and I'll do this in a summary way. Any deal that we end up executing will have a return profile well in excess of the company's weighted average cost of capital, part one; part two, as we look to fill gaps from a product technology or channel standpoint, and that's what makes these acquisitions attractive; number three, is with respect to accretion, we would target for these deals to be accretive after about 2 years, but certainly not much after 3 years. The deals we've done to date have by and large turned out to be quite successful and have returned incremental value. I'm not going to get into the specifics, but we recently looked at this. Incremental value that is meaningful from a shareholder's standpoint. So I don't know, Tom, if you want to add anything from that perspective?","Thomas A. Kennedy","No. I would just like to address the gaps. As part of our strategic process we go through is we do identify the gaps and in being able to achieve the growth that we expect from our strategy. And as part of that gap, we look at either internal investments or look at acquisitions to fill those gaps in the most cost-effective manner and also relative to speed and agility. And so that's really how we look at it. And that's obviously addressing the synergies that we get by buying these companies.","David C. Wajsgras","And just one last point. With respect to size of acquisitions, I know you're aware of this. I think most people are. We have not been very active in the M&A market for the last couple of years, by design, for a number of reasons. With respect to the size of the acquisitions, it's probably not in investors' best interest or the company's best interest to handcuff ourselves to a certain amount. Certainly, I don't see a problem with doing deals larger than we've done in the past. But again, I think the most important thing is, when we look at acquisitions, we want to make sure that we can maintain the type of capital deployment plan, execute the type of capital deployment that we have in the past, and we don't want to sacrifice one for the other. So that's probably the best way to think about how we're thinking about size of acquisitions.","John D. Godyn - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, that's very helpful. And if I could ask one quickly on Patriot. Assuming the Cutter deal goes through, you'll have quite a lot of Patriot business hitting at the same time. And I'm curious if you can just speak to -- I know it's hard to put a number on it. I'm not necessarily looking for that. But what does that mean for margins? I mean, I imagine a scenario where you're layering shift on top of shift. I mean, it seems like it could be pretty impactful. Anything you can offer there would be helpful.","Thomas A. Kennedy","Well, the more you load up the factory, the better the financial performance of the programs are. And so bottom line is we'll have the Qatar program going through and another major program going through at the same time. So we do expect improved efficiencies on the production side, which then translate into good margin performance in the out years. Now we do traditionally at the beginning of the program, we start off at lower margins on a per basis on each of the programs as we build confidence and reduce risk moving through, for example, risk on our supply chain or other elements, whether we do increase the margins through the lifetime of the program. That's just the traditional way that we do it from -- to control risk. I don't know. Hopefully, that helps.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Dave, you had talked about investments you're making to lower cost and -- as one of the things with Better Buying. And I guess, I'm trying to just think about, is this something that in a way is driving down revenues because of cost-plus work? And is there any way you can quantify what the impact of that might be?","David C. Wajsgras","Well, let me start -- I'm sure Tom has something to add. We started talking about this a few years ago, and we spoke to it pretty directly early in the year on the January or first quarter call. I don't remember which one. We've been investing in technology through a number of different vehicles for a while. Tom mentioned a few new programs that we have with DARPA. It's important to understand that when we invest in technology programs -- I'll use Tom's words, these are seed corn for the future. So by definition, these are not high-fee or high-margin programs. They're well below the average company margins. So that's one form of investment. There's direct investments through our IRAD, and that runs roughly speaking $300 million to $400 million a year. There's investment from a program perspective. Tom spoke on one of the calls about the Patriot System and how an earlier international program essentially was set so that we could invest in new Patriot capabilities and technologies. And that's what's being basically sold across the globe today. So there's varying ways to think about investments. Tom, I don't know if you wanted to add something to that?","Thomas A. Kennedy","Yes. And getting the cost out is obviously driven to improve our financial performance. But also our customer has a need. And I'm sure you've heard about the Better Buying Power, that OSD's initiatives that they're running. We are working with our customers to drive additional cost out of our products. And part of that is, as you said, reducing our footprint. We're driving and optimizing our global shared services part of our business to get cost out. We also have fully implemented strategic sourcing across our entire business to essentially improve our cost perspective relative to our overall supply chain. And so it's -- we -- and it's been very successful as we move forward. Now working with our customer, we understand that there's -- they need more for less. And so it is important for us to make sure that we deliver products that meet their capability needs but at a cost that they can afford. And we've been doing that and you can see some of the wins we had. The FAB-T program is a prime example of their use of competition. And we believe that we're significantly in line with what our customer wants to do in terms of cost.","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then Dave, in terms of the pension slide on Page 11. Is there -- where would we be if the year ended right now in terms of that grid?","David C. Wajsgras","Okay. If the year ended today, the returns are roughly -- the actual returns are roughly about 3%. It's important, it has been -- the markets have been exceptionally volatile in the past, I don't know, 4, 6 weeks. There's been a selloff of about 8% -- 7% or 8% from a broader market perspective. Historically, the fourth quarter is the strongest quarter of the year. So it's very hard to handicap how this plays out. And -- but today, we would be at about 3%. If you're thinking about the discount rate, last year was pegged at 5.1. If you look at the past month, there's been a lot of movement in interest rate markets as well. I'm sure you're aware of that. We would be down, roughly speaking, 50 to 75 basis points, again, if you look at it from a month ago to roughly where we are today. The one thing I just -- I want to say this again, I probably said it 3 or 4 times. This is a point in time and I'm pretty confident when I tell you it's absolutely going to change by year-end, okay?","Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And one last quick one. It's just the Other, net of $234 million in the cash flow, what was that? What does that mean [ph]?","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. There was a settlement that we had relative to a long-dated pension litigation with the U.S. government. It goes back to -- prior to 2000 that was settled. That was a big piece of what's in there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was wondering if we could start on a clarification first. Was there any cume catch in the segments from the CAS adjustment. Northrop called one out and Lockheed didn't. I just didn't know if there's one for you guys.","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. No, I saw that, and we looked at it obviously. For us, I'll use my term, it was a bit of a rounding error. What we call the flow-through was under $10 million spread across 4 different segments. So it does impact all companies differently. It depends on overall percent of completion, your mix of fixed price versus cost-type business. There's a lot of elements that go into that. But for us, it was not meaningful.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. The real question was on sales target for the year. And given the sales kind of what you're shooting for in the quarter didn't come through, you did raise the low end of the guidance range. Even at that low end, I think it would be one of the more bountiful sequential growths you've had from a 3Q to 4Q. You talked about IDS, and that's dependent on securing contracts. And then missiles is the other big moving target. Is there something there you need to secure as well? And it just seems like you'd put a little bit more factoring behind a lot of this to maybe not have brought up that guidance range.","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. So good question. Let me just -- I talked about IDS earlier. So I won't go over that segment again. With respect to missiles, the most important metric from that business's perspective is the book-to-bill, which is 1.11 year-to-date. So we do see a fairly healthy ramp in Q4 on their year-to-date bookings, and that's why you're seeing very strong sales in Q4. So the combination -- and you nailed it, the combination of IDS and missile systems have a fairly meaningful impact from a company level perspective in the fourth quarter.","Myles A. Walton - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I mean, missiles was 1.6 in the second quarter. And obviously, it didn't lead to anything in the third quarter. So it's just it will come, you have it in hand and it's just delivering what you have.","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. That's why I wanted to go to the book-to-bill. That's right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","One of the things that you've been doing internationally has been partnering. Could you expand upon that a little bit? For example, in Poland, it looks like you have a low-cost missile. You want to integrate onto Patriot and then you've done some things with Kongsberg in Norway to expand the portfolio. How does that help you maybe in the intermediate term? And also does that mean you have a Patriot 3 -- PAC-3 solution in hand or close to it?","Thomas A. Kennedy","Let me start off with the partnering, and I'll give you a kind of a phrase. We partner for success. And it does help on the international marketplace to be able to partner with strong companies, for example, Kongsberg. You mentioned there is another activity in Poland, another competition that's not Patriot. It's for the -- more in line with our NASAM system. That's a system that protects the nation's capital. You're correct. We are partnering with Kongsberg in that pursuit in Poland. And we think we're in a very good position there. We also have partnered with Kongsberg in Oman on the NASAMS award that we got last year. So we do work with them. We also have a joint venture with TALOS Raytheon systems. Again, we partner with different companies to -- essentially for success and where it makes sense. Relative to a new low-cost interceptor for Patriot, that's just in our overall Patriot road map to continually -- to evolve that system into its next generation. Right now, we have something called Configuration-3 plus. That was a result of the major development activity funded by the United Arab Emirates that has taken Patriot to essentially state-of-the-art technology. And -- but we are going beyond that. We are working solutions for AESA radars for Patriot. We also are looking at reduced-cost interceptors and other C2 and C4I capabilities for the Patriot System. That continues -- we continue to do that, so that we're relevant in the marketplace, and that we continue to win business across the globe. I hope that helps, Howard, but that's how we do business.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Well, it expands the footprint and the partnering.","Thomas A. Kennedy","Exactly. Expands the footprint, and sometimes certain companies have a better footprint in certain countries. And by partnering, you can be more competitive in the marketplace.","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then for Dave, just a follow-up on Sam's pension question. So if we kind of looked at where we are today versus where we were a year ago, the difference is on the order of $300 million. Is that a fair way to think about it?","David C. Wajsgras","Today versus what we have -- what we would have talked about in January -- are you talking about -- what year, Howard?","Howard A. Rubel - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I'm sorry. Well, 2015 FAS\/CAS outlook versus what you had in January for...","David C. Wajsgras","Yes. If you put a stake in the ground, I actually think it's a little bit north of that. But again, I would urge you not to reach any conclusions based on the spot market today, especially with respect to the returns. The other thing I would ask you to look at is the cash flow over the next 3 years, which increases substantially as a result of the highway bill. But you're right. I mean, point to point, you're right. That's the arithmetic. That's the grid. But as you well know, between now and year-end, things will definitely change.","Todd B. Ernst","Okay. We're going to have to leave it there. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We'll look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter call in January.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day."]}}
