For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Joe Lovechio.","Joseph Lovechio","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, as well as in the Appendix of this presentation.","Turning to Slide 3, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operation. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation. Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation, beginning on Slide 31, for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you saw in our earnings release from earlier this morning, our first quarter results were in line with our expectations as we continue to expand our margins and improve our operating results. We are on track to deliver our operating profit margin, EPS and free cash flow guidance for 2013, primarily due to the strong execution of our business priorities. We've outlined these priorities over the last several quarters and they remain unchanged. We expect to realize cost-based pricing actions. We continue to introduce mix-enhancing new product innovation and products. We continue to reduce our fixed cost structure. And we're delivering on ongoing cost productivity programs. The first quarter results marked the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year ongoing business operations margin expansions, and we expect continued margin expansion, higher revenue growth and higher cash generation as we progress throughout the year.","If you turn to Slide 6, you can see our first quarter results are summarized there. As expected, excluding the impact of foreign currency and BEFIEX, our revenues were essentially flat versus the first quarter of last year. Our diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved $0.56 per share or 40% to $1.97 compared to the $1.41 last year. And first quarter cash flow usage improved from last year, and we are on track to meet our full year guidance as cash generation ramps up during the second half of the year.","Turning to Slide 7. You can see our global industry demand assumptions, which we believe are -- continue to be -- will be positive for the full year. Overall, our outlook remains unchanged as we expect to see moderately higher growth going forward due to the strength of U.S. housing and improving demand trends internationally. In North America, we expect industry demand to be up 2% to 3% as we continue to see the positive trends in housing, and we see this becoming even more structurally strong during the second half of this year. For Brazil and other Latin American countries, we're forecasting industry demand growth ranging from 3% to 5%. In Europe, we still expect a flat industry for the full year as weak economic environment continues across the Eurozone. And finally, we're forecasting moderate growth of 3% to 5% in Asian regions.","At this point in time, I'll turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review in more detail our North America operations.","Marc R. Bitzer","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning to everyone. Let me begin on Slide 9 by reviewing North America's performance in the first quarter, starting with the top line. First of all, if you recall, in December of last year, U.S. retailers' concern over consumer reaction to a fiscal cliff maintained very low inventory levels. On this first quarter 2013, retailers increased their inventory levels, particularly driven by addition of brands in their stores. The result was that industry sell-in was quite a bit better than sell-through for the quarter. Industry sell-through for the quarter was actually in line with our expectations and our full year industry guidance of plus 2% to plus 3%.","As expected, our market share was down versus last year as we comped against our highest market share quarter of last year. Sequentially, however, compared to Q4, our market share was up.","Out of U.S., we saw continued industry demand softness in Canada and Mexico, and as a result, our net sales of $2.2 billion for North America were essentially flat from last year. We do expect, however, higher revenue growth as we progress throughout the year. As we have previously stated, our priority has been and will remain margin expansion. Our operating margins were 9.7% for the quarter, and operating profit was $218 million as compared to $151 million in 2012. Overall, our operating margins expanded by 3 points year-over-year. Strong market execution and innovative consumer products continue to drive increase in price and mix, and the benefit of our cost and capacity reduction initiative was also positive driver in the first quarter. The consistent and disciplined execution of our actions resulted in a sixth quarter of year-over-year ongoing business operations margin improvement.","Turning to Slide 10. You can see just a few examples of our innovative products: the Whirlpool Gold refrigerator, the new Jenn-Air Accolade ventilation system and the Maytag Maxima XL front-load steam washer.","Let me just take a moment to talk about our expectation for the rest of the year as shown on Slide 11. Q1 was in line with our expectations, and we expect revenue growth to build throughout the year. And with regard to the industry demand as we continue the year, we remain optimistic about the continued strength in U.S. housing and the consumers' regained confidence as federal government policies become clearer. And also, the normal replacement cycle of appliance continues, which is particularly important given the peak appliance industry years that occurred well before the recession. With regard to our business priorities, we remain focused on action, driving margin expansion, including investing innovative new products, continuing to deliver cost and capacity reduction initiatives, realizing positive net cost productivity and growing beyond our core product categories.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of international operations.","Michael A. Todman","Thanks, Marc. Turning to Slide 13. Overall, our international operations were led by another strong performance in our Latin America region as margins continue to expand. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa region was negatively impacted by the continued weak environment across the Eurozone. In Asia, we gained market share and drove favorable product price and mix, which was offset by unfavorable currency, a weaker industry and higher material costs.","If you turn to Slide 14, you'll see our Latin America first quarter results. Sales, excluding currency and BEFIEX, increased 2% on improved pricing and mix but lower volumes. As you recall, Q1 last year was the first full quarter of the IPI tax holiday in Brazil. Beginning in February of this year, the IPI tax holiday changed, making Q1 the toughest industry comp. We expect industry demand to grow from here.","GAAP operating profit for the quarter totaled $130 million compared to $121 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher monetization of tax credits, but on an adjusted basis, excluding Brazilian BEFIEX tax credits, our operating profit for the quarter, which totaled $114 million, was equal to the prior year. Improved product price and mix offsetting higher material costs and unfavorable currency continue to drive margin expansion again this quarter as our ongoing business operating margin increased 0.5 point to 9.6%.","Our first quarter results of Europe, Middle East and Africa on Slide 15 reflect the very challenging market environment in the Eurozone. First quarter sales decreased 3% year-over-year to $668 million. Foreign currency did not have a significant impact on net sales compared to last year. The region had an operating loss of $8 million compared to a $4 million profit in the prior year period. Weak demand and country mix, as well as higher material costs, more than offset benefits from cost and capacity reduction initiatives. Also note that Q1 is historically our lowest volume quarter of the year. Given the current economic conditions, we continue to evaluate demand and assess additional cost reduction actions required to adjust for demand.","Our first quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 16. Net sales decreased 8% during the quarter to $187 million, down from $202 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 4% as we saw weaker industry demand, particularly in India. The region's operating profit was $3 million, down from $9 million in the prior year. Market share gains and favorable product price and mix from new product innovation were more than offset by weaker industry demand, unfavorable currency and higher material cost.","Slide 17 shows a few examples of our international product leadership in the first quarter and how we continue to capitalize on the opportunities for growth. We've highlighted the Whirlpool brand Stainwasher in India, Brazil brand's Ative! dishwasher and an induction oven in Europe for the Whirlpool and Bauknecht brands.","On Slide 18, in 2013, we expect improving demand trends in emerging markets throughout the year. Latin America is expected to ramp throughout the year due to the strong underlying fundamentals in the region. For Asia, we see current strengthening in China and India improving throughout the year. And we continue to focus on our business priorities, which are leveraging new product launches and growing beyond our core businesses, continuing cost and capacity reduction initiatives and executing ongoing cost productivity programs.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli.","Larry M. Venturelli","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results are consistent with expectations entering the year and have us on plan to deliver our annual guidance, which we are reconfirming today. On Slide 20, you can see we expect to deliver annual GAAP EPS in the range of $9.80 to $10.30 per share and annual ongoing business operations of $9.25 to $9.75 per share. Our 2013 free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million.  Slides 31 through 39 in the Appendix provide you with a reconciliation of our reported GAAP operating profit and EPS to ongoing business operations for both 2013 and 2012.","Turning back to Slide 21. You will note that we continued to deliver on our margin expansion initiatives for the first quarter, driving a 130 basis point improvement in operating profit margin. Ongoing operating profit margin increased to 6.6% during the quarter, driven by price mix, which was up 1.5 points, and we continue to expect to realize approximately 1 point for the year. Our cost and capacity reduction program contributed another point, consistent with our full year guidance. As expected, net cost productivity was slightly negative as material cost inflation was $46 million during the quarter.","Our cost productivity is on track to ramp up throughout the year, fully offsetting approximately $150 million to $200 million of year-over-year material cost inflation, and is expected to deliver a positive 0.5 point of margin for 2013.","In addition, as planned, we increased our marketing technology and product investments during the quarter, reducing margins by less than 1 point. Overall, our first quarter margins were firmly on track with expectations and consistent with our expected full year improvement.","Moving to the financial summary on Slide 22. As expected, reported net sales were $4.2 billion compared to $4.3 billion last year. Excluding the impact of both foreign currency and BEFIEX, sales were flat to the prior year. As Jeff, Mike and Marc mentioned, we expect revenue growth to progress throughout the year. Monetization of BEFIEX tax credits were $16 million compared to $7 million last year. As of March 31, $177 million in BEFIEX tax credits remain.","Turning to Slide 23. The income tax benefit in this quarter primarily relates to the recognition of $84 million for the U.S. energy tax credit program related to 2012 and Q1 2013 production. As we noted previously, our 2013 full year GAAP earnings guidance includes $120 million of expected benefit from the U.S. energy tax credits. Our full year 2013 ongoing tax rate assumption remains 24%, and our GAAP tax rate assumption adjusted primarily for energy tax credits remains 9% for the year.","The graph on Slide 24 illustrates expenses associated with our cost and capacity reduction program. We continue to expect our program expense to be approximately $185 million this year, and the program remains on track to deliver $175 million of benefit in 2013.","On Slide 25, you see our cash flow priorities remain funding the business, including capital expenditures, debt maturities and pension contributions, return to shareholders and M&A. This month, we raised our annual dividend by 25% to $2.50 per share, and we continue to evaluate M&A opportunities and share repurchases. During the quarter, S&P upgraded our credit rating to BBB, marking solid progress toward returning our credit ratings to prerecession levels. We will continue to balance funding all aspects of our business to ensure the best long-term value creation for our shareholders.","Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","Turning to Slide 27. I would summarize by saying that we are on track to deliver our operating margins, our EPS and free cash flow goals for 2013. We will continue to invest in innovative consumer solutions for the home. We do expect higher revenue growth with the continued strength we're seeing in U.S. housing and improving demand trends internationally. And we do remain focused on delivering at least 8% operating profit margins during 2014.","Finally, turning to Slide 28, I would just say that we are confident in the opportunities that we have for revenue growth and cash generation as we progress throughout the year. These revenue growth opportunities will come through new and emerging markets; our consumer-relevant innovations, which are going very well; our expansion into higher margin, faster growing adjacent businesses, which are growing at good rates; and the advancement of our overall global product leadership position. We have been, and we expect to continue, to perform at levels that will create more value for our shareholders.","So with this, I'll stop our formal remarks and then open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And with that, we'll take our first question from the line of Sam Darkatsh.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First off, I apologize if this was in the prepared remarks and I missed it, was there market share commentary around Latin America and Europe? I missed it if there was.","Michael A. Todman","Sam, this is Mike. No, I didn't make market share commentary, but in Latin America actually, our market share was stable so we maintained. And in Europe actually, we saw a slight increase in our market share.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my primary question, you said that you're expecting sales growth to build as the year progresses in North America and Latin America. Could you decompose that a bit into units versus price mix as the year progresses? And then the follow-up to that would be, how do you see share, market share playing out in the United States, particularly if industry pricing gets a little bit more challenging?","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, Sam, this is Jeff. Let me maybe take that at a global level. First of all, we had -- our Q1 revenues were basically flat when you take out foreign currency. And we've been -- the big currency devaluations happened in March and early April of last year, so we kind of anniversary-ed those things. And given today's currency levels, that should not be a drag on revenues. The second thing I would say is if you step back and look at the global appliance business at a global level, largely speaking, Q1 was probably marginally slightly better or slightly worse than it's been in the last 6 to 9 months, meaning there's been no real material change in the global market. The individual markets, there's been a lot of change, some up, some down. So we're kind of tracking at the rate we've been. The activities we've been putting in place have been expanding margins, and we continue to ramp up investments in new product innovation. So our comments are that with revenues, in essence, being flat in the first quarter, we do expect revenue growth to begin to ramp up as we go out through the year. If you look at our demand forecast, you can see that, largely speaking, we still expect it to be positive. And I think you will see our new product innovations working well in the marketplace. So that's why we're sitting here today feeling good about our revenue growth opportunities. Specifically, North America, I'll let Marc speak to that.","Marc R. Bitzer","Hey, Sam, it's Marc Bitzer. And I made an earlier comment about the revenue growth, which we're expecting. And first of all, as you know, we are not giving revenue or price mix guidance by region, certainly not. So let me try to be vague within the guardrails. First of all, on revenue growth, I wouldn't say I expect it if we don't see trends supporting that and if we don't have a strong degree of confidence that revenue growth will materialize, and we're very confident. Obviously, in particular as you compare year-over-year revenue numbers and also as you keep in mind, we're cycling through several price increases, mix changes, the baseline of comparisons change. And as such, the price-volume equation, by definition, will change. That's just a reflection of baseline and what we're doing about this one. I think the important thing, and that's what's probably implicit in your question, is based on the past industry trends, we have not changed our view on promotional policy. We feel, based on what happened in the first quarter, that our view has been confirmed as evidenced by these operating margins. I'd also said that we remain committed to our strong margins and margin expansion and we -- and that has also been evident in Q4 and Q1. We're playing now with more and more levers. In the past year, we played strongly in the price margins, now it's price margin and cost, and we're increasing -- also, we'll have volume opportunities and that ultimately will support our margin expansion.","Michael A. Todman","Sam, let me give you a little bit of color on Latin America. If we just remember, and I had this in the prepared remarks, the first quarter was the toughest comp quarter for Latin America. And so in general, the industry is down because it was up so high last year because of the IPI tax -- the first quarter of the IPI tax introduction and then the change in IPI tax. But our expectation is that the demand environment in Brazil, in fact, is going to grow. And we're already seeing that in April as we begin to comp over slightly lower numbers from last year and we see positive trends in the economic environment.","Larry M. Venturelli","One other comment, Sam, this is Larry, if you look at the guidance we provided throughout the year, which everybody is reiterating today, if you look at just the industry guidance by itself would indicate 2.5% approximately improvement in unit volume, which would translate into at least that amount of sales for the year, to answer your question.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got it. If I could sneak one more in here real quick. Marc, you mentioned that U.S. POS was less than that of the sell-in. Do you anticipate a bit of a correction or a softer Q2 as a result of that versus what we saw in Q1 for the industry?","Marc R. Bitzer","Let me first -- Sam, it's Marc again -- first reexplain what I mentioned about Q1. As we entered the first quarter, the industry -- or the trade inventory levels were low. I would say unusually low and that was largely driven by the uncertainty, which was around the fiscal cliff and everything else in December. As the quarter progressed, I would say both consumer and trade confidence, particularly trade confidence, increased and inventory levels went up, coupled -- or I would say particularly also driven there. As you know, there have been some retail landscape changes and there were some new brands and floors, which always drives some initial load inventory. That's just the nature of whenever you have new flooring. That was an unusual Q1 effect. The underlying sell-through data, which, as you know, there is no solid source available, but we have a pretty good sense about this one, is, I would say, almost spot on what we had in mind for our full year guidance. I also see that pretty stable to maybe slightly increasing as the year progresses, and for Q2, it feels stable right now. I mean compared to the Q1 trends, not stable in absolute terms.","Operator","We'll take our next question from the line of Eric Bosshard.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Curious for you to speak a little bit more. You clearly are committed to making great progress on margins. I'm interested in how you're thinking about market share relative to that. I know you've talked in the past of some decisions you've made on market share relative to margin. But interested in how you're thinking your commitment to that. And then also, within the market share performance, if you're seeing changes at any different piece of the market at the high end relative to the low end within your performance and if you have different strategies or thoughts about defending or pursuing market share across the portfolio, specifically talking about North America.","Marc R. Bitzer","Eric, again, it's Marc Bitzer. First of all, just to provide facts, as I indicated already, our Q1 market share was year-over-year down and sequentially slightly up, which pretty much confirms our current trends and the decisions which we've taken in Q4. And obviously, I can't give a quarterly guidance on market share, but let me try to maybe put it more in generic terms. The way how we look at market share is there's a certain portion -- the biggest portion of our market share, which I call it everyday earned in the trade's local grade products. As you can imagine, we're exceptionally committed to grade and innovative products to earn that every day, and we will work incredibly hard to never let that go. There's another portion of the market, which is, call it, promotion market share, which sometimes is a little bit like quicksand and you need to make a decision, a, how big is that. In the past couple of years, we said we don't believe that promotion markets were big. And two, what return on investment do I get, i.e., how much does it cost me to buy that market share in simple terms. I'm simplifying. And that is where we have not changed our view on this one. But don't confuse that with us not being committed to drive our market shares with great products and innovative products. We remain exceptionally committed and will remain so.","Jeff M. Fettig","And Eric, I would just add to that. I mean, we are investing in what we think is sustainable market share, which is new product innovation. And where we brought out really great new product innovation, we are actually gaining market share. To Marc's point, we do not believe -- if you look at the elements that construct demand in the marketplace, it's primarily replacement. We're now seeing a really nice growth factor in new construction. We're starting to see the pickup from existing home sales. But the pure, pure discretionary is still very, very weak, and given that environment, we don't think what I'd call uneconomical promotions drives any more demand. So that's the same position we've had for some time now and it's the position we have today.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","I guess, just a follow-up. I totally understand your comment that uneconomical promotions don't drive demand, but they may influence market share. And so what I'm curious, as you have seen LG and Samsung go into Depot and Lowe's, how that is impacting your market share there and how you're seeing the landscape change. I know you've also won market share at Home Depot with the Whirlpool brand. But my follow-up is, how you're seeing that market share position evolve as those new players have arrived?","Jeff M. Fettig","Again, Eric -- again, I can't really speak about competitors, but if you look at the last couple of years, when there were these heavy promotions, we would lose some share and a month or 2 months later we'd be right back to where we are. So we think it's transitory, and I haven't seen any change in the environment today.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Denise Chai.","Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I had a question on your -- on the growth in the North American contractor channel that you saw in the first quarter just year-on-year and also quarter-on-quarter. And then my second question is about how you see the raw material price outlook and really how that factors into your thinking on price and margins going forward.","Marc R. Bitzer","Denise, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me first take the question on the North American contract channel. Yes, it's correct, we've seen strong, robust and sustained growth in contract channels in the first quarter. I would also like to refer back to some comments that we made in Q3 and Q4. The size of the contract channel is still off a very low base. So it does not yet weigh as big as it would have done 4, 5 years ago. But again, I would say growth, and without giving you specific numbers, strong double-digit growth and we've not seen that for sustained periods, and we do expect that even to grow further as the year progresses.","Jeff M. Fettig","Denise, regarding raw materials cost, clearly, the last couple of weeks there's been some change in sentiment certainly reported and in some prices of pure commodities. For the year, we don't see a material change. We've guided early on in February $150 million to $200 million for the year. I would say that if current trends hold, we're probably heading towards the lower end of that range as opposed to higher. And we still have some big materials like resins and -- that are significantly higher on a year-over-year basis. And the other thing, we have some very high inflationary markets like India and Brazil where they're not reflecting the global commodity trends that you're talking about. But overall, we're comfortable, we have a significant portion of our business hedged. We will benefit if these current prices hold of reducing that range, which will just help our net productivity.","Operator","We'll move next to the line of Michael Rehaut.","William Wong","It's actually Will Wong on for Mike. Regarding your 2014 outlook in terms of the operating margin getting back to about at least 8% operating margins, you guys are looking at maybe about 7%, looking at the mid-point of the range this year. What are the main drivers of getting back to that 8% plus in 2014?","Jeff M. Fettig","Well, for the full year of 2014, we're clearly not giving forecast yet. But the 8-plus percent is what we've been indicating really for the last 3 years of what -- the way we're going to drive our business to rebuild healthy margins, invest in the things that will drive growth. And so we've been executing now to that -- those plans and with great detail for some time. If you just look at the margin progression the last 5 quarters and the drivers of it, you kind of see all the pieces. Fundamentally, we have 4 big levers that we're driving -- or 3 that we're driving and 1 that is external, first is demand. We do think demand is going to improve. We don't think it's going to -- we believe it's improving gradually, but that's a profound change from what we've seen the previous 4 years where the North America market is still 25% below where it was in 2007, European market's about 20% down and so on. So having even a little growth is going to be highly leverageable in our business. The second thing has been price mix. We made great progress in price mix last year through both cost base price actions and very positive mix from our new product innovation. That's moderating this year as we expected, but we still expect certainly the mix portion of that to be very important this year and going forward. The third is our restructuring plans, which we're fully on track to delivering, and we've indicated this year it will contribute $175 million and there may be a tail to that with some more benefits even next year. And then lastly is our cost productivity. Despite weak volumes, we've been in a highly inflationary materials market. And so even this year we're talking about commodities going down, they're still up for the full year. And so a moderation of that will help us drive higher net productivity. In the combination of those 4 things that we're managing in every part of the world, everywhere and plus the 5 -- last 5 quarters of track record, we believe we're going to continue to grow our margins sequentially and head into next year, and when it's time, we'll give you those plans. But we've guided early on to between 6.8% and 7.2%. So yes, 7% is the mid-point. It could be on the high end, it could be on the low end, it's too early to tell, but that was the basis for our guidance this year.","William Wong","Okay, great. And a question regarding Europe. Last year, you guys made about $4 million on higher revenue and this year -- or this quarter you lost about $8 million. You talked a little bit about maybe potential further restructuring going forward. Question, like how much of that restructuring that was previously announced was actually executed thus far? And then in terms of profitability in Europe, how should we think about just the remainder of the year? Do you expect to be profitable in the region going for the next couple of quarters?","Michael A. Todman","Yes, let me take that question. First of all, if you think about how Europe went over the course of last year, what we saw was a reduction in demand over the course of the year. And so that had an impact on our total profitability. We've executed the bulk of the restructuring actions, but as you know, in Europe, it takes a little bit longer to begin to get those benefits. But we are getting the restructuring benefits that we committed to, and we expect to get that throughout the course of this year. The other thing to remember is even though you quoted the year-over-year, if we look at just sequentially, the first quarter is always our lowest quarter of volume seasonally in Europe. So it's about 20% lower than it is in the fourth quarter. So those are just kind of the macro. We do expect that as we go throughout the course of this year that, yes, we will drive this business to profitability. And we will continue to assess the demand environment, and if necessary, we will take action on our fixed cost. But that's something that we'll observe over the course of the year.","William Wong","Great. And then just last question, if I could. Regarding the sequential improvement in margins in North America from 9.3% in 4Q to 9.7%, could you help us maybe in terms of what were the main drivers? Was it price mix, cost and capacity reductions? Maybe just give us a little bit more color on that, that would be great.","Marc R. Bitzer","It's Marc Bitzer again. First of all, typically, what you see in Q4 to Q1 sequentially in North America is maybe less amplified as you would see, for example, compared to Europe, which Mike just referred to. What we took the gap in North America between Q4 and Q1 is 2 effects. You have a little bit less profitability coming from small domestic business, which is a healthy business for us, and you have the opposite effect because typically Q4 is a little bit more promotion intense period. As a net result of all this one, you typically would expect Q4 to Q1 a small drop, i.e. the Q1 has a slightly lower operating margin than Q4. And this year was different, and that is a good achievement and that gives us all the confidence for this year.","Larry M. Venturelli","Will, just one other thing to add to what Marc said, just realize that there's almost a -- there's almost 20% lower volume between Q4 and Q1, and that's really typical across the company, as well as North America, and margins improved.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of David MacGregor.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","On the North American business, you mentioned that Canada and Mexico were off. I wonder if you could just say what U.S. grew if you exclude Canada and Mexico.","Marc R. Bitzer","David, it's Marc Bitzer. I mean, first of all, you probably have seen the industry shipment data, which are 5.5% up for Q1. Again, keep in mind these are sell-in data, which are slightly elevated due to the inventory moves. Again, it's difficult to quantify publicly what we think the sell-through is, but it's obviously a few points below that, but again supporting our full year assumption. Mexico, in particular in Q1, had a very soft industry, double digit down.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. We've kind of carved this thing up. I'd like to maybe talk about the use of cash. My recollection is that you still have a share repurchase authorization remaining from many years ago. Can you just remind us if that's correct and what the amount of the authorization is and what your inclination would be to be active here in the very near term in terms of share repurchase activity?","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes, David, this is Larry. As I said in my prepared remarks, the uses of cash, funding the business, debt maturities, pension contribution, M&A, return to shareholders. We did increase the dividend pretty much in line with our historical payout ratio. We are evaluating both M&A and share repurchase. We have $350 million remaining on our authorization. And again, as I mentioned, we're continuing to evaluate both M&A, as well as share repurchase as we move forward.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Maybe we could talk about the M&A opportunity a bit as well. And I guess, Jeff, if you could talk a little bit about your priorities or how you're thinking about M&A opportunity and -- maybe from a valuation standpoint or geographic standpoint or -- and how can you execute acquisitions at this point in a way that doesn't disappoint the investment community?","Jeff M. Fettig","Well, I guess, that would be the starting point, David, is -- well, first of all, as I've said, we're always looking at opportunities throughout the world in different parts of our business. We have strict criteria that we follow when evaluating them. There've been a number of acquisitions over the last couple of years that we've looked at and decided didn't meet our criteria. But top of the list of that criteria is creating value for our shareholders. So the simple answer is if we don't see a clear path to doing that, we won't do it. And again, the things that have worked well for us, very well in the past are what I call plug-and-plays into some of our regions, our core regions. We continue to invest in certain emerging markets where we can scale up. We continue to look at opportunities in our expanded -- extend and expand categories. But the fact that we haven't done any means that we haven't done anything that really meets our criteria.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Would that criteria include being accretive in the first year?","Jeff M. Fettig","David, it depends. I can't answer that because it just depends on the opportunity but...","Larry M. Venturelli","I think we're looking at the value creation, value creation versus [indiscernible].","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Right. I'm just thinking about catalysts in the story. And then, could you just maybe talk about Eastern Europe and particularly Russia? Just what is the opportunity there for Whirlpool and where would that stand in terms of your list of emerging market priorities.","Michael A. Todman","Yes, David, Russia historically and continues to be a pretty volatile market. It's a market that's driven on basically one area, which is oil. And so our investments in Russia have been limited. We don't see it as a huge growth opportunity because some years it will be a boom and other years it will be a bust. And so what we're looking at is really investing in those businesses where we think we can get sustainable growth. And we don't see Russia -- we think there's opportunity, but not for huge investment.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And as ugly as Europe is right now, is it fair to say that at least it would be a consideration for you if there was an opportunity to play a consolidating role in Europe?","Jeff M. Fettig","Right. Yes, Dave, look, we've got many things we can and are doing in our current business in Europe to improve value creation and returns to our shareholders. Europe remains a very fragmented market and consolidation is something that can and likely will happen someday. But the question is  someday and I don't know when that will be.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from the line of Ken Zener.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Jeff, Larry, I'm going to go back to AHAM versus your North American shipments because it's the fundamental question today given that your margins sequentially are higher in North America, which is, I think, outstanding. However, we had LG report last night. They're up 19% international, led by U.S. sell-in to Lowe's, part of that product shift. How clearly can you express to investors that you're not losing share, which is the fundamental pressure on the stock today despite the excellent operating leverage sequentially that you delivered?","Jeff M. Fettig","Let's be clear, first of all, AHAM, we're not talking North America, we are talking the U.S. AHAM was up roughly 5.8, and we think sell-through was about 2 to 3, okay? You talked about the competitor number up 19%. Please remember, they entered a major distribution channel during the quarter, which involves -- that has nothing to do with sellout and has everything to do with sell-in. You also probably note in that release their margins in this category went down 2 points. So, I guess, I wouldn't make a plus 19 trade-off for minus 2 points of margin. It wouldn't be value creating for our shareholders. So our view is that we're going to earn good business every day. We are investing significantly in new innovations we're bringing to marketplace. We've got great examples where we are gaining share with this innovation. And we feel fine about where we are in market share today. To Marc's point, there's business you got to earn every day and there's business that's transaction oriented, and we do both. And the business that you earn every day we do very well in. And the transaction, if it's a good transaction, we do it. But candidly, as I've said in the past, we could gain 2 to 3 points of market share in 90 days in the U.S. market, if we want to pursue certain types of business. Today, that type of business just isn't value creating.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Jeff, that was very good and clear. I do appreciate it. Second question is, our forecast, if the AHAM was -- again, North America was 36 million units '12. We forecast roughly 42 million in 2015, of which half of the growth comes from housing, normalizing the 1.5 million starts. Can you give investors a little more comfort that your market share, which I believe is roughly 40% nationally, as well as 40% new construction, that, that growth is predicated upon structural issues like your distribution channel, a, and comment on the profitability of that business relative to the segment in general?","Marc R. Bitzer","Hey, Kenneth, it's Marc Bitzer. First of all, on your 2015 industry forecast, which I wouldn't confirm but I'm not disagreeing with, first of all, rightfully, you point out the 2 fundamental driver in the long-term industry demand are ongoing replacement cycle and the structural recovery in the housing\/construction. You obviously also noted that all the growth, which was in housing permits, is still, and we made that point earlier, 6 to 9 months away from housing completions and when you typically get the appliance shipment. You get the appliance shipment pretty much on 2 days before the keys are handed over. So you were always at the tail end, but also means in 2013 you will still only see a certain portion of the underlying momentum being built in that channel. But again, the momentum is building strongly. Now as you look at the market share and that is -- I will say the nice thing about this channel in particular, and you asked earlier about certain other brands, that channel is a very, how should I phrase it, very captive channel that you have to earn contracts over many years. These contracts are awarded, they're signed, and it's a very difficult channel to manage and serve in the right way. It takes years of building a capability of contracts. And today, that market is, I would say, largely 2 players and the third one a little bit smaller of a branch you mentioned before are basically not having access to that channel. So we are very confident that we're in a very strong position to participate in that growth of a market in a, I would say, almost disproportionate manner.","Jeff M. Fettig","And Ken, I would add to that. I mean, there is an infrastructure cost to be in that channel, a supply chain cost, service cost, coverage cost. And we're still early in the game, I think, in the housing recovery. And that infrastructure cost is highly leverageable. It's fixed. And so as that channel grows, it's not only very leverageable from a fixed cost base, but it's a great mix channel for us because the power of our brand portfolio, we give builders packaged options which they offer to consumers, and we see great mix upgrade opportunities throughout our portfolio of brands. So it's a great channel as it's getting healthy. It was an investment on our part when it was down to the levels it were with the fixed cost that we had, but it was an investment we decided to make, and we're going to benefit from the upside of that.","Larry M. Venturelli","And we'll see some very strong industry growth in the future as that part of the business comes back.","Jeff M. Fettig","I think that was our last question we had on the line. We appreciate everyone joining us today. We look forward to talking to you next time. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's program. Have a great day. You may disconnect at this time."],"22793":["Whirlpool Corp. (NYSE:WHR) Q1 2017 Earnings Call April 25, 2017  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Chris Conley - Whirlpool Corp.","Jeff M.

Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to Whirlpool Corporation's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Call. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Chris Conley.","Chris Conley - Whirlpool Corp.","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation first quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Marc Bitzer, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on slide 2 of this presentation.","Turning to slide 3, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions in the first round and then time permitting we will address any follow-up questions after everyone has had a turn.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you saw in our press release from last night, we delivered strong revenue growth for the quarter of about 4% with substantial growth and margin expansion in both North America and our Latin America regions. We also had significant free cash flow improvement of more than $240 million, an increase of more than 30% versus last year. These results represent good progress towards our long-term goals. We also continued to execute our balanced capital allocation strategy during the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased about $150 million of common stock, and last week, we announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend.","During the quarter, we did experience challenges with integration complexity in our European business, which negatively impacted our quarterly results, but we have plans in place to deliver significant improvements to grow our margins, which Marc will discuss later on in this call. Overall, the fundamentals of our business are strong. We are confident in our ability to deliver revenue, earnings per share, and free cash flow growth this year. We plan to continue deploying cash to our balanced capital allocation strategy, including the increased dividend I just mentioned and also continued share repurchases throughout the year.","On slide 6, we show our first quarter financial results, which I have already discussed. I'll now turn to slide 7, where we show our 2017 financial guidance. Our free cash flow guidance of approximately $1 billion has not changed. We continue to expect to drive free cash flow improvement through both working capital optimization and increased earnings. We have updated our 2017 earnings per share guidance, primarily to reflect the impact of the challenges we had in Europe during the first quarter. Again, we do believe we have the right actions in place to drive improvements to our European margins as we progress through the rest of the year. So overall, we now expect to deliver ongoing earnings of $14.75 to $15.50 per share for the year, which represents a 5% to 10% improvement year-over-year.","Next, I'll turn to slide 8, where you see our 2017 priorities, which are unchanged. As we discussed earlier, we do expect to complete key elements of our integration activities in Europe, driving several points of margin improvement in the second quarter and continuing to subsequently improve margins as we progress throughout the second half of the year. Also, as we have done over the last several quarters, we expect to continue to drive growth above industry levels, especially in key markets like the U.S. and Brazil. And we remain focused on driving substantial free cash flow improvements through working capital initiatives and earnings growth.","So with that as an overview, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 10, we will review our first quarter performance in North America. Net sales were $2.6 billion, an increase of more than 6% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, revenues grew 7%. We continued to deliver profitable growth above industry levels through our leading brand and product portfolio. We gained more than a point of market share as consumer demand for our strong brands and new product has continued to outpace the industry.","We also expanded margins through cost productivity and unit volume growth, despite $40 million of higher raw material inflation and about $10 million of unfavorable currency from Mexican peso. As a result, our margins expanded by more than 70 basis points to 11.2% for the quarter. As demonstrated by these strong results, we believe that we have the right plans in place to deliver our full-year margin goals of 11.5% to 12%, while growing at or above industry levels.","Turning to slide 11, you will see our expectations and operational priorities for North America. We continue to expect industry growth of 4% to 6% for full year, behind strong macroeconomic and housing trends. The industry grew approximately 2.5% in the first quarter, in line with our expectations. We continue to expect to grow at or above industry levels, while expanding our margins through cost productivity, adjacent business growth and leveraging the benefits of unit volume growth as we did in the first quarter. And we expect to drive improved mix through a strong cadence of new product launches throughout the year.","Beginning on slide 12, we will review the first quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Sales were approximately $1 billion, down 9% versus the prior year, excluding the impact of currency. Our operating margins were negatively impacted by approximately $20 million of currency and demand impact in our UK business, consistent with our expectations. And as Jeff mentioned earlier, our European integration is currently at peak levels of complexity, which impacted margins by approximately $40 million. To provide additional context on these integration-related impacts, I will share some details beginning on slide 13.","We are approximately halfway through the final, but most complex phase of this Indesit integration. Our footprint optimization efforts, which include integrating product platforms into new factories and reducing the number of factories in the region, are approximately 70% complete. Our brand and product platform integrations are nearly complete, and we are beginning to see working capital benefits of our simplified portfolio in the region. Finally, we're approximately 30% through our system integrations and legal entity mergers. We reached a peak level of integration-related complexity in the first quarter, and we expect the impact of these elevated complexities to continue until the end of the second quarter.","On slide 14, we show the impact of these transitions over the past three quarters. We started our platform of footprint optimization process in the middle of last year, causing a negative impact to the availability of certain products. As we progressed through this process, our availability continued to be challenged with the impact of late shipments peaking in January. As we normalized operations during the quarter, we began to see late order levels improve and shipment volumes increase and achieved major appliance volume growth in March.","We are confident that with strong actions we have in place, shown on slide 15, we'll overcome these challenges. Our focus is on minimizing disruptions and quickly normalizing our operations, as we complete legal entity mergers, the brands and product transitions and footprint optimization efforts. First, we expect to stabilize systems across the region and improve our key business processes. Additionally, we are improving our order intake process and safety stock targets. We expect these actions to decrease late order delivery. Finally, as we push simplifying our brand and product portfolio, we expect to improve working capital and drive profitable growth.","To summarize on slide 16, we now expect 0% to 2% industry growth in 2017, a slight reduction from our prior guidance. We're expecting growth in Russia and Eastern Europe to be offset by slight weakness in Western Europe and the UK. Based on current market rates, currency weakness in the UK is now expected to be largely offset by the strengthening Russian ruble, but increased raw material inflation will have a negative impact on margins for our full year. We now expect to deliver operating margins of 3% to 4% for the year as we work to offset the impact of raw material inflation and first half integration complexity. We expect second quarter margins to sequentially improve by several percentage points, and we expect that performance trend to continue as we progress through the second half of the year.","I will now discuss our Latin America results on slide 17. Sales for the quarter were $818 million, an increase of 16% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, revenues increased 4%. Operating profit was $68 million and margins increased 220 basis points versus the prior year. Despite operating in an environment that continues to be challenging, we were able to expand margins through cost productivity and favorable price mix, which more than offset industry volume declines and higher material costs. We drove strong revenue growth and gained additional market share in Brazil as we continued to benefit from our leading portfolio of brands and products.","On slide 18, our 2017 priorities and expectations for Latin America are unchanged. We continue to expect industry demand for the full year to be flat, with demand declines continuing in the second quarter, followed by offsetting growth in third and fourth quarters. We remain committed to delivering revenue growth and margin expansion in the region as we continue to realize the benefits of our brand investments and new product launches, while delivering strong cost take-out. As the industry begins to grow in the second half of the year, we will further benefit from our right-sized fixed cost structure in the region. For the year, we now expect to deliver 8% to 9% operating margins.","We now turn to our first quarter results for the Asia region, which are shown on slide 19. Net sales were $419 million versus $371 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 16%. Our operating profit was $23 million and operating margins were 5.5%. We continued to deliver strong performance in India, and demand growth in that country has remained robust. We also continued to grow volumes in China, despite an operational environment in China which continues to be challenging. Chinese industry declines continued and raw material inflation in the region was higher than expected, negatively impacting margins by approximately $20 million. We also saw an unfavorable mix in China, as we have not yet realized the full impact of our investments in brands across our large distribution network.","Turning to slide 20, you will see our 2017 priorities for Asia. We continue to expect flat to 2% industry growth for the region. We expect strong demand to continue in India, and we will continue to drive revenue growth in China through our distribution expansion, despite industry demand weakness. We are on track to deliver margin expansion in 2017, and we continue to expect to deliver 7% to 8% operating margins for the year.","On slide 21, we summarize our regional margin progression growth for 2017. While we're working through challenges in the EMEA region, we continue to expect strong margin improvements and revenue growth in our other regions.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jim.","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our first quarter results on slide 23. Net sales were $4.8 billion and grew 4% versus the prior year, which is in line with our full-year revenue growth expectations. We delivered strong free cash flow improvement of more than $240 million versus the prior year through focused working capital optimization. We delivered ongoing earnings of $2.50 per share. A strong cost take-out and revenue growth were more than offset by $90 million of raw material inflation, as well as the negative impact of integration complexity in Europe. Finally, as indicated on the prior call, due to our tax planning activities, we now expect a full-year effective tax rate of 20%.","Turning to slide 24, I will update our expectations for the 2017 EBIT margin drivers. We are experiencing raw material inflation at higher levels than we expected in January. However, our exceptionally strong cost productivity and restructuring programs will more than offset these levels of raw material cost inflation, while still delivering benefits to the bottom line. We are also seeing less impact from currency and expect the full-year impact of currency on EBIT margins to be approximately flat.","On slide 25, we update our expectations for total cost take-out in 2017. As you can see, we now expect $300 million of raw material cost inflation. However, we remain confident in our ability to deliver substantial levels of cost productivity. We now expect to deliver approximately $475 million of gross cost take-out for the year. We have a strong track record of dealing with raw material cost inflation through cost productivity, while expanding our margins. This year will be no different.","On slide 26, we show our updated full-year guidance for 2017. We continue to expect to deliver approximately $1 billion of free cash flow, and our first quarter free cash flow improvement of more than $240 million has us firmly on track to delivering that goal. As a result of the increased complexity of our first half integration activities in Europe, we are adjusting our full-year ongoing earnings guidance to a range of $14.75 to $15.50 per share.","On slide 27, we update the first half versus second half timing of our earnings for the year. We continue to expect volume to be a positive contributor to earnings in both halves of the year. We now expect the impact of total cost take-out to be slightly positive in the first half, with the benefits from our cost take-out programs ramping up in the second half, as has been the case in prior years. We have seen some improvements to currency in the first quarter, and we now expect the full-year impact of currency to be approximately flat. Finally, we expect to more than offset slightly negative price mix in the first half of the year with positive price mix in the second half driven by our innovative new product launches. Overall, we expect full year earnings seasonality to approximate 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half.","On slide 28, we provide additional detail on our cash flow and capital allocation priorities. As I mentioned earlier, we delivered free cash flow improvements of more than $240 million in the first quarter, and we are well on track to deliver approximately $1 billion of free cash flow for the full year. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $150 million of shares, and we recently announced a 10% quarterly dividend increase. Given our confidence in our underlying business performance and our cash generation capability, we remain committed to returning significant levels of cash to our shareholders by executing our balanced approach to capital allocation.","Turning to slide 29, we update our full year free cash flow improvement drivers. We now expect to deliver cash earnings growth of approximately $200 million through the margin expansion plans I discussed previously, and we now expect to generate $250 million in free cash through our strong focus on improving working capital efficiency, primarily in North America and Europe.","Turning to slide 30, consistent with our prior disclosures, we remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy.","Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Thanks, Jim. I'll turn to slide 32 where I wanted to update you on our progress towards our long-term value creation goals, which we laid out at the beginning of the year. Our first quarter revenue growth of 4% has us fully on track towards our annual growth target for the year in revenue. We remain committed to achieving our long-term EBIT margin goals of 10%-plus by executing all the elements of the strategies that we described.","We've also delivered significant improvements in free cash flow in the first quarter. We expect to deliver again for the year, and we are on track to deliver cash generation of 5% to 6% of revenues, in lines with our 2018 goal. So overall, we're confident that we will make meaningful progress towards each of our value-creating goals this year.","Lastly, on slide 33, let me summarize kind of the key points we wanted to communicate in this call. Again, first, good revenue growth in the first quarter; really good revenue growth and margin expansion in both North America and Latin America. Cash flow, very strong, and we are on track for the year. We do have actions in place to complete the key elements of our European integration as we go through the year, and we do expect strong improvement from the first quarter to the second quarter and the balance of the year in our European business. So overall, we remain confident in the strong underlying fundamentals of the business, and we're fully committed to delivering our long term goals.","Finally, we do look forward to providing all of you more detail about our long-term strategy for shareholder value creation at our Investor Day which is scheduled to be held next week, May 4, at the New York Stock Exchange.","So with that, I'd like to end our formal remarks and open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Robert Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, Jeff and everybody, good morning, and thanks for the extra detail on today's call. It sounds like you made a lot of progress in North America, and LatAm is rebounding nicely, and then we get to EMEA, and it seems like there's some hardship in place. And I really was hoping you'd give everybody a little bit more comfort, is this kind of a transitory margin shortfall, an air pocket in the first quarter we saw? How confident are you that you can return to profitability in the second quarter based on that chart you had, chart 14? And where can this business go in terms of longer term margin performance once you finish with the platform integration and get the headquarters system integration complete? How should we think about this going forward?","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah. Bob, I'm going to turn it over to Marc to give you a little bit more detail, but big picture, our expectations for Europe are unchanged. We think with the integration complete, this is going to be a highly value creating business. First quarter was a big challenge, and it had a material impact on our earnings. We do very much believe it's transitory, and again, I'm going to turn it over to Marc, let him give you a little color on it.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Hey, Bob. It's Marc. First of all, as you outlined, we're very pleased to have three of our four regions fully on track, probably even on the high end of the margin. Europe was a miss. There's no questioning around this one. To Jeff's point, what is important is we strongly consider this of being a temporary nature and not structural, this is nothing and also if you look at the issues, there's nothing structural. We had a blip, if you want to say so, which was particularly concentrated on January and February. And as you have seen on the slide before, March, I would say we stabilized the situation and we exited the quarter with a much stronger performance compared to January, February.","What ultimately drove it is, call it, the cumulative effect of a complexive (21:04) integration. So as we came to the tail end of a factory and product platform integration and as we did the entire SAP system go live from the headquarter in Italy and all the factories in Italy, that led to a major supply chain disruption in January, February. It happens. The situation is stable, but it doesn't mean that it's yet a good supply chain situation. We expect it to be stable in Q2 and then turn back to, kind of call it, normal operations in Q3.","It is also as we are progressing in April, we see a similar trend as we've seen in March, a fairly stable system environment; not yet good, but stable. And also we see then the subsequent positive effect on order and shipments. So again, we had an issue, particularly focused in January and February. March, exit was much better. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, Q2, we will see several points of margin improvement compared to Q1 and we expect that positive trend to continue in the second half.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And straight up on that question, do you think you're going to be in positive margin performance for the second quarter in EMEA?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","We do expect so.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it, that's great. And then obviously, you show some good progress working through these issues. North America, it's your big engine driver of profitability. I was just wanting to get a little bit more depth. Sounds like there's some input cost inflation on the steel side, but you're making good progress of the productivity improvement. And how do we think about the pace and cadence kind of profitability? You reaffirmed your long-term margin target this year for North America. Does the productivity improvements outstrip cost inflation? And could you talk a little bit about the pricing environment? It seems like you're gaining some share. How should we be thinking about competitive dynamics?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Hey, Bob, it's Marc again. So let me break it up in several points. First of all, top line. As I indicated before, we're highly confident the industry will grow 4% to 6%. That 2.5% in Q1 was more driven by inventory adjustments related to a trade partner bankruptcy. In that environment, we picked up approximately one point of share. What we haven't referred to in detail is actually if you look at the underlying driver of that one point of share growth particularly came from KitchenAid and where we launched the new Kitchen Suite last year and Maytag laundry. Right now if you look at the industry, these are probably the strongest growing brands in the entire industry. So, we feel very good about the mix we achieved in Q1.","Despite some reports out there, we were not very promotionally aggressive; otherwise we would have never achieved these kind of margins. So, I think we were very balanced in deciding which promotion to go in, we drove the mix very well and that helped, very strong in the top line. On the cost side, yes, we see globally, and we refer to that significantly higher raw material than we expected just 90 days ago. The good news both globally and in North America, a big part is already behind us.","We ate through a big part of raw material increases in Q1, both in North America and the global level, which is largely related \u2013 you mentioned steel \u2013 call it, the surprise came particularly from resins. Steel prices are higher, but resins were substantially higher throughout the quarter, but started coming down in late March. So, yes, we faced some raw material increase in North America. We dealt with them through additional cost productivity and we're very confident that we can deal with them throughout the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, Jeff, Marc, Jim. How are you?","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Good morning, Sam.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Good morning.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And thank you also for the additional time for us to process all the moving parts by reporting last night. That was much appreciated. Thank you. Two questions. First, I think you mentioned that the systems integration milepost in Europe is still ongoing and probably doesn't end at least comfortably until late Q2, so why specifically do you feel comfortable that your visibility is better now than it was in late January? And how do you get improved working capital for the year, knowing that you have to raise safety stock inventory? That would be my first question.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Hey, Sam. It's Marc. I'm going to take this one. First of all on the system integration, the Q1 of January-February was the combination of system integration and the remaining piece of some factory moves. We particularly moved some hops which was confined up in (25:57) January. So the combination of this one led to a supply chain disruption.","In particular also, the system introduction in January was not a normal one. This is not one of a normal market interruption. It impacted Italy, the entire headquarter operations, and linked with all Italian factories. So even while we're not done with the system integration, that was the single biggest piece, and it's kind of \u2013 yes, and we had some issues in particular on the electronic orders, which we addressed, but it took us some time to address it. So yes, we will have system go-lives going forward. But I would say these are more kind of normal market go-lives, which on its own are challenges, but we know how to deal with them. But as a single piece, they're not comparable to anything which we had in January-February, and that gives us a certain confidence behind this one.","To your question on the working capital and again, as you know, we don't show regional working capital levels. But we actually addressed the inventory overhang in Europe, which may sound contradictory to the late orders, but we had a lot of inventory coming from kind of phased out products as a result of a product transition. And if you want to say so, we flushed them out. and so the inventory reduction is largely related to phase out obsolete product, which helped us significantly improve our working capital in Europe, and we've basically dealt with that, so we don't have to deal with that going forward.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Last question, if I could, and if you mentioned this in the prepared remarks and I missed it, I apologize. But where specifically is the extra productivity and cost take-out coming from? I think you called out $25 million or so. Are there specific areas where you highlighted that that you could talk to, if you could?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Yes. Sam, let me maybe give you an answer on a global level, and Jim showed it also in his overall chart. First of all, in terms of headwinds, we so far assumed $150 million-plus raw material headwinds. We now expect this to be about $300 million. At the same time, we think we can increase our gross productivity to roughly $475 million, so the net of this one being roughly $150 million to $200 million positive. The increased gross productivity comes back to basically the playbook which we use in these kind of situations. We ramp up our engineering activities on normal cost take-outs. We take very tight controls of SG&A measures, and that basically leads to the increased results. And that is pretty much true for all the respective regions. So, the kinds of measures which we are looking at are true for North America, Europe and all the other regions.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","And, Sam, the only thing I'd add to that, in addition to that, the other side of the equation is what we've done in some markets with price. We have gotten in markets like Brazil and some other markets where we have an even higher level of inflation. It requires us to take cost based price increases and everywhere, and Marc told you the example in North America with our brand portfolio of how we're driving mix. So, cost productivity has always got to be on, particularly in these kind of environments, but we give the same attention to the price margin realization side.","Operator","We'll move next to Megan McGrath of MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Good morning. I guess a couple updates on your operations in the UK. I know you said last quarter you had initiated some cost based price increases there over the last six months, and it was a little slow going in terms of getting competitors to follow. So, if you could give us an update on that, that would be great.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Megan, it's Marc again. So, I'm going to take this one. So, first of all, UK was not a surprise for us. It's basically the kind of issues which we expected which impacted the quarter by roughly $20 million year-over-year. So, the price increases which we referred to already in our last earnings call, we had a July and September price increase of which year-to-date, given the competitive intensity and given the trade partner situation, we realized about 6% or 7%. So we realized quite a bit of a price increase, but not yet to the full level which is required to offset the currency impact.","It's difficult to comment on the entire competitive environment that we focus in our operations, so we realized something, but it's also important to note that our exit market share in the UK after two or three rough quarters has now stabilized. So, we're basically back to kind of pre-Brexit market share level, which is an important measure, and we continue to stabilize that. Keep also in mind pretty much with June of this year, we kind of annualized the Brexit impact. So from then on shouldn't be a headwind anymore.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Great. And then moving on to Latin America, good stable results there on the top line and an improvement in margin. What's your level of confidence there in terms of the overall market having bottomed?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Megan, this is Marc. I'm not quite sure I would call the results stable. We're actually very pleased with these kind of results in a very tough environment. So, first of all, there's two aspects to this one; so the markets remains tough, I mean, the Q1 was down, and Q2 as we indicated earlier will probably not see a lot of recovery. We're still fairly confident in the back half. So on a full year basis, we expect the market to be flat, but we're not putting a lot of hopes behind a too fast market recovery. But again, for the second half we're a little bit more confident.","I think the team has done an excellent job in rightsizing fixed cost structure and also the variable cost. If we look at our variable product margins, despite not having a lot of volume, we have a very healthy business in there. And we had a similar experience in North America three years ago. If you have strong variable product margins without volume in a down market, then you know you can exit very strongly once the market recovers.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question I had was just going back to the European margins, and sorry to beat a dead horse, but just obviously, want to gain a little bit of incremental clarity. So I guess just going back to the end of January, kind of two parts on this. Going back to the end of January, when you put out your 4Q release and held the conference call, you were obviously already going through a pretty tough January, but at the same time expected it seems like perhaps better improvement within the quarter than ultimately played out. So just kind of curious what kind of turned in February? Or where was the enthusiasm that you could pull it out maybe a little sooner than ultimately occurred? And then conversely, looking forward, it seems like you're kind of expecting a back half margin perhaps similar to original expectations to get to the 3% to 4% for the full year. So does that point to by the end of 2Q most of all of this drag essentially ending?","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Yes, Michael. Again, big picture, Marc kind of went through it very specifically in detail, but the first quarter, whatever word you want to \u2013 it was operationally not a surprise, but it was operationally challenging to us. We had very negative shipments in January, still pretty negative in February. Turned around slightly positive in March. We've shown that progression.","So, yes, we didn't plan an operational shortfall, no. We had one. We got I think our arms around it by the end of the first quarter. As Marc said, we still have challenges going into the second quarter. We will improve our margins to profitable levels in the second quarter, and then we expect to kind of get back to an improving margin structure in Q3 and Q4 which leads to 3% to 4%.","So what gives us confidence? Well, again, Marc said, we saw improvement in March. It was just too late for the quarter. It looks like we're going to have similar in April, and every day, every week we get further past the peak execution point in the integration. And that's our job, and that's what we intend to do.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I appreciate that, Jeff. And I guess I was just kind of looking for \u2013 again, it seems like by the time you're looking at the back half, it seems like you're expecting more business to return to normal or so. The expectation is to return to what you had at the beginning of the year. So I just wanted to try and confirm that, but...","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","You figure out the math. I mean yeah, with a almost minus 2% margin in the first quarter, yeah, we do expect much better margins in the second half.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. And, I guess, just switching gears to North America. If you guys could kind of comment on the competitive backdrop. You noted very positively you gained a point of share and you did that without being aggressive on the promotional side. I was wondering if you could give an update on just the overall competitive backdrop. Has anything changed in 2017 versus the back half of 2016? And maybe also talk about some of the ongoing changes in the different distribution channels, the different retail partners to the extent you're able.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Hey, Michael, it's Marc. First of all, the competitive level in North America remains \u2013 in U.S. remains highly competitive I mean, as it always does. Now I think a small change from Q1 versus the back half of last year. As you know, back half last year, we had a significant impact on our P&L coming from excess inventory by certain Asian competitors who kind of loaded the trade with laundry products in anticipation of an antidumping cost. And that was a reality, and we paid a big price for that as a company in the second half.","That effect has moderated in Q1, but it doesn't mean that it's quiet out there. So there's always promotional pressure. I would say not the same kind of inventory overhang as we saw in the second half last year. It's hard to predict, and I can't comment on our competitors what would happen in Q2 and Q3. But right now, as you know, there's certain antidumping measures in place which we are confident will lead to a fair level playing field in the overall markets. And that's what we right now continue to expect to see.","From a trade environment it's kind of, as always, we don't comment on specific trade partners. I would say overall, we're still very confident first of all on the entire builder segment. That continues to show strong growth where we're well positioned. The home improvement channel is overall growing very strongly where we have a very strong market position. So I wouldn't call out any specific retailer. You all read the headlines out there, and we're experiencing similar things.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","And I'd only add to that, Michael. Demand was solid the first three or four months \u2013 or has been in the first three or four months of the year. Again, we get into this sellout data versus shipment data, and plus we had a major bankruptcy of a retailer and all that kind of stuff. But as we look at it, we feel really good about the 4% to 6%.","Operator","Our next question is from Samuel Eisner of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Good morning, everyone.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Good morning.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Good morning.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just wanted to double-check on some of the EBIT walk numbers here. And so I just wanted to confirm. So of the $300 million of raw material inflation for this year, how much has been recognized in the first quarter? And then in addition to the $475 million of gross cost out, again, how much has been recognized in the first quarter? If you can give us either by segment or in aggregate, that'd be great.","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah. So, Sam, this is Jim. And I think the one thing I mentioned is that $90 million of the raw material inflation has already been realized in the first quarter. So you could think about a quarter of it has already come in. And then for the first quarter, as we said, cost was slightly positive. So you should think of it for the full year, we've got about a fourth of our cost also improvement that's come in at this point in the year. So it's about ratably in the first quarter. We do expect it to accelerate somewhat in the back half of the year, but that's where we are and that's what you should assume.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. And then if I just think about the North America margin, it certainly seems a surprise to the upside. The incremental margin strictly on volume in the quarter or even going forward, how should we think about that? Is that a 25% incremental margin? Is that a 40%? Just how should we think about it given that presumably you're reaching pretty decent levels of utilization on that fixed asset base? Thanks.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Hey, Samuel, it's Marc. So first of all, as you know, we guided North America to 11.5% to 12% margin. And right now obviously with the strength in Q1, you could probably make the case where we're more on the high side of this one, but we got to see how the year plays out. Right now I would say we're confident we can deal, as Jim said, with all the raw material increases through cost productivity and even more than offset this one.","And then a lot depends also on how we can drive our product mix going forward. Q1 was very strong, KitchenAid and Maytag laundry (40:21), that gives us a lot of upside on the price mix. The volume impact, we had 6% in Q1, so that's solid, but it doesn't drive a massive P&L impact. Yes, you have some volume leverage on this one. But right now from a pure margin expansion, we're still more focused on product mix and cost take-out.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the North American share gains. And I know you talked about that five or six quarters ago as being sort of a rising priority for you. It's nice to see that playing out. Two questions. First of all, on the Indesit integration, you had originally at the time of the acquisition laid out some ultimate cost synergy numbers, and I was just wondering if this morning you could update us on the cost synergy expectation now for Indesit in 2018?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Hey, David. It's Marc. First of all, as we said at the very beginning of the Indesit integration, we expect to deliver roughly $350 million of overall synergies. As of today, we're fully on track to deliver these ones. We delivered them in 2015 and 2016, and in 2017 we expect another $75 million of incremental synergies to come through the bottom-line. And we're fully on track on this one.","Unfortunately, so far these have been masked by currency and demand effects. That's been obviously very painful, but versus the original $350 million of synergy targets, we're fully on track. And we will also give further update on this one at the Investor Day, but that part of the equation is fully on track.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then secondly just on the raw materials, I guess, you raised the guide on raw materials to $300 million from $150 million three months ago. Is there any way to achieve a little more forward visibility on these costs and management of some of the quarter-to-quarter volatility, and I guess, as well, how exposed are you to further upwards revisions to these numbers as the year goes on?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","David, it's Marc again. So first of all, as you know, the two biggest components of raw materials in our case is steel and resins, okay, these are the two single biggest items, and there's of course a number of other raw materials. Steel and resins are the big ones.","What made the change in Q1 and what makes also the forecast very difficult is, yes, you have some element of steel prices, which are on the high side of what we even expected, but the resins had a massive move in Q1. What makes the forecasting so difficult, and more difficult than usual times, that in both steel and resins, we can't relate these increases to either input costs or demand levels. They're more driven by, what I would call, capacity management.","So there's a lot of factors which are right now hard to explain and hard to forecast because, again, it's not input driven and we do not see the demand side on either steel or resins to justify these kind of price increases. So that also makes the rest of the year a little bit difficult to forecast, but right now I think the $300 million, which Jim referred to, that's probably right now our most likely assumption for raw material cost increase for the full year.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Denise Chai of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. So my questions are still around EMEA as well. You gave guidance in late January. You said that January was the toughest month for the integration. So, I guess, what was your thinking when you provided that guidance? And what was kind of most out of expectations in terms of the complexity of integration? And then secondly, how should we think about margins as you exit the year with all this integration now under your belt? And related to that, when you think about the impact to long term margins, should we think of that as being a 2018 thing? 2019? Just kind of any sort of color around the timeline. Thank you.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Denise, it's Marc. First of all, when we gave the last earnings call that was kind of late January. So frankly, we expected the operations to stabilize faster. So the fact that it also took us way into March to stabilize it, took longer than expected. The reason for this one plentiful, but it's largely systems and the complexity of managing through supply chain challenge.","Having said that, March was better, and April is better, so we're confident on the improvement sequentially. As Jeff indicated before, the two aspects are, if you just do the math, there's a 3% to 4% full year guidance. The exit run rates of Q3 and Q4 are very similar to our original expectations. And by the same token, again, we will talk at the Investor meeting. We stand behind our 8%-plus long term operating margins for the full year, and we're fully convinced that's the right structural run rate. That Q1 was a blip, but we're fully confident we can be on that track.","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah. And Denise, this is Jim. One of the things, too, is some of the increased raw material inflation we saw came in EMEA. And we were able to offset it globally as we said, but with some of the integration issues we weren't able to offset it necessarily in EMEA. So they saw a more significant impact within the first quarter. But, again, we believe we're going to be able to offset it globally on a full year basis.","Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks. And just one more. Looking at slide 14, you had eight straight months of negative volumes in Europe, which has now turned positive. But do you see any obstacles to regaining market share, and if we could perhaps size on maybe the aggregate production shortfall that you've seen.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","So overall, Denise, I mean obviously with kind of this seven or eight months of volume decline, we lost the market share in Europe. It was largely focused initially on UK where we took some strong pricing action and we lost the market share. But this integration complexity we also lost in Q1 and Q4, we lost market share in a number of countries. We're country-by-country regaining the market share and actually see positive momentum. The first country which came around was Russia where we had solid market share gains in Q1. UK is only in March we now saw good exit market share similar to kind of going into Brexit.","Italy, we had some challenges in Q1, so piece-by-piece we're finding our way back to market share. What is I think important to realize is, the market reaction on our new product as a result of these product integration has been very positive. So we know the products are working. We had availability issues, and Europe and all the other global markets are so competitive, if you have availability issues you will have competitors being able to quickly fill in.","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","But again, what has been a headwind we would expect to be a tailwind as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Zener of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Good morning, Ken.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Not sure if it was intentional, but it was nice that you had Johnny Cash singing, You Are My Sunshine precall, first time for me. So once again, the bear case in the U.S. wasn't realized and that's really the permanent shadow that you guys are under. But Europe missed, and I'm not diminishing the difficulty of what you guys are doing in Europe, but I think part of the bigger issue here is, if you could respond to that \"temporary\" that you referred to Marc, and it's not the first time, from an operational perspective we did have several years ago, as you recall, the complexity of the product rollout in the U.S. which impacted you. So, I guess, if I could have you respond to the complexity issue of these operations. If we think about Europe, there's a lot going on, but also in the U.S. we had this issue a while ago. And why that miss-results and reduced guidance, perhaps? That's my first question.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Ken, it's Marc. So, yes, I would say we had a supply chain issue in North America and it was two or three years ago. However, I would not compare these two things (48:35). I mean, the U.S. was around the product introduction and it's a massive demand increase against what was still limited capacity in the system. Europe is \u2013 the amount of complexity is probably difficult to explain on a conference call. We have about...","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","You can try.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","We have about 9,000 SKUs in Europe which compares to about 2,000 in U.S. We changed last year about 80% of these SKUs. As you've seen on this little chart, literally almost every single factory was impacted by all the combination transition that's behind us. At the same time, we introduced several new product platforms and we changed to SAP system. So we've combination of these factors, I don't think it's in any way comparable to what we had in North America.","Now having said that, as Jeff said before, Europe was a miss. I'm not trying to put it any differently. I think we got our arms around it very quickly. We have the entire company focused on this one. We stabilized it in March, but we also recognize it doesn't mean that it's yet good from a supply chain situation. But we're confident we can keep it stabilized in Q2 and then kind of month-by-month get better on this one.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay.","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Ken, the only other thing I'd add, sometimes you have \u2013 and you pointed at two operational things, they do happen. But I would also point to North America, we had the best quarter ever in North America. Part of that benefit is from the new product transitions that we had some challenges with, and we're growing revenue above market. We're expanding margins in a difficult market, and we're improving our mix. And a lot of it has to do with getting massive product transitions in the marketplace, and I think hopefully we'll see the same thing going forward there.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","No, that's why I tied the two together because it is complex and you do have to create a foundation. Marc, I'm going to go back to, I guess, slide 14 \u2013 no, 13, Wave 3. For us that haven't worked in the industry, I think this conference call and obviously next week, I think this will be a topic too, but ramp-up industrialization, you mentioned SAP electronic orders. That is not unique to you, all that an SAP system can \u2013 Hershey did it on Easter. Can you get into a little more detail though on this? Because there's a lot of questions in my e-mail just saying, what does it mean? I mean I hear the words, but is it that you turned on a computer, basically system and all of a sudden orders weren't coming from 50% of your customers through the system into the factories? Because I do think, Jeff, realizing \u2013 and Marc \u2013 that the U.S. and Europe were different, in many ways they're the same because you're executing well in the U.S. but it's these hiccups that kind of undermine the longer-term slope that people can expect from your margins. I think if you could just go into that a little more Marc that would be helpful? Thank you.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Ken, it's Marc again. Obviously, I think that is a good topic for our investor meeting in a couple days from now. Having said that, in kind of one sentence, it's not just the SAP introduction. We changed all our SKUs in pretty much most of the factories, and on top of that have an SAP introduction.","And by the way, it's not the first SAP introduction. We had the SAP introductions before in Europe and North America. We know how that normally works. Right now as you go for integration you have two legacy systems converging into a new system. So you basically have in simple terms three systems talking to each other, which drives a lot of the complexity.","No, the electronic orders are not everywhere (52:24) detail, Italian kitchen manufacturers and electronic orders are something fundamentally different than a normal EDI order from other trade partners.","But again, these are probably way too much detail for the conference call. We know what's behind us. We know we're still not done with all the SAP introductions, but now they will not come on top of a factory integration which is a big difference. But again, I would recommend that we spend a lot more time on this one at our investor meeting in a couple of days from now.","Operator","We have a follow-up...","Chris Conley - Whirlpool Corp.","Looks like we do have one more question.","Operator","We do. We have a follow up from David MacGregor of Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah. Good morning again, and thanks for taking the follow-up. I guess certainly good performance on the North American margins this quarter, and clearly the productivity initiatives you talked about are coming through here and helping you on the raw material offset. I guess, could you talk about how important you feel it is, I guess in the face of these higher raw material costs, and I guess given the revision from $150 million to $300 million from the beginning of the year to hear there's still risk of upside to that $300 million number for this year, but wonder if you could just talk about how important you feel it is in the face of that higher raw material cost to get a price increase this summer that would give you more gross margins to take into the Black Friday discounting?","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","David, obviously we don't talk about future price increases. I would just say that in our business, whether it be North America or anywhere else, we believe it's fundamentally critical to maintain and preserve margins in any environment. And if you look at our track record, there's different levers to pull. You heard Marc and Jim describe in great detail the cost productivity actions that we are driving.","We are in fact in some apparently big markets around the world we have announced and continue to announce cost based price increases. So we've got to do all of that, but we've not communicated anything specifically on a go forward basis in the U.S. market. I'm not saying we won't. I'm just saying we haven't done it yet.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","And, David, maybe to Jeff's point also, again, we will never comment on forward-looking pricing, et cetera, but our playbook and we've shown that in the past repeatedly is, when you're faced with raw material, we first of all double down the cost take-out actions including fixed cost. Two, we drive product mix very hard, and three, as an ultimate resort, we have like-for-like.","We've done the cost take-out, the price mix successfully in most regions. To Jeff's point, we have driven like-for-like increases already in China in the face of raw material, and we will make decisions on a go forward basis.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","So with that, we're going to wrap up. I want to thank everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing most of you next week at our Investors Day on May 4 in New York. So thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's Whirlpool Corporation's first quarter 2017 earnings release call. You may now disconnect your lines. And, everyone, have a great day."],"22785":["Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call April 28, 2015 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Chris Conley - Senior Director of IR","Jeff Fettig - Chairman and CEO","Mike Todman - Vice Chairman","Marc Bitzer - Vice Chairman","Larry Venturelli - CFO","Analysts","David MacGregor - Longbow Research","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James","Denise Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Ken Zener - KeyBanc Capital","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to Whirlpool Corporation's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Release Call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Chris Conley. Please go ahead.","Chris Conley","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation first quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Vice Chairman, Mike Todman and Marc Bitzer; as well as Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with a presentation available on the Investors section of our Web site at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports, as well as on Slide 1 and in the appendix of this presentation.","Turning to Slide 2, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 41 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Fettig","Well, good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. In the press release this morning, we reported strong revenue growth in our earnings performance for the first quarter. To-date, our integration activities in Europe and China are on track, and we continue to see substantial value creation opportunities in these regions through synergies and growth.","During the quarter, we did see significant movements in global currencies and a very negative demand environment in Brazil. But our larger global operating platform helped to offset most of these issues, and we deployed a series of new actions, which are expected to deliver margin expansion in the second half of the year. We will review these actions in detail during our regional reviews.","Turning to Slide 5, in the quarter you can see we delivered strong revenue growth. Excluding the impact of currency, our revenues were up 23% on a year-over-year basis. As expected, our free cash flow was lower compared to last year, primarily due to seasonal working capital requirements related to our acquisitions.","Our ongoing business EPS came in at $2.14 a share, compared to $2.20 last year. Again, primarily due to the negative impact of currency devaluations and lower demand in Brazil. As a result, we are revising our 2015 earnings guidance, which we show on Slide 6. Our revised GAAP to EPS is down $9 to $10 per share. Our ongoing business operations EPS is down $12 to $13 a share, and free cash flow is approximately $700 million positive for the full year.","On Slide 7, you can see the combined impact of these environmental changes that had on our business, and is expected to be approximately $2 per share. Within this environment, we expect our first half results to deliver earnings per share that are approximately flat on a year-over-year basis. And as a result, the new actions implemented or in the process of being implemented, we expect to deliver margin run rates in the second half consistent with our prior expectations for the year, which represents a substantial level of margin expansion from where that is today.","As shown on Slide 8, we feel good about the progress we're making in our long-term growth strategy, which remains on track. We continue to see multiple opportunities for both growth and margin expansion over the medium and long-term, falling under three prime categories; the first is our geographical expansion, again our integration plans are fully on track and already producing positive results. Additionally, while emerging market is currently slow or weak, we still remain very confident. There's a tremendous mid to long-term opportunity in these emerging markets, and this along with what we see as recovering demand in both the U.S. and in many European markets.","The second area we're focused on is product and brand innovation. We continue to accelerate our investments in the relevant technologies and innovative products, which benefit our end customers. This will ensure our future growth rate and margin expansion.","And third, and very importantly, we will continue to leverage and right-size our fixed cost structure with volume growth, which will lead to further margin expansion. So in summary our strategy remains on track. We will continue to deliver results, and enable us to overcome short-term environmental challenges as we are seeing today.","Turning to Slide 9, you can see that our business priorities for 2015 are fully in line with these growth and margin opportunities, and remain largely unchanged for the year. Our integration and activities in Europe and China will continue, and are on track. We have taken additional cost-based pricing, and very strong cost productivity actions around the globe. We do except our investments in new products and growth beyond the core to continue to drive both revenue growth, and margin expansion. And as a result, we expect to expand operating margins significantly during the second half of the year.","So at this point in time, I'll move on to our regional details, and I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone. Let me begin on Slide 11 by reviewing North America's performance in the first quarter, starting with the top line. Net sales of $2.3 billion for North America were up slightly compared to the prior year period, and up 2.1% excluding currency. This is now the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth.","Our first quarter ongoing business operating profit was $230 million, compared to $228 million in the first quarter of 2014. In summary, in an essentially flat market we delivered strong margins in the first quarter, which confirms that our product transition and availability issues are largely behind us.","Turning to Slide 12, our expectations for North America in 2015 remain unchanged. With major product transitions now largely behind us, we expect to leverage with launches and drive margin expansion. From a broader U.S. market perspective, we believe the industry is on track for a multiyear recovery, as evidenced by a recent increase in the existing home sales.","In the first quarter, the industry was up 1%, and we expect the full year industry to be up around 4%. 2015 did start out a little soft industry-wide, largely driven by destocking at several major retailers, a somewhat slow start to the housing markets, and what we believe to be a delay, not a reduction in the ramp up of consumer spending.","In Canada, specifically, where we have a significant currency issue we do expect that our recently announced cost-based price increases will help offset the margin impact of currency devaluation. As we speak, we are launching a new commercially inspired suite of KitchenAid appliances.","On Slide 13, you can see our award-winning five-door refrigerator that features storage for easy access for family favorites, five customizable temperature zones, and a platinum interior option.","I will now talk to the first quarter result for our Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, as shown in Slide 15. Sales were $1.3 billion, compared to $0.7 billion in the prior year. While a significant portion of its growth was driven by the integration, it is important to note that we had underlying growth in both the legacy Whirlpool and Indesit businesses. Ongoing operating profit was $35 million, with ongoing operating margin at 2.7% compared to $7 million, and 1% in the first quarter 2014.","During the first quarter, positive volume, ongoing cost productivity, price mix, and accelerated integration activities more than offset the significant unfavorable impact of currency and lower demand in Russia, delivering another quarter of expanded operating profit and margin.","As we look towards the full year 2015 on Slide 16, our integration activities remain firmly on track, and we continue to drive margin improvement in the region. For 2015, we expect the continuation of the Eurozone recovery, and industry to be flat to up 2% for the year. Demand continues to be strong in Western Europe, which is more than offsetting weaknesses we're seeing in Eastern Europe, most prominently in Russia, and the Ukraine. We have announced cost-based price increase in both Eastern European countries to offset the impacts of currency, and we are well positioned for growth and demand return.","In summary, we remain focused on accelerating integration activities, ongoing cost productivity programs, and growth throughout new product launches, both within and beyond the core.","On Slide 17, you can see our all-in-one countertop cook processor as an example of innovation outside of our core appliance categories. It is designed to simplify the lives of our consumers, functionality to prepare entire meals, and featuring six automatic cooking modes that guide consumers step-by-step for recipes for delicious culinary preparations.","Now, I would like to turn it over to Mike.","Mike Todman","Thanks, Marc. Let me begin with our Latin America results on Slide 19. Sales for the quarter were $899 million, down 24% from a very strong baseline in the same prior year period, primarily due to unfavorable currency and reduced demand in Brazil. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were down 11% from the prior year period. Our ongoing business operating profit for the quarter totaled $59 million, or 6.6% of sales, compared to $109 million and 9.2% in the prior year period, driven largely by the factors mentioned earlier.","On Slide 20, we want to provide additional detail on the macroeconomic picture in Brazil. Throughout the first quarter, the demand environment in Brazil weakened rapidly. Inflation, unemployment, and consumer confidence had a significant impact on demand, which was down 16% in the first quarter. While these macro changes are significant, it appears that the economic crisis has been initiated by the political crisis in the country, which is having a strong impact on consumer sentiment in the short-term. We continue to believe that Brazil's long-term attractiveness remains intact.","As shown on Slide 21, if you look at the last 14 years of GDP, Brazil has shown a strong capacity to rebound from downturns, and we believe that the country as a whole has a positive long-term outlook.","On Slide 22, we have taken strong and decisive actions to offset this rapid demand decline and currency impacts. We have executed and announced new cost-based price increases that become effective early in the second quarter. Additionally, we deployed strong actions to reduce our fixed cost, which included a significant workforce reduction, and production shutdowns to control our inventory levels.","It is important to note that while we have taken these strong actions we will not see their full impact until the second half of 2015, at which time we expect to deliver operating margins in line with our prior expectations. We have adjusted our 2015 industry guidance for Latin America to down 10% to 12%. In summary, we expect to expand margins in the second half, similar to our prior expectations, while we continue to operate in a more challenging environment in Brazil.","Turning to Slide 23, we launched a new Brastemp laundry product with an easy visibility glass lid in multiple color options that is designed for top performance in cleaning, bedding, and larger items.","Now, turning to our first quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 25; net sales of $378 million more than doubled from the prior period, primarily due to the integration. Consistent with our expectations we are on track with the integration process and have delivered ongoing operating profit of $26 million compared to $5 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margins were 6.9%, up significantly compared to the prior year period, behind continued strength in India, and our expanded China growth platform.","Turning to Slide 26, we continue to see favorable macro trends in India, and relatively neutral macro trends in China. Our industry guidance for Asia, as a whole, is up 1% to 3%. In summary, for 2015, we expect significant growth from our integration activities, continued strength in India, and as a result, strong margins from our larger growth platform.","On Slide 27, you can see our new entry-level refrigeration product for India. It features rapid cooling, and ice making technology, which has been well received by consumers. Now I would like to turn it over to Larry.","Larry Venturelli","Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone. Let me start with our first quarter results on Slides 29 and 30, and then I'll discuss guidance for the year. As Jeff mentioned, we had record net sales and ongoing operating profit during the quarter. Our revenues were $4.8 billion, compared to $4.4 billion last year, an 11% increase. The business performed well, given the rapid changes in global currencies and a weak demand environment in Brazil.","Currencies, which have weakened double digits versus the dollar year-over-year impacted our revenues by over $500 million, EBIT margins by just under 2 points, and earnings by approximately $0.85 per share. Despite significant currency headwinds, and a weaker-than-expected demand environment, the company delivered solid ongoing earnings of $2.14 per share, down slightly from the $2.20 last year.","The diversification of our regional profit contribution, and the combination of positive price and mix, cost and capacity reductions, productivity, and benefits from our acquisitions offset most of the headwinds we've discussed. You'll note that interest and sundry increased $30 million compared to the prior year, and this is primarily due to fluctuations in currency. Additionally, as shown on Slide 30, on a GAAP basis our effective tax rate for the first quarter was lower than our full year guidance, however the ongoing rate was 24%, and we expect our full year tax rate to between 22% and 25% for both GAAP and ongoing earnings.","Turning to Slide 31, relative to the guidance we provided in our last earnings call, we are revising ongoing business EPS guidance to $12 to $13. This will represent a 10% improvement in earnings compared to last year. Our expectations for 2015 free cash flow are now approximately $700 million.","On Slide 32, let me make some additional comments regarding the challenging macroeconomic environment, and actions we have taken to mitigate the impact. Our revenues year-over-year will be reduced by approximately $2.5 billion due to currency, and we are now expecting a $500 million year-over-year impact to EBIT, which is $150 million higher than our previous guidance. This includes transactional currency of approximately $330 million, which impacts our margins, and translational currency of $170 million. Additionally, we expect approximately a $100 million impact due to the recent weakened demand environment in Brazil.","Combined, these two factors lower our current earnings by approximately $2 per share, from our previous guidance. We view this earnings reduction as concentrated in the first half of this year. We expect to fully offset these headwinds, and return to the second half run rates we previously expected.","As Mike and Marc discussed, we have taken further accelerated actions through cost-based pricing, cost productivity, and integration synergies to mitigate these impacts. When combined with the actions we've previously communicated, we now expect to deliver $700 million in EBIT improvement on a year-over-year basis to offset these headwinds, and deliver 10% earnings improvement. We have demonstrated over the past few years that we can offset significant cost headwinds, and improve our margins in earnings.","On Slide 33, let me make some additional comments regarding regional operating margins and our earnings expectations. Given the fact that significant volatility in currency and demand have an immediate impact on our results, and the cost and pricing actions we're taking billed throughout the year, we would expect first half margins and earnings to be relatively flat with the prior year. We do expect strong second half margins and earnings, given the normal earning seasonality of our business and the benefits from actions we have taken.","As we previously discussed, the normal seasonality in our industry and demand environment drives a ramp up of both volume and productivity as we progress throughout the year. So, the second half is typically more positive than the first half.","In North America and Europe, we expect second half demand growth and the continued price mix benefit from prior year product transitions and our new product launches. Previously announced price increases as well as a ramp up in acquisition integration of synergies in Europe will also improve second half results. Both of these regions remain on track.","For Latin America with recently announced price increases, fixed cost reductions, second half product launches, and actions to lower inventories to current demand levels behind us, we expect to restore margins to our prior expectations in the second half. We expect that Brazil's demand weakness and currency impact to result in lower margin expectations for the region on a full year basis. Asia is on track, and we expect continued integration progress from our acquisitions in China as well as continued strong performance from India. In summary, we expect margins to accelerate in the second half as our previously announced cost-based pricing, ongoing cost productivity, and price mix benefits ramp up to more than offset the negative currency impact.","On Slide 34, you can see additional detail, and how we intend to deliver ongoing business EBIT margin expansion with a very balanced approach.","On Slide 35, you can see an update on the progress of our integration activities in Europe and Asia. We incurred 33 million in restructuring expense, and $30 million in benefit during the first quarter, which was consistent with our expectations.","For the full year, our acquisition and restructuring activities are on track, but we expect 300 million in expense, and 175 million in benefits consistent with our earlier guidance. Benefits will be more weighted towards the second half of the year. As we continue to grow revenues and improve margins, we have solid priorities to deploy the cash generated from our business as shown on Slide 36.","Recently, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend by 20%, reflecting our confidence in the continued strength of our ongoing business. In summary, given our profitable growth trends, increased investment capacity, and strong balance sheet, we continue to balance funding for all aspects of our business to ensure the best long-term value creation for our shareholders.","Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff Fettig","Thanks, Larry. Let me sum up by saying we certainly are addressing the short-term challenges we see throughout our business. But as I mentioned earlier, the priorities that we have for the business have not changed. We're focused on successfully integrating our European and Asia acquisitions, which are on track.","Additionally, we do expect revenue margin growth from our innovating new product launches that are in the market today. I feel good that we deployed very specific actions to address the current challenges, and position us well to expand margins in the second half of the year.","Our long-term growth strategy certainly remains on track, and we're making great progress towards this as we do continue to see multiple pass to profitable growth throughout our business. And we certainly haven't changed our mid to longer term value creation expectations. Overall, these growth plans do provide us with an outstanding opportunity to continue delivering significant shareholder value.","So with that, I'd like to conclude our formal remarks and open this up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we can take our first question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning everyone.","Jeff Fettig","Good morning, David.","Larry Venturelli","Good morning, David.","David MacGregor","I guess just to talk about Latin America for a second; that will certainly be a focal point today, but I wanted to see if you could address to the extent you can, the discrepancy between your competitors that announced 2% organic growth in Latin America this quarter, and your negative 11. And I realize you are up against a pretty tough call from a year ago, but can you help us understand that? Maybe was Embraco a factor there or maybe to the extent you can add some color, it would be helpful.","Mike Todman","Yes, David, it's Mike Todman. I'll talk about our business in Latin America and what we saw in the marketplace. And we saw a market that it was dramatically down, and significantly from where we thought it was going to be when we entered the year. And what we saw was that volatility, and really throughout the first quarter.","So what did we do? We took immediate action to lower our production levels to make sure that we were producing in line with kind of where the market demand was. What we also saw was that some of the trade partners had too much inventory, and so started to de-stock, so that had an impact on overall volumes. So I could only comment on kind of where our volume was, and what the impacts were. And those were largely the significant impacts for us.","Jeff Fettig","David, this is Jeff. I would add to that. As we've talked in the past, we subdivide our Latin America business into four elements. Our global compressor business, which I would say is on track. Obviously currency translation affects everything, but in terms of the fundamental business, it's on track. What we call our LAR [[ph] international appliance business, all of our appliance business in the 30 some odd countries outside of Brazil is off to a good start. Our extended expand categories within Brazil continue to grow very rapidly.","So the heart of our challenges really has to do with the core appliance business in Brazil. And there the issues -- Mike explained it very clearly, the market was down over 20%. We certainly have the currency, the valuation of almost over 40%, and then we still have the issue with inflation, which is relatively high in that country.","So I think we understand the dynamics of our business very well. A big part of our business is the core appliance business. That's what's under pressure right now. I feel good about the actions we're taking to get it. At least the margins stabilized. Demand is going to be whatever demand is. And we think that's a nearer term problem, but will be with us most of the year.","David MacGregor","Okay. Just a follow-up question would be with respect to the guidance of down 10 to 12 for the industry for the year, in the second quarter the comps starts to get decidedly easier here just as you're up against the World Cup from a year ago and then the Presidential Election in the second half. It just seems like you go from a very difficult comp situation 1Q to a much easier comp situation, hesitant to use the word \"Easier,\" but easier nonetheless over the balance of the year. And you took your guidance down substantially. Do you expect that still those procedure [ph] comps still have kind of a 10% challenge as the year goes on, or how does the cadence play out?","Mike Todman","Yes. David, it's Mike again. What we're seeing right now is still lower demand, even starting in the second quarter. So we expect demand even though those comps are a little bit easier to continue to be down in the second quarter. And then we see a relative improvement, although still negative, but down in the third and the fourth quarter. And that's exactly what we're experiencing. Remember, a lot of these comps and demand is based on consumer sentiment. And as we said, there are some issues in Brazil in the overall political environment, which are impacting, which won't necessarily resolve just in the short-term. So that's how we have come to the 12%. We still see second quarter being challenging, and slight improvement in the third and fourth quarter.","David MacGregor","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Megan McGrath with MKM Partners LLC. Please go ahead.","Megan McGrath","Good morning. Thanks. Obviously a lot of questions; just one of the moving parts here, could you just give us a sense for when we're watching things going forward as to when you lowered your guidance, what date you took the FX at? Things are moving pretty quickly, so just so we can sort of track going forward. Was it this week? Was it last week at the end of the quarter?","Jeff Fettig","Yes. Megan, obviously the currency has moved a lot. So we're using recent rates that we're seeing in the currency markets around the world. As we did during the last call, and as we've seen currencies move, we've taken actions to improve our business in specific areas like price increases and cost reduction because of the fact that currencies are relatively immediate. The benefits that we get from these actions will build over time, but essentially to answer your question, we used very -- the rates we're using are very consistent with what we've seen over the last -- in the very near term.","Megan McGrath","Okay, great. And then a follow-up on your guidance, could you give us an update on what you're assuming from commodities? Because we have seen still [ph] prices also continue to decline.","Larry Venturelli","Yes, I would say, Megan this is Larry. I would say, our guidance last time was about $50 million of deflation. We're seeing -- probably at current rates we're probably closer to 100 million, but I would say currencies especially in some of the emerging markets around the world obviously are having a negative impact and reducing the benefits of that. But certainly what we're seeing trend-wise material costs have been favorable. I would expect that the benefit from that will be more back-half weighted than first-half weighted.","Jeff Fettig","Megan, I would just add to that. You talked about the moving parts, if you really step back and look at our global business; we spoke the two negatives which are globally currency, but really a handful of currencies in particular. The Euro, the Reais, the Canadian dollar, and the Ruble are probably our four most impacted currencies. And they have moved significantly. In the other, we talked about demand, and the only place where we're largely different in demand that we thought is Brazil. Those are the two negatives.","On the positive side, we feel really good about the rate of integration that's going on to-date. That's very positive. The new product transitions that we had some challenges with in the last couple quarters is behind us, and now we actually have the benefits of having those in the marketplace. And for the full year, our ability both through our cost productivity, our synergies, and our integration benefits, our cost position will improve radically as we go throughout the year.","So as we look at it, it's really have we adjusted the business to the current range of currencies and demand, and I think the actions we've taken to-date are putting in place in the second quarter we have, and that's why we feel good about our ability to get our margin run rates at an accelerated level in the second half of the year.","Megan McGrath","Great, thank you. I'll let others get on. Thanks.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Sam Darkatsh","Good morning, Jeff, Larry, Marc, Mike. How are you?","Jeff Fettig","Hi, Sam.","Larry Venturelli","Hi, Sam.","Sam Darkatsh","A couple of quick questions; raising prices in Latin America in the face of demand deterioration, obviously there is some benefit to how appliances are sold from a pricing standpoint in the country, but how concerned are you about elasticity as demand perhaps making things more challenging for the consumer down there? That would be my first question.","Mike Todman","Okay, Sam. It's Mike. The reality is we've raised prices every time we need to, based on the inflation and the environment. And right now we're focused on expanding our margins, getting our margins back to the level that they need to be. The fact of the matter is there is a level of demand that stays [ph] there, and we're relatively confident in the demand outlook that we've given in that. Having our price increase won't have a material impact on that.","Jeff Fettig","Sam, I would add to that. If you look at our price increases, they're at or below the overall level of inflation, one. Two, we're taking just as harder [ph] actions on the cost productivity side, so ensuring that our business is competitive every day. And then the third thing is we don't believe in selling products at a loss, and so restoring the margins is critical in -- I think all the things going on in Brazil recently politically, et cetera has shaken consumer confidence. That has more of an impact than absolute pricing levels, particularly when you consider virtually everything in Brazil is bought on installments, and it's a cost per month. Therefore that's usually not the factor.","Sam Darkatsh","Next question, and I recognize this is patently unfair, because your visibility four months ago is going to be different than now, and I'm going to be asking you a question about four years from now, but regarding your 2018 expectations, you are expecting second half 2015 stabilization. Should we reset the base year lower now, and then assumes similar growth rates from there, or is that $22 to $24 goal still hold without making it a stretch goal?","Jeff Fettig","Sam, the way I'd answer that, everything we talked about at our Investor Day in our strategy remains intact. We have a different environment in a couple of dimensions right now. We do view this as -- certainly, we've been through ups and downs in Brazil demand before. And we think -- we still believe over the mid to long-term we're going to like the grow rate in Brazil. Currencies you adjust and we are adjusting very rapidly. So as you said, may be it wasn't clear enough, but there's nothing that has happened to date that would cause us or give us pause as to the targets that we outlined for investors, last December.","Sam Darkatsh","And final question, Larry, if you could help. Do you have the breakdown of the organic units' growth, or you change year-on-year in Euro and Asia?","Larry Venturelli","As Marc I think mentioned, our units, both the acquisition was up in units, and the base business is up in units. And then I think in the [indiscernible] side we're up slightly.","Sam Darkatsh","So, in line with the industry in both counts?","Jeff Fettig","At least in line or better.","Larry Venturelli","I would say Europe was better, China the same, yes.","Sam Darkatsh","Okay, thank you.","Larry Venturelli","You're welcome.","Operator","You can take our next question from Denise Chai with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Denise Chai","Okay, thank you. Could we get some more color on the $100 million benefit from raw materials? What commodities do you see benefiting you the most? And is it your expectation that you'll be able to keep all of this benefit, or that it will be partly computed [ph] away?","Jeff Fettig","Yes, Denise. I think the whole basket of commodities are -- have been stable to lower, whether it's -- again, it depends by market because, and again I don't want to get into complexity here, but currency outside U.S. dollar denominated is -- does have a negative impact. So for example, globally in U.S. dollars we've seen commodity prices go down. That does not mean they go down in local currencies. In fact, in Brazil, we have again that 40% evaluation we have a huge increase in local currencies, but at a macro level, globally steel is a little bit lower year-over-year, hydrocarbons are lower, therefore you see plastic prices, and although we hedge all the pure commodities, the commodity trend has being going down.","We are probably above that trend right now because of hedges, but over time it just smoothes it out. So a $100 million plus or minus is not a lot in the global business. I would just say this is the first time in absolute dollars that we might actually have lower raw material costs in over a decade. But on the other hand, we have a lot more than that in currency impacts as it relates to materials. So I don't see it as a big game changer either way, other than it won't be a drag against our productivity numbers this year.","Denise Chai","Okay, got it. And just a follow-on on that; can you give an update then on the North American competitive situation? I'm just wondering if the strong dollar would be encouraging more discounting by your foreign competitors. But I guess from what you are saying, but U.S. -- in local currency commodity cost has also gone up.","Marc Bitzer","Denise, it's Marc, and I'm trying to answer your question. First of all, on the cost base in North America. On the cost base in North America, yes it is true. We're starting to see raw material tailwinds. As you may recall, Q4 and we said that that would be the last quarter where we had headwinds, and now kind of it's slightly turned. So we have some modest benefit in the raw material, which we expect to build, and that added with cost productivity actions helps us improving our cost situation.","I presume your second question was relatively more to a promotion environment. As you know we're kind of -- we're a little bit somewhat concerned about the heightened level of promoting in Q4. I will take Q1 was what I would describe more back to normal levels.","Denise Chai","Okay, got it. Thank you. And just last one, you reduced your CapEx guidance. Are there any projects getting pushed out to 2016, or what's changed there?","Larry Venturelli","No, you shouldn't think that any changes -- I mean, just again, on currency in U.S. dollars we're going to have lower CapEx with the same projects.","Denise Chai","Okay, understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.","Ken Zener","Good morning, gentlemen.","Larry Venturelli","Good morning, Ken.","Marc Bitzer","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zener","Might have more than two questions for you; so when you guys talk about the first half '15, I believe you were talking about flat EBIT. Can you attribute how much of that would be to Brazil? If it's most of it, and then what is that 10% unit decline in Brazil relative to where you were kind of before in volume imply for LATAM margins sequentially. I think this -\u2013 the strength you're talking about in the second half specifically is related to LATAM. You guys had previously a 9% to 11% margin range. So I'm just trying to make sure we're all on the same page for 2Q sequential, which seems to be nine to 11 on the back-half.","Larry Venturelli","Yes, Ken, let me try to answer this a little bit differently. I think I understand what your question is, it's more half one versus half two related. We said we'd be relatively flat in the first half of the year, and we did a little under $5.00 a share in the first half of last year, so that'd imply we do over a $7.50 in the second half of this year. There's probably about five factors that you need to take into consideration, first just the normal seasonality in the business. Historically, results are high -- we have higher volume in margins in the second half than we do the first half. If you would go back and look at the last three years, that's probably about $1.50 a share.","We talk a lot about the acquisition synergies, those will be higher in the back half of the year. That will give you in order of magnitude probably $0.50. Net cost productivity, combination of the cost take out, material cost trends we're seeing will be better in the second half as I mention, and could get a dollar out of that. And then the enacted price increases and improved mix will be more weighted towards the second half based on actions we've taken. There will be a slight offset to that. When we just do the year-over-year currency, impact will be higher in the second half than it was in the first half. That's just that the business is larger, has higher volume in the second half. But that's really the bridge that gets you between the first half and the second half.","Jeff Fettig","And Ken, this is Jeff. I would add, you talk about Latin America, I mean the challenges that we saw in Q1, which is currency, which is lower demand, and I would add inflation that's been persistent. Also causes us to reduce our production schedules which will continue on into the second quarter. So you should expect the one part of the region in the world that's negative in terms of EBIT year-over-year, -- in Q1 it is Latin America, and in Q2 it will be Latin America. Everywhere else it is either modestly improving or improving a lot. And so what we're really seeing is that those trends that you saw in Q1 will be similar in Q2. But in Q3 onward, we expect our margins to albeit at a lower revenue level will expand significantly in Latin America. You'll see continued improvement with more cost productivity in North America -- well, in all parts of the world. And in the markets where we have, which are Europe and China, where we have integration activities, those too will ramp up. Q2 is going to look a lot like Q1, and you ought to see an acceleration because of those factors in Q3 and Q4.","Ken Zener","So I do, Larry, and Jeff, I do appreciate the details. I'm just still trying to I guess hone you in on that sequential margin. Because when you guys talk about a strong second half in LATAM last quarter you guys provided regional EBIT guidance which was very useful. And if you could update that I think everybody would appreciate that, but it seems\u2026","Larry Venturelli","I would say the goals that we talked -- Because we're not going to give quarterly guidance on regional EBIT, but I would say this though, the goals we articulate haven't changed. The one that has been the delayed is Latin America. And you saw we were at 6.6%, so we went down before we go back up, but in terms of where we want to get to, that has not changed. I would say everything else we expect to be tacking to those goals in second half of the year.","Ken Zener","Right, okay. Taking a different perspective, and given the majority of the regions are doing well as LATAM. Other companies have elected to use their balance sheet, so you guys have a free cash flow that you're talking about should improve overtime. Can you talk about your willingness to use your balance sheet to perhaps offset some of these currency headwinds, whether it be by buybacks, or what some of the constraints might be and you're thinking that way, whereas many other companies have elected to do that.","Larry Venturelli","Yes, Ken, look I think Mike mentioned the several actions that we've taken in Latin America to get our run rates back on track in the second half of the year, again, this is timing between half one and half two. We've \u2013- as a company if you look over the last several years, we continue to fund the business through capital spending. That's averaged 3.5% a year. We do have a targeted debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately one to one and a half times. You have to remember today is the highest debt to EBITDA that we've had over the last several years, and that's primarily due to the acquisitions that we took on last year, and we fully expect to be back to pre-acquisition metrics by the end of 2016. That has not changed.","We've also over the last several years repurchased over a billion dollars of stock. We've provided a dividend in the range of 25% to 30% of our earnings annually. I just mentioned, we just increased that, and then opportunistically we've taken advantage of M&A. I think all those actions combined have been reflected in the company's stock price. So we're deploying the operational actions that we can do to return the business and Latin America back to the margins that we previously expected. We will from time-to-time repurchase stock as well as balance the other opportunities we have. So our capital allocation decisions haven't changed. I think we're doing a very well-balanced approach to it.","Ken Zener","Thank you.","Jeff Fettig","Thank you.","Operator","We can take our next question from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Eric Bosshard","Thank you. The Europe margin performance in the quarter and the outlook through the year, it sounds like the incremental cost saves and synergies you're talking about, it sounds like you're affirming the 175 million, same number that you've been at, and so the two questions, one, how do you think about the progress of Europe margins 1Q relative to 4Q and how the margins should behave through the year. And then secondly, as you're generating cost saves, your confidence in netting those cost saves to the bottom line as we work our way through the year.","Marc Bitzer","And Eric, it's Marc. Let me try to answer your question. First of all, the previous full year margin which we gave as a guidance from regional perspective was 4% to 5% for Europe, and 2.7% in Q1. So to answer it in short, we're fully confident that we are within that margin range. You've got to bear in mind, first of all in Europe, the seasonality in Europe is probably stronger than in other regions. So the Q1 is typically -- and if you go back the last ten years I think nine of ten years it's by far the lowest margin quarter.","Two, as we previously indicated, a lot of the integration synergy is build throughout the year, so things which we -- and actions which we either took over or announced in Q1 that starts to build in terms of synergies throughout the year. So take the normal seasonality, add the typical synergy build up throughout the year, we're very confident that we are exactly within that margin range.","Eric Bosshard","And then within that, the second part of the question, the experience and -- again, I understand you're on the business for six months or so now, but the confidence that you have in netting the saves to the bottom line, I'll ask differently, how is the competitive environment there, the pricing environment, how do you feel and what are you observing within that? Is that any different now that you've combined the two businesses?","Larry Venturelli","Eric, on that point, I mean keep in mind the synergies are unique to us. So it's not industry-wide cost benefits. These are unique to us. So yes, we have a high degree of confidence that we can take them to the bottom line.","Jeff Fettig","And we've been pleased with the market, combined market or performances, they're running at or above the market in terms of volume. Our price mix is stable, and so we fully expect them to follow the bottom line.","Eric Bosshard","All right. And then if I could just follow-up on Latin America; two questions there. One what were your units in Brazil down relative to the market that sounds like was down 16 to 20 is the -- is the first question, and secondly, the inventory situation in Brazil, yours and the channel, did you exit the first quarterback at normal or is that progress expected to be made in 2Q?","Jeff Fettig","Yes, answer to the first question, Eric; we were slightly down more than the industry so we did loose a little bit of market share in the first quarter. But we felt a bit about where we were in the run rates. And the answer to the second quarter is we expect some continued inventory reduction in the second quarter. We think we will be more normalized as we get through the second quarter going into the second half.","Eric Bosshard","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks, good morning. First question, I was hoping to go back to Slide 32, where you quantify on a full year basis the currency and Brazil demand and the actions taken, and I wanted to try and look at that slide, if possible, thinking about it through just the incremental change from today versus three months ago when you gave your guidance originally. And so I believe you said earlier, Larry, that there is an incremental 150 negative impact between today and three months ago from the currency. I'd presume that Brazil demand environment worsening that 100 million is also fully incremental. And if you could just confirm that, and then on actions taken as you list the different categories there, what is just purely incremental versus three months ago? I know you talked a lot about cost-based price actions, but if you could kind of walk through the different buckets there?","Larry Venturelli","Yes. Michael, versus February when providing guidance, we made a $2 adjustment; $1.50 of that is strictly due to currency, primarily the Real and the Euro. And the balance is related to the Brazil economic environment. If you would go back and look at our expectations for the year from a price mix perspective, last time we said I believe we get about a point of price mix, now we are seeing a point to point and a half. We take that additional pricing since the last call in Brazil, Canada, and Eastern Europe. So that explains that. Cost and capacity reduction essentially remains unchanged from what we said for a full year basis. Ongoing cost productivity, material costs, we are seeing benefits from material costs versus last year about a point. But remember, we are taking out a lot of production to meet demand. So we are still saying we will get at least a point there.","Marketing and technology is essentially the same. And the big mover, as I mentioned before was currency. Now we are seeing -- I think we said 1 to 1.5 times last time, and now we are seeing 1.5 to 2 times.","Michael Rehaut","So I guess taking it in another way, with essentially your expectation that second half is unchanged from previous expectation, does that effectively -- in kind of reference to an earlier question, if you expect all these actions to come in fully, and get you back to your prior 2H '15 expectations, it would seem then that excluding any incremental, again, currency or demand type shocks that would kind of get you back on track for those longer term expectations, is that fair to say?","Larry Venturelli","That's fair to say, especially the action we have taken in the first quarter and what we are doing here in the second quarter positions us well to get back on the run rates for the second half of the year than we expected originally.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. And just lastly on this topic, it seems like most of the offsetting actions are the additional pricing initiatives, but there is also little bit of cost out in Brazil as well. To offset that impact, is it really kind of like two-thirds additional cost-based pricing and one-third cost reductions, or how to think about that mix?","Jeff Fettig","Yes, Michael, I would say we are pushing hard on both, but I mean the bigger factor is price. But I would say we are redoubling our efforts on cost productivity in places like -- well, really everywhere, but particularly places like Brazil, including significant structural changes. We are not going to wait for the demand environment to get better, although we believe it will. We are reducing fixed costs, headcount, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, very, very aggressively, because we learned from being in the Brazilian market for 70 years that the faster you adjust to the new environment, the better position you are even in recovery, and that's what we are doing.","Michael Rehaut","All right. And just to make sure also the acquisition, synergies and the acquisition contributions expected this year, that has not changed at all, in other words there is no acceleration in any of those synergies or benefits?","Marc Bitzer","Hey, Michael, it's Marc. Let me try to answer this for the European part of the acquisition. The acquisition as I said before is firmly on track. Actually if you would peel back and look in Euro-denominated synergies, we're even ahead of our original scheduling timeline. But of course because of Euro\/dollar translation you lose some of that, okay. Net-net even dollars are synergies and synergy expectations are fully on track. It's a complicated and complex undertaking, but we are fully in control and on track.","Larry Venturelli","And Michael, I would say that in Asia, this China integration we're fully on track with the expectations that we gave at the beginning of the year.","Michael Rehaut","Great, thank you.","Marc Bitzer","Thank you.","Larry Venturelli","Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Jay McCanless with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Jay McCanless","Good morning, everyone. First question I had, when you look at the $12 to $13 on ongoing EPS guidance, can you discuss what type of interest rate environment you factored into that guidance, and also what type of currency impact you factored into it?","Larry Venturelli","Yes, Jay, from an interest rate perspective, we are largely -- our portfolio right now is fixed. We have a small maturity in May. So I would say that what you're seeing from our run rate in Q1 should be fairly close and indicative of what you will see for the full year. As I mentioned before, from a currency perspective, the way we set our guidance is recent rates that we've experienced in the key markets; Euro, Real, Canadian dollar, Russian currency. So hopefully that answers your question.","Jay McCanless","Okay. The second question I had, if you exclude the one-time gain from the curtailment, it looks like SG&A deleveraged by about 100 bips year-over-year, is that how we should expect deleverage going forward to the rest of the year?","Larry Venturelli","Yes. We did have a curtailment gain, first one that was not in our ongoing results, and that is in our GAAP results. The majority of that would have hit in the gross margin line. But from an SG&A perspective, apples-to-apples, if you adjust out pension settlements, acquisition-related transition expenses, this year and last year we were really around 9.8% run rate compared to what we're reporting today about 10.3.","Jay McCanless","Okay, great. Thank you.","Larry Venturelli","Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's Q&A session. I'll now turn the program back over to Mr. Jeff Fettig for closing remarks.","Jeff Fettig","Well, again, thank you all for joining today. We appreciate your questions, and we look forward to talking to you next time. Thank you again.","Operator","And this does conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. And have a great day."],"22791":["Whirlpool Corp. (NYSE:WHR) Q3 2016 Earnings Call October 25, 2016 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Chris Conley - Whirlpool Corp.","Jeff M.

LLC","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Call. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the conference over to the Senior Director of Investor Relations, Chris Conley. Please go ahead, sir.","Chris Conley - Whirlpool Corp.","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation Third Quarter 2016 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Marc Bitzer, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with a presentation available on the Investor section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on slide one of the presentation.","Turning to slide two, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on our Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions in the first round and time permitting, we will address any follow-up questions after everyone has had a turn.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you saw on our press release this morning our operational execution offset some significant external challenges that we saw in the quarter. But we did deliver record results for the third quarter. During the quarter currency continued to be volatile and negative, and we saw some softness in the appliance demand, most prominently in the UK and the U.S. Despite this volatility we were able to deliver record results and year-to-date our earnings have increased by 18%.","In North America and Latin America, we expanded margins while gaining market share which was done by leveraging our leading brands, launching innovative new products and delivering strong ongoing cost productivity. And finally, consistent with our balanced capital allocation approach we repurchased $100 million of our common stock during the quarter. Overall, the fundamentals of our business remain strong and we continue to adapt our operating plans in order to deliver strong results.","I'll now turn to slide five where you see our third quarter results. Our revenues ex-currency increased slightly. Our ongoing business earnings grew to a record $3.66 a share and this came through a combination of acquisition synergies, unit volume growth, and ongoing cost productivities. And we improved our free cash flow for the year.","Turning to slide six we have an update on the external environment and some of the challenges that we're facing and offsetting. We have seen what we believe is a temporary softness in industry demand in U.S. particularly you saw it early in the quarter in July and August with some rebound in September. We believe this is due to consumer confidence weakening primarily due to the focus around the U.S. elections. In addition, the promotional environment in the U.S. has elevated during the quarter, especially in the washing machine category.","There, certain import competitors continue to unlawfully dump product and we're responding with continued investment in our strong brands, launching new, innovative products as well as our fair-trade actions. For the year in Europe our integration is on track and we're delivering cost synergies in line with our plans and our previously-discussed margin recovery actions in Europe are progressing and we do expect to see the positive impact of these actions over the next couple of quarters, somewhat later than we originally thought because we continue to see currency and demand volatility particularly in the UK market. Overall we expect to deliver a record performance this year with approximately 15% ongoing EPS growth over a half a point of ongoing EBIT margin improvement and good improvement in free cash flow.","On slide seven, we've updated our 2016 guidance to reflect these changes. We now expect to deliver ongoing earnings of $14 to $14.25 a share and to generate approximately $700 million in free cash flow.","Turning to slide eight we show our balanced capital allocation approach which has not changed. We continue to appropriately fund our business and expect to invest between $650 million and $700 million in capital this year. As I mentioned we did repurchase $100 million in share repurchases during the third quarter and we do intend to continue repurchasing stock in the fourth quarter. So in total we remain committed to delivering our long-term value-creation objectives through our operational execution and a balanced approach to capital allocation.","So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 10 we will review our performance in North America. Net sales increased 2% versus prior year and grew 3% excluding currency and we expanded our ongoing operating margins to a third quarter record of 12.1%. Our operating margins were driven by strong ongoing cost productivity programs and unit volume growth which more than offset approximately $25 million in unfavorable currency impact in Canada and Mexico.","During the quarter we gained over a point of market share versus the prior year as consumer demand for our brands and products have continued to be strong. As demonstrated by our performance we remain focused on driving both revenue growth and margin expansion.","Turning to slide 11. I will discuss some external factors affecting our North America region. As Jeff outlined earlier we have seen a temporary slowdown in U.S. supply and industry demand since our last call. We are confident that this dip in consumer discretionary purchases is temporary as consumer confidence has been impacted by the upcoming U.S. election. We increasingly see solid consumer demand for our strong brands and new products, and expect to continue generating profitable market share gains. However, we have seen an increase in promotional activity in U.S. especially on washers which corresponds with significant inventory stockpiling by certain competitors at the end of the second quarter who we believe are continuing to unlawfully dump products.","This higher promotional intensity had a significant negative impact on our washer margins in the third quarter. We continue to pursue our fair trade case for washers manufactured in China and anticipate a final ruling in early 2017.","Additionally, we have recently announced cost-based price increases primarily on washers to allow us to recover the cost of our investments in new and compelling products. We expect that these actions along with focus on value-creating promotions and strong productivity programs will offset negative margin impacts from continued dumping by certain competitors. We fully expect to deliver strong results in fourth quarter and remain on track to achieve our long-term goals.","Turning to slide 12, we discuss key drivers of the U.S. appliance industry. The fundamentals underpinning U.S. supply and demand are healthy. During recent periods we have seen steady growth in key macro indicators including housing starts in both new and existing home sales, as well as improvements to other relevant indicators such as consumer sentiment and unemployment. While some of the individual monthly data is volatile, the trends overwhelmingly demonstrate strong demand for housing, increasing levels of employment, real wage growth and long-term improvement in consumer sentiment.","We've seen 15 consecutive quarters of appliance industry growth in U.S. and all of these underlying macro trends support continued growth to the U.S. appliance industry in the coming years. As such, we believe that the current industry slowdown is a temporary shift consistent with what we're seeing in the retail environment for household goods and we remain confident that the multiyear cycle of U.S. demand growth will continue in 2017 and beyond.","Turning to slide 13, we outline our 2016 operational expectations for the North America region. We now expect the industry to grow 3% to 4% for the full year. Through the end of the third quarter the industry is up a little over 3.5%. We continue to expect to grow at or above industry rate with targeted investment in our strong brands and new products as we have done consistently throughout the year. We continue to execute strong cost productivity programs and we remain focused on achieving growth in our adjacent businesses. We now expect to deliver 11.5% to 12% margin in 2016, an increase over the prior year.","Beginning on slide 14 we will review the third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. Sales were $1.3 billion, down 9% versus prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were down 6% as we saw demand softness in certain key countries particularly in the UK. Ongoing operating margins were 3.7%. Our margins were negatively affected by approximately $40 million in unfavorable impact in our UK business from a devaluing British pound and softening demand environment.","Turning to slide 15, we provide an update to our previously-deployed actions in Europe. The integration of Indesit continues to be on track and we fully expect to deliver planned cost synergies in the fourth quarter and into 2017. Consistent with what we've seen since the Brexit decision, currency continues to be a headwind and demand in the UK remained soft, causing our previously-announced cost base price increase to be implemented slower than anticipated. Our platform integration manufacturing transitions remain on track. However, we reduced manufacturing volumes in response to this lower demand, most of which occurred in the third quarter and we now expect roughly half a point margin impact for the full year. As a result, our margin expansion in Europe is slightly delayed. In summary, we believe we have the right actions in place to manage through volatility and deliver our long-term goals.","On slide 16, our 2016 priorities for the European, Middle East and Africa region remain largely unchanged, with a continued focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity and growth from adjacent businesses. Similar to the third quarter, we plan to manage inventory levels as we continue product and brand transitions in the fourth quarter. Our industry guidance remains flat to up 2% for the full year. We now expect to deliver 4.5% to 5% operating margin for the full year and remain confident in our long-term margin guidance of 8%.","I will now discuss our Latin America results on slide 17. Sales for the quarter were $800 million, an increase of 7%; excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 2%. Our third quarter operating profit totaled $45 million and margin increased 150 basis points versus the prior year. Despite operating in a challenging demand environment, we expanded margins and delivered strong revenue growth through continued investments in our brands and products. We gained significant market share while also improving price mix in Brazil and we continue to benefit from substantial fixed cost reduction actions which we began implementing last year.","On slide 18, our priorities in Latin America have not changed. We remain well prepared to manage through volatility as we've done consistently over the past several quarters through cost productivity, significant market share gains, and positive price mix. For a couple quarters now we've been monitoring the difference between sell-in and sell-out volumes in Brazilian markets. At this time, because we've seen our trade customers build some inventory, we are expecting an inventory correction in the fourth quarter, and as a result we now expect the Brazil industry to be down 10% to 12% for the full year. We now expect to deliver 6.5% to 7% operating margins for the full year.","Now we turn to our third quarter results for the Asia region, which are shown on slide 19. Net sales were $338 million versus $346 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 2%. Our ongoing operating profit was $17 million compared to $27 million in the prior-year period. Ongoing operating margins were 4.9% as continued demand softness and price mix challenges in China more than offset continued record performance in India.","Turning to slide 20, you will see our 2016 priorities for Asia. We are focused on marketplace investment, on our core product offerings, driving stronger mix. The brand transition from Sanyo to Whirlpool is progressing and we are now focused on increasing awareness of the Whirlpool brand. As a result of these actions, we're confident in our ability to deliver our long-term margin goals in the Asia region.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim Peters.","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we delivered another quarter of record results despite operating in a challenging external environment.","Turning to our third quarter results on slide 22, net sales were $5.2 billion. We achieved record ongoing earnings of $3.66 per share primarily driven by strong delivery of acquisition synergies, unit volume growth, and ongoing cost productivity programs. Currency had a top line impact of approximately $40 million and reduced EBIT margins by approximately one point.","Some currencies have strengthened against the U.S. dollar most notably in Canada and Brazil however, we are hedged at rates more reflective of last year's environment and as such we are not seeing the full benefit of those currencies strengthening in our operating margins. Our third quarter tax rate was driven by the timing of tax settlements and planning activities and we now expect a 19% tax rate for the full year. Overall we are pleased with our results through the first three quarters of 2016 and are on track to deliver strong full-year results.","On slide 23 we provide an update on the progress of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities. Through the third quarter we have incurred restructuring expenses of $116 million and delivered $165 million in benefits. We continue to expect $200 million in expense and $200 million in benefits for the full year which is ahead of plan.","I will now discuss our expectations for full year EBIT margin expansion on slide 24. As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, we have seen elevated promotional activity in the U.S. since our last call as well as delayed benefits of our previously-announced, cost-based price increases in the UK. Both had a negative impact on our price mix which we now expect to be flat to slightly negative for the year. We are also slightly reducing our ongoing cost productivity due to the impact of softer global demand on production levels. As a result of these changes we now expect to deliver approximately 7.5% EBIT margin for the full year, more than half a point expansion over the prior year.","On slide 25 we share some details of our free cash flow results and capital allocation actions through the third quarter. Our free cash flow improved versus prior year, primarily due to improved earnings. We expect full year free cash flow of $700 million which is inclusive of $150 million of restructuring cash outlays and $155 million associated with legacy product warranty actions in EMEA. Consistent with our strategy we continue to execute a balanced approach to capital allocation by funding the capital needs of our business and returning cash to our shareholders. We have executed $425 million in share repurchases year-to-date and we plan to buyback additional shares in the fourth quarter, consistent with our prior statements.","Turning to slide 26. We are adjusting our full-year guidance as discussed earlier. We are confident in our operational plans and expect to deliver up to 15% growth in ongoing earnings per share and approximately $700 million in free cash flow in 2016.","Now I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Thanks, Jim. Turning to slide 20, I'd like to summarize our discussion today. We have deployed strong actions to offset the operating challenges we faced in the third quarter. We do expect to deliver another record year including about a 15% EPS growth and strong free cash flow.","On slide 29 you'll see our long-term value creation strategy which remains unchanged. We are committed to being the best global branded consumer products company in the world. We believe our ability to generate earnings growth and free cash flow is very strong. We have the leading market positions in three of the four regions out of the world, a very strong platform for our continued growth and our brands are very well-established and reach over 90% of the appliance consumers globally. So we are confident that our strategy will continue to deliver significant value.","Finally, on slide 30 I want to make a few comments on our 2016 operating performance and over a longer period of time. Over the last five years we have delivered record results including \u2013 counting 2016 with over 20% annualized earnings EPS growth, despite what I would describe as challenging external environment. And in the last two years we've absorbed over $6 per share impact from global currencies weakening against U.S. dollar in a very unprecedented manner. Additionally, we've seen significant demand declines in our major emerging markets which are Brazil, Russia and China. This had a $2 impact per share over the last two years.","But within this environment we were able to grow our earnings by 10% in 2015 and we expect to grow them additionally by 15% this year, and all the while driving strong free cash flow. We've used that cash to reinvest in our business, increase our dividend, pay down debt, and buyback nearly $700 million in stock.","Today managing through economic volatility is the new normal and it's part of our everyday operating management system. We believe that we continue to demonstrate our ability to navigate through those challenges and because of that we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage our business in this type of environment. So in total, we believe we have significant opportunities to continue creating shareholder value going forward.","So with that, I'm going to end our formal remarks and we'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Megan McGrath with MKM Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first a little bit of a practical question on the U.S. market. In relation to the washers business, and you indicated, pardon me, that you're going to \u2013 you've started cost-based price increases. But you've dealt with this before in the past in terms of this dumping behavior. How, from a practical perspective, do you implement price increases in an environment where your competitors are lowering their prices aggressively?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Megan, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me try to answer it \u2013 first of all, let me, first talk about what happened in Q3 in washers and what we're going to do about it going forward. First of all, in Q3 as we indicated in our remarks, we saw an increased promotional intensity in particular in washers. I would say all the other categories have promotion intensity, but nothing earth shattering or surprising from our perspective. In washers it was more intense, to some extent we were not completely surprised because we saw certain competitors stockpiling a lot of inventory at the end of Q2, and I think, we made a remark on that during the last earnings call. The negative impact on us is kind of twofold if you want to say so.","One, because obviously we cannot and will not participate in certain value-destructing promotions, so of course you lose the volume and thus the leverage on your overall production. Two is a mix element because if you basically have a high end of your range by certain competitors' pulldown very much, you lose a lot of mix. To be more specific, take a typical front load washer, we have a line structure anywhere from $399 or $499, to $999 \u2013 not $399, $499 to $999. If certain competitors bring that down to $599 or even below, it's hard to build a line structure and therefore you lose mix. So we had a twofold negative impact on our business. What we're going to do about it apart from continue to invest in new product and innovation, which we are announcing to the market, is to yes we have announced certain price increases because we felt that certain price levels just do not reflect the cost investments which we've put behind the product. These price effects are \u2013 cost-based price increases are in effect for January 1.","Thirdly, as Jeff also indicated, we are continuing to pursue the antidumping lawsuits. We remain confident in our ability to win on this one. So, I think, the combination of all these three elements make us believe that we can fully restore our margins in the washer business.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks. And could you talk a little bit more, your units actually were up nicely in the quarter in North America, so it does look like overall you might have gained share. It sounds like it wasn't in washers. I'm not sure if there was some growth outside the U.S. Could you talk us through your unit growth a little bit in the quarter?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah. Megan, it's Marc again. First of all, let me also remind everybody on the call that our unit growth is not exactly reflective of T6 or T7 AM industry numbers. We've said that several times before. So already on \u2013 call it the outside of the T6 or T7 volume, yes, we saw decent growth or solid growth in Canada, Mexico and also in our KitchenAid SDA business which had an above average unit growth, slightly negatively impacted our ASV's but overall helps our margins. If you peel back the onion and you go back to T6 or T7 units, yes, we saw solid growth in refrigeration, in dishwasher, and also in our kitchen business, the cooking business, but of course in particular in the washer segment our market share progress was not satisfying.","Operator","Thank you. Next we'll move to Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, Jeff, Marc, Jim. How are you?","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Good, Sam.","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Good.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Morning, Sam.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","A couple of questions if I could. Jim, could you help us with the earnings sensitivity of the pound, knowing that it weakened after the quarter? And then talk about, based on the fact that you're seeing maybe increasingly weak demand in the UK, your ability to offset that sort of pressure next year with subsequent price increases?","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah, Sam. And to begin with as I talked about in the script earlier, in that, with the pound right now while we are seeing some weakness to it we still are hedged within the UK, and so we'll continue to see ongoing weakness in the UK. But as Marc talked about earlier our price increases are now beginning \u2013 our previously announced price increases are beginning to take hold. And so I would say that as you look into Q4 we still will have an impact, a deteriorating impact to the pound, but it will begin to more be offset by the price increases at that point.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Sam, it's Marc. Let me maybe also give a little bit more context and color on this one. As we indicated in earlier calls our UK business at the time of the acquisition was roughly about $1 billion. So, it's a very significant business where we have historically a strong market position and a strong above-average operating margin. If you just look at the pure currency, now Q3 over Q3 last year you basically have roughly 22% decline, so it's been massive. To Jim's earlier point, it has been a little bit moderated because of some hedging programs, but it's still going to \u2013 it's massive.","You also need to keep in mind that about 85% to \u2013 yeah, roughly 85% of the product which we sell in the UK are imported, or in other words produced on a euro base, so we basically have a full cost base impact on this one. So it's significant. The $40 million impact which I referred to in the script is related to one, obviously the margin loss because of the high cost-base. And two, we implemented a price increase in September. We started to implement it, and yes, we saw significant volume reduction in the month of September. The combination of these two things were roughly $40 million.","So it's \u2013 by definition, it's a massive impact on our operating results in Europe in Q3. To your question about the price increases and the progress, we had a small price increase in July, where we frankly had a hard time getting full traction, we had a number one September where we've seen the traction on the invoices, but yes, we still have a drag on the volume. And we expect that drag to also be there through Q4 even though at a slightly lower level.","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","And again to Marc's point, probably over 95% of all the products sold in the UK are imported, so our view is that the pricing is critical for us to get our margins back, and I think others will have to decide what they're going to do.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","In isolation, what's the EPS impact of just the pound for 2017, of where we are right now? Just trying to get a sense of that.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","We said in third quarter again without \u2013 where you had the impact of the pound and you had the impact of lower demand, cost us basically $40 million, which is roughly $0.40 a share. So it was really big for a quarter. But going forward, two things. One is the rate that we get our price increase, which we said it would take at least a couple of quarters for us to work this through our system. And to Jim's point, we have our normal hedging process in place which will smooth out some of the volatility, but we haven't felt the whole impact due to that.","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah. And, Sam, in our guidance where we talked about a 1-point impact due to currency throughout the year, what we've seen is the weakening of the pound but the strengthening of some other currencies that have offset each other. So we still feel that that is accurate for our full basket of currencies for this year.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Last question before I defer to others, the cash flow guidance was lowered more so at least by my math than the EPS guidance. Are you drawing down inventories outside \u2013 I think you mentioned EMEA, you're drawing down inventories, but where should we anticipate inventories by year-end based on current plans?","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","I think if you look at our guidance; again, our free cash flow guidance is more just reflective of the lower earnings. So being at the lower end of our earnings, we went to the lower end of our free cash flow guidance. Again, inventories we think will be relatively consistent year-over-year, so I don't think you're going to see a big change there. They will come down significantly in the fourth quarter as we talked about and Marc talked about with some of the actions that we are taking.","Operator","Great. Thank you. Next we'll move to our Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Hi, Bob.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Hi, guys, and maybe it's for Jeff. Just start big picture, 2018 you guys have talked about earning $20 to $22 per share and today you were taking down your margin targets for this year or for the full year, and you also reduced cash flow guidance. Is this kind of a temporary adjustment to the macro environment soft patch in the U.S. and the UK? Or do you feel that current trends will make it a lot more difficult to get to your long-term EPS targets?","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Bob, again, it really relates to the time it takes us for recovery, as we talked about here. But nothing fundamentally has changed about what I would call our long-term strategic drivers of our earnings and free cash flow potential. So, the goals we have out there are $23 billion to $24 billion, 9% to 10% EBIT, 5% to 6% free cash flow which would equate roughly to $20 to $22 a share, we still think our global operating model certainly has the capability of delivering that.","What we're dealing with right now, as you saw, is we're dealing with some fairly substantial external shocks that we have taken actions for, and some things like as Marc mentioned the demand in the U.S., we think will right itself in the coming months. The UK is going to take longer and we've got to see the effect of this elevated promotional scheme in the U.S. So having said all that, I would say that the goals we feel good about. We're assessing the timing of those goals given where we are at this very moment. In our January call, as we normally do, we'll give our 2017 guidance and provide you with a very thorough update on our long-range goals.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. And thanks for giving me a little comfort around those long-term targets. And maybe you could just drill down, if you try to segregate North America, what part of the headwind was just from increased promotional activity? And what part was due to general consumer weakness? It does seem like the consumer is freaked out a little bit around the election. Do you think that's a transitory thing? And since the end of the quarter, just looking at your shipments do you feel the consumer is back in action and this is really just a lull in demand that will self-correct? Or is this something more like a change in the trajectory of what you anticipated?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Hey, Bob. It's Marc. Let me just try to take it. First of all, in Q3 we still expanded margins in North America, so we moved from 12.0% to 12.1%. Having said that, it's obvious that a stronger environment and less promotion pressure our margin expansion would have been significantly different. That's very obvious.","So to your first question about the consumer demand, to some extent it's, of course, a little bit speculative answer, but we do see consumer span of attention right now shifting towards other topics and discretionary demand and ultimately, yes, we see what we think is a temporary softness of consumer confidence.","As you know, in our product in particular discretionary demand is largely driven by consumer confidence. Will that improve and recover after November 8? Probably not immediately, not the next day, but over time we expect to do so. If you also look at the fundamentals and that what we've included in the presentation, the script, the fundamentals of the housing market are 100% intact. You can look at it from whatever angle, we just don't see a slowdown of a cycle. So in the broader scheme of things, we see the consumer sentiment right now being of a very temporary nature and we do see a full recovery in 2017.","Operator","Thank you. Next we'll move to Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Morning, gentlemen.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Morning, Ken.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Morning.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So a lot of different pieces moving here. I wonder if I could focus Europe on the margin reduction from the second quarter, roughly 100 bps times your sales would imply closer to a $50 million EBIT headwind or $0.50. And in the U.S. your 50 bps margin reduction on that revenue base is roughly at $50 million EBIT, yet you didn't fully take down earnings as much as that margin reduction times sales would imply. First question, not to be too positive here, but what is the offset to that margin times sales, which is a drag? Because it seems in your margin guidance you're actually getting a little less productivity.","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","If you look at our overall EPS guidance in that, and again it didn't come down at the same level, you did see as I highlighted earlier, a slightly better tax rate than we had before and that is compensating for some of the earnings offset there. Again, I think that's probably the biggest driver of the offset.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","And the only other thing, Ken, is obviously with the changes that we're dealing with, we really have a strong handle on fixed costs and so on, so we've also probably reduced some corporate overhead costs, but tax and corporate overhead are basically the offsets to that.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Appreciate it, guys. Now just to get into the operational component, for the European 100 bps, can you isolate that relative to the \u2013 how much is this pound versus core market or your execution? And obviously there's price lags, but how much of that reduction is associated with the pound?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Hey, Ken. It's Marc Bitzer. First of all, coming back because you mentioned there's a lot of moving pieces. There are exactly three moving pieces which we referred to: we had a temporary slowdown in U.S. demand, we had a promotional environment in washers, and the Brexit-related impact. We don't have any other issues going on; these three. By definition, some of that drag we expect also in Q4 even to a less extent. So we do see a slight recovery of U.S. demand in Q4, not as bad as in Q3. The promotional environment in U.S. it's probably going to last in Q4 but not beyond. The U.K. will be less but still somewhat impact in Q4, so that's from a macro level.","Now specifically to Europe, when you basically take the $40 million which I referred to earlier Brexit related, that is the entire or almost more than entire year-over-year drop, or in other words, we continue to make excellent progress on the cost take-out related to integration and the synergies, but it's been entirely offset by the impact which we had in the UK, and that's obviously been very impactful. Whether that be also impacted in Q4? Yes, but to a lesser extent.","Operator","Great. Thank you. Next we'll move to Denise Chai with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. So just picking up on what you were saying just now, Marc, you said that the promotional environment in the U.S. would last through the fourth quarter but not beyond. Can you comment on how washing machine inventories look at this point? Is there still an overhang heading into the fourth quarter? Or what gives you confidence that we'll see the promotional environment improve?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Denise, it's Marc. Particularly on the question of inventory, there's two aspects which we need to look at. One is what is the likely inventory level of certain competitors? We knew coming into the quarter there has been a massive stockpiling coming in...","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","And that was evidenced by the Department of Commerce findings.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah. So we do think but we don't have certainty that the large amount of that inventory has been literally burned through now. So there will still be some old inventory overhang into Q4. Now the other side of the equation is trade inventories. We do believe that the trade inventory was slightly low coming into Q4 or at the level ending Q3. So it's not a massive impact, but we would expect, at least from our perspective, the trade inventories on Whirlpool brand, the Whirlpool Corporation brand of products to be 100,000 units to 150,000 units below where it would have been last year.","Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks. And I know that your Q is going to be out later this afternoon, but could you talk a little bit about just directionally how gross margin was in each market and also if there was anything unusual in SG&A this quarter that we should be aware of?","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","So if you look at gross margin across the globe, what you'll see is it's relatively flat compared to prior year, and it's in line with their where our operating profit is. And so even if you break it down by the various regions, what you're going to see is that the change in gross margin is very similar to what you see in the change in operating profit today. So without going through the individual ones that's what you'll see, and I think Marc has already talked about the drivers.","Operator","Great. Thank you. Next we'll move to David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. Good morning, everyone.","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Good morning, Dave.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Just first question, I've got a couple questions for you, first is just on raw materials and if we saw some inflation this quarter, and how we should think about raw material cost inflation for 4Q?","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Dave, this is Jeff. No, actually I think, as we progress through the year through contracts or hedging or whatever, we're pretty stable in terms of the improvements that we saw for the full year in raw materials. So I wouldn't say there's any material change. There will be less, as we indicated I think in the last call, that the second half although improving, because we're going against the year-ago base will be less of an improvement versus last year, but it will still be positive. And then looking forward, there's a lot of moving parts, but I don't see anything in the environment that's extraordinarily unusual at this point in time. We're pretty locked in for 2016. We're still working on 2017, which we'll talk about in January, but for now I'd say it's stable.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. The second question I guess the situation this quarter frames up the challenges you faced in trying to defend or gain share in a competitive space. I guess my question is, how are you thinking these days about the possibility of substantially increasing your investment in innovation and also driving productivity on the current level of investment by holding your new product development organization accountable for a higher hit rate?","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah. Well, we are investing very strongly for innovation. I think we've never been in a better spot in terms of the rate of innovation that we're bringing to marketplace. This is a globally competitive business. Productivity is always strongly part of our global operating system, and when there's opportunities to see raw material costs, new product (40:06) and so on, we can deliver very strong productivity as we are right now.","Now, having said that, we've seen, and as you mentioned certain competitors who, in our case, in the case of washing, we believe strongly are dumping imports in the U.S. market and that's why we also are using our global trade mechanisms to try to address this situation. But you should expect more innovation from us, you should expect ongoing productivity from us, and again, as I said before, we believe in earning market share, not buying market share.","Operator","Great. Thank you. Next we'll move to Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Neil (40:57) on for Mike. I appreciate the discussion around price increases and recent promotional activity, but maybe you could add a bit more color on how you see the elasticity trending, so that's both in the consumer and retail channels. So it's obviously early to talk about 2017 raw materials, but how do you think the market could receive those higher prices?","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","We've talked about this in the past. At the current prices, we're talking about there's no elasticity. The consumers are in the marketplace probably every 10 years for a product, the reference points is whatever they happen to look at this week online. They have a budget, and whether it's a $399 washer or $1,499 washer, we offer models at every price point. So, again, I don't really believe in the case of the U.S. it has any impact at the levels that we're talking about on demand.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","It's Marc. Just to clarify what Jeff was referring to. There is no price elasticity on U.S. industry demand perspective, i.e. you come down on prices, it doesn't change anything on our 2016 or 2017 industry guidance. There is, however, a short-term impact if somebody else promotes a front-load washer at $499, while our range starts at $699. Of course, you feel that and that is what we referred to.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess there have been some misconceptions around Haier-GE. Do you see the industry a little more competitive with GE's business under Haier ownership or is it more of a continuation of being a strong competitor?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","It's Marc. So, first of all, it's obviously hard for us to comment on any competitor, because we don't talk to them. In simple terms, first of all, you've got to bear in mind the integration is still fairly fresh and so it's been just one or slightly more than a quarter behind it. And so far I don't see any different behavior. GE has been a very tough competitor, and I think they will continue to be that. So we don't see a massive change in their behavior contrary to what sometimes has been speculated about.","Operator","Thank you. Next we'll move to Alvaro Lacayo with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Alvaro Lacayo - G.research LLC","Good morning. I just had a question on North America. I saw the volumes were very nice but from a price\/mix standpoint, maybe if you could provide a little bit more color on the moving pieces. I know that FX had I think about 1 point of an impact, then you talked about product launches and what's going on with washers. But are there any other elements that are dragging on mix given that you've had all of these product launches? And I would expect some positive price\/mix?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah, it's Marc again. So let me maybe just give a little bit perspective. Of course, first of all, in our unit numbers there's a lot of moving pieces. There's Canada, Mexico, there's different currency elements. Having said that, if you want to pinpoint two elements which explain a slight ASV decline, average sales value decline, is one is what we related to earlier is the promotion intensity in washers. And two, yes, we had a higher KitchenAid, small domestic appliance growth quite a bit above our average unit growth in the region, which negatively impacts the average sales value, but knowing that it's a very strong margin product it helps our profitability.","Alvaro Lacayo - G.research LLC","Great. And then just on cadence for share repurchases in Q4, how much of that is thought about in terms of the updated guidance? And has there been any incremental share repurchases between 9\/30 and today?","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Again, we don't comment on specific amounts of forward-looking share purchase. All we've said is we intend to continue to buy back shares in the fourth quarter and again our guidance is reflective of the share count that we are at today.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","And we don't buy back shares during our quiet period.","Operator","Great. Thank you. Next we'll move to Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Thanks. Two questions for you. First of all, on the market share and I hear the comment that KitchenAid small appliances had a good quarter. Can you just give us some context of your growth relative to AHAM 6 flat in the quarter? Just trying to gauge a more accurate evaluation of your market share gains because it doesn't sound like the seven versus zero is the right compare? And then secondly, curious Jeff as you think about the benefit from the antidumping ruling coming in January, how we should be thinking about how that might influence the industry and your performance in 2017?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Eric, it's Marc. Let me first try to answer from a share perspective. Overall, as we commented earlier, we roughly had a 1 point of share growth year-over-year. That is, of course, the result of moving different elements. First of all, if we split by product, our washer market share gain has not been there. Actually, year-over-year it's been disappointing. Having said that, that also means in refrigeration, dishwashing and cooking we had almost more than 1 share point of growth, so that was actually very satisfying. Then you have your other component which is the branded versus non-branded part of our sales. As you can imagine, when the not owned brand piece which is largely for big customer that has been coming down year-over-year while the branded piece has seen very strong growth in the entire Q3.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Eric, regarding the antidumping, first of all just a reminder on the process, in December it's expected the Department of Commerce will establish the final tariffs. And you may remember the preliminary tariffs were over 50% for one competitor and over 100% for another one. So they're substantial. So that will happen in December. And then the ITC will make the final ruling on that dumping has caused injury to the washer business in the U.S. and we expect that ruling in January. So at that point in time and we do assume we're going to be successful here, then those competitors will either have to pay really high tariffs or they'll have to do something else.","And at the same time, and again I don't want to overemphasize this, but as Marc said, I mean, we had one competitor in the second quarter ship in months and months of supply in advance of trying to, as the DoC ruled, beat the cash deposits. And unloading that inventory in the third and perhaps part of the fourth quarter has been a real strain on the operating margins and has caused a lot of injury to the washing business. So basically, I, again, I can't speak what competitors are going to do. I know we're going to run our business in an economical way. We're going to earn our market share through great products but we fully expect to make positive margins on them as well.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take a follow-up question from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you, gentlemen. Given your view that the U.S. trends are temporary, Marc, what would lead you to think that it's not temporary I guess? I mean I saw the macro slide that you guys have in your deck, but what variables would lead you to think that things are kind of slowing versus these long-term rates that you look at for the U.S. market specifically? Thank you very much.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Ken, it's Marc. Again, if you look at the fundamentals and first of all, on demand trends of housing, housing formation is intact, unemployment is getting better, income is finally arriving in middle and lower income levels, so you have a lot of \u2013 and mortgages and affordability is still very positive, so you have a lot of positive entrants there. We always argued for last three years and I would still argue, entire, call it, housing boom has been a little bit constrained by the supply side. There has not been enough developed lots, there have been issues about getting enough construction workers, there has been a severe supply constraint which also explains a little bit why the house prices came up so quickly.","So that was the constraint which we slowly start see easing but not at a rapid pace. So if you want to find any negatives, which could impact that, you can put up theories and of course if the Fed rates would come up too fast, too quickly that could have an impact, I don't think that's likely but I don't know. But outside of this one, you would have to find any macroeconomic shocks outside the housing industry and appliance industry which could impact consumer confidence.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Ken, I would just add as Marc went through the fundamentals of appliance demand, all are still very strong and we think will be for some time. If you look at the trends, it was an odd trend. The first half was up 5% and July, August were down about 5%, that's a 10-point swing. You don't see that very often. And then we look at other household product categories and we saw similar trends. So I think most of the data suggests that the consumer got cautious. Typically, that doesn't last for long periods of time, particularly when there's certainty ahead and that's why we have confidence we'll continue to see growth.","Operator","Great. Thank you. Next we'll move to Denise Chai with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Could you tell us why you've lowered your CapEx guidance? Will some of those projects move to next year or is it currency or something else?","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah, Denise, I wouldn't consider that a big change, it's just the timing of certain projects. When we started them, all the major innovation that we expected to get out this year we are. Obviously, we're managing things tightly, but we're certainly not cutting back on anything that we're bringing in the marketplace. We've got a full pipeline ready for 2017. So this is just probably more timing than anything else.","Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And then could you talk a little bit more about European demand ex the UK? I mean if you just isolate the UK, how much were volumes down compared to the rest of Europe? And generally, how has the UK trended since Brexit?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Denise, it's Marc. So first of all, let's differentiate overall industry trends from our own demand which we see. I would say overall the European market and we don't yet have a final sell-in data for Europe, I would expect them to be closer to 2%, we already indicated 0% to 2% for full year and in Q3 I would expect it right now somewhere between 1.5% and 2% but it's too early because we don't have the final data. Also, on the full-year basis I would say the entire European market still in 0% to 2%, probably ending closer to 2%. So the fundamentals of demand in Europe are not that horrible, it's the currency which impacts a lot.","If you kind of peel back the onion, of course there's a lot of moving pieces. I think first the most promising sign going forward, we start seeing some recovery in Russia and Ukraine. That's an early sign, but with the Indesit acquisition, we're very exposed to both UK and Russia and right now both markets very soft from currency and demand. But we see Russia slowly coming back and now it's too early to yet call it a recovery, but I would say the early signs have been promising.","Now specific to our demand, for us the UK markets did better as a market than we saw in our demand that is directly related to us coming out with prices increase in September, which the rest of the industry did not fully follow, and that impacted our demand, that's a particular impact. Outside the UK I would say by and large, our demand is solid. Probably the only other exception will be Middle East and Africa which is still impacted by a lot of uncertainty demand in that entire space.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we'll move to David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Jeff, you made a passing reference to the weaker private label business, JCPenney has entered the market, you were kind of conspicuous by your absence there. What's the thought process around potentially partnering up with them and what that might look like from a timing standpoint?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","David, it's Marc. So yes, I referred to year-over-year down volume on the private label side of the business, that is true. Not entirely surprising, consistent with prior trends, more than offset in our branded business, so Whirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid, are all going extremely well. JCPenney, as we discussed earlier, we monitor them, we still consider it a pilot. It's not yet proven to be in our view fully successful and we will see, but we will monitor it and we always said we will ultimately have our brands where we believe the consumer distribution, consumer demand will be. So this is not a final call or decision, we're monitoring it.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Okay. Well, listen, we're going to conclude the call here. Thank you for joining us. Thank you for the questions, and we look forward to updating you in January.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference.

For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Joe Lovechio.","Joseph Lovechio","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer.","Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, as well as in the Appendix of this presentation.","Turning to Slide 3, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation. Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation, beginning on Slide 41 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","Good morning, everyone, and thank you again for joining us today. As you saw in our earning release from earlier this morning, our actions in 2012 have delivered a record year of margin expansion. If you recall, in October 2011, we outlined several business priorities and accompanying actions that we said we would execute throughout 2012 to improve our operating margins and lower our fixed cost. These included realizing cost-based pricing actions, an increased level of new product innovation driving enhanced mix, reducing our fixed cost structure and delivering ongoing cost productivity from our global operating programs. And as a result, this last quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year ongoing business operations margin expansion and, for the full year, generates strong levels of underlying free cash flow. These actions and this momentum, combined with favorable trends that we see in U.S. housing and growth opportunities that we see in emerging markets, have created positive momentum as we have headed into 2013.","Our full year results are summarized on Slide 6, and you'll see overall revenues were up approximately 3%, excluding the impact of foreign currency and BEFIEX, as our strong price and mix continued throughout the year. And in line with our previously increased guidance, diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved $5 per share to $7.05 for 2012 compared to $2.05 in the prior year.  Our underlying cash flow generation from ongoing business operations also improved significantly year-over-year by over $550 million.","Turning to Slide 7 and 8, we highlight our business priorities for 2013 and how we expect them to impact our results. These priorities are well aligned with our long-term growth strategy and build upon the success and the foundation we've built in 2012.","For the year, we expect our ongoing business performance and margins to continue to improve as we launch new product innovations, accelerate growth and higher-margin adjacent businesses, continue our expansion in emerging markets, realize additional benefits from our cost and capacity reduction initiatives and execute our ongoing cost productivity programs.","We believe these positive drivers will more than offset the expected increases in material and oil-related costs. We also expect to see positive global demand, as we outlined on Slide 9. In the U.S., we expect demand to be up 2% to 3% for the year, as we are increasingly optimistic about a more structural demand recovery, and we do continue to see very positive trends in U.S. housing.","In Brazil and other Latin America countries, we continue to see strong underlying economic fundamentals, and we're forecasting demand growth in the region from 3% to 5% for the year.","In Europe, we're forecasting a flat industry for the full year as consumer confidence in the Eurozone remains weak within this still challenging economic environment.","And finally, we expect a modest recovery and modest growth of 3% to 5% for Asia across the region for the full year.","Finally, turning to Slide 10, we continue to execute these actions to expand our margins with enhanced price\/mix through innovative products and our cost and capacity reductions. Combined, these actions, along with the revenue growth, we expect to deliver GAAP EPS in the range of $9.80 to $10.30 per share and overall positive free cash flow of $600 million to $650 million.","In our ongoing business operational guidance for 2013 is $9.25 a share to $9.75 per share, and our cash flow from our ongoing operations is forecasted to be $950 million to $1 billion.","So at this point in time, I'll turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our North America operations.","Marc R. Bitzer","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by reviewing North America's performance in the fourth quarter, starting with Slide 12.","Our consistent and disciplined execution of the actions we laid out last year resulted in the fifth quarter of year-over-year ongoing business operations margin improvement. And our operating margins exceeded 9% for the quarter. A continued investment in innovation and a strong market execution drove a significant part of the improvement. Cost productivity was also a positive driver as we more than offset material cost inflation in the fourth quarter.","Turning to Slide 13. Net sales of $2.5 billion decreased 3% from last year as a weak economic environment continued in the U.S. amid uncertainty with government policies. Concerns over consumer reactions to the fiscal cliff loomed during the month of December, and retailers responded by maintaining low inventory levels, resulting in lower industry selling during the quarter.","As we have previously stated, our priority has been and will be margin improvement. We have increased our balance of sale in the higher-priced segments across most products, driven by innovation as evidenced by our very strong positive mix.","Ongoing business operating profit was $233 million, which more than doubled as compared to $106 million in 2011. Overall, ongoing business operating margin was up over 5 points year-over-year.","In addition to a very strong price and mix improvement, the year-over-year progress was, to a lesser extent, driven by the benefit of our cost and capacity reduction initiatives, as well as our ongoing cost productivity program.","Turning to Slide 14. You can see just a few examples of our innovative products. The small domestic appliance you see here is just an example of how we're growing our adjacent businesses.","Let me take a moment and talk briefly about North America in 2013 as shown on Slide 15. We will remain focused on actions driving margin expansion, including growing our high-end margin core and adjacent businesses, continuing to deliver cost and capacity reduction initiatives and realizing positive net cost productivity. As Jeff mentioned earlier, we expect the U.S. industry to increase 2% to 3% in 2013 as the market demand grows throughout the year. We believe that consumers will remain cautious in the early part of the year as fallout of fiscal cliff negotiations are understood and budget debates continue in Washington.","As we continue the year, we'll remain optimistic that the home building recovery and remodeling will continue to strengthen its momentum and that consumers will gain confidence as federal government policies become clearer. Also, the normal replacement cycle of appliance continues, which is particularly important given the peak appliance industry years that occurred before the recession.","Let me just close with some comments on the recent ruling by the ITC on our anti-dumping petition. Last week, the U.S. International Trade Commission, or ITC, confirmed an unanimous 6-0 vote that unlawful pricing by Samsung and LG caused injury to the U.S. domestic appliance industry. The positive vote was the ITC's final ruling in the anti-dumping investigation related to clothes washers from South Korea and Mexico. As a result of the vote, the U.S. government will impose trade remedies on the imports of the unlawfully traded washers. The decision is a great victory for the U.S. appliance industry and is an important stride towards enforcing laws that enable a balanced, competitive marketplace for U.S. manufacturers, employees and customers. It is not yet clear how the competitor will respond to this decision and therefore, it is difficult to fully gauge the commercial implications of this. However, we clearly said that in a level competitive playing field, we are very well positioned to win. With this in mind, this decision is clearly a net positive for Whirlpool.","And now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations.","Michael A. Todman","Thanks, Marc.","Turning to Slide 17. Overall, our international operations were led by strong performances in our Latin America and Asia regions, as well as a return to profitability in Europe. We delivered improved price and mix across all of our international business as we continue to launch consumer-relevant innovations in every product category around the world. Productivity also drove favorable results as our ongoing cost productivity programs more than offset material cost inflation and currency for the quarter.","If you turn to Slide 18, you'll see our Latin America fourth quarter results. Sales, excluding currency and BEFIEX, increased 14% on higher volumes and improved mix. GAAP operating profit for the quarter totaled $134 million compared to $155 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower monetization of tax credits.","On an adjusted basis, excluding Brazilian tax credits, our operating profit for the quarter totaled $119 million compared to $96 million, a 24% improvement year-over-year. Improved price, mix and ongoing cost productivity programs more than offset the raw material inflation.","Turning to Slide 19, we saw good market demand in Brazil and a share gain in our core 3 appliances, which are higher margin and contributed to our positive mix.","I now want to highlight a few points regarding our Latin America region. On Slide 20, we compare a few economic indicators for 2 portions of our Latin American appliance business, Brazil and what we referred to as LAR International. As you can see, LAR International, which is made up of over 35 markets outside Brazil, is comparable to Brazil in size, GDP and number of households. Our appliance business in these markets is approximately 1\/3 of the size of our appliance business in Brazil but has been growing over the past few years. Our Latin American international business continues to have a significant growth opportunity. In fact, we had record sales and operating profit in this portion of the business again this year. In summary, in addition to Brazil, we also have an opportunity for growth and strong margin contribution in many other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.","Slide 21 highlights the growth potential in our Latin American region, given current penetration rates of appliances in Latin America compared to the United States.","Now turning to the fourth quarter results of Europe, Middle East and Africa on Slide 22, we returned to profitability in the quarter, driven by the actions we outlined last quarter. The region had an operating profit of $8 million compared to a $32 million loss in the prior year period. Favorable price\/mix, the benefits of cost and capacity reduction initiatives and ongoing cost productivity positively impacted results.","Our fourth quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 23. During the quarter, we gained market share and expanded our margins across the region despite weak consumer demand, material cost inflation and unfavorable currency. Net sales increased 1% during the quarter to $203 million, up from $200 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 4%. The region's operating profit was $7 million, up from $2 million in the prior year due to favorable price and mix and ongoing cost productivity.","Slide 24 shows just a few examples of our new products in 2012. To continue to capitalize on the growth -- on the opportunities for growth, we expect to launch over 200 new products in our Latin America region alone in 2013.","Our international priorities are outlined on Slide 25. In 2013, we expect to leverage new product launches and grow adjacent businesses, continue cost and capacity reduction initiatives and execute ongoing cost productivity programs. These actions, combined with stabilization in Europe and growth opportunities in emerging markets, have us well positioned to perform in 2013.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli.","Larry M. Venturelli","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by making some comments on our fourth quarter results and then I'll transition to guidance for 2013.","Beginning on Slide 27, you'll note that we continued to deliver on our margin expansion initiatives. For the quarter, we had approximately a 400-basis-point improvement. Ongoing operating profit margin increased to 6.5%, driven by price\/mix, which is up approximately 4 points, and resulted from both cost base price increases as well as favorable mix.","Another positive margin contributor has been benefits associated with our cost and capacity reduction program, which contributed about 1 point of year-over-year margin improvement. Material cost inflation was approximately $73 million. As expected, we saw cost productivity ramp up, more than offsetting our material headwinds, resulting in positive net cost productivity. Overall, our fourth quarter and full year margins were firmly on track with expectations.","Now turning to free cash flow on Slide 28. We generated cash of $230 million compared to a free cash flow use of $55 million last year. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, our underlying ongoing business cash flow improved by over $550 million compared to last year, largely driven by an improved margin structure.","Now let me spend a couple of minutes on some general topics embedded in our fourth quarter results. Before I do that, as a general reminder, Slides 42 through 45 in the Appendix will provide you with a reconciliation of our reported GAAP operating profit and EPS to ongoing business operations. As you can see, we have removed the impact of restructuring expense and BEFIEX tax credits, as well as the impacts from legal resolutions and an intangible impairment.","Turning back to the financial summary on Slides 29 and 30, let me provide a couple of observations. It's important to note that net sales in constant currencies, excluding BEFIEX credits, were up approximately 2%. Monetization of BEFIEX tax credits were $15 million compared to $59 million last year. For the year, $37 million of credits were recognized and, at the end of the year, $184 million remain.","Regarding interest and sundry expense, in the quarter, we recorded an expense of $17 million for antitrust resolutions. This is adjusted from ongoing business operations to provide better clarity of our underlying business results.","Slide 31 illustrates expense associated with our cost and capacity reduction program. We continue to expect our total program expense to be approximately $500 million through 2013. The program is progressing very well, and we delivered $227 million of benefit in 2012 and expect an additional $175 million of benefit in 2013 for a total of $400 million, which is consistent with our previous guidance.","As Jeff introduced earlier on the call, our 2013 guidance is shown on Slide 32. We expect to deliver annual GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $9.80 to $10.30 per share and annual ongoing business operations EPS of $9.25 to $9.75. Our 2013 free cash flow guidance is $600 million to $650 million.","To provide further clarity and comparability between our GAAP guidance and our ongoing business operation guidance, we have included a table on Slide 33, which I'd like to provide some comments and perspective on.","Consistent with 2012, we will continue to adjust GAAP EPS for both BEFIEX tax credits and restructuring expenses. As you recall, in October 2011, we announced the largest restructuring program in company history. Restructuring expense is expected to be $185 million or $1.75 per share this year. In 2013, we expect to monetize approximately $60 million to $70 million of BEFIEX tax credits.","Lastly, recent legislation in the U.S. has extended the energy tax credit program. You'll note that our 2013 GAAP earnings guidance includes $120 million in energy credits. We will continue to exclude these from our ongoing business operations.","Our 2013 ongoing tax rate guidance is 24% and 2013 GAAP tax rate guidance is 9%. And this primarily reflects the energy tax credits.","On Slide 34, we highlight the main drivers of our expected year-over-year ongoing business operating performance improvement. During 2013, we expect 1 point of margin improvement from price\/mix, largely driven from the mix impact of innovative new product launches and adjacent business growth; approximately 1 point of margin from our cost and capacity reduction program. We also expect to deliver approximately 0.5 point of margin expansion from our normal cost productivity, and this includes fully offsetting approximately $150 million to $200 million of year-over-year material cost headwinds. And finally, higher marketing and technology investments are expected to reduce margins by approximately 1 point during 2013.","On Slide 35, you'll note we generated $230 million in free cash flow during 2012 and are guiding to $600 million to $650 million, largely driven by cash earnings. It is important to note that we now expect the bulk of our restructuring program cash outflow during 2013, as well as higher capital spending, which is expected to be $600 million to $650 million, compared to approximately $475 million in 2012. The underlying ongoing business operations free cash flow we are generating through operations takes into account short-lived cash requirements and continues to be close to $1 billion.","Before I close, I want to discuss our short-term cash allocation priorities outlined on Slide 36, which include funding the business, including capital expenditures; debt maturities and pension contributions; return to shareholders; and M&A. We are planning to refinance our $500 million 5.5% long-term debt, which matures on March 1 in the public debt markets.","Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","Thanks, Larry. Well, let me summarize. I'll start with Slide 38.","Overall, we were pleased with the performance and progress that we made in 2012. We delivered record margin expansion across our global business, which in turn generated very strong underlying free cash flow. These actions, as I mentioned, combined with what we see are positive trends in U.S. housing and our growth in emerging markets, do position us well coming into the year. Our actions have clearly produced the expected results, and we remain committed to delivering at least 8% operating margins by 2014.","Turning to Slide 39, I am confident in the opportunities that we see to grow the business worldwide. And these opportunities, in summary, will come through: appliance growth in new and emerging markets; our stepped up in investment in the consumer-relevant innovations; our expansion into higher-margin, faster-growing adjacent businesses; and advancement of our overall global product leadership.","So we continue to make great progress on our road map for growth with our great brands and great products. And more importantly, we're performing at levels that will continue to create value for our shareholders.","So with that, I'm going to conclude our formal remarks and open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question, listening from the site of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can you address the trends in 2013, Marc? And I think you were touching like why investors shouldn't be concerned about the North American GAAP volume that you guys are reporting for, say, AHAM 6, so negative 5 versus negative 2 in the fourth quarter. And talk about North American margins and your view on discounting in 2013. You guys said you'd be discounting, it's part of the landscape, but it's going to be disciplined. If you can expand on those 2 comments.","Marc R. Bitzer","Ken, its Marc Bitzer. So let me try to break it out into 2 pieces, the volume, and I think you had a question about the Q4 2012 industry volume [indiscernible] then I come to discounting. First of all, on the Q4 volumes, I would say, overall, the full year industry volume in Q4 largely came within the range of what we've guided to, provided in the previous quarters. Slightly below. We always had 0 to minus 2. Full year industry was minus 2.3. That was largely driven by a weaker-than-expected December. As I mentioned before, the trade sale in December was pretty low. Everybody took inventory down. Probably, a lot had to do with the uncertainty coming out of Washington. But I would say, overall, at the very low end of our guidance. And the only -- if at all [indiscernible] December 1. On our 2013 guidance, Jeff indicated and I indicated it's a plus 2% to plus 3%, which we expect to build throughout the year. We expect some uncertainty in the market, certainly in the first quarter, depending on the whole fiscal cliff discussion. But the underlying trends remain robust. The housing trends is, I would say, in a very healthy shape. If you look at the housing starts, very positive trends, the completion are meant -- just a definition of time, about 6 to 8 months later. That is a strong momentum. I also referred to what is still a very important part of our business replacement cycle. You're basically cycling now against almost a peak of the appliance demand in 2004 and 2005, and that is also an underlying growth driver. So we're pretty confident behind this plus 2% to plus 3%.Now on your comments on the discounts. I was referring to our course has been and will be margin expansion. And as such, we kind of -- I mean, I can only comment on our Q4. We don't make forward comments on planned promotions on Q4. We'll stay the course. We participated when there was value creation, and we did not participate when there was no value creation for us. And that is the course you will see.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then my second question, some of the recent analysis that we've done in terms of modeling forward demand, if AHAM 6 is around 36 million units in 2012, we kind of forecasted a rate of 42 million units in 2015. And what surprised us is starts were to be normalizing towards 1.5 million units. Approximately half of that growth of 3 million units would have -- would come from new construction. And I believe you guys have roughly a 40% share there; GE, 45%. So if our analysis, what I described, is correct, could you kind of describe the operating leverage that you're going to see and why this wouldn't result in meaningful growth for Whirlpool North America above the industry shipments?","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes. Ken, this is Larry. A couple of things. Certainly, during this time period, the recessionary time period, we've taken down our fixed cost structure significantly. We're very well positioned as volume comes back from a leverage perspective. So on an incremental margin perspective, you're probably thinking about -- if you think about 90% of our cost of goods sold approximately is variable and 40% is SG&A, we'd have a nice volume leverage as volume comes back. And as Marc indicated, certainly, the housing completions and existing home sales are a stimulus for us, combined with the increased share we've had over the last couple of years.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess just wondering if I -- one more question. On the marketing, technology and product innovations that we see in 2013, the 100 basis points, is that a normalized rate of investment that we should think about, that needs to be met by positives such as price\/mix, cost and productivity?","Jeff M. Fettig","Well, again, as we outlined, we are stepping up investments in -- beginning with our new product introductions. So our -- both capital and technology investments because we're getting paid for these in the marketplace. Innovation sells, and that's -- that's our view of how to grow faster and win in the marketplace, is through product innovation, not through price cutting. So that's one. Two, brand investment. With new products, you need to, through all the different mediums, communicate to consumers. And we're at a level where we're going to increase that substantially. And our systems investment is really to help us drive productivity through our global operations. So it's not -- we have a lot of levers that will offset that increased investment, but it's a combination of continued PMR; getting paid for innovation; the restructuring, which we're completely on track to delivery; and we're very optimistic we're going to have positive net productivity. So we're balancing all those, expanding our margins, growing our business. If the market is better, we'll do better.","Operator","And we'll take our next question, listening from the site of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question I had was on the productivity and material cost guidance for the upcoming year. Little surprised with the expectation for that $150 million to $250 million headwind in the materials, given right now, at least both steel and oil are tracking down year-over-year as we end the year. So I was wondering if you could give commentary around that? And also, the productivity side, if that offset is being driven more by volume leverage? If that's what's included as part of that productivity? Or if there are incremental actions, more like kind of cost actions, that also help that productivity offset?","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, Michael. This is Jeff. Our guidance of $150 million to $250 million, it is still more inflation of raw materials, lower than we've had obviously the last 2 years. But if you look at our main drivers of raw materials are steel, resins, base metals, strategic components and so on, and I'd add currency because we've had a currency impact on this as well. So we feel pretty good about our position going in the year. Resins are much higher and have a material impact, as well as some of the strategic components and currency. So this is a balance. We think it's a fair snapshot for where we are right here. It is a lot of inflation given the global environment, but we're -- we've been pretty accurate in tracking these things over the last couple of years. As it relates to productivity, the lion's share -- we have very little volume built into our cost productivity because even last year, we're -- we had dampened production levels as we both dealt with market demand, a negative situation in some key regions, as well as managing very tightly our inventory. So there is a very small amount of volume built into that. It is largely through our cost programs; lean manufacturing; product redesign process and a supply chain optimization that we're very confident in our ability to drive productivity, which will offset this and contribute to our margins.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So if the cost productivity doesn't include volume leverage, is that just a source of upside to margins relative to your guidance?","Jeff M. Fettig","As I said, if we have better demand, it'll affect us both in the top line, and it'll affect us on the productivity level. And if we have higher demand than what we're showing, we'll do better.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. And then just a clarification on 4Q results. I think it was referred to before that your shipments were down 5% versus negative 2% in the quarter for the AHAM 6. Is that correct? And how are you thinking about your shipments versus the industry for 2013?","Marc R. Bitzer","Michael, it's Marc Bitzer. And again, what is correct from these numbers are year-over-year volume and market share has been down. However, if you compare it to Q3, we basically had an essentially market share with Q3. And given that Q4 is typically a quarter where you have higher promotion because of the holiday period, and given our policy to expand margin as the out course, I actually feel pretty comfortable that it's a steady market share coming out of Q3 and Q4. And also, if you peel back the onion, we actually have pretty good share gains in the higher-end segments where we have a lot of innovation, and we feel very good about it. And as usual, we can't give a market share forecast for next year, that is driven by a number of factors, but we will stay our overall course here.","Operator","Next to the site of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Two primary questions. One, the last time that the energy tax credit program was in effect, whether this is related or unrelated, your inventories swelled. And I'm noticing that you have a very large productivity expectation for 2013. What should we expect inventories to do by year end? And how much of your productivity, that you're factoring in, comes from trying to maximize these credits from a production standpoint?","Larry M. Venturelli","Sam, this is Larry. A couple of things to keep in consideration. We are not building inventory for energy tax credits. These appliances, these high-efficiency appliances, have very quick -- have very low days of inventory. They're some of the fastest-selling products in the marketplace. Our productivity is based on what we normally do in each and every year to generate productivity. And year-end inventories, I would say I would expect our year-end inventories to be right around where they're at this time next year as where they ended up in December.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And my next question, you mentioned 1 point of price\/mix expected for '13. I think you might have said mostly mix. If we were to go around by region, how would that differ regionally, that 1 point?","Jeff M. Fettig","We expect to see positive price\/mix everywhere, Sam. Think of it this way. There's really 3 drivers, again, this is as of where we are today. We've got some good carryover coming over from last year from actions we took throughout the year. We clearly are seeing positive mix with better margins virtually everywhere, and that should continue because we continue to -- or we're ramping up our launches, we're ramping up our investment, so we expect that piece to continue. And in our high-inflation or high-devaluation markets, we've already announced, such as Brazil and India and a few others, new price increases this year to cope for the kind of inflation we're seeing in this market. So it's a combination of all. But we expect positive price\/mix everywhere.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And as a follow-up, Jeff, I know last year you were real demonstrative, and still remain so, that price and margin expansion will supersede market share. Should we then read your comments today you are every bit as resolute going forward? Or is market share going to be a bit more of an important factor for you going forward than it was last year?","Jeff M. Fettig","Sam, our primary objective is create value. There's been a number of questions about market share. We had some, what I would describe as marginal market share losses, primarily around the area where we had significant, large, appropriate cost-based price increases last year. Everybody's got their own objectives, and I can't speak for others. I would just say that it is not abnormal for us to lose some market share during those periods of time. I would say that we have gained market share where we've wanted, which is in higher-value, innovation-driven areas. We're not in the business to chase market share based on price. We try to earn it with customers every day, and I guess I'm -- we're very pleased with what we're doing in earning our market share in areas that create value.","Operator","Next to the site of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Two things. First of all, in terms of the environment, obviously, you're focus in '12 works, being more focused on margin and a little bit less focused on share, but certainly aware of share. I'm just interested in how 4Q played out. And as you're having discussions with your customers and in the channel in 2013, if you feel like that stance of the environment is going to be different? 2012 is a year obviously where it was much less promotional, and that helped. How do you feel, or what do you see within what retailers are wanting to do competitively in 2013 in that area?","Jeff M. Fettig","Eric, it probably varies a little bit but not a lot around the world. This -- and I'll take the U.S. for example. This industry got into a lot of trouble when there was a recovery in early 2010, a lot of it by stimulus-driven things off of a low base. And we had very fast volume recovery. And then it stopped. And then a very negative reaction in terms of aggressive promotions and price discounting at levels never seen before in this industry. And there was tremendous value destroyed at every level. Manufacture, retail, et cetera. And the background is it didn't change demand at all. And so as we said 2 years ago, we're in the appropriate level of promotion that makes sense with the business, to offer values in the marketplace and so on. But the kind of stuff we saw earlier, I don't see us -- there's no economic value to doing that. It does not attract demand. We're still in a largely replacement market. Even with housing coming back, that's a new construction market. I would say the weakest part of the market in between is the pure discretionary. So it isn't like we're in an environment where people are coming to the marketplace because they see a discount or a price promotion. They're coming to the marketplace because they need a new product. And so we're -- we kind of see a -- the focus you will see from us is largely built around letting consumers know about our new products. And I think that's the way to attract customers in the marketplace in this kind of environment.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. Secondly, the volume expectation for '13, up 2% to 3% in North America, is a material improvement for what we saw in '12. Housing seems robust in '12 and seems robust in '13. What's different in '13 that allows the category to perform much better with what looks to be a similar new housing environment?","Marc R. Bitzer","Eric, it's Marc. Yes, with plus 2% to 3%, it seems different than this year. In the grander scheme of things, it's still on a very low absolute level and we're still far, far away from the peak levels where we -- which we experienced in 2006, 2007. Again, as I said before, I think despite the uncertainty which was driven a little bit around consumer and trade confidence towards the end of the year, which will have some spillover off into Q1, there's a couple of underlying drivers which are just healthy and strong. One is the housing. Keep also this one in mind, we are in the housing completion side, not necessarily in the housing starts side. The housing completions in 2012 are still very low, below 600. By the starts now come right into the market. I mean, many people expect housing starts next year to be between 950, 970. So you add -- you took maybe 6 months or 8 months completion. You can do the math. I mean, it's still various momentums building the market and the housing side. And if you further zoom out, our business is not only driven by the new housing. Existing homes is still the #1 driver for appliance sales. Inventories are low. We're probably more supply constrained right now. We expect the inventories -- or supply coming back into the market, and that gives us a healthy confidence in existing home sales. And the third element, which is really maybe one of the most important one, and particular that it is still in a replacement market, we are cycling against the peak demand levels of 2002 to 2005. So you add your typical 10 years, \"life of an appliance\" in there, you are entering now some pretty healthy replacement cycles. So you put all of these 3 factors together, that has us lead a very strong momentum in the market. Now it maybe dampened in the short term by some consumer confidence issues, but it doesn't structurally change our view on a slow but very steady recovery of industry demand.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","And then one follow-up. You spoke earlier of the incremental marketing, technology, product investment, the 1-point margin hit in '13. Could you just explain a little bit better? It seemed like you've been make investments in these areas in the past. Is there a reason or a little bit better color for why it's such a material step up in '13, which seem to be a reasonable level of investment in the past?","Jeff M. Fettig","Well, Eric, I would say we have had reasonable levels. But number one, we've never had as many new products to come in the marketplace. And so as I said earlier, I think letting consumers know about a lot of this innovation is a value-creating activity. So we have higher capital and higher brand and market launch expense, which I see is a very good investment. The systems investment, which is not trivial, is to further help us on the productivity side. So we line all these up against returns. Okay? And so if we don't see the returns coming, we'll scale them back. But we think these are healthy investments for the business. They will accelerate our revenue growth in the right areas, therefore, margins. And this gets us at a level where we think is commensurate with the kind of things we bring in the marketplace.","Operator","Time for one more question. We'll take that final questions from the site of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Just back to the whole discussion with operating leverage for a second. Can you just update us on where your capacity utilization rates are in North America and Latin America?","Jeff M. Fettig","David, we've had this discussion before. It's really hard to give you an exact number there. I would say -- let's take North America for example. We resized the North America capacity to be profitable at 2011, 2012 demand levels. And in many cases, that's running 1 or maximum 2 shifts, 5 days a week. Okay? So on that basis, there's a capacity utilization. But the reality, and I think probably the relevant question here, is if we see an uptick in demand, or a significant change in demand, can we respond to it profitably? And the answer is absolutely yes. We've ran some of these facilities back in 2006 and '07 24\/7. And so we have substantial upside capacity without any major investment or -- probably the biggest constraint to upside is just getting the rest of the supply chain ready for it, which we work on all the time. So I have -- the way I look at capacity utilization today is we're very profitable at today's levels and we can go up. In Latin America, there, as we've had nice growth for a number of years, we have had some capacity constraint issues that we continue to address through very targeted and focused investments. So it's something we -- I mean, we're -- our asset utilization and the management of assets and capital is something that's on everyday here. And so, basically, that's where we are.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. On Latin America, Mike made the observation that you were looking to grow in the non-Brazilian markets. Is that largely distribution? Can you do that with the brands you have now? Is it organic? Or do you have to make acquisitions?","Michael A. Todman","No, David. It is largely through distribution. Our brands, we market both the Whirlpool brand and KitchenAid brand in those markets, and the fact of the matter is they're very well received. We've started to increase our investment in new product innovations in those markets and we're starting to see it take. So we feel pretty good that just through investment and more distribution, we can significantly increase our share.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Final question, just you talk a lot about the innovation and the growth that comes along with that, which is very encouraging, but you're also exiting some underperforming business as well, as I understand, or at least some underperforming SKUs. Can you just talk about the exiting underperforming SKUs as a drag on revenue growth next year? Is it a couple of points? Is it less than that?","Jeff M. Fettig","No, David. We've got -- we made an awful lot of progress in 2012. I mean, basically, we want to sell products for a profit. And if it doesn't hit that criteria, we either fix it, change it or quit selling it. And so yes, the lion's share of the marginal market share loss that we had is -- probably would fall under the categories of unprofitable businesses to sell it. And but our view is not to quit selling, it's to get better products, get better costs, that sort of thing. So it's kind of an ongoing assessment and cleansing process. But fundamentally, we are -- we believe great products sell. And if they truly are great products, we will get paid for them. And so revenue growth without profit is not a big interest to us.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Sounds like we -- I was the last question. You got a couple of minutes to go to the hour. Let me just ask you if you'd consider a share split?","Jeff M. Fettig","David, anything like that or a return to shareholder or anything else is something that we would -- we ongoing have discussions and dialogues with our board. And if anything like that would happen, it'd be a board decision.","So listen, everyone, thank you for joining us today. We really appreciate your questions on the call and we look forward to updating you the next time we get together. Thank you very much.","Operator","And this concludes today's program.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Joe Lovechio.","Joseph Lovechio","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Presidents Mike Todman and Marc Bitzer; as well as Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, as well as in the appendix of this presentation.","Turning to Slide 3. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations, as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation, beginning on Slide 33, for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you saw in our earnings release from earlier this morning, our third quarter results reflect record earnings for our company. We continue to execute on the plans that we laid out to you at the beginning of the year, and we're managing well all the drivers which drive revenue growth and margin expansion. In addition, our -- we continue to accelerate the pace of our innovative new products in support of our industry-leading brands, and in turn, these are driving increased consumer demand and revenue growth. As a result, this marks the seventh straight quarter in a row of year-over-year ongoing business operations margin expansions for us.","Given the strong underlying trends that we see in our business today, we are raising our full year ongoing business operation EPS outlook to $9.90 to $10.10 per share and increasing our free cash flow forecast to between $690 million and $710 million of cash.","Our third quarter results are summarized on Slide 6. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and BEFIEX, our sales were up over 5% versus last year, led by strong growth in our North America business. Diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved by $0.92 or 51% and came in at $2.72 compared to $1.80 last year. As we continue to drive higher revenue growth and expand margins, our expectations for cash are firmly on track for the year, and we're effectively deploying that cash in line with our previously communicated priorities.","Turning to Slide 7, you will see our current full year industry assumptions by region as compared to our previous forecast. In North America, we are increasing our industry demand assumption to approximately 9% for the year as we continue to see positive trends in U.S. housing, the normal replacement cycle of appliances and a return of discretionary purchases to the market. In Europe, we now expect a flat industry for the full year, as the region remains weak but appears to be stabilizing. And for Latin America, we saw inflation and currency changes impact consumer demand in Q3. But we're now seeing a pickup in demand, and we expect that positive trend to continue during the fourth quarter. So for the full year, our industry forecast is now expected to be a positive 1%. And finally, we're now forecasting the industry demand in Asia to be down 2% for the full year, primarily driven by industry demand weakness in India, somewhat offset by our strength in China. In total, given these changes, our overall global industry demand expectations has increased slightly for the year.","So at this point in time, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer.","Marc R. Bitzer","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Slide 9 by reviewing North America's performance in the third quarter, starting with the top line. Net sales of $2.6 billion for North America were up 8%, driven by higher volumes, particularly in the U.S. where core appliance revenue was up approximately 10% compared to the prior year. Strength in the U.S. was partially offset by industry weakness in Mexico and currency impact in Canada. Ongoing business operating margins were 11% for the quarter with ongoing business operating profit of $289 million, an all-time quarterly record, compared to $227 million in 2012. Higher sales, ongoing cost productivity and cost and capacity reduction benefits continue to be positive drivers in the third quarter, more than offsetting higher material cost. Overall, ongoing business operating margins expanded by 1.7 points year-over-year. Consistent and disciplined execution of our action resulted in the eighth quarter of year-over-year ongoing business operating margin improvement.","Now let me take a moment to talk about our expectations for the rest of the year, as shown in Slide 10. Given current trends, we expect the strong momentum to continue in the fourth quarter. And as Jeff indicated earlier, we are increasing our full year industry guidance to approximately 9%. Positive trends in the U.S. housing continue, including both new constructions and existing home sales. In addition, we see increased demand for replacement purchases, as well as discretionary purchases, driven by improving consumer confidence. We continue to invest in innovative new products. We are seeing the benefits of our cost and capacity reduction initiatives, as well as our ongoing cost productivity programs. And we remain focused in growing beyond our core business.","Turning to Slide 11, you can see a couple of examples of our leading innovative products in the North America region, with the industry's first induction double-oven freestanding range and KitchenAid brand's new 5-speed Diamond blenders.","I will now talk to the third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, as shown in Slide 13. As discussed in our last earnings call, our first milestone for Europe was to bring the operations back to breakeven, and this is what we achieved during Q3. Our breakeven results for the quarter reflect a weak but stabilizing market environment in the Eurozone. Sales were $778 million, compared to $702 million in the prior year. Excluding currency, sales increased 5% year-over-year, driven by higher volumes. Operating profit improved by $36 million, and operating margins improved 520 basis points compared to the prior year period. Higher sales, ongoing cost productivity and benefits from cost and capacity reduction initiatives more than offset higher material costs. And we will continue to evaluate and take all actions necessary to ensure this positive trend in operating margin growth continues.","Turning to Slide 14, you can see a couple of examples of our leading innovative products in this region with the Bauknecht UltimateCare washer and the Bauknecht dishwasher with PowerClean+.","And now I'd like to turn it over to Mike.","Michael A. Todman","Thanks, Marc. If you turn to Slide 16, you'll see our Latin America third quarter results, which highlight our sixth conservative quarter of year-over-year ongoing business operations margin expansion. Sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. Excluding currency translation and BEFIEX, sales were down less than 1% to the previous year, as temporary reduction in global compressor sales was partially offset by growth in core appliances through increased market share. GAAP operating profit for the quarter totaled $133 million, compared to $118 million in the prior year.","On an adjusted basis, excluding Brazilian tax credits, our operating profit for the quarter totaled $104 million, 9.4% of sales, compared to $105 million or 8.8% of sales in the prior year. Ongoing cost productivity offset higher material costs and foreign currency.","Now let me take a couple of minutes to talk about the region in general on Slide 17. The temporary reduction in global compressor sales stemmed from onetime events, including an unplanned port closure that delayed shipments, as well as some isolated trade customer inventory adjustments. The appliance industry in Brazil was flat for the quarter, given the negative impact from currency changes and inflation on the consumer. At this point, given other environmental issues, we do not expect the government loan subsidy program in Brazil to have a relevant impact for appliances. However, we are now seeing a pickup in demand and expect that to continue in the fourth quarter. So for the full year industry growth forecast, we expect a positive 1%. It is also important to note that we had strong appliance growth through increased market share as our innovative new product launches win with consumers. So we expect our business in this region to outperform the industry, resulting in strong revenue and earnings growth going forward. We continue to be very positive about the long-term trend in Brazil, given the low penetration rate of appliances, the emerging middle class and strong underlying economic fundamentals.","Slide 18 shows how we continue to capitalize on the opportunity for growth with product leadership in Latin America. For this quarter, we've highlighted the Consul Bem Estar refrigerators.","Our third quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 20. Net sales during the quarter were $197 million, compared to $201 million in the prior year. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 2%. Operating profit of $7 million was approximately 4% of sales, flat from the prior year, as growth in China, favorable price and mix, as well as ongoing cost productivity was offset by industry weakness in India, increased raw material cost and foreign currency. One last note on our Asia region. We were pleased to announce our intent to become majority shareholder of Hefei Sanyo and accelerate our growth in the emerging Chinese market. The regulatory approval process remains on track, and as we previously stated, we expect the transaction to close by the end of 2014. Slide 21 shows a couple of examples of our product leadership in Asia. For this quarter, we've highlighted 2 refrigerators: the Whirlpool Neo iChill and the Whirlpool Beijing Opera.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry.","Larry M. Venturelli","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Overall, the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to remain strong, as evidenced by another quarter of bulk sales growth and margin expansion. We continue to manage effectively through short-term volatility in demand and unfavorable currencies across the globe. Given our strong operating results for the first 3 quarters, we are again raising our full year guidance today.","Turning to Slide 23, you can see we now expect to deliver annual GAAP EPS in the range of $10.45 to $10.65 per share and ongoing business operations EPS of $9.90 to $10.10 per share. We are also raising our expectations for 2013 free cash flow to be in the range of $690 million to $710 million.","Before I move on, as a general reminder, Slides 33 to 41 in the appendix provide you with a reconciliation of our reported GAAP operating profit and EPS to ongoing business operations for 2013 and 2012 and reported GAAP cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow.","On Slide 24, you will note that we continue to execute our margin expansion actions. In both the third quarter and year-to-date, we drove a 170 basis point improvement in ongoing business operating profit margin. Price mix is on track, and we continue to expect to realize 0.5 points for the full year. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives contributed 1 point, consistent with our full year guidance. Net cost productivity was positive year-to-date as our actions more than offset material cost inflation of approximately $120 million to the first 9 months of the year. For the full year, productivity will more than offset approximately $180 million to $200 million of material cost inflation. We expect net cost productivity to deliver approximately 0.5 points in margin for 2013.","Increases in marketing, technology and product investments are expected to reduce margins by approximately 0.5 points for the full year. As we manage all these margin drivers, we expect to deliver an ongoing business operating margin of greater than 7%, and we remain on track for our 8% margin target in 2014.","Moving to the financial summary on Slide 25. Reported net sales were $4.7 billion, compared to $4.5 billion [ph] last year. Excluding the impact of both foreign currency and BEFIEX, sales were up over 5% compared to the prior year, primarily driven by strong growth in North America. Third quarter ongoing business operating profit increased 34% to $353 million, up from $262 million in the prior year, driven by higher sales, ongoing cost productivity and the benefit from cost and capacity reductions, more than offsetting higher material cost and unfavorable currency.","The graph on Slide 27 illustrates expenses associated with our cost and capacity reduction program. The program results continue to be strong. For the full year, we still expect our program expense to be approximately $185 million, and we will deliver $175 million of operating profit benefit. We remain firmly on track to deliver the full $400 million in benefits we announced when the plan was initiated.","On Slide 28, you see that our actions to deploy cash this year are aligned with our previously communicated priorities, which include funding the business for growth, including capital expenditures, refinancing our long-term debt maturities and contributing to our pension. We are also returning to our shareholders through an increased dividend. And since resuming our share repurchase program earlier this year, we have repurchased $140 million of company stock, leaving $210 million in funds remaining under our existing board authorization. Also, as Mike mentioned, we are on track to acquire a 51% majority stake in China's Hefei Sanyo at the end of 2014.","Finally, in regards to next year's company outlook and consistent with prior years' practice, we will provide guidance for 2014 during our next conference call in late January, early February. However, we do anticipate continued earnings improvement, driven by both revenue growth and margin expansion. And given our cash flow generating capability and strong balance sheet, we will continue balancing funding for all aspects of our business to ensure the best long-term value creation for our shareholders.","Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","Thanks, Larry. Let me summarize on Slide 30. As we've said, both year-to-date and for the quarter, we're pleased with the progress that we're making in our results. And as we indicated, we have raised our guidance for 2013. Looking ahead, although we're not providing, today, any 2014 guidance, I did want to make clear the trends that we're seeing in the business. Overall, globally, although varied by market, we are seeing demand trends improving. We're very positive about our robust pipeline of new innovative products, and we expect it to have a positive impact on our customers and drive further revenue growth. We are seeing material costs, although still increasing, seeing the rate of that increase stabilizing. And we fully expect the current trends that we see in our business and our positive momentum to carry over through the fourth quarter and into next year. We also expect to get through the currency fluctuation impacts that we experienced in the first 3 quarters of the year. So as a result, we are generating very strong underlying cash and growing our investment capacity to deliver upon our cash priorities.","Finally, I would turn to Slide 31 and just say this is a slide we first introduced to investors in the fall of 2010 and say that we remain very confident in our opportunities to grow our business, expand our margins and generate strong free cash flow. We are executing on our long-term growth strategy to remain focused on delivering our shareholder value creation targets.","So with that, I'd like to open the line up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.","Tom Mahoney","This is Tom Mahoney on for Eric this morning. A question on the North America guidance for the fourth quarter. It looks like you're implying industry shipments up in the 10% range, which is pretty similar to what the industry did in the third quarter. What are you seeing in the market that gives you confidence in that forecast relative to the softer September shipment number we saw?","Marc R. Bitzer","Tom, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me try to answer it and break it up in pieces. First of all, I mean, the overall industry, again, August, the industry was up 15%. September was \"only\" up 6%, but the entire Q3 was strong at 10.4%. And basically, what we're saying, we see the current momentum continuing into Q4. Let me make a couple of comments on some noise, which was out there towards the end of the quarter, beginning of October. First of all, and we made this point earlier, I would be extremely cautious looking at weekly industry shipment data. Depending on where certain shipments fall into, that can make a big difference. For example, we know at least one big retailer who took Black Friday shipments in August as compared to September last year, and that makes a big difference. More importantly, to keep in mind that the data you sometimes see is shipment data. That is not sell-through data. If you would look at the sell-through data, and we have about 70% of our retailers participating, we saw a small decline towards the end of September, October. By the same token, the early indicators of last week are somewhere between strong and extremely strong. That's why I'm saying be careful about weekly shipment data. And we saw a small blip, but it's completely normalized, and that gives us a lot of confidence about the Q4 industry shipments.","Tom Mahoney","Great. And then what is the driver if you guys outperformed AHAM 6 on your unit shipments in the third quarter? What is the driver of that, and what has changed relative to the first half where you underperformed? And specifically, what areas in North America are you gaining share?","Marc R. Bitzer","Tom, it's again Marc Bitzer. Repeating a comment which we made at other earnings call, you're comparing T6 industry shipments with our overall unit shipments as we publish it. So there's a lot of things in units outside T6. There's also other products, like kitchen and small domestic appliances, which had a very strong Q3. So overall unit shipments, which we publish, are a lot of elements, way more than the just pure T6 where we look at the industry data -- or T7. Having said that, if you would just focus on the T7 and T6, I would say our market share is overall slightly stable and slightly down on a year-over-year basis. So it's not that we're kind of picking up huge market share, but we're pretty stable, which is a reflection of strong product launches, which we had. That's a positive. At the same time, we continue to stand firm on our promotional policy, which also means during the July promotion period, we lost a little bit of share, and picked it up back in August, September.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My first question, on North America, the improvement that you continue to see there is solid. And with an 11% margin this quarter, you're kind of getting back to the 11% type of margin that you did mid-cycle last cycle. And so my question is kind of twofold. One, do you remain confident? During the last quarter, you saw a little bit of blip up in promotional activity, and I think during the past cycle that pricing was a little bit more of an issue. Any update in terms of promotional activities as you've seen them year-to-date relative to your expectations? And I think, bigger picture, do you see any structural changes in the industry, particularly in the competitive makeup of North America, the competitive marketplace, that would or would not support margins in North America being higher this cycle than previous cycle?","Marc R. Bitzer","Mike, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me try to answer your question, which obviously has several pieces in there. Let me first make a comment on your word of mid-cycle. Mid-cycle implies that it's a normal cycle up and down. And I would like to remind ourselves, last year, same period, we already were trending towards operating margin of 7% or 8% in a bad industry environment. So what I would see right now is, to some extent, driven by industry, but to a much larger extent, driven by the actions which we took out on cost productivity, pricing, capacity reduction, et cetera. So we're kind of starting, if you want to say, for this industry cycle, on a much, much stronger base than, I would say and would argue compared to previous periods. So that's a big difference, which also means the industry volume is only one part of our strong margins, but not the only one. To your question about promotional activities, yes, we did see a slightly increased promotional activity by certain competitors who went pretty long on Black -- not Black Friday, on July 4th. We saw normal activities, what I would call, or as-expected activities around Labor Day. It's difficult to forecast what happens around Black Friday. And as you know, we don't comment on our future promotion plans. But I would argue, and we made the same comment in the Q2 earnings call, Q3 shows we stand firm behind our promotion policy, which means we will participate, but we will not participate when there is no value creation for either us or the trade partner.","Larry M. Venturelli","And Michael, this is Larry. One other thing, and just speaking in general for the company, when you talk about last cycle, our fixed cost structure is much different now than it was back then. So what you've seen in the last couple of quarters is the fact that we've seen revenue improvement volume increase on a much smaller fixed cost structure. So what you're actually seeing is just the power of the leverage.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, great, I appreciate that. And I guess, just flipping to the top line as my second question. You referred throughout the presentation, or here and there, and certainly, it's a big part of your longer-term strategy in terms of expanding adjacent revenue streams, growing beyond the core. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of, with the growth that you're seeing this year, the volume growth either globally or even by region would be more helpful, what you estimate that might have contributed to your results this year. And how do you think of that adjacent -- those adjacent streams -- of the 5% to 7% revenue growth, is that another -- is that a 1% to 2% driver, or how do you think about that? So kind of bigger picture, but also if you could provide any granularity on how it helped in 2013.","Jeff M. Fettig","Mike, I can give you directionally what we're doing there. There's a lot of different pieces of our extend businesses. And again, extend businesses are businesses that we're able to create revenues off of because of our strong core. And the expand businesses are, let's say, new or expanded spaces that we can apply our brands and operating execution to. And so it's a wide variety portfolio, but it's very tied to those 2 things. And I would say, with the exception of global compressors, they're all growing. And as I had indicated before, we would expect them to grow at about twice the rate of our global core appliance business, if you will. I would say, this year, they're probably -- they're growing much faster than our global core appliance business. And they have very attractive margins that improve with that growth. So it's meaningful. In total, it's over 25 -- or over 20% of our total revenues. It's growing at a faster rate. There's many different examples we could use, but -- and it varies a little bit around the world. But particularly in Latin America and North America, we have a very strong portfolio of these business activities that are working very well right now.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","I guess, just to pick up on Michael's question on the North America margins, if you take a look at where you were prior to Maytag, I mean, he was talking about 11% as mid-cycle. I remember quite a few quarters where you were putting up 12% kind of numbers and even, I'd say, 1 or 2 where you were pulling up a 13% handle. If you take kind of the capacity utilization numbers you've shared with us in the past and you take the contribution margin numbers you've shared with us in the past and you extrapolate that, it's pretty easy to get to kind of mid-teens margins for North America at full capacity. So why are we wrong to think about that as -- and I realize you can't control when you get to full capacity. That's a cyclical phenomenon. But why are we wrong to think about mid-cycle -- or peak margins as being mid-teens numbers?","Jeff M. Fettig","David, let me maybe take the macro view of that, and then I'd ask Marc to add his comments. First of all, I'd go back a little bit back to Marc's comment. I'm not sure that we could compare this to past cycles because the downturn was unlike any cycle we've ever seen. And so -- but on the demand, we're bullish in North America, and let's be clear, particularly in the United States. And that is because, from peak to trough, we're down 28%. The market is up 8% to 9% so far this year. So we still have a long way to go in terms of the drivers of demand. The housing market is moving in the right direction, we're very bullish on that. We think we'll see, over time, an acceleration in the replacement cycle based on the installed base. We expect to see -- and then very positively have seen the return of discretionary purchasers. So I think we're, as we've said before, at the beginning of a 3- or 5-year up cycle in demand. So your comment about increased production demand on capacity, it should be a positive productivity driver for us. The other thing, though, that I want to just make sure is clear with everyone on the call is it's a little bit comparing apples to oranges. The Whirlpool North America business today is the North America business 10 years ago. Post-Maytag, our portfolio mix changed dramatically. Now of course, we didn't -- it was not obvious to people because of the incredible downturn we saw in demand. But today, our brand -- our sale of products is significantly weighted toward own brands versus, in the past, a very high preponderance of OEM. That's a plus mix factor for us. We had elements of extend and expand. We now have businesses of extend and expand. And I don't want to miss out on what I think is the most important, is our rate of innovation, and the kings of innovation, is stronger than it's ever been. It's not even comparable to 10 years ago. So our portfolio is different today than it was a decade ago. So we're not going to give you a margin number. I would just say that we're committed to value creation. We're committed to both growth and margin expansion, and I think we have the tools to do that.","Marc R. Bitzer","David, it's Marc. Just to add a few comments on this one. First of all, just to echo what Jeff was saying, if you come back to this word of mid-cycle. If you look at the industry demand, I would strongly argue we're way, way earlier than mid-cycle, probably in the early innings of an industry recovery. And if you would look at typical demand cycles, even at the current growth rates, the industry is still below long-term trends. So we're far away from even remotely being at a mid-cycle in industry demand. So with this demand side, yes, I would say we're very bullish. Your question about the margin expectation, of course, we can't specify the exact margin forecast. To your point, it's driven by a number of factors. Capacity utilization or fixed cost leverage, because there's more than just factory capacity, is a big driver. And from that perspective, we are probably in a better shape than we ever have been, post-Maytag. The other parameters are materials. We can expect this leverage of commodity to cycle over and up, but right now, we see moderate materials. So that's the good news. But then you also have pricing, promotional activity versus volume, and as you can imagine, even with healthier margins, we are driving for -- harder for revenue growth. And that is an everyday decision, which we will continue to evaluate as we go into the respective quarters. But there's a couple of fundamental drivers which are part of this, but we also got to remind ourselves we're living in a competitive environment.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Great. Well, that was a great answer. Maybe I should've asked why we shouldn't expect high-teens margins. On Brazil, I wonder if you could just dig a little further into that. You put up a great volume number, despite the fact it sounds like your compressor units were down year-over-year. Can you just maybe break out for us how much of this might have been just acquired listings from sort of lost share by Mabe versus the innovation and the new product development? And then maybe you could just give us a feel for what non-Brazil versus Brazil look like.","Michael A. Todman","David, it's Mike Todman. First of all, let me just say, at the margin, the impact on price mix was positive for the quarter. So I think it's important to note -- to differentiate between ASVs and margin on price mix. And at the margin, we had -- actually, it was very strong, and we had good improvement. With respect to the overall ASVs and sales, I commented in the script on -- specifically on compressor sales, and we think we see those as just onetime temporary issues. We also did gain share in some categories that have lower price points. And so the fact of the matter is that did depress, if you will, our overall ASV, but those categories have very positive margins. So we actually felt -- we felt really good about the margins there. Outside of Brazil, we've got some markets that are very strong for us and where we had good growth. But then we've got markets like Argentina and Venezuela, where the demand was depressed. So overall, I'd say it was about stable. It was even if you take those 2 things in consideration.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Can you remind us what the percentage breakdown is between Brazil, non-Brazil and in Broco?","Larry M. Venturelli","The percentage of Brazil, non-Brazil, I believe probably around 60% of compressors would be Brazil.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","But in appliances?","Jeff M. Fettig","No, the Brazil appliance business...","Larry M. Venturelli","Was about $1.5 billion in total.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Just last question, if I could quickly. If you could talk about the Chinese acquisition and, I guess, the growth strategy once the deal closes? What's the 24-month to-do list look like? And how capital-intensive will that be?","Michael A. Todman","David, it's a little bit premature to talk about that. We're going through the regulatory approval process. Once we get through that process, we'll then provide a lot more color in terms of what we expect. I'll just -- suffice it to say, we're expecting some very positive contributions from the business and at very reasonable investment levels.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Denise Chai with Bank of America.","Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just want to ask some more questions on Latin America. We've been seeing some very positive data points from the big retailers in Brazil. So could you explain a bit about why you don't expect the subsidy program to have a relevant impact for appliances?","Michael A. Todman","Yes. Denise, it's Mike Todman. Right now, we have not seen a huge demand increase from that. What we have seen is -- and the overall Brazil market in the quarter was actually flat. So there's just the -- that's just distribution changes between different retailers. We have picked up a lot of share, so actually, we saw significant share growth in Brazil for the quarter. And we are now seeing some more positive consumer demand. So we're seeing, in the fourth quarter, pretty strong demand coming through, but we don't think that, that's just the appliance program. We think it's the overall consumer sentiment, you've seen that currency rates now stabilized, and it's those kind of things in the environment.","Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great, okay. And in Latin America, I believe you used to say that your market share was about 40%. Could you update us on that?","Michael A. Todman","Yes, we gained about 5 points of share, so we were up in the quarter to about 45%.","Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Wow, okay. And just lastly, so -- I mean, you lowered your Latin America industry volume guidance, but your volumes have been so strong. So I mean, could you comment a little bit more on the competitive environment and just where your share's been coming from, and also on the pricing environment, please?","Michael A. Todman","Yes. Well, I think you know, the competitive environment, we have one competitor who declared bankruptcy, and that's certainly been an opportunity for us. We continue to launch new products and new innovations into the marketplace, and so that's had a very positive impact for us. In fact, actually, we've taken price increases in the marketplace because of the currency and high inflation to be able to cover that. So that's been a positive as well. So overall, we feel pretty good about where this market is and where it's going.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Jeff, Marc, Larry. 11%. The last time you did that was 1Q '04. Can you talk about, in North America, how the seasonality of the business impacts margins to help give us a reference point for the current level of margins, kind of on a sequential basis?","Marc R. Bitzer","Ken, it's Marc Bitzer. And first of all, let me add a general comment. I would say the North America margin seasonality is probably less compared to Latin America or Europe. I mean, you just have much more seasonal blips. And so I would say in general terms, the seasonality in our North America business is fairly limited. There's a couple of pluses and minuses. But take, for example, Q4. Yes, you have a fairly long holiday period which -- that you have lower margin. On the other hand, you have other businesses around kitchen and small domestic, which are more attractive, so it's pretty much a balance act. Typically, our Q3 and Q4 are slightly more profitable than the first 2 quarters, but only to a lesser extent. So in general terms, I wouldn't look at, right now, Q3 and Q4 season numbers. I would rather call them run rates.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. The 9%, you're pretty much that range for 4Q. Obviously, you talked about people's perhaps misinterpretation of volatile weekly data vis-\u00e0-vis shipments, vis-\u00e0-vis POS, so I appreciate that. Could you give us a little more granularity around the contractor versus the replacement splits that you guys are seeing out there in North America?","Marc R. Bitzer","Ken, again, it's Marc Bitzer. I mean, obviously, we don't break down the forecast in terms of contract versus retail. But let me just...","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Or just the quarter.","Marc R. Bitzer","Let me -- just for Q3, the business which we call contract, i.e., these are the national, large national builders and also some of the small builders, has been very strong. We're talking about in the ballpark of 40% to 60% up. So this industry is growing exceptionally strong. I know there's been a lot of press reports about housing slowing down. We don't see that.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. When we think about your 4Q, can you just give us a sense for where -- how much inventory -- and it varies by some of the channels, obviously, but how much visibility you have into your forward activity? So if there are 2 weeks, I know retailers might have 2 weeks, some retailers don't have large inventory. Builders, you have larger visibility because you bring your product in at the very end. But could you give us a sense how much insight you have? Or do you focus more on the inventory levels that are there or more on the POS? How should we think about that?","Marc R. Bitzer","Again, Ken, it's Marc Bitzer. I mean, as much as we look about POS, we strongly look at inventory data from our retailers. And we typically have 70%, 80% of our retailers give us our -- their inventory data, so we have a pretty good visibility on this one. And yes, you're correct, it's a wide range. Some retailers, they don't hold inventory. Some other ones have 7% or 8% inventory. I would say the overall inventory level, with some pluses and minuses end of Q3, were balanced, i.e., there has not been significant inventory build. And we have also a little bit of inventory build towards the end of August. By the end of September, that's pretty much balanced out.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Now the margin gains that we did see, could you kind of help us think about -- I think, Larry, you kind of talked about a 20% general EBIT operating leverage in the business. I assume that's tied to volume. Can you tell us if that's correct, a? And then b, the improvement, how much of that is price mix, and how should we think about that?","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes, I think -- again, I think the incremental margins in general are right around what you had said, around 20%. What we saw in Q3 was about 0.5 point positive price mix. The cost and capacity reduction program contributed about 1 point. We were able to offset -- more than offset material cost and delivered about 0.5 points of productivity. And then marketing technology and product investments was approximately about 0.5 points. So we ended the quarter at about 7% to 8% [ph] profit margin. And the numbers I gave you is pretty much how we see the full year shaping up.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my last question, do appreciate it, what are you going to do with all this cash you're generating? I mean, you've highlighted this Hefei [indiscernible] absorbed 500 and change of capital at some point at the end of 2014. Given the generation of cash, more of it abroad than domestic, how do you guys look to deploy that capital? And what vehicles would you have to bring it back to the U.S., where you could pursue more share repurchase programs?","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes, I guess, I think we've been pretty consistent about usages of cash, and we're doing everything we spoke about earlier. So we increased the dividend this year. We did begin repurchasing stock. Mike talked about the Hefei Sanyo acquisition. And in addition to that, we continue to fund the business. So those are really the levers that we continue to look at over time as the company generates cash, and we look at all of them. So that would be how we would utilize cash going forward. As far as cash and cash location, we look for tax-efficient ways to bring cash back in to deploy cash. And certainly, in this case -- and if we have a great opportunity on an international opportunity in China that's going to be very value-creating for the company, and so what you've seen us is deploy cash, and we will deploy cash into China.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Two thrusts of my questions. First off, I noticed that the marketing and technology R&D costs are now less of a headwind by about 0.5 points on the margin for the year. What's the reasoning behind that? It seems -- I mean, superficially, at least from externally, it looks like you had a little bit more raw material inflation, and you're maybe offsetting it with less R&D and marketing costs. Am I looking at that wrong?","Larry M. Venturelli","Sam, this is Larry. I think probably what you're seeing is, as Jeff talked about earlier, industry guidance went up, so our sales forecast is up a bit. So we're getting a little bit more leverage on the dollars.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the absolute level of spending has not changed there. Is that accurate?","Larry M. Venturelli","That's correct. We're still spending incremental dollars this year over last year, so yes, that's true.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, good. Next question, and this is even more fine-tuning around Latin America, can you quantify the compressor negative impact -- or what compressors were down in the quarter and -- both on a sales and possibly an EBIT line for us? Then I've got a couple of quick follow-ups in Latin America, also.","Larry M. Venturelli","Sam, this is Larry again. Let me do it this way because there are some nuances in Latin America when you look at ASVs. So within sales, you have a mix -- as you know, you have a mix of appliances and compressors. And our reported units are only appliances. We do not report units of compressors. So if you were to do an apples-to-apples comparison and added the units to the compressors in sales, along with appliances, our ASVs were actually up. That's pretty much what I can provide you with.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So your ASVs were up. But can you help us with respect to what compressors were down and whether that's going to be a bleed-over into Q4?","Larry M. Venturelli","They were down -- again, Mike mentioned temporary reduction. So they were down in the double digits, and we do expect that to recover.","Michael A. Todman","Sam, just to add to that, I would say that what we expect is growth when you look at our total our business in the fourth quarter.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then BEFIEX remaining, and I noticed the run rate in Q4 is only $5 million. What do you expect the run rate for '14? And then also, for your industry growth expectation in Latin America of 1% for the year, can you remind us what that implies for fourth quarter industry shipments?","Larry M. Venturelli","A couple of questions. Let's handle BEFIEX first. We expect to end the year with around $90 million of credits, as we've talked before. About $50 million of that is related to legal fees, which we will not collect for several years. So really, you're talking a very small amount that would be monetized in 2014, around $40 million. That was your question in regards to BEFIEX. And what was your other question?","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Your 1% growth in Latin America for the year -- for the industry growth. What does that mean for Q4 specifically for the industry?","Larry M. Venturelli","You're probably talking up mid-single digits.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Up mid-single digits?","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes.","Operator","And I'd now like to turn the call back to our speakers for closing remarks.","Jeff M. Fettig","Well, listen, everyone. Again, we're pleased with the progress that we've made. Appreciate you participating on this call, and we'll look forward to updating you in late January. So thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's program. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you, and have a great day."],"22788":["Whirlpool Corp.

Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Chris Conley.","Chris Conley - Senior Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation fourth quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Marc Bitzer, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with a presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports, as well as on slide one and in the appendix of this presentation.","Turning to slide two, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think these adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation, beginning on slide 36, for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record revenue, ongoing profit, and earnings per share for full year 2015. Overall our integration activities in Europe and Asia progressed well and as planned, we delivered significant integration benefits both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our ability to deliver these record results, despite significant volatility in the global economic environment, does demonstrate the strength of our execution and the benefits of our larger global operating platform.","If you turn to slide five, I will review the 2015 financial results. Where you see that we delivered strong revenue growth for the year, our revenues were up 5% versus last year, and 18% excluding currency impact. Our ongoing business earnings were a record $12.38 per share, and as we expected, we delivered $620 million in free cash flow.","Turning to slide six, you can see our 2016 priorities in what we expect to be another record year. We do believe that the challenges we successfully managed in 2015 will carry over into 2016. And by that, we mean, we expect that emerging markets will continue to be weak or decline, but we do see that largely offset by growth in our developed markets. We also anticipate that the strong dollar era that we're experiencing will continue into this year. So within this environment, our focus in 2016 is to continue to grow revenues and we see great opportunities to expand our operating margins.","We plan to invest to grow globally in both our core appliance business and adjacent businesses. We will deliver significant new product innovation to the market. And we continue to expect to deliver very strong cost productivity.","So turning to slide seven where we show our guidance for 2016, we expect to deliver ongoing earnings per share of $14 to $14.75 a share which represents 15%-plus growth versus last year. We also expect free cash flow generation of between $700 million to $800 million, which is a substantial improvement versus the prior year. And while 2015 was a year where we faced several challenges, I think we were able to demonstrate our ability to create value for our shareholders through strong operational execution in this environment. And our current guidance reflects our expectation that this level of execution will continue as we do expect to deliver another year of record results in 2016.","So at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations.","Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide nine, we will review North America's performance in the fourth quarter. As emphasized in our last earnings call, our strategy in North America has not changed. We performed perfectly in line with our expectations as we grew revenues and substantially expanded margins in the fourth quarter. We grew our revenues 6.2% excluding currency and expanded operating margin to 12.4%, an all-time record. As expected, with our recently launched products fully available and nearly fully floored, the investments we made to drive growth in our U.S. business delivered sequential (05:07) market share improvement in the fourth quarter.","In addition to leverage from this revenue growth, our very strong operating margins in the fourth quarter were driven by our ongoing cost productivity programs and favorable mix from our new product introductions, which more than offset nearly $30 million in unfavorable currency impacts in Canada and Mexico.","Turning to slide 10, we outline our 2016 operation priorities for the North America region. Our expectation is that the industry will continue to show strong 5% annual growth behind improved housing trends and consumer sentiment. And we expect to grow our revenues at or above industry levels. We also expect to continue accelerating growth of our new products to capitalize on this increased consumer demand and to drive improved price, mix and revenue growth. Our strong cost productivity programs will continue to drive margin improvement and remain focused on growing outside the core. We anticipate that these actions will more than offset a point of margin impact from negative currency, based on today's rate for the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. We expect to deliver operating margins between 11.5% and 12.5%, which is fully in line with our long-term goals and another improvement over prior year.","I will now share the fourth quarter results for our Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, as shown on slide 11. Sales were $1.5 billion compared to $1.7 billion in the prior year. Excluding currencies, sales were up 8.1%. Ongoing operating profit was $88 million compared to $101 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. During the fourth quarter, strong execution of our integration plans and ongoing cost productivity mostly offset $45 million in unfavorable currency impacts, as well as the impact of a significant industry decline in Russia.","Last year, we saw an unusually strong fourth quarter in Russia, as trading consumers bought heavily ahead of devaluation. As planned and expected, we also invested in marketing technology and products this quarter. For the full year, we delivered 4.5% operating margin, which is fully consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the year, in spite of $160 million in currency impacts and weaker demand in Eastern Europe.","On slide 12, as we look towards the full year 2016, our priorities remain unchanged, with a strong focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity, and growth from new products, both within and beyond the core. We expect industry to be approximately flat to 2%, primarily driven by continued strong demand in Western Europe. Based on today's rate, weakness in the ruble and euro will continue, but we plan to more than offset over a point of margin impact from currency through ongoing cost productivity and acquisition synergies. Overall, we expect operating margins to be between 7% and 8% for the year, which is another substantial year-over-year improvement and very consistent with, and even ahead of, our long-term goals.","Now we'll discuss our Latin America results on slide 13. Sales for the quarter were $845 million. Excluding the impact of currencies, sales decreased 8%. Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $58 million, or nearly 7% of sales, which represents a substantial improvement in operating margin versus the prior two quarters. These margin levels are a clear indication that we have readjusted our business for today's operating environment through already deployed price, mix actions, and cost and capacity reductions.","On slide 14, we summarize our priorities in Latin America. We expect demand through continued volatility and are fully prepared to deploy further actions if necessary. We will continue to invest in new products, grow our business out of Brazil core appliances, and are well positioned to capitalize on growth in Brazil when demand does return. We expect industry decline of 10% and, based on today's rates, a half a point of margin impact from currency, primarily in the first half of the year. For growth in our non-Brazil operations, the benefits of previously announced cost based price increases, implemented reduction of fixed costs, and improved mix from our new products, we expect to mitigate both currency and demand impact.","Based on our expectations of demand down 10% and the Brazilian real at current spot rates, and with the benefit of our offsetting actions for 2016, we expect operating margins between 6.5% and 7.5%, despite lower revenue due to the currency and emerging market demand.","Now we turn to our fourth quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on slide 15. Net sales were $312 million, in comparison to $282 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, our sales increased 15%. Our fourth quarter ongoing operating profit was $11 million compared to $17 million in the prior-year period. Ongoing operating margins were 3.6%, driven by record margins in India and integration benefits in China that were offset by weak demand and increased product and marketing investments. While these investments in China temporarily reduced our margins in the fourth quarter, we expect them to lead to strong growth in margins in the future.","Turning to slide 16, we share our 2016 priorities for Asia operations. We will continue to focus on distribution expansion and ongoing cost productivity programs. Our expectation is for flat industry growth in the region. For additional clarity about our assumptions, we are forecasting a 5% industry growth in India and a 2% to 3% industry decline in China. Overall, we expect strong margin performance of 7% to 8%, driven by our larger growth platform and the benefits of our strong innovation pipeline.","Slide 17, we summarize our regional margin goals. We expect 2016 to be another year of record performance, and see opportunities for strong margin expansions in all regions.","And now I'd like to turn it over to Larry.","Larry M. Venturelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we had a solid year of performance. You may recall that we entered the year with significant currency headwinds and weakened emerging market demand. Given these challenges, our first half ongoing earnings of approximately $4.85 per share were flat with 2014. However, based on the actions we took throughout the year, we were able to deliver second half ongoing earnings of $7.55 per share, which is up 15% from last year's results. Our second half earnings momentum and our fourth quarter run rate entering 2016 are solid.","Turning to our fourth quarter results on slide 19 and 20, revenues were $5.6 billion, currency had $700 million top line impact, but excluding currency, sales were up 4%. We achieved all-time record ongoing earnings of $4.10 per share driven by acquisition synergies and ongoing cost productivity programs as well as price mix from new product introductions and previously announced cost-based price actions. You'll note from the slide that SG&A as a percent of sales on a GAAP basis decreased approximately 1.5 points. While we did make incrementally higher marketing investments this year to support our product introductions, those were more than offset by acquisition synergies and a planned reduction in acquisition related cost.","Our effective tax rate for the year was under 21%. This represents approximately a $0.20 improvement versus our prior full year guidance. In summary, we are pleased with the results for the quarter.","Now turning to 2016, we expect another record year. We will continue to be impacted by currency and emerging market demand. However, we are confident in the actions we are taking to offset these headwinds and deliver 15%-plus earnings per share growth in 2016.","First on slide 21, you can see that we absorbed nearly $6 from the combination of emerging market demand weakness and currency devaluation in 2015. As Marc discussed in the regional reviews, our operational focus and additional actions deployed during the year drove record revenue and earnings performance despite these challenges.","Now turning to slide 22, we share the 2016 assumptions for emerging market demand and currency headwinds included in our guidance. As Jeff mentioned, based on current exchange rates, we expect currency devaluation to continue although at a reduced level compared to the prior year. Accordingly, we anticipate a negative impact of approximately $1 billion in sales and $2.50 in earnings per share from currency headwinds. Additionally, we are anticipating continued demand weakness in most emerging markets, as a result we will offset $0.50 in earnings per share impact from that. It's important to note that these emerging market countries now represent 15% of our global sales.","Finally, on slides 23 and 25, we summarize key actions that we expect will offset the impact from currency and emerging market demand. We expect another very strong year in total cost productivity given material trends, fixed cost reductions taken in Brazil, and our normal productivity programs. Our acquisition synergies, tighter cost and capacity reduction activities will ramp up during 2016. We expect solid demand trends in developed markets combined with positive impact from previous and new product launches and growth in adjacent businesses. And our previously announced cost based price increases in Canada, Brazil, and Russia are in full effect.","On slide 24, you can see an update on the progress of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities. We incurred $200 million in restructuring expense and delivered $200 million in benefits this year consistent with previous communications. For 2016, we expect $250 million in expense and continue to expect $175 million in benefits.","On slide 26, we highlight the cadence of half one versus half two earnings drivers we just addressed. First, given historical seasonality, volume is stronger in the second half of the year. In addition, we should have lower currency headwinds in the back half of the year based on current rates. Traditionally, we see much stronger seasonality in our cost productivity programs in second half of the year and our acquisition synergies will ramp up throughout the year. As a result, we would expect full-year earnings seasonality to approximate 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half.","On slide 27, our 2016 guidance is to deliver record ongoing earnings of $14 to 14.75 per share, a 15% increase year-over-year. We are forecasting approximately $700 million to $800 million of free cash flow which includes planned cash outlays of up to $200 million in restructuring related to the acquisitions, $150 million related to our previously announced product warranty cost in Europe, and capital spending of between $700 million to $750 million.","Our priorities for cash deployment have not changed as shown on slide 28. We did repurchase $155 million of stock during the fourth quarter and have $225 million remaining on our existing authorization. We expect to complete our current share repurchase authorization this year.","Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Larry. I'd now like to take a moment to update you on our long-range goals that we first outlined at our December 2014 Investor Day conference. Overall, our long-term strategy remains on track, and we see tremendous opportunities from our larger global footprint, our leading position in key markets around the world, our continuation of stepping up levels of new product innovation, our strong brand portfolio with seven powerful brands, each with over a billion dollars in revenues, and over the mid-to-longer term, we do believe that our leading positions in several key emerging markets will be a great advantage for us.","So then turning to slide 31, I would like to summarize our updated management goals. And again, as we discussed earlier, last year and carrying over into this year, we have been hit by declines in emerging market demands and significant currency valuations. And this is really the only driver of our changing goals because this has had a large impact on our original sales goal. As a result, we now believe we can grow our revenues to $23 billion to $24 billion in sales by 2018 versus our previous goal of $26 billion to $28 billion. And again, the difference is essentially all purely from currency translation.","Because we have rapidly adjusted to the changed global environment through our previously announced cost based price increases, fixed cost reductions, and continued investment in new product innovation, and we will continue to do so as we go forward. We are offsetting these impacts previously discussed with what I believe is very strong operational execution, and as a result, we still expect to deliver operating margins consistent with our 2018 goals. So, we haven't changed our view at all that we can deliver double-digit operating margins globally. And with that, we expect to reach also our goal of doubling our free cash flow by 2018.","In total, this will lead to strong earnings growth, and we now plan to deliver strong growth in earnings per share to $20 to $22 per share in 2018. Again, the difference between this and the previous is simply a reduction in revenues due to currency. These revised targets would represent an improvement of 60% to 80% over today's levels of earnings and represent exceptionally strong value creation. As always, there are risks of us putting out long-range goals like this, right, but I think as we've demonstrated last year, we have been able to adjust to the environment and still deliver strong results.","So turning to slide 32, you can very specifically see the drivers in our ongoing earnings per share improvements. And again, we have multiple paths to drive value creation. We'll drive it through growth, acquisition synergies and cost productivities. And these big levers that we outlined in December of 2014 have not changed.","We are on track with our acquisition synergies in Europe, and we expect an additional $2 to $3 per share in benefits by 2018. We are assuming demand in emerging markets like Brazil, Russia and China begin to stabilize in 2017, but likely only drive moderate recovery growth during this planning cycle, and we don't expect to see that until 2018. Additionally, demand in the U.S. is rebounding consistent with our Investor Day assumptions, and we continue to see solid growth in our adjacent businesses. We also now are seeing more and more growth which is enabled by our Indesit and China acquisitions, which are now part of our baseline revenue assumptions.","And finally, and importantly from a cost productivity perspective, we fully expect to continue with strong ongoing annual productivity improvements in addition to the benefits from favorable input costs that we're currently seeing, and we see great opportunities to further leverage benefits from our global operating platform. And I think over the last couple of years, we've had a good track record of delivering on those type of benefits. So to sum up, we do expect to grow earnings per share by nearly 60% to 80% over the next three years to between $20 and $22 per share.","And then on slide 33, you can see the walk on how we expect to double our free cash flow. And as you can see from this chart, cash flow growth is largely earnings driven. Working capital is just a bit higher due to growth in the business. We don't expect any fundamental changes in our rate of capital expenditures which run about 3.5%. And this has not changed.","So turning to slide 34, I'd just reconfirm we are committed to achieving our vision of becoming the best global branded consumer products company. As a reminder, we are number-one globally in three out of the four regions in the world. We're the largest western company in Asia. We have a top market position in five of the top seven largest appliance markets in Europe, and we also have the number-one position in U.S., Canada and Brazil. So in total, we have very high confidence that our growth plans give us an outstanding opportunity to continue driving significant shareholder returns. And we believe 2016 will be a strong step forward towards reaching our 2018 goals.","So with that, I will end our formal remarks, and we would like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We can take our first question from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Please go head.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, Jeff, Larry, Marc. How are you?","Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Great.","Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Sam.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I've got a couple questions here. First off, regarding Latin America, Jeff, you're looking at a margin up 1% or 2% year-on-year on obviously a continued very challenging times. You don't normally do this, but can you help us with what your margin expectations are for the sub-components of that region for the Brazilian white goods, Embraco and the non-Brazilian white goods just to get a sense of what that margin growth means year-on-year?","Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Sam, I mean, just breaking that out, I won't give you specific, but I'll give you directionally. I mean, there are three or perhaps four segments you can look in that business. The most impacted for all the reasons we talked about is the Brazilian appliance business because of the currency and because demand being down almost 25% with the expectation \u2013 so that's where the heavy hit. But I would say and I think I said this before, we've been in Brazil market for over 60 years and we've never lost money in that market, and we continue to be in a positive-profit position. So even in that tough situation \u2013 but our margins were hurt very badly in appliances.","In our adjacent businesses, other than offsetting the inflation, they've remained intact. Embraco, which is our global compressor business, was hurt by demand in emerging markets and currency but not nearly as much. And we had a reasonably good year in Embraco. And our international, I would just say that it got hit by all the same currency deval \u2013 the currency devaluations came at different times. We have a big position, for example, to Colombia. Colombia pesos devalued by 50%. Late in the year, Argentina obviously devalued. So we adjust, but there's a larger basket of countries to do. So those margins, although hurt some, were not hurt as bad.","So the predominant work, I would say, has been to do \u2013 which we've already announced, the cost-based price increases which we've already announced and carry over into this year. We've done significant fixed-cost reduction, almost 30%, I think. We drive the heck out of productivity, but we still have to offset inflation and negative demand. So \u2013 and I think Marc said it exactly correct. If you, based on our assumption of today's spot in currency and the market going down another 10%, we feel pretty good about our ability to improve our margins. If we have another round of volatility, we'll have to adjust again. And we're fully prepared to do that.","Larry M. Venturelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And the only other thing I'd add to Jeff's, is Sam, is just remember that pricing increases went into effect throughout last year. Production \u2013 fixed cost reductions were taken throughout last year, so you still haven't seen the full run rate in the margins in the fourth quarter exit rate.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Two more quick questions, if I could, housekeeping related. First off, the fourth quarter, your free cash flow was below where your guidance was, the implied guidance. Now I know some of that I think is pension contributions, some of it is a little maybe lower CapEx, but it doesn't explain the entirety of the variance, Larry. Could you help us with what happened in free cash flow in the fourth quarter?","Larry M. Venturelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No. I think, Sam, I think we guided to $600 million to $700 million. I believe we ended up at $620 million. So pretty close to the midpoint. I'd say that working capital was a little bit higher, but that was more due to timing in receivables than anything else. So I think we were very happy with where we ended up, and pretty much consistent with our guidance.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And then the last question, as it relates to 2016 guidance, could you help us with what your expectations are for raw materials and tax and pension and some of the other below-the-line items?","Larry M. Venturelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I can help you with some of the below-the-line items, Sam. Tax rate, in the prepared remarks we said 22% to 24%. And then you also asked about pension. We will not have a pension contribution this year. We're fully funded from a funding perspective, so you will not see a U.S. contribution this year. You'll see a small amount that will go out for the foreign plans.","Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And, Sam, on the cost side, if you look at the walk that Larry provided for the margins, I think \u2013 the way I would look at costs are, we're going to have a very significant cost year this year. And we do look at total cost, which is comprised of our synergies, our restructuring, as well as our ongoing productivity, which includes change in raw material costs. And, as we talk about \u2013 and by the way, that we think that's the best way to look at it, because that gives you a net number, which you ought to expect to see in the P&L or in the margins, which is what we show.","The challenge talking about \u2013 which caused a little bit of confusion last year is, when you have this volatility in currency, we certainly saw lower net material costs last year. I think we said over $100 million. But we also had \u2013 part of that \u2013 the actual gross number was higher than that, but it's offset by currency increases in markets like Brazil and Russia and so on and so forth. So, bottom line is, we're going to have a big year of productivity. If you look at the margin walk, it's roughly, between all those factors, is about a $400 million reduction of which I would suspect, net, and it really depends on currency, raw materials ought to be \u2013 we ought to expect the same kind of improvement that we saw this year.","Operator","And our next question will come from Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Nice quarter, Jeff, and great execution. I was hoping you guys, and maybe Marc, could touch on the North American market. It looks like you guys got 3% volume. I wanted to also understand your assumptions. Your press release says 5% growth. How do you think about volumes going into 2016, and with that, I noticed price was also up slightly more than three points in North America? That's probably something I wasn't expecting to that extent of strength. What's the promotional environment like, and what are your expectations for volume in 2016 in North America?","Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Bob, it's Marc. Let me try to answer these multiple questions. Let me actually start with, first off, by saying we're very pleased with our North America Q4, and I know there were some concerns out there, but these results would have quiet down a lot of concerns. Let me first of all, on the units, because you mentioned the 3% unit; first of all, and we said that in a number of previous calls, our unit shipments are not comparable to what is AM published numbers, because we include a lot more now (30:31) units. So the numbers are not fully comparable.","Having said that, what you can compare is our unit growth versus our organic net sales growth, so the 3% versus 6%. And you're exactly right. I mean, that shows you just how strong our price mix was, which is the full result of disciplined promotion management and finally the results of our new product introductions. So to have that kind of a lift in such a promotional environment is an achievement we're very proud of. Now let me put it in broader context of the fourth quarter.","Again, we delivered good ex-currency revenue growth, 6%, record margin of 12.4%, which is exactly what we said we would do, drive growth and margin expansion. What is also important to know, we had ex-currency revenue growth in all our business units, so Canada, Mexico, small domestic, majors, core appliances, which also means we had sequential market share growth Q4 compared to Q3, which is something which, as you know, we've been driving for very hard.","So now with regards to your question about our expectations for next year's market, as you know, we guide industry to 5%. As I also said in my prepared remarks, we fully expect to grow our revenue in line or above that market assumption. That's what we guide to, and that's our expectation, based on run rates which we have developed, based on new product introductions.","So we're \u2013 I think, we'd say very confident behind these assumptions. Towards the \u2013 we're coming to work with a broader industry assumption of 5%. As you know, as we guided into 2015, we initially came up with 4% and we lifted to 5%, 5% plus. The final number was 6.5%. Beginning of a year, many people questioned if North America would come to these growth levels, and North America as an industry did. That is still largely driven, the confidence for 5%, we still do believe the housing is at best midpoint of a housing recovery in terms of cycle. We do see consumer sentiment becoming bigger. We do see wealth creation on the mid and lower income levels. So all these factors if you put it in our macroeconomic model, you'll have a lot of confidence behind the 5% industry growth.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. That makes a lot of sense, and thanks for the detail on North America. Kind of jump ball in terms of question, I'd love to understand two things; one, the margin walk between 2015 and 2016 in Europe to get to that 7% to 8% range, what's your confidence in executing against plan? And putting aside the fact that we understand things change quickly in emerging markets, what's the likelihood that you can actually achieve positive margin momentum in Latin America? And are you confident that Brazil will not lose money? That's a lot of stuff, but if you could just take it in part, that would be great.","Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","So, Bob, it's Marc again. So let me first answer Europe and Middle East and Africa. As you know, we guided at the beginning of 2015 4% to 5%, and we hit exact in the midpoint. I would say probably now some people may be surprised that we're guiding out towards 7% or 8% which, as you recall, that was pretty much our targets yesterday. (33:54). We are fully confident on that 7% to 8% and the confidence comes from we do see the benefits from restructuring synergies and ongoing cost productivity.","So which, as you know when you run a business, if you have a confidence in cost, that gives you a lot of confidence. It's just much more predictable than any top line assumptions. And if you look at 2015, there was largely costs, total costs driven, and we know we have a momentum. We know we have agreement on certain restructuring activities and that carries into 2016. You will also note that our volume assumption for industry is actually not overly bullish. It's 0% to 2%. And frankly, that magnitude between 0% and 2% is entirely driven by what happens to Russia. So we basically we're not overly bullish on Russia. If Russia comes around faster, which we've seen in prior decades and cycles, then you could see an upside versus the 2%. But that's a big assumption right now. But again in Europe, in our view, on all quarters they delivered like a clockwork, and that gives us a lot of confidence for 2016 as well.","On Latin America, I'm going to get back to Jeff's comments. First of all, let me underline Latin America is obviously heavily influenced by what assumption you take on Brazil industry growth and the real. So on today's spot rate of real and with the assumption that Brazil goes down another 10%, which pretty much will be consistent with what we see right now, so further deterioration of a marketplace based on our already taken cost actions and price mix which we have already deployed. We are very confident to hit that 6.5% to 7.5%. Which is, by the way, it's not too far away from what we had in Q4. So it's not like we were \u2013 from a run rate perspective, it's not like we're planning for a huge step-up. But again, I want to reiterate that's a big assumption about real exchange rates. And we've seen dramatic moves this year, and it's a big assumption about the industry.","Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, only add the color on that, that Marc had was that this 10% decline is our forecast for demand for the year in Brazil. You know, if you look at the progression of decline throughout 2015, fourth quarter was the worst at almost 25%. So as this carries over, our belief is the full year probably plus or minus is minus 10%. But by definition, it will be higher in Q1 and Q2.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Denise Chai with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Just want to go back to North America. Could you talk a little bit about how market shares have shifted in the last year and also comment on the impact of product transition on product availability in the past year? Because I think Marc said that the new products were fully available and almost fully floored, so just wondering when that's going to be resolved. Thank you.","Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. So, Denise. It's Marc again. Let me try to answer that. So first of all, as I indicated in Q4, we had sequential market share growth. On a year-over-year comparison, we had a slight market share loss, that's basic of a carry forward of momentum which we had from the mid-cycle. But again, the important thing is sequentially we see the business growing in the critical categories. Now that is a very important element of this one. To my earlier comment about product introductions, as you are well aware, we had a lot of product introductions the last 18 months in North America. There was laundry, there was pretty much an entire refrigeration line which was driven by energy standards.","So we had \u2013 we are behind an unusual high amount of product introductions which, of course, always has a certain impact on the top line. It's not just availability. It's just the ramp up, ramp down, re-flooring. You know whenever you do that, you have an impact. But availability supply chain from ex-factory is fully restored. We're not yet 100% completed with the flooring, but it's pretty much 80% to 90% done on the major product introductions.","Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks. And just a follow-up on the realized synergies in 2015?","Larry M. Venturelli - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I mean, we said, Denise, in the prepared remarks between restructuring and synergies we had about $200 million. It was very consistent with what we said before. And synergies on both Europe and Chinese business came in exactly what we said.","Operator","And our next question comes from Megan McGrath with MKM Partners.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Good morning. So just a quick follow-up on North America. In terms of the competitive environment, could you just give us an update on that? Certainly don't expect you to say that it got a lot better, but was there any change? You talked a lot about the breadth versus the depth of the promotions that you saw starting last summer. And any early indications in the early part of the year about what you're seeing there?","Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Megan, it's Marc. Let me try to answer. During our last earnings call, we said we had a slightly elevated promotional intensity out there in the markets, and I would say but it was pretty much consistent also in Q4. In our \u2013 in that environment, we stuck to the strategy which we had for the last couple years. We participate when we create value for our brands in our company. That's what we've done. So in that promotional environment, which year-over-year was maybe slightly more intense, we basically fully relied on our new products. That's what drove the margin and the price mix impact in that environment. It's hard to of course anticipate what happens in 2016, and it's way too early in the year. But right now I would expect similar environment like the back half of 2015.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then I guess I want to touch on Asia because it's the one region no one has asked about yet. But can you talk us a little bit through this nice guidance that you have out there for the full year, but 4Q did drop off. You said you increased some expenses on marketing and other investments in the quarter. Is there any seasonality involved that we should think about when we're modeling 2016? And could you maybe talk us through some of those investments that you made, are any of those going to carry into let's say the first part of 2016 as well.","Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Megan, it's Marc again. Again, conceptually you've got to split the Asia business into a largely India business and the China business and some other smaller business. Our India business is in \u2013 which is by the way a publicly traded company is in very good shape, strong margins, steady margins, and had also really strong Q4. In China, we had I wouldn't call it seasonality. It's an anomaly. We basically had a one-time investment in certain go to markets, and particularly in certain technology investments which are largely related to introduction of new washers which come to the market in April. So I would not factor that in, in an ongoing model because we know it's largely one-time expenses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Samuel Eisner with Goldman Sachs. Please go head.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, good morning, everyone.","Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So just going back to the China comments, I think there was some commentary that was given there where you guys are expecting down volumes for that market. Can you talk a little bit about how the integration of the (41:10) transaction now that you're such a large part of that market? Just kind of wouldn't that help out the overall volumes of the market? I just want to better understand what you're seeing on the ground level.","Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Sam, it's Marc. Again, China as a market as a single market from an industry perspective did not grow in 2015, and in fact it was down on the T2 level by minus 2%. We, in our prepared remarks, guided towards a minus 3% for next year. So pretty, by and large, similar environment in China overall. We just don't see right now the consumer sentiment and the housing activity strong enough to hit into positive territory. Of course that can change in that context, but right now that's our assumption going into the 2016 year, and that is also based on fairly recent inputs from trade partners.","So we're \u2013 that's what it is. It's of course a change compared to two years or three years ago, but I think we have a way to operate in that environment. The integration overall is successful. Of course there's a lot of work, and as you put together different brands, but it is successful. It is on track. And we're kind of as you see from the guidance, we're guiding towards 7% to 8% for 2016, which by definition cannot only come from India. So we anticipate also strong progress on our not only synergy from the cost side but also from the revenue synergies on the China piece of integration.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And then just switching gears back to North America, can you just give a comment about how inventories stand right now in the channel? What are your retailers showing? There was some chatter in the fourth quarter that there was a good amount of sell into, so just curious what you guys are seeing at the retail level. Thanks.","Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, Sam, it's Marc again. I mean, again if you take the Q4 as an industry, and there are first of all there is not fully reliable sell in sell out statistics for North America, so that's based on the data which we've seen and how we triangulate it, you always have in Q4 in the beginning a heavy sell into the promotion periods. If you just look at the quarter overall, we do not see elevated inventory levels as the year begins. If at all, I would almost argue the opposite. Regional inventories are not significantly elevated. As the year begins, it's a pretty normal situation. But, yes, there was quite a bit of load into promotions in October and November.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jay McCanless with Sterne Agee.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee | CRT","Hi. With GE potentially being sold to another buyer, are you seeing any impact on the ground either in North America or in the Chinese market as that deal progresses? And if so, what steps are you taking to get in front of that.","Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Jay, this is Jeff. You know, the question about are we seeing anything in the market in either market, I think the answer would be no. The GE business, you know the story. I mean, they had an agreement with Electrolux, time expired, it didn't go through, it's clear and it's been clear for some time that General Electric would sell their appliance business. So the global people that you would expect to look at it had plenty of time to look at it. And obviously they wound up getting a substantially improved offer from Haier, and so from that standpoint, they'll go through their process, and we'll know in four, five, six months how that's going to turn out.","But the question is have we seen any changes? No. I mean, we compete with both companies. Haier is a very substantial competitor in China, very successful, and has created value doing that. General Electric has been a very good and tough competitor in the U.S. for forever. So, Chinese companies wanting to have a good market position in the U.S., this is an attractive opportunity. And they apparently agreed, and that's probably why they paid the price they did.","Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee | CRT","Great, and thank you for that. The second question I have, and I think you guys touched on this earlier, but just with the decelerating year-over-year increase in North American units, do you feel like you're on the cusp of changing that through either growth in housing starts or a pickup in renovation remodel? And I apologize if I missed it, but if you all could comment on where you think unit growth should go in North America this year, especially in the U.S.?","Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Jay, it's Marc. I wouldn't read too much into our guidance of 5% versus the 6%, of which I wouldn't call that a deceleration. The 5% is a midpoint of a spectrum, which is probably, you can put it 4% to 6% or maybe even 4% to 7%, whatever. And a lot is driven by the housing consumer sentiment. So I would still refer to U.S. is midpoint of a recovery cycle, of a long-term recovery cycle. I don't see the end of a cycle. I don't see the deceleration. And the 5% is not a precise number. It's a range, and it could well be that we'll see 6% at the end (46:48).","Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","And Jay, we didn't include it in this deck, but I think we have it in our Investor Day site, that what we outlined actually three years ago was, particularly in the case of the U.S., where the industry demand was relative to our 30-year average. And basically, the bubble of 2003 to 2005, the decline, the financial recession, so on and so forth. And we kind of laid out what we thought was a reasonable path of recovery.","And to Marc's point, we view we're only (47:26) at the midpoint. And if you look at the last three years, I would say our forecasts were actually pretty good, plus or minus 1 point, I think. And we're still underneath a 30-year growth rate trend in the United States. So we still have, in our opinion, pent-up demand, as well as \u2013 every piece of the drivers of demand: replacement, new housing, existing home sales, and discretionary are going in the right direction. So we view it as a very positive spot. And to Marc's point, it can be 5%, it can be 4%, it can be 6%.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen.","Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning, Ken.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Lot of slides in the deck there. In Europe, considering that with such an important acquisition and profit driver, can you get \u2013 you talked about cost restructuring. Can you get a little more granular? Is it just on the execution of the cost side that you're expanding the margins, or are you actually \u2013 can you describe the perhaps in-country dynamic that you're experiencing with this larger portfolio? I mean, are you able to get better positions with the key retailers in countries, or what else is driving this? Because given the realization of this margin in 2016, it seems to indicate, in fact, you might be realizing higher margins longer term than you've guided here in that long-term guidance.","Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Ken, it's Marc. Let me first try to explain what happened in 2015 and then maybe give an indication for 2016, and how these dynamics come together. If you just look at the full-year P&L in Europe, you realize there's \u2013 if you take up the currency impact, there's a small revenue growth, but the margin growth or expansion came largely from the cost side, to be very straightforward. And the cost side on the other hand, yes, there's some ongoing productivity coming from raw materials, which in the case for Europe, is largely offset through negative currency. That's a transactional impact.","So the net-net bulk comes largely from realizing the synergies in procurement, in footprint, in SG&A. So if you want state of (49:47) 2015 was largely a restructuring and synergy play. It is, however, important to note that the fact that we held the top line in year one in a post-merger integration is a big deal. Because you typically would see, in such a competitive environment, that you're being attacked from all sides. And we even grow it, and some people ask us about the different pieces. Even if you break down the two legacy pieces, both elements grew organically which, again, is a big deal in year one after such a complex integration.","Now shifting gears into 2016, again, the cost side are carryover benefits and certain restructuring initiatives which we have just initiated and announced. So that just gives you an unusual high amount of confidence, because you're not relying on certain raw material assumptions, whatever, it's in your control. And I would say, off a margin improvement and profit in Europe, for 2016 it's still, 70% or 80% is cost driven. Now ultimately it comes back to the question of how much revenue growth can you drive with that brand and product portfolio?","I would expect, and now I'm coming back to more Jeff's point, the long-term plan. In the planning horizon, 2017, 2018, that's when you start seeing the revenue growth coming in. And the simple reason for that one, it just takes a while to have all these product platform integration plans, because that's the most complicated process. And you see we already put a lot of new products now in the market. The vast majority of the new joint products basically come 2017 and 2018, and that's when you should expect the top-line growth. Even in the interim, and that's an important thing is, as you know, one of our biggest attractions of the (15:32) why we bought it, is ultimately the strong country position. We're number one in five of the top seven markets and (15:41) profit of Europe. Our market share in these top five markets has held up or even expanded in the last year. So that's a very, very important achievement for us.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that. And then, Jeff, given all the product transitions and rollouts that you had this year, I mean, I think in one of the conference calls, one quarter or two quarters ago, you said in hindsight perhaps you wouldn't have had so many moving parts at one time. Are there any operational\/executional issues that are happening in 2016 that we could be aware of that you're a little more focused on just so we don't find out that you are worried about it in hindsight?","Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Ken, if I can really simplify and give you a couple perspectives. We did have and we talked about some very, very large new product transitions which affected millions of units of volume. Okay? We always have product transitions. So that is not new. And I would say if the rest of the world was somewhat stable that you wouldn't have probably even noticed the impact of the product transition problems we had last year. But the fact of the matter is, we had, and the way I've described it, the currency devaluation and it's part of life, but it is the most impact in moving currencies we've seen ever since we track currency. It cost us over $4 a share. And at the same time, emerging markets in general, particularly Latin America, it seems like a long time ago, but in 2014, we had an all-time record year in Latin America. Last year, one year, our earnings went down by $300 million and cash went down by $300 million. We had record years in every other region in the world. So it wasn't the operational challenges we had on product trends, it was that on top of dealing with a massive currency issue, a massive decline in demand issue, and it means we had to do other things really well to still grow our earnings by 9% last year.","So let's fast-forward into this year. And I should say we did very well on the cost side last year for a host of reasons, including the synergies, the restructuring, raw material markets, et cetera. So coming into this year, what we all have to mention is we still have big currency and demand headwinds, but they're less than half the size of last year. If things stay as we see them today, we're going to have another great year of cost productivity. And I would say we have no major known operational execution problems today like we had a year ago. So that's I guess as clear as I could try to be to hopefully address your point.","Operator","Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah, congratulations on a good quarter in a tough environment.","Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, David.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","I want to just maybe pick up on a couple of other questions that have been asked, and first is really just what we're talking about product availability. Assuming that you've addressed this and you get that business back in 2016, what does that represent in terms of incremental North American revenue?","Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","David, it's Marc. It's hard to quantify, and obviously we wouldn't want to quantify for competitive reasons. But there is in particular in the first half of 2015 and Q3 we were impacted. Not just by availability, it's also flooring and the new product introductions, and that's by definition. Again, as I said before in Q4, that was behind us. So it's largely behind us. But yes, in total, you probably have more than a point of market share.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","More than a point of market share?","Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Good. Secondly, just can you talk about Canadian and Mexican operations and specifically what impact weaker demand had on that 2.9% North American segment unit growth number?","Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, David, it's Marc again. First of all, often when you look at the numbers, yes, the Canadian market was down 8% in Q4, and to put in context, Canadian markets in the financial recession did not dip as deep as North America. So it held up for much longer. But obviously with consumer confidence, oil, the Canadian market is soft, and we do expect it to be soft also going forward.","In addition to the markets \u2013 and as we in the investor meeting showed, Canada used to be roughly $1 billion business for us. That was in the old currency exchange rate. So you have a demand side. And on top of that, the currency move for Canadian dollar has been massive. Keeping in mind this no production in Canada, so you have a full currency impact. Having said that, in context I think our team through very disciplined cost based price increase, which we already had announced and executed, we maintained a good margin, unfortunately at much lower base. But the margin in Canada is very intact, very robust, but it's just a much lower base.","Mexico is slightly different story. The Mexican market is steady pretty much, slightly down, but there's not a huge downside as in Canada. Mexico is a top line issue because also you have Mexican peso was MXN 18, it's just dramatically devalued. And so that has obviously a negative impact on the pure revenue side. It doesn't impact us so much on the ongoing margin side because our Mexican production is 60% local to local production or 70%.","Operator","Our next question will come from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.","Thomas McNally Mahoney - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good morning. This is Tom on for Eric. I was wondering if you could size the savings from favorable input costs within 4Q, and 2015 more specifically. And then anything directionally you can give us on how that flowed through by segment in 2015?","Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","This is Jeff. Actually I don't have that level of detail in front of us, because our input costs, we buy obviously all the time, but we have contracts, we have hedges, so on and so forth, and we have that information, I just don't \u2013 we don't have it in front of us right now.","Marc Robert Bitzer - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, what Jeff said is in his prepared remarks, the total productivity would be 1.5 points to 2 points, and we'd expect each region of the world to have productivity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get a little more granular on a couple of things. First off, the 15% of global sales I think that you highlighted was your total emerging market's exposure. Just wanted to get a sense, was that on 2015 revenues or expected 2016 revenues? And if you could at least give a sense of a breakdown of the order of magnitude? I assume Brazil is the largest, but some of the other components by country?","Jeff M. Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Michael, to answer your question, what I would say is that that's on 2016 base, the 15%. In order of magnitude, obviously Brazil would be our largest emerging market followed by China. It would be Brazil, China, Russia, and then India.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'll return the floor to Mr. Chris Conley for closing comments.","Chris Conley - Senior Director-Investor Relations","Well, listen, everyone, we appreciate you joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you at our next earnings call.

Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Joe Lovechio.","Joseph Lovechio","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation Fourth Quarter 2013 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Presidents Mike Todman and Marc Bitzer; as well as Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, as well as in the appendix of this presentation.","Turning to Slide 3, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 42 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you saw in the earnings release from early this morning, the strong execution of our plans drove record earnings for our company in 2013. We continue to successfully drive both revenue growth and margin expansion, leveraging our industry-leading brands and innovating new product launches into the marketplace. This marks the eighth quarter in a row of ongoing business operations margin expansion for us. And as a result, we generated strong cash flow, ending the year with a very strong balance sheet and increased investment capacity.","Our full year 2013 results are summarized on Slide 6. Our revenues were up over 4% versus last year, excluding foreign currency and BEFIEX, led by strong growth in our North American and Latin American businesses. And in line with our previously increased guidance, diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved to $2.97 for the year or up 42%, in total, delivering $10.02 per share compared to $7.05 last year. Our free cash flow tripled year-over-year with a $460 million increase to $690 million. And overall, we effectively deployed that cash in line with our previously discussed priorities.","So if you turn to Slide 7 and 8, we highlight our business priorities for 2014, building upon the progress we made last year. Overall, we remain very confident in our abilities to continue to grow revenues and expand margins. As we expect to grow organically and improve our mix with our innovative new product launches, we expect to continue to accelerate growth well beyond the core, extend and expand businesses, and we expect margin expansion with the execution of ongoing cost productivity programs, additional cost and capacity reductions, as well as improved price\/mix and the impact on our margins.","We also expect to complete the acquisition as a majority shareholder of Hefei Sanyo, which we expect will enable significant emerging market growth in China in the future. All totaled, we believe these actions will more than offset some headwinds that we see in 3 areas: one is continued increases in material and oil-related costs; second is the negative impact of foreign currency; and third is the inflation that we continue to see in emerging markets. But as a result of this in total, we do expect to be in a strong financial position to continue to invest strongly in our business and deliver strong levels of free cash flow.","Turning to Slide 9, you'll see our expectations on global demand, which in total, we expect to grow in 2014. Our industry demand assumption for North America and, in particular, the U.S. is for demand to grow 5% to 7% for the year as we continue to see growth in U.S. housing, the normal replacement cycle of appliances and improvement in discretionary demand. In Europe, we expect flat to up -- the market to be flat to up 2% for the full year as the region remains somewhat weak, but we are beginning to see some stabilization in this and some signs of recovery.","In Latin America, we continue to expect to see inflation and currency fluctuations impacting consumer demand and consumer sentiment. So for the full year, our industry forecast at this time is expected to be basically flat. And lastly, we expect Asia forecast to be up to -- flat to up 3% for the full year, primarily driven by strengthening Chinese market and offset by industry weakness that we continue to see in India. But in total, we do expect positive global industry demand for the year.","Finally, turning to Slide 10, I would sum up by saying given the strong underlying trends in our business from both a revenue growth standpoint and a margin expansion, we're giving our 2014 full year diluted GAAP EPS outlook in the range of $11.05 a share to $11.55 per share, and our ongoing business operations outlook is $12 a share to $12.50 a share, and this, with also our free cash flow forecast of approximately $700 million.","Overall, we remain confident in our abilities to continue to execute our plans, and we expect to deliver another record year of performance.","So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer.","Marc R. Bitzer","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Slide 12 by reviewing North America's performance in the fourth quarter, starting with the top line. Net sales of $2.7 billion for North America were up approximately 9%, driven by higher volumes, particularly in the U.S. where revenue was up approximately 11% compared to prior year. Strength in U.S., particularly in the building channel, was partially offset by industry weakness in Mexico and significantly negative currency impact in Canada.","Our ongoing business operating margins were 11% for the quarter with ongoing business operating profit of $301 million, an all-time quarterly record compared to $233 million in 2012. Higher sales, ongoing productivity and restructuring benefits continue to be positive drivers in the fourth quarter, more than offsetting higher material costs. Overall, ongoing business operating margins expanded by 1.7 points year-over-year. Consistent and disciplined execution of our actions resulted in the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year ongoing business operating margin improvement.","Now let me take a moment to talk about our expectations for 2014 as shown in Slide 13. Positive trends continue in both new construction and existing home sales, and we see increased demand for normal replacement purchases, as well as discretionary purchases, driven by improving consumer confidence. We remain focused in innovative products and growing beyond our core business, and we expect positive net cost productivity, and we will continue investments in marketing, technology and products.","Turning to Slide 14, you can see just a few examples of our leading innovative products in the North American region. First of all, you see Whirlpool's brand new 4-door refrigerator that offers superior flexibility and energy efficiency. The EveryDrop water filter by Whirlpool Water offers fresh filtered water at the speed of life, which shows how we're growing beyond our core business. We also highlight the Jenn-Air built-in coffee system featuring ideal brewing pressure for barista-sized drinks at home.","I will now shift gears to talk about the fourth quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region as shown on Slide 16. Despite a weak market environment, we achieved positive operating profit for the quarter, driven by the actions we've put in place. Sales were $847 million compared to $794 million in the prior year. Excluding currency, sales increased 1% year-over-year, driven by higher volumes. Operating profit of $10 million improved by $2 million compared to the prior year and operating margins improved 20 basis points.","Now turning to Slide 17. While the market environment in the Eurozone remains weak, we expect normal seasonality and slow industry demand recovery to accelerate in the second half. We expect to grow revenue organically and improve our mix with our innovative new product launches and grow beyond our core. Margin growth will be driven by continued benefit of our ongoing cost productivity programs, but are expected to more than offset higher material costs. And also, we expect further margin growth from our additional restructuring initiative, which includes the recently announced closure of a plant in Sweden. We will continue to evaluate all options necessary to ensure positive trends and operating margin growth to continue.","Turning to Slide 18, we are highlighting the Bauknecht brand KOSMOS built-in induction oven that integrates seamlessly into any kitchen and the Bauknecht GreenKitchen refrigerator and dishwasher that work together to save consumers water and energy.","And now I'd like to turn it over to Mike.","Michael A. Todman","Thanks, Marc. If you turn to Slide 20, you'll see our Latin America fourth quarter results, which highlight our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year ongoing business operations margin expansion. Sales for the quarter were $1.4 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year. Excluding currency translation and BEFIEX, sales increased more than 8% compared to the previous year due to continued growth in the core appliances and favorable product and price\/mix.","GAAP operating profit for the quarter totaled $159 million compared to $134 million in the prior year. On an adjusted basis, our operating profit for the quarter totaled $130 million, 9.7% of sales, compared to $119 million or 9% of sales in the prior year. Improved product price and mix, including cost base price increases and ongoing productivity initiatives, offset higher material costs and foreign currency for the quarter.","Turning to Slide 21, the appliance industry in the region for 2014 is expected to be flat as inflation and currency volatility throughout the region impacts demand. However, given our strong market position and the current competitive environment, we expect to grow our revenue despite this environment. Our innovative new product launches are winning with consumers, and we remain focused on growing beyond our core business. Even with this short-term volatility, we continue to be very confident about the long-term fundamentals in Brazil.","Now let me take a couple of minutes to talk more about the region on Slide 22. You can see that the long-term positive drivers outweigh the short-term uncertainties and challenges. Both positive drivers are primarily related to Brazil and include population growth with an emerging middle class, who has the ability to increase and upgrade the number of appliances in their home. Brazil's strengthening domestic market, real wage growth and low unemployment rates are also very positive drivers as we look at the fundamental economics.","LAR International, our appliance business outside Brazil, is made up of over 35 markets. Some of them are up, some down, but LAR International in aggregate is fairly balanced even in the short term. We continue to be confident about the long-term growth opportunity in these markets.","As we look at the uncertainties in the year, the 2014 World Cup and government elections in Brazil may affect the consumer and business sentiments in the short term. We also expect inflation pressures and currency fluctuations to have a negative impact on consumer demand, especially in the first half. However, we will continue to manage through the short-term volatility and overcome the challenges just as we did last year.","Slide 23 shows how we continue to capitalize on the opportunities for growth with product leaderships in Latin America. For this quarter, we highlighted the Whirlpool Connect refrigerator with smart technology, the Consul Facilite portable refrigerator and the Brastemp Ative! washer and dryer.","Our fourth quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 25. Net sales during the quarter were $177 million compared to $203 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 7%. Operating profit of $10 million improved by $3 million, and operating margins improved 210 basis points compared to the prior year period. Favorable price and mix, including cost base price increases, as well as ongoing productivity, offset industry weakness in India, increased raw material cost and foreign currency.","Turning to Slide 26. In 2014, we expect to continue managing through volatility in India and capitalize on the industry growth in China, as well as leverage our new product launches. Last August, we were pleased to announce our intent to become the majority shareholder of Hefei Sanyo to accelerate our growth in the emerging Chinese market.","Earlier this month, we welcomed the announcement that our acquisition proposal had received the second of the 2 key approvals required by -- from the Ministry of Commerce in China, or MOFCOM, those being the antitrust and foreign strategic investor approvals. The transaction remains subject to approval by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, certain other regulatory approvals required by the relative Chinese authorities and some other formalities. At this time, we expect the transaction to close any time between the end of the second quarter and the end of 2014.","Slide 27 shows a couple of examples of our product leadership in Asia. For this quarter, we've highlighted Whirlpool brand's Professional frost-free refrigerator with innovative 6th Sense Active Cool technology and the Whirlpool Armstrong total home laundry solution that includes a prewash station, washer and storage.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry.","Larry M. Venturelli","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by making some comments on our fourth quarter results, and then I'll transition to guidance for 2014. Overall, the underlying fundamentals of our business remains strong as evidenced by continued sales growth and margin expansion, as well as a strong balance sheet. As we have previously demonstrated, we continued to effectively manage through short-term volatility in demand and unfavorable currencies across the globe. Our strong execution throughout the year delivered record earnings.","On Slide 29, you will see how we expanded our margins with a balanced approach across multiple drivers. For the year, we exceeded the high end of our original guidance and drove a 160-basis-point improvement in ongoing business operating profit margin. We realized a 0.5 point for the full year in price\/mix. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives contributed 1 full point. That productivity was positive and delivered approximately 0.5 point margin as our actions more than offset material cost inflation of approximately $180 million. And as expected, increases in marketing, technology and product investments reduced margins by approximately 0.5 point.","Moving to the financial summary on Slides 30 and 31, reported net sales during the fourth quarter were $5.1 billion compared to $4.8 billion last year. Excluding the impact of both currency and BEFIEX, sales were up 7%, primarily driven by strong growth in North America and Latin America. Fourth quarter ongoing business operating profit increased 25%, driven by higher sales, ongoing productivity and the benefit from cost and capacity reductions, more than offsetting higher material cost and unfavorable currency. Graph on Slide 32 illustrates expenses associated with our cost and capacity reduction initiative. The actions we have been taking over the past couple of years and into 2014 represent a generational change for our footprint and cost structure. Through 2013, we have delivered the $400 million of benefits we laid out in Q4 2011.","For the full year, our program expenses were $196 million ,and we delivered approximately $175 million of benefit. As Marc mentioned earlier, we have taken additional cost and capacity reduction actions to address the weak, but recovering European market and to continue to expand our margins. For the full year 2014, we expect approximately $100 million of charges and $80 million of ongoing benefits.","As Jeff introduced earlier on the call our 2014 guidance as shown on Slide 33. We expect to deliver annual diluted GAAP EPS in the range of $11.05 to $11.55 per share and annual ongoing business operations EPS of $12 to $12.50. Our expectations for free cash flow are approximately $700 million, of which I will provide more detail shortly.","On Slide 34, you can see the reconciliation from diluted GAAP EPS with ongoing business operations EPS for 2014. As we take appropriate actions in regards to our generational change in footprint and consistent with prior years, we are adjusting diluted GAAP EPS for restructuring expense. As we near the conclusion of benefits associated with the long-running program in Brazil, we are also adjusting for the remaining BEFIEX tax credits of $16 million. Consistent with 2013, we're adjusting for the onetime investment expenses of approximately $22 million that relate to the pending acquisition of Hefei Sanyo. Lastly, we expect our tax rate assumption for 2014 to be 24%.","On Slide 35, we expect the current year to deliver another balanced approach towards margin expansion, resulting in an 8-plus percent margin. For price\/mix, we expect a 0.5 to a full point of margin, driven by cost base price increases, as well as from innovative new product launches and growth beyond our core business. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives will drive a 0.5 point improvement. We also expect positive net productivity to contribute 0.5 point in margin for 2014 as our actions more than offset material cost inflation of $150 million to $200 million. And finally, higher marketing, technology and product investments are expected to reduce margins by about 0.5 point to a full point.","Now to provide a bit more clarity on our free cash flow expectations, I'll refer to Slide 36. Walking from our 2013 actual free cash flow to our 2014 outlook of $700 million, there are several factors impacting the comparison. Most notably, you can see that we plan to utilize our increased earnings to drive enhanced investments for growth and profitability. Increased capital expenditures of $75 million will support continual product innovation for consumers. Higher restructuring cash of approximately $45 million will support continued margin expansion. Working capital is essentially neutral year-over-year.","Due to the requirements of the pension relief program enacted in 2011, our U.S. pension contributions are required to increase approximately $45 million this year. However, it's important to note that our U.S. GAAP pension obligation was cut in half during 2013 and has been lowered to $700 million. Lastly, we will monetize $90 million less BEFIEX tax credits compared to last year. Overall, the underlying cash flow generation of the company remains very strong. In total, we continued making investments in our business to support our long-term growth and margin objectives.","As we have executed our plans to improve margins and grow revenues, we have effectively deployed the cash generated from our business as shown on Slide 37. During 2013, we increased our dividend and recently completed our share repurchase program. Shareholders were also rewarded with a 54% increase in the company's stock price. Moving into 2014, we will continue to fund the business for growth, as I just mentioned, including capital expenditures between $625 million and $675 million. We plan to refinance our maturing debt. Also, as Mike mentioned, we are on track with the acquisition of a majority stake in China's Hefei Sanyo. Consistent with the past, we will continue to update you with our future plans for use of cash.","In summary, given our increased investment capacity and strong balance sheet, we will continue balancing funding for all aspects of our business to ensure the best long-term value creation for our shareholders.","Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","Thank you, Larry. I'll turn to Slide 39 to summarize our remarks. First of all, I would say we're pleased with the actions that enabled us to deliver record results in 2013. We have and we expect to continue to grow revenue, expand our margins, and we're firmly on track to deliver our 2014 objectives, including 8% plus operating margins.","As we look ahead, we're very well positioned to capitalize on positive global demand trends, and we are very positive about our own robust pipeline and new innovative products for consumers that will enable us to grow faster and improve our mix. The Hefei Sanyo acquisition provides a great opportunity for us for transformational growth in China. We will continue to grow beyond our core business as we have been. And as result, we will have even more opportunities to grow our investment capacity and to deliver on our cash priorities.","Finally, I'd like to turn to Slide 40, which should be familiar to you, which is our road map for growth and value creation that we first introduced to investors in 2010. I think we are now demonstrating that we have the capabilities to address challenges related to raw material cost, rapidly changing global economies, currency fluctuations, inflation in emerging markets and value-destroying competition.","Given our success and current momentum, we remain confident in our opportunities to grow the business, expand our margins and generate strong free cash flow. As we achieve our 8% plus operating margin, and close the Hefei Sanyo transaction, we will provide updates to our shareholder value creation targets at the appropriate time later in the year. In the meantime, we'll continue to invest in our long-term growth strategy, and we're firmly on track to deliver our shareholder value creation targets and deliver another record year of operating performance.","So with that, I'll -- that concludes our formal remarks. We'd now like to open it up for Q&A to the audience.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we will take our first question from Ken Zener with KeyBanc.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Currency. If Latin America volume is flat in '14, could you describe the currency headwind you would expect at today's rates, given the volatility we've seen week to week? We can see the fourth quarter currency hit, but could you kind of frame out, given that there's 35 different countries passing through in America, what it would look like in terms of currency headwind, so we can understand that?","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes, this is Larry. Let me give you a couple of comments. First, for the total year of '13, we absorbed -- effectively absorbed about $85 million of currency headwinds, a lot of that occurring in the second half of the year. For -- and I'm talking in globally. For 2014, we'd expect total currency to be a headwind of around $50 million based on where currencies are today. The majority of that, a lot of percentage that happen in emerging markets, but we will continue effectively navigate through currency headwinds just as we have over the last couple of years.","Michael A. Todman","Maybe, Ken, I can just add to that, specifically related to Latin America and just put it in perspective. On -- with that currency headwind, we still have been able to grow our market position and we still have been able to, if you will, balance off that currency with price increases that we've already taken. So we certainly feel like we can deal with the current volatility that we have [ph].","Larry M. Venturelli","And Ken, just one other comment. With, really, the currency, you see a lot of discussion in the press. If you look at our combined businesses we do in countries like Argentina, Venezuela, Turkey, Russia, South Africa, these represent about 3% of our sales just to give you a little bit of perspective.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Could you restate those just for everyone's clarification again?","Larry M. Venturelli","If you look at countries like Argentina, Venezuela, Turkey, Russia, South Africa, they represent about 3% of our total global sales.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Very good. Moving to the U.S., it's obviously very constant tension between market share and margins as any industry faces. But given the margins that you had in North America were very good, your North American volume did lag a hem by about 200 basis points. So Jeff, could you kind of comment if you'd be willing to go into a little more detail about, obviously, you're looking for profitable growth. We do think a lot of pressure from the Korean firms has been -- is always there, but you've been able to navigate it. Could you just, as you look back at 2013, reaffirm your view of how you can maintain share profitably and as it relates to the refrigerator comments you made that you are not pursuing the appeal despite the international -- the appeal decision that, in fact, the ITC might have been fought. Is there a reason you're not pursuing that appeal as it relates to margins and market share?","Jeff M. Fettig","Okay. Let me turn the first question over to Marc and he'll answer that.","Marc R. Bitzer","Ken, it's Marc Bitzer. Let's first talk [ph] about the market share and the unit is 2-sided. First of all, and I think we made that comment several times in previous earnings calls, the units which we report are not comparable to the AHAM market share unit. Our units which we report include more than the so-called T7, includes the units, which are T7 to T12 in U.S. Of course, it also includes Mexico and Canada. So it's -- when you compare AHAM numbers with our reported unit, you're not comparing apples-with-apples. Not even apples with oranges and certainly. As importantly, our T7 market share, which, as you know, we don't public detail -- our T7 market share in Q4 was stable sequentially and actually even up year-over-year. So we are kind of -- from a market share perspective, we are certainly solid right now at the current point.","Jeff M. Fettig","And Ken, regarding the fair trade question that you asked, we did put out a statement earlier in the week, which basically position or gave our position on the refrigeration ruling. And let me make a couple of comments. One, as we said in the announcement, dumping -- we have proven twice in both washers and refrigerators that dumping has occurred, and we stated that we believe it's still occurring in the marketplace. Secondly, there is no question in terms of with the Department of Commerce and with the appeal that we are correct on -- in terms of bringing this fair trade issue to the table legally, if you will. We are pleased with and agreed with the appeal ruling from the trade court that the decision on the refrigeration case by the ITC was based on nonaccurate data, but we also stepped back and said, as we said in the release, we're now talking about data that's from 2008 to 2011. And in our view is that in 2014, the marketplace has changed, prices have changed, products have changed, countries of origin have changed. And given the time that it would take to continue to pursue this or affect ruling on this appeal, we believe there are faster vehicles available to us to both monitor and address trade issues that we see in the United States. So that was the basis. We have a strong and unwavering commitment to fair trade enforcement, and we'll continue to take the appropriate actions to monitor that.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Understood. The last question, if I may, is your long-term guidance, which at one point seemed long term, of 8% margin is in fact your 2014 guidance despite, obviously, difficult Latin America guidance, I would say. So would you venture to give us what might be a medium-term guidance or thoughts given that long term is, in fact, your fiscal '14 guidance of 8% margin?","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, Ken. Okay. So I mean, we've done our 2014 guidance, and what I said and the question that's been asked before is, is 8% plus the upper limit? And my answer has been no. That's where we see 8% plus. And what I said in my remarks is as we -- first of all, we want to demonstrate we are in fact achieving that, which we expect to do this year. Second of all, we have a very important [ph] acquisition, which will positively affect both our revenue. And if we look at their margins, they're good. And our -- my comments are is that there will be an appropriate time as we progress in our milestones in 2014 and update you and investors on a more medium- to longer-term value creation targets, which we intend to do. But for now, I think that 2014 -- we've got 11 months to go, and we'll focus on delivering 2014.","Operator","And we will next go to Denise Chai with Bank of America.","Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you -- let me see. So just starting with your U.S. guidance of 5% to 7% volume growth, can you maybe break that down now for us into, say, replacements, new build, existing and discretionary demand? And how do you see the mix of that demands at this point?","Marc R. Bitzer","Denise, good morning. It's Marc Bitzer. As opposed to breaking down, let me just maybe give you a broader comment on the 5% to 7%. First of all, starting with lasted energy [ph], I mean, we've shown in the Q4, and we pretty much came exact -- essentially exactly. It's in the guidance of what we've communicated, the 9%. As we start the year, we're starting off with a slightly softer January, which is largely driven by fairly significant trade inventory corrections end of April. Having said that, we remain very positive about this year's and probably also mid-term trends for U.S. market in both new constructions, existing home sales, and as you also pointed out, we are hitting more and more of a normal replacement cycle, i.e. appliances, which were bought in the peak of the market of 2004 to 2006. So without breaking down into components, but with both elements of the market, replacement and new construction, we see we have a very solid momentum, and that's why we are still very bullish about the 5% to 7%.","Jeff M. Fettig","And Denise, I would add we've talked before about those 4 dimensions. Replacement is in a -- and we're moving back towards a more normal market is in the high-40s to 50% of demand. New construction as it starts to get back to what we think is replacement level should be around 15%. Existing home sales is about 15%, and the rest is discretionary. And as we've pointed out at the end of the third quarter, we're hitting the period where the first time in many, many years where all 4 are growth and moving in the right direction, which to Marc's point is why we're still bullish not only for this year, but over the next coming years.","Larry M. Venturelli","It's still about 15% below the peak of the industry through 2013, so a lot of opportunity there to...","Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just turning to LatAm, last year Mabe gave up a significant amount of share. Can you kind of update us on where your share stands now? And also on pricing because I believe you took prices up mid single digits in Brazil sometime around June last year. But was there a further increase in the fourth quarter? And given your more dominant market position, how should we think about pricing going forward, I mean, obviously, with the currency fluctuation?","Michael A. Todman","Well, let me first answer the first, and we closed the year up about 3 points of market share for our Brazil business. And we expect with the product investments that we're making, the innovation that we're bringing that we will continue to have good performance in the marketplace taking market share. We did also announce after the June price increase the price increase that we are actually executing right now, and we announced that for the 1st of January. So we're in process of doing that, and I really can't comment on any future increases.","Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And the 1st of -- January 1, is that also mid single?","Michael A. Todman","Yes, that's mid to high singles, depending on...","Denise Chai - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Great. And just one last thing about raw materials. So can you give us maybe the dollar increase in raw material costs in 2013, and what you're expecting for 2014 now that you've done a lot of your negotiations?","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes. We ended up 2013 with about $180 million of headwinds, and we were forecasting for this year, which we will offset with productivity, is about $150 million to $200 million of raw material headwinds.","Operator","And we will next go to Megan McGrath with MKM partners.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Could you just clarify your comments on the retail inventory levels? I think you said that January is a bit weaker because of inventory and sort of compare it to what you're seeing, what you saw last year.","Marc R. Bitzer","Marc Bitzer. Just my comments on the trade inventory correction. Let me offer you the context. We have -- of a vast majority of our retails, we have a very good understanding and have exact data on what we call sell-through, i.e. what has been sold to the consumer and what we sell. So we have a fairly good understanding of trade inventory moves. And what we see this year coming out of 2013 into January [indiscernible], that was pretty much over last 12 weeks of significantly trade inventory reduction on the trade side. There's a certain elements, which is not surprising, something in January [ph], but I would say the magnitude of what [indiscernible] this year clearly goes beyond what we've seen before to the point that I think some retailers with low -- they run very low in the inventory coming to February.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just a little clarification. I know it's small, the percentage of your sales, but clearly you're looking for the full year for the Asian market to improve versus what you saw in the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there to get you to flat versus the mid single-digit unit decline you saw in the fourth quarter?","Michael A. Todman","Yes. We are seeing a strong environment in China, and we expect that, that will continue. There are -- India continues to be somewhat challenging, but we are beginning to see some improvement in India. And then there are all the markets around, there is growth in those markets. So we feel pretty good about what we're seeing out of China and some improvement that we're seeing in India.","Operator","And we will next go to the side of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Both Mike and Marc talked about growth beyond the core, and I presume you're talking about your adjacencies business, which you address in your IR deck. Using the numbers that you cite in that deck, it's about a $4 billion a year business. It's basically -- you're pretty close to the European business in terms of its magnitude, Europe and Asia together maybe. Can you just talk about what you achieved in 2013 in terms of full year growth and sort of the look for 2014 in terms of what kind of growth we could expect, and also not only growth in terms of revenues, but growth in terms of margin contribution?","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, David. This is Jeff. We've got -- the way -- again, this is for everyone's benefit. We talk -- the way we look at our business in many different ways is we first look at them regionally, we then look by product line, and then -- we then introduce the concept that we talk about our core appliance business, which there tends to be a fixation on T6 U.S. business, but it's really at least a T12 global business. That, we call our core business. And then we look at categories, which due to that strong core business, we're able to extend revenues from that. And then we talk about expand, which is categories that aren't completely dependent up on the core, but where we can bring our capabilities to expand our business scope. And it's largely all around branded consumer products in around the home. So with that definition, I mean, your math is roughly correct. I think those categories, which we look at internally, there is extend and expand that cap about 23% of our revenue. In total, they're nicely profitable, and we're growing as we said on value-creating objectives. It varies per year and so on, but roughly we expect to grow faster than our core business. And I'll just give you 2 quick examples. There's over 30 different categories in there, so it's hard to really go -- and they vary in size from $10 million to $1.5 billion. So -- but we manage virtually all of them discreetly. And that -- I think that in terms of growth, the 2 biggest growth generators right now are -- one is our KitchenAid small domestic appliance business, which is strongest base is in North America, but we are expanding it globally. We're growing it very, very strong double digits as we have for the last couple of years. We're adding new product lines to that. We're expanding into many, many more markets around the world, and it's a sustainable source of both growth and significant value creation. Another interesting example, which is a composite of many different things in different markets, it's our overall water business. You saw, I think in -- Marc Bitzer showed a new-to-the-world product for us, which is the Drop product in the United States, which is a consumer product, which we have now having many retailers across the United States. It's a water filtration product. We have a subscription model in Latin America that is meaningful, and it grew 30% last year. So -- and I could go through a whole written of those things. But suffice to say, our goals in this area is to continue to extend and expand. We expect over time to grow this business as twice the rate as our total business, and we have substantially higher margins. So as we grow this business, it will be a mix up to our total margins. So that's the quick snapshot of that category.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And do you get growth in margin from where you are, or are margins pretty much where they'll be now, and it's really just about growing the revenues in that group?","Jeff M. Fettig","It's a little of both. But I would say -- because where we have really good margins, I would say we're reinvesting rapidly in expansion and advertising, and things like that. So -- but in terms of mix on our total margins, I mean, we have both. We have some where we will also improve our margins substantially. And where we have big positions, high margins, we basically are focusing just on growth.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And Jeff, I realize there's a lot of categories there, but would you say you have more pricing power in those categories than you do in the core 6?","Jeff M. Fettig","David, over the last couple of years, I mean, our view is -- our -- very simply put, as we talked before, we're in the business of selling products at a profit and that applies to everything, including the core business. In the last couple years, we've been able to do both. We've gotten pricing on our core business, and we're getting pricing on our extend and expand.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Last question just for Larry. Two things, can you talk about the interest in sundry expense line, I got an $82 million versus $35 million, and just what might have been going on in there? And then also on the balance sheet, you had a $7 per share drop in your pension liability. You went through that quickly in your prepared remarks, but maybe you could just give us a little elaboration.","Larry M. Venturelli","What was your question, David, on interest and sundry to change year-over-year? Is that what the question was?","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, your $82 million versus $35 million, could you give us a look at what's going on?","Larry M. Venturelli","The delta is really related to a legal accrual that we took late in the year in interest and sundry. That's what's driving that. The pension liability, quite frankly, is a couple of things. One is discount rates dropping, and we've been saying for a while -- I'm sorry, rising. So if interest rates increase, we would see a substantial decrease in our liability. And the return on our assets have been pretty strong. So in total, for the company, and I talked about the U.S. pension liability, which is the most -- the larger part of the liability, we were about $1.4 billion in pension liability last year in the U.S., and we're a little bit over $700 million this year. So a significant, significant decline in one of our legacy liabilities.","Operator","And we will next go to Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, I was hoping if possible to give a little more color on the price\/mix benefit that you saw in 2013 and expect in '14. And if it's possible to kind of give us a sense of which was the bigger driver, price or mix, and as you -- particularly as you expect that benefit to, I believe, improve in 2014?","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, Michael. I would say overall, our price\/mix was positive. It varied dramatically. The source of that varied dramatically around the world. I would say in our developed markets, which is largely North America and Europe, it was largely on the mix side. In our emerging markets, it was both like-for-like price increases, which we executed throughout the year like in India and Brazil, which we talked about, as well as some positive mix contribution from product innovations. As we look to 2014, we've talked about -- we had announced in many major markets around the world and have implemented or have announced we're implementing price increases based on the inflation that we're still seeing virtually -- it's for raw materials everywhere, but high inflation, particularly in emerging markets, partly currency driven. So we have -- that has been announced. But in principle, given the investments we're making in new product innovations, we do expect to have a positive product mix as well. So it will be a combination of both.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I appreciate that. And also on the interest expense -- I'm sorry, the investment expense that is something you add back to get to your adjusted non-GAAP measure, and this is also for guidance, it looks like it's about $0.21 per share that you add back in '14. It's about $0.19 in '13. Is this something that you expect to eventually roll off or given that it's kind of -- you're expecting it 2 years in a row, it seems to be different from a restructuring expense? Is this something that we might expect also in '15, and when would this eventually roll off?","Larry M. Venturelli","Michael, it's Larry. The expense in 2013 and '14 is related to the same things, related to the Hefei Sanyo. So obviously, once we close on that, that investment expense goes away, and there's nothing that we carry over into '15.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, if I could, how are you thinking about the effective tax rate x BEFIEX in 2014? And also if you could give us a sense within the guidance of how you're thinking about the interest and sundry income and the interest expense lines?","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes. In my prepared remarks, Michael, I said we expected about a 24% rate from a tax rate perspective in 2014. Figure interest and sundry, anywhere -- we figure around $95 million and a figure interest expense between $165 million and $170 million.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm sorry, just one more if I could squeeze in, the share count, also where did it end in '14?","Larry M. Venturelli","I would use what we ended at, which is about $80 million.","Operator","And our final question comes from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions, first, housekeeping, Larry, while you're doing all these granular stuff, change in pension expense on the P&L in '14, I know you talked about the liability and the contribution, but what about the P&L impact?","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes. Again, just to remind you, we closed the pension plan several years ago, so it's not a big pickup. It will probably be around $12 million lower between pension and post retirement.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So that will be an increase of $12 million on a year-on-year basis?","Larry M. Venturelli","A decrease of $12 million .","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A decrease or increase, I'm sorry?","Larry M. Venturelli","Decrease.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Decrease. Okay. And I was hoping that you would say that. Okay. And then 2 final questions, if I could. I mean, it seems as though if you go around the world in your industry expectations, Europe, Latin America and Asia, even to an extent, I guess, U.S. because of the channel inventory correction that you're really baking into your expectations improvements in the second half versus the first half. You talked around a little bit, Jeff, about why you feel that might be the case. But could you put a little bit more meat on the bone as to specifically what data points or channel anecdotes that you're seeing that gives you that confidence that things in the second half are going to be better than the first half? Because right now, obviously, the first quarter and first half, we may not be seeing that.","Jeff M. Fettig","I don't -- for the most -- I think the starting point I would say is that we expect at largely have our normal seasonality that we have in our business. As I go around the route, I don't necessarily look at it as first-half-second-half big change in North America or Europe other than we do believe in both developed markets that we have seen a slow generally positive trend that we expect to continue to build. I think probably where there is a little bit of first-half-second-half expectation is in end markets like Latin America and India for one reason when we're facing -- again, we talked about currencies as of today. We still have year-over-year currency headwinds we've got to overcome. And I think as those markets settle out, you'll see a better -- start to see a better return to normalized growth, which we don't expect to see in the first half. So that's probably the 2 places in the world where we have a little bit of a first-half-second-half view of the world as our -- largely Latin America and India. Everywhere else, we look at basically normal seasonality.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then directionally, market share expectations, I know you talked about LatAm, but you -- do you expect to gain share? I'm guessing some of that is going to be carryover from Mabe. But on the other hand, I think, organically, you're expecting to gain share also. U.S. and Europe, directionally where do you expect your market share trends to be in 2014?","Jeff M. Fettig","Look, Sam, as we've discussed candidly with the investments we make in new product and so on, we expect to always gain share with our new product innovations, where we -- But having said that, we want to do it profitably. So I think everywhere where we introduce new products that are -- which is everywhere, we have an expectation to gain share to some degree. What we haven't changed is our expectation is that we will pursue loss-making share moves for the sake of share because that, for us, is obviously -- that is not an economically viable model. Some may choose to do it, we don't. And so I guess our expectation on the year is everywhere we have a meaningful participation, we would expect to grow our share.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","From a new product rollout standpoint, is there a timing, first half, second half, in terms of where you expect a bulk of your new product to be introduced?","Jeff M. Fettig","Not anymore, Sam. I mean, it's -- we've got keen some pipeline innovation around the world. You've asked me and others have in previous years, what's your big innovation this year? It's hard to say because there are so many of them, and we literally every month and, certainly, every quarter are bringing out meaningful innovation. So it's kind of a continuous pull for us.","Well, listen, everyone, thank you, again, for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you at our next earnings call. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's program. You may disconnect at any time."],"22794":["Whirlpool Corp.

Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to Whirlpool Corporation's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Call. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Max Tunnicliff.","Max Tunnicliff - Whirlpool Corp.","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our second quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Marc Bitzer, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpool.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on slide 2 of the presentation.","Turning to slide 3, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions in the first round, and time permitting we will address any follow-up questions after everyone has had a turn.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you saw in our press release, we delivered very strong revenue and margin performance in our North America and Latin America regions despite the impact of higher raw material cost, which did negatively impacted our second quarter results. We also delivered sequential operating margins improvement in Europe, and overall we did make good progress in Europe on our supply chain initiatives which resulted in improved availability.","At the end of the second quarter, our free cash flow increased by nearly $200 million compared to last year, and we are on track to deliver our full-year free cash flow goal of $1 billion. This strong level of cash flow generation allows us to continue executing our balanced capital allocation strategy and effectively returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","During the quarter, we repurchased $200 million share of common stock bringing our year-to-date total to $350 million. We also paid an increased quarterly dividend of $1.10 per share. Overall, our strong confidence in our cash generation has enabled us to announce a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization, which brings our current total authorization to $2.350 billion. This increased authorization gives us ample flexibility to effectively execute our balanced capital allocation plans and continue effectively returning cash to shareholders.","On slide 6 we show our second quarter financial results, where we delivered revenue growth of 3%, ongoing earnings per share of $3.35 a share and a free cash flow improvement of more than $190 million.","We have seen cost increases on key raw materials, primary steel and resins across the globe during the first six months of the year. In North America and Latin America, we've been able to more than offset these headwinds with favorable demand and productivity gains. In Europe and Asia, however, weaker market demand has made it more challenging to offset this during the first half.","So I'll turn to slide 7 where we show our 2017 updated guidance. Again, our free cash flow guidance of $1 billion has not changed. We have updated our 2017 earnings per share guidance to reflect the impact of the expected raw material inflation. So, overall, we now expect to deliver ongoing earnings per share of $14.50 to $15 a share.","Turning to slide 8, you'll see that our priorities for the year have not changed. We remain focused on realizing the benefits of our integration activities in Europe, and we do expect to deliver sequential margin improvement in the third and fourth quarters. We also continue to expect to drive growth at or above industry levels in both the U.S. and Brazil, and again our focus remains on delivering substantial free cash flow improvements for the year ahead.","So, with that, I'm going to turn it over to Marc to talk about our global operations.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. On slide 10, we will review second quarter performance of our North American region.","Net sales were $3 billion, an increase of more than 8% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currencies, revenues grew 9%. This growth was driven by a combination of continued industry growth and another quarter of market share gains. We gained nearly 1-point of market share as we continue to see consumer demand for our leading brands outpacing the industry.","In addition to strong unit volume growth in our core business, we also delivered very strong adjacent business growth, particularly in our KitchenAid small domestic business through new product introductions and share gains. We reported very strong margin of 11.8% for the quarter, fully in line with our full-year guidance as we realize the benefits of double-digit unit volume growth and continued cost productivity.","Compared to the prior year, margins were impacted by elevated raw material inflation of more than $14 million as well as $10 million of unfavorable currency. In summary, we're very pleased with our second quarter operating performance in North America.","Turning to slide 11, we show our expectations and operations priorities for North America. We continue to expect industry growth of 4% to 6% for full year behind strong trends in housing, low unemployment and real wage growth. The industry grew more than 5% in the second quarter and have now grown 4% for first half, in line with our expectations.","As we have done in each for the first two quarters of this year, we expect to grow at or above industry levels while driving strong levels of cost productivity. We continue to believe that we're well positioned to deliver our full-year margin growth of 11.5% to 12%.","On slide 12, we will review the second quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. Revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, down 5% versus the prior year excluding the impact of currency. The sales decline was largely impacted by continued demand weakness in the UK, which was partially offset by growth in Russia.","We delivered sequential operating margin improvement of $17 million as we realized the benefits of improved system stabilization and product availability compared to the first quarter. Compared to the prior year, our operating margins were negatively impacted by approximately $25 million of raw material inflation and approximately $10 million of unfavorable currency impact.","Turning to slide 13, we summarize our priorities and expectations for the EMEA region. We improved system stabilization in the second quarter and remain focused on further improvements across the region this year. As a result, product availability has improved compared to the first quarter and we expect to continue driving improvements for our supply chain initiatives.","We continue to expect 0% to 2% industry growth in 2017, as growth in Russia and Eastern Europe is expected to be offset by weakness in UK. Based on current market rates, we anticipate continued margin impact from currency weakness in the UK. We will continue to reduce inventories, which as a result of product transitions have been slightly elevated.","Our accelerated inventory reduction, combined with competitive intensity in the first half, is expected to drive a negative full-year price mix impact compared to our prior regional guidance. Raw material inflation is expected to remain stable in the second half.","In summary, we expect to deliver sequential improvement to operating margin in each of the next two quarters but the magnitude of improvement will be slightly less than previously expected. We now expect to deliver operating margins of approximately 4% in the second half and approximately 2% for full year.","I will now discuss our Latin America results in slide 14. Sales for the quarter were $848 million, an increase of 3% versus the prior year. Excluding the impact of currencies, revenue decreased 1%. Operating profit was $59 million and margin increased 90 basis points versus the prior year.","Similar to the first quarter, the excellent environment continue to be challenging. We saw further industry declines and raw material inflation had a negative impact of approximately $25 million. However, we were able to expand margins through strong operational performance as we continue to deliver cost productivity and positive price mix.","On slide 15, our 2017 priorities and expectations for Latin America are unchanged. We continue to expect industry demand for the full year to be flat, the first half declines to be offset by flat demand in the third quarter and solid growth in the fourth quarter. We expect to deliver revenue growth and margin expansion for full year from the continued benefit of brand investments and new product introductions, while remaining focused on strong levels of cost takeout to offset raw material inflation. In total, we continue to expect to deliver 8% to 9% operating margin for full year.","We now turn to our second quarter results for the Asia region, which are shown on slide 16. Net sales were $358 million versus $363 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were flat. Our ongoing operating profit was $8 million and ongoing operating margins were approximately 2%. We delivered exceptional performance across all key measures in India, and have continued to see strong demand growth and favorable economic trends in that country.","In China, the operating environment continued to be challenging in the second quarter. Raw material inflation for the region negatively impacted margins by approximately $20 million. We also saw high single-digit industry declines, which contributed to elevated competitive pressure and drove unfavorable price mix in China. As you saw in our press release, during the quarter, we recorded an adjustment in our China business, primarily related to trade promotion accruals from prior periods. The impact of this adjustment on GAAP operating profit for our China business was $40 million.","Turning to slide 17, you will see our 2017 priorities for Asia. We continue to expect flat to 2% industry growth for the region, with strong demand in India offset by industry weakness in China. We expect raw material inflation in China to continue in the second half. We implemented the previously announced cost-based price increase and we're expanding our Whirlpool brand distribution for large retailer, and we are introducing a new lineup of cooking products. As a result of these actions, we expect to improve price mix by the end of the year, although full-year margin impact will still be negative. We now expect to deliver 3% to 4% ongoing operating margins for the year.","Turning to slide 18, we highlight our first half versus second half operating margin improvement drivers. In the second half, we expect to deliver margin benefits in all regions from cost productivity and seasonally driven volume leverage. We also expect less raw material inflation globally compared to the first half.","In North America, we expect growth in our business to continue positively impacting our margins, and we expect further price mix benefits from the upcoming global launch of our Whirlpool brand Kitchen Suite. In Europe, we expect to benefit from our simplified brand portfolio and further improvement to product availability, as I discussed earlier, and drive approximately 4% margin in the second half.","In Latin America, we expect to continue our margin improvement trajectory and we expect to benefit from positive demand in the fourth quarter. Finally, we expect to improve Asia margins sequentially through the price mix actions I discussed earlier.","On slide 19, we summarize our regional margin guidance goals for the full year. We continue to expect strong margin in North America and Latin America, and we will deliver sequential margin improvement in Europe and Asia in the second half through our target actions, but full-year margins are reduced due to raw material inflation and price mix.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jim.","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. Turning to our second quarter results on slide 21.","Net sales were $5.3 billion and grew 3.3% versus the prior year, in line with both our full year and long-term revenue growth expectations of 3% to 5%. Ongoing EBIT margins declined as strong cost takeout and revenue growth were more than offset by approximately $110 million of elevated raw material inflation and unfavorable price mix, primarily in EMEA and China, compared to the prior year.","Currency impact to EBIT was approximately flat in the quarter as the Mexican peso and British pound weakness offset Russian ruble and Brazilian real favorability. Also on a GAAP basis, earnings per share were negatively impacted by approximately $90 million in tax expense as compared to the prior-year period due to the timing of our tax planning activities in the prior year. We continue to expect a full-year effective tax rate of approximately 20%.","Turning to slide 22, I will update our expectations for 2017 EBIT margin drivers. We are now expecting slightly higher negative price mix for the full year. We have experienced negative price mix during the first half of the year in EMEA and China, which we expect to partially offset in the second half of the year. We also now expect slightly higher raw material inflation for the full year.","However, we continue to expect that our strong cost productivity and restructuring programs will deliver net benefits through our earnings. And we are reducing our forecast for the impact of marketing, technology and product investments. We continue to expect the impact of currency to be flat for the full year. As a result, we now expect our EBIT margin to be flat for the full year.","On slide 23, we update our expectations for total cost takeout in 2017. Through the second quarter, we have delivered approximately half of our full-year cost takeout goal. We now expect $350 million of raw material cost inflation for the full year, with the majority of this impact having already been absorbed in the first half. We continue to expect approximately $475 million of gross cost takeout for the year. I will provide a few additional details on these productivity initiatives.","Our complexity reduction initiatives are ongoing, including reducing the number of global product platforms, streamlining our brand portfolio and reducing our SKU count in Europe by more than 40%. As a result, we are improving our supply chain efficiency, inventory positions and ability to realize the purchasing benefits of our industry-leading scale. We also continue to focus on minimizing raw material cost volatility through supplier contracts and commodity hedging.","On slide 24, we show our updated full-year guidance for 2017. We continue to expect to deliver approximately $1 billion of free cash flow, and our first half free cash flow improvement of almost $200 million has us on track to delivering that goal. As Jeff discussed earlier, we are adjusting our full-year ongoing earnings guidance to a range of $14.50 to $15 per share to primarily reflect the lower-than-expected price mix and increased raw material inflation.","On slide 25, we provide an update on our cash flow and capital allocation priorities. During the quarter, we repurchased $200 million of common stock, bringing our year-to-date total to $350 million. Given our confidence in our cash flow generation, yesterday we announced a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization. This brings our total available authorization to $2.35 billion. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders, consistent with our balanced approach to capital allocation.","Turning to slide 26, we updated our full-year free cash flow improvement drivers. Overall, we are on track to deliver $1 billion for the full year. We now expect to deliver cash earnings growth of approximately $150 million. We continue to expect to generate approximately $250 million in free cash flow through our strong focus on improving working capital efficiency, primarily in Europe and North America. And we expect capital expenditures to be $650 million to $700 million, approximately $25 million more than the prior year.","Turning to slide 27, we remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy. We are on track to be at our targeted capital structure. We raised our dividend earlier this year to $1.10 per share, and we intend to continue repurchasing shares throughout the rest of the year.","Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Thank you, Jim. I'll turn to slide 29. Let me start by saying we are confident that we will make meaningful progress towards each of our value creation goals this year. Year-to-date, our revenue growth of 3% is in line with our long-term annual growth target of 3% to 5%. We have very strong actions in place to enable and deliver the second half EBIT margin expansion. And we fully continue to expect strong free cash flow generation and delivering 5% to 6% of net sales by 2018.","On slide 30, I would just summarize the key messages from our call today. Our North America and Latin America regions continue to perform very well. We do expect revenue growth and margin expansion in both of the regions for the full year. In Europe, despite some challenges that we faced, we delivered sequential operating margin improvements and we believe that our growth, price mix and productivity actions will deliver improved EBIT margins in the second half of the year.","As a result of our strong first half cash improvement, we remain very confident that we'll deliver our $1 billion of free cash flow this year. More importantly, because of our confidence in ongoing future cash generation, our board has announced a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization, bringing our total authorization to $2.350 billion, which represents more than 15% of our current market capitalization. And we plan to use this authorization to continue repurchasing shares throughout the year.","Finally, I'd like to comment on the important succession news, which we announced last month. As part of our ongoing executive succession process, which is driven and overseen by our board, we announced that I will step down as CEO on October 1. And then our board has elected Marc Bitzer as our new CEO, the eighth in our 106-year history. I would just say that I and our board could not be more pleased about these succession changes, and we're very confident in Marc and in our entire executive team that they'll do a great job in leading our company in the future. And I'm very confident that we'll have a very exciting and value-creating future under Marc's terrific leadership.","So, for me, after five years of being President and Chief Executive Officer and 13 years of CEO that translates into 72 quarterly earnings call, and so this will be my last one. And beginning in October, we'll turn this over to Marc and Jim.","So, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for your support and confidence and investing in our company. And I look forward to the great future for Whirlpool under Marc's leadership.","So, with that, I'd like to end our formal remarks and then open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Robert Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning. Jeff, congratulations on a fantastic career and a great tenure. You're leaving the company in better shape than you found it and done a lot to grow it. And, Marc, you got some big shoes to fill.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Thank you, Bob.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So, for my first question, I'd like to understand how you can bridge from this quarter and current trends you're seeing in the market towards reaching your long-term financial targets. And, Marc, I was hoping you could step me through your action plan to address price mix issues that you're seeing in Europe and Asia.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","So, Bob, it's Marc. So let me, kind of \u2013 particularly, if you talk about the long-term guidance. Let me start region by region. North America, as Jeff pointed out, we're in a very good shape. I think Q2 shaped up very well. As you've seen on the slide 18, our guidance for the second half margin is around 12%, which gets us very close to the margin targets which we communicated in the investor call, i.e., the 12% plus.","So I think our fundamental view on the long-term dynamics of the North American market have not changed. If at all, I think with Q2 and what we see is current trends just to reconfirm our kind of bullish view on the long-term trends in the North American market and I would say by any definition we're performing very strong.","On Europe, again, our recovery and the sequential recovery is there, but very frankly it's in Q2 being slightly slow when we're expecting and in Q3 it's also slightly slower than we expected originally, but it's there. So, kind of the exiting margins in Europe, we would say is around 4%. That does not change our 8-percent-plus long-term targets for Europe. And again, that is more a result of \u2013 the outcome of that transition will be a very, very strong cost platform in Europe, and then coupled with a very powerful brand portfolio. It's the integration process which we go through, so it doesn't change our long-term expectations in Europe. And you also know, we've kind of through the currency kind of cycles in Europe, so at least that seems to be stable.","Latin America, if at all, the investor there would be more bullish. As evidenced in Q1 and Q2, we have very strong operating margins on an EBIT level and on an ongoing level, but even more so internally on what we call the gross margin per product, which are very healthy. So, once the volume comes, and it will come, our Latin America outlook is a very positive one and I have no question and no doubt on the long-term target.","Also same is true for Asia. India, as you can evidence in Q2 and Q1, it is in very strong position. Our brands are in very strong position and we are, if at all, also even more bullish about the long-term prospects of the Indian market. China is still going through rough waters. I mean, the industry has been down minus 9% year-to-date. Given the size of the China market, can that continue forever, when you talk about our strategic horizon, it's unlikely, but for this year, 2017, we're not overly bullish on the China market.","And having said that, the market is too big, the penetration growth is still there, particularly outside refrigeration and washer and you're also starting to get into replacement cycle. So it's unlikely that these market trends continue. We obviously have also our own homework to do in terms of how we mitigate raw material trends with price mix action. I call that more an execution as opposed to a strategic challenge. As such our long-term perspective on where we expect the Asia margins to come up has not changed versus Investor Day.","Robert Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's helpful. Thank you for the detail geographically on the segments. Switching gears a bit, I wanted to ask at a high level what's the potential impact of Amazon's decision to sell Kenmore products on the North American pricing environment and how do you see this effecting industry profitability in the next two to five years?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","And, Bob, let me take this one, and then maybe also Jeff can also add his perspective. As you know, the Kenmore brand is owned by Sears and it's subject to their decision kind of where the brand is being sold. So, in a very short-term, and I know there has been some reports and comments on this one, in the short-term, given that we produce Kenmore and still have a very significant OEM Kenmore business, they're certainly not a negative impact for us, if at all, neutral to even slightly positive.","In the long-term strategically, I think many things have to be seen. I mean, obviously, they need to be seen how strong the sell-through is on this one. And to what extent it can mitigate the inherent Sears decline. So, I would say from a long-term, a lot has yet to be seen, probably in the second half in terms of how much pick up they actually get. I would say, it's an interesting development. I would not, at all, see this as a negative development for Whirlpool.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah, Bob. This is Jeff. I absolutely \u2013 completely agree with Marc. Short to mid-term, I don't see any good or bad impact for us. Our position is and always has been, we're going to be where customers want to shop. And we're doing that today with the trade partners we deal with. We support their online activities. Our job is to have great brands, great products and deliver.","Now the second part of this, what to do with the industry profitability, I think we've demonstrated over long periods of time that no matter what the model to the consumer is that we are appropriately represented in the value chain. And consumers will decide how big or how little this is. We will make decisions to make sure we are appropriately represented in the value chain.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, Jeff, Marc and Jim. And, Jeff, again, best wishes for your next chapter of your life and it's been a pleasure dealing with you for all these years and, Marc, also congratulations, well deserved naming to the new post for you.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Thanks, Sam.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Thank you, Sam.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Two questions if I could. The spending cut for the marketing and technology initiatives, it was an eyebrow razor for me. Where specifically is that? Why the decision to do so, particularly to such a significant degree and does this potentially jeopardize the Whirlpool brand launch in the back half of this year?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Sam, I can take this one. And, first of all, I know on the surface as you compare to the earnings slides, it looks like a big number, but let me give you a little bit more detail. One part of our brands, there's a certain timing issue in terms of how much of a brand investment fall into Q4 versus Q1. That has something to do with launch timing. Year-over-year, our brand investments, the pure brand investments, will still be up as a company. So, of course, we continued to stick to our commitment to strengthening the brand. So, one part is more timing between Q4 and Q1.","The other part is in Medline, our technology investments. One initiative which we didn't talk too much about is, we have reconfigured our entire product development cycle from which with the same or better output we actually have reduced engineering and capital expenditures. That is actually a good thing. So, in a certain way, we get more for less. We didn't talk too much about it, but that's also behind this one, and frankly that is very well on track and that's why we feel very confident that with even increased output from product development we don't have to invest exactly the same dollars.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And then the final question I would have, can you help quantify the efforts to clear out the inventory in the UK? Can you help quantify what the impact is on margins, both in the second quarter and the back half? I'm trying to parse that out separately from what's happening in the legacy business.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah. And, Sam, first of all to clarify, again, it's Marc, it's not just UK, it's on the European level. As we explained in Q1 and also in Investor Day, as part of integration we offer initially 12,000 SKUs, we bring that down to 5,500 or 6,000 SKUs and we basically had to change about 90% of SKUs. As you go through that change process in a very short time period, no matter how well you plan your production plans you have, by definition, obsolete inventory, just by definition it's not miss-plan, it's just by definition.","And given that we don't want to carry the inventory too long and also with our strong focus in cash flow, frankly, internally we put a lot of pressure on the European team to kind of sell that out as quickly as possible. So, yes, it impacted the first half in margins and it will also impact the second half to a slightly lesser extent, because we burned through a lot of that obsolete inventory. I can't give you the precise number, but I think just the pure impact of burning through that inventory probably in first half was about $10 million or more in terms of margin impact.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sam Eisner of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone, and Jeff, great working with you, congrats. Look forward to the next step. And Marc looking forward to working with you as well.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Thank you.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, on North America, volume growth has been pretty strong in excess of, obviously, the industry data and it seems like, as you commented, you guys have been gaining share. Can you talk specifically about either who that share is coming from, how you're going about gaining share, should we expect that the share gains lessen in the back half of the year as the Koreans actually have product that they're able to bring into the market after their product transition, or their facility transition? I just want to better understand what are the drivers of your ability to see such high volume levels.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Sam, it's Marc. Let me actually first start with our usual boilerplate answer, but the industry sell-in growth is not exactly comparable to the sellout in our overall unit numbers. I mean, we say that's been our market share, it's not so favorable and we say that also has been our market share is favorable. And what I mean with that, we are internally more focused on the sellout and we're also internally more focused on the entire quality trough sellout.","Having said that, we feel very good about where we are on the sellout number as also reflected in the sell-in market share gains. There is no one single product category which would stand out from a market share. But, frankly, compared \u2013 and that's probably the biggest change with 2016, we regained some share also in laundry. Our laundry business, as you know, was under pressure, was injured by foreign imports. We see the supply chain challenges and we also see maybe some results of early antidumping actions in the announcement. But I also want to clarify, it is absolutely not only constrained or contained to the laundry category. It's across the board. We're very pleased with our refrigeration and cooking products, and we're very bullish about the Whirlpool brand suite which comes in Q4.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","I'd only add to that is, our brand portfolio is really delivering. Again, Maytag and KitchenAid are the fastest growing brands in the market and Whirlpool continues to be the largest. And so that coupled with great products, to Marc's point, it's spread across our entire business.","Samuel H. Eisner - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. And then maybe just on Asia given the profit weakness there, Marc, you commented that there was elevated competitive pressures and recognizing that margins are going to be down in the second half versus the first half. And you commented that in the long-term you expect to get back to some long-term average. But trying to understand what, \"long-term\" means and how long these competitive pressures are going to last for you guys because it is a pretty sizeable reversal in that segment? Thanks.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Sam, and again, first of all, on Asia, as I explained also at investor call, Asia is largely India and China. So, to simply, yes, there is also some other business in there but it's largely India and China. India had a very strong Q2 and India where, as I said before, we're very bullish about the long-term trends and our market share gains.","China was a combination of, I would say, actually three elements. One, it's the industry decline which was minus 9% on the Q2 until May. It's hard to read what will happen in the back half, but I would not expect industry growth on a full-year base in China and that's also what is embedded in our guidance so it's probably depressed on the full-year base.","Then you have the other element, which is raw material, maybe not in absolute dollar numbers but as a percentage of sales, we had the biggest impact of raw materials in China but it's partially due to the more short-term nature of raw material swings in China compared to other regions. And so we saw a huge increase in RMI in Q1 and partially Q2 and right now, I would say, there's uncertainty about the RMI. That's the one thing.","And the other thing is, we have not been able to mitigate that through pricing actions. We have implemented something now, we announced it, but frankly, in the first half the traction was below where we should be given the raw material trend. So I would say that's the China situation.","Now the question is to what extent can we address it. We have announced a price increase and we're driving hard to kind of make sure that this price increase, which we already announced, finds the traction in the marketplace. On the raw materials, probably as we are going towards the end of the year, we expect more stabilization but we expect it still to be slightly elevated in Q3 if the early signs point to more normalization in Q4. So, I would say, as we enter 2018, we should see more margin run rate for Asia in total, which we're getting closer and more on track towards our long-term margin goals there.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning, and I'd also like to add my congrats to Jeff and Marc. Well done on both accounts.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Thank you, Mike.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","My first question is on Europe, and obviously you've had great success in North America and there's been different structural problems there over the years, and you've been able to \u2013 I mean, it's still a lot of, let's say, at points, structural industry challenges in North America, given some of the competition, you've been able to turn that into a very profitable business over time.","So, when you think about Europe, you made the acquisition and very quickly as things were doing well, you got that line of sight to an 8% margin. Obviously, there's a lot of challenges right now. I was hoping you could kind of walk me through what gets you from flat in the second quarter to up 4% margin in the back half? And then, going from the back half of 4%, what's the path to 8%?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","So, Mike, it's Marc. So, first of all, on the European margin, again first of all, keep in mind, we were already last year more in 3% or 4% margin levels. So, we're not talking about levels which we have not already achieved post integration. Q1 and Q2 were significantly impacted by the cumulative effect of a number of integration complexities, largely driven by the SAP introduction. And I think we explained that in Q1 and the earnings call.","So I would say a big part of the second half improvement is just the absence of system unavailability issues, which we encountered in the first half. So, as such, I wouldn't describe the back half margin as spectacular, because that's pretty much the run rate which we had last year. Then we had already the impact of the currency of UK already in the numbers. So, the year-over-year comparison is \u2013 from back half it is not so completely different from last year. So, again, it's the system stabilization around product availability, which we know is, every month, going better. I also indicated during the investor meeting that we had our very important go-live in Poland in July, that went successful. So, we know that's largely behind us. So that makes a big difference.","On top of that, we see kind of every month, we see continued progress on price margin, on a full-year basis, it will still be down and that's what we indicated. On a sequential base, we're getting better on this one. So, I would say, the combination of more solid top line, not growth, but a solid top line, better margin realization, and frankly also continued progress on cost productivity, that gives us some confidence about the back half margins.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, I appreciate that Marc. And I guess, that kind of gets you to the back half margins. And I'm just curious about the path to 8%. But the second question, also you talk about, I believe earlier on, different actions you're trying to take to offset the raw materials. At the same time I think, you reiterated your total cost takeout. And it looks like the other big movement here is price mix, obviously, in China and Europe.","So, what kind of gets you back, are there actions that you're taking in the back half of the year so that perhaps going into 2018 that price mix would then get back to even to slightly positive, potentially? I noticed you're taking some price actions in China. But just trying to get a sense of kind of as you look at kind of the incremental challenges here that you're facing, what gets you back to, let's say, neutral or positive as you go into 2018?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","So, Mike, given that I think your question was referring to the global perspective on these questions. So, first of all, let me answer on the cost side. As Jim also indicated earlier, our gross cost takeout is $475 million, that is consistent this Investor Day, which is the $400 million on kind of ongoing cost and $75 million on restructuring benefits. So that is unchanged, which is on a high level and I would also describe as consistent as our Investor Day. These are the kind of levels plus\/minus what you should expect from us on an ongoing base.","The $350 million raw material, as you also know, beginning of the year we started with $150 million then we felt this more like $300-million-plus and now it's $350 million. If you compare it to our internal forecast, which of course, the full-year outlook, what Jim also indicated and if you do the math, of the $350 million, $210 million is already behind us, roughly $210 million. So, we see that that pressure becoming less and less, which obviously kind of takes some pressure of the margin away. You also need to always keep in mind on the ongoing cost productivity builds through the year. The raw materials will be less impactful and the cost productivity builds better on its own should drive something also as we go into next year.","Having said that on the price mix and as we indicated in the script, on Europe and Asia in particular, we still have homework to be done on price mix. We initiated actions. I've approved price increase, which we already announced in China and additional actions in Europe. So, I think these are particularly two areas where we still have work in front us on the price mix and we're very committed to this one. And I would say, you will see that coming through in the second half. And as we enter the next year, we should have a pretty good run rate on that.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Michael, this is Jeff. I would just add to that, because \u2013 to Marc's point, we expect to move from, what I would call, operationally challenged issues which negatively impacted our business to more of a stabilization in the second half, which gives us about a 4% run rate return. But your question about 2018, I would say very simply, again, we've got to assess the environment and all that kind of stuff. But the absence of the obsolescence that we're having to clear out, which will be largely done, moving back to what I'd call a normal full availability, there's no question we think this is going to drive growth in mix on a year-over-year basis, because we'll move from these integration issues operationally challenging this to a more normal environment that we're used to operating in. So, I think the big lever you'll see going into next year is growth in mix.","Operator","Our next question is from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah. Good morning. And Jeff, it's been a pleasure working with you. Congratulations on your retirement. And hope a lot of good things coming your way, still.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Thank you, David.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Can you talk about Latin America and one thing that was kind of interesting was the observation that 3Q will be flat before getting to a better 4Q? Maybe just elaborate a little bit around the extent to which that maybe a function of compares versus things that you see unfolding in the market. And just trying to get a general sense as well, you were talking about positive pricing in that market. I know there's been a number of price initiatives down there. But as the market recovers and foreign exchange begins to come back into balance, does the pricing power down there begin to fade? If you could just talk about a couple those things, and then I have a follow-up.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah. David, let me take this one and maybe Jeff can add also some comments on this one. So, first of all, and I know there's a lot of noise about Latin America market demand, et cetera. We think we have a pretty good perspective on the Brazil market and as you know also in some upper markets in that environment. Brazil, we are confident on a full-year flat base. Having said that, as I indicated, that implies Q3 flat and Q4 up on a significant base.","To be very transparent, Brazil is a very volatile and erratic market. So, we even in our past numbers we had one week, one direction, the other week the other direction and there's a lot of, as you know, political noise, headlines which immediately impact consumer demand. So, there is uncertainty associated with the demand guidance, but through our best of our knowledge we would still expect a flat on this year.","What I rather want to point out and you may not see it fully in the numbers, the structural health of our Latin America business is very impressive. Of course, on a top line, given the currencies and volume demand, it is still way off the 2014 numbers. The one number which we typically don't show externally is what we call the variable product cost of product margin, which is actually even better in the 2014 level. So, we're sitting or we're faced with a very, very healthy P&L. Once the volume comes, we will have a very nice and attractive leverage.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah. David, I'd add to Marc's comments. We do believe we're starting to bounce along in the bottom, which is somewhat difficult to see until you start looking backwards, but it feels like we're bouncing at the bottom, so we see some of these monthly gyrations, which is far from our recovery. But to Marc's point, and again relating back to Investor Day, we've been through these emerging market trends in the case of Latin America for 60 years. We have never been in a better position from a market share, margin, fixed cost, structure, product innovation in the marketplace, to come out of this recession stronger than we've ever before than any other recession I've seen.","So, it's certainly challenging until you start seeing demand going back up. We think we're getting closer and closer to that, but we don't know until we see it. But I would say, given that, we're really happy with where our business is, our position is and where our margins are.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Just as a follow-up, if I could, I wanted to ask you about European business and particularly thinking back to the Indesit days, they generated the majority of their EBIT from the UK and Russia. Can you talk a little bit what you're seeing in your Russian business right now to the extent which similar to your comments on Brazil, do you feel that market is bottomed, and we're in a recovery mode? And if so, what should we be thinking about in terms of the incremental EBIT contribution that's achievable in the European business through that part of it?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah. David, it's Marc. First of all, you're correct and your observation is very right. Indesit had very significant amount of their profits tied, are driven by UK and Russia. I think in the last earnings call I also made reference to that even in 2015, or kind of year-over-year in 2016 on a full-year base our UK profits were in the ballpark of $90 million to $100 million. That is certainly not the case and a very significant portion of that has been eradicated in a certain way.","We're slowly starting to claw that back, but it's slower frankly than we originally were expecting. Part of that is the difficulty of getting the traction for price increase in the UK, but we're making still progress. So, first in UK, I would still give it to some time until we see that level of profitability back in the business. The encouraging thing is, we see now our market shares being back to pre-Brexit which were significantly impacted after we end up at price increases, so it's starting to stabilize but that's not a short-term full recovery UK.","Russia is a more, how do I phrase, a more short cycled market. You have more rapid swings up and down in the market demands. We were very pleased with the Russia recovery of the market demand in first half and also a stabilization of a currency. There is a little noise right now because the ruble now starts moving in the other direction, again, but these are the kind of, I would say, swings which we'd always expect from Russia. Having said that Russia is, I would say, on the path of the recovery. I would also clarify, in the 2017 guidance, we have not baked in a lot of optimism on either UK and Russia. I think this is more on the strategic horizon, but not on the 2017 guidance.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","David, I'd only add to that, on Russia, obviously, we have less time with that as it's only been a market that's been open for a little over 20-some years. But the trends in Russia are unsimilar than Brazil in the sense that whatever they cycle, the recovery has been better than the previous high. And we have no reason to believe that won't continue, the two bigger, to Marc's point, the bigger factors there that we watch obviously are price of oil and the political factors. But given all that, it is recovery. We have a very strong position, to Marc's point. And we do believe that Russia or that market will recover as well, but it's hard to pinpoint exactly when.","Operator","Our next question is from Curtis Nagle of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Jason Oss (49:12) on for Kurt Nagle. Thank you for taking my question, and I'd also like to add my congratulations to Marc and Jeff.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Thank you.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Thanks, Jason (49:19).","Unknown Speaker","So my question is focused on volumes in North America. They came in a lot stronger than we hadn't expected and then also relative to the industry. I know that it's not apples-to-apples with the AHAM data, but maybe you could help us bridge the gap for this quarter compared to industry. And then I also have a follow-up.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Jason (49:40), it's Marc. First of all, the T6 industry AHAM in Q2 was 5.2%. Obviously, our total volume growth was quite a bit above that. Again, keep in mind, we have also Canada and Mexico in there, which we had in both countries actually pretty strong performance. And we have obviously products outside T6 and we also have a KitchenAid small domestic. In my prepared remarks, I indicated that the KitchenAid small domestic had a very strong quarter. So, there is a significant volume portion also of that growth coming from KitchenAid SDA. Having said that, even on apples-to-apples comparison on the T6, our volume growth outpaced that 5.2%. I would call it high single digits without getting too much on the details. So we outperformed the market even in the core majors, and in addition we got tailwind from SDA, Canada and Mexico.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you. And then for my follow-up, could you give us an update on how, for the quarter, the retail versus the builder channels performed in North America?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Jason (50:44), again it's Marc. I mean, it's a little bit back to comments which we made in other meetings, it's only one, a portion of a builder channel is captured in call it the national build, the direct business. There's a big amount of builder business going through the home improvement channel. So that's why when people refer to builder, it shows up in two different channels, the direct channel and the home improvement channel. I would still argue the total builder business is in line with market or slightly ahead of market. And I know there's sometimes a little bit stop and go in the statistics about housing starts and existing home sales. The long-term trends and even this year's trends were still pretty positive, and I would say the builder market in total is ahead of the total AHAM shipments.","Operator","Our next question is from Susan Maklari of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Good morning, Susan.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I want to go back to sort of the Amazon-Kenmore situation and just perhaps get a bit more color there. Can you talk to the current magnitude of your online sales and maybe just give us some sense of your ability to operate within that kind of channel. And with this announcement, have you seen any change in your appetite or the way that you're ultimately thinking about perhaps getting into this and selling more through this way to the consumer?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Susan, it's Marc. So, let me try to put it maybe in a global context also and then a little bit more North America. The North America online market in appliance is a little bit peculiar relative to the rest of the world. In rest of the world you have, in some parts of the world fairly, A, the online transactions are actually higher than typically in North America; two, you have a lot more pure players on the online market. You see that very strongly in UK, you see that in China, et cetera.","North America is, the online transactions tend to be lower than rest of the world and whereas largely, I would say, 95% today it's, what we call, bricks and clicks, i.e., it's the existing trade partners who have successful online channels. So, call it our online presence in the market is largely via the existing trade partners which we have, i.e., would it be Lowe's, Home Depot, or Sears and other ones. That's where our online presence is.","On majors, the Whirlpool branded products are not sold in Amazon. We do have a fairly sizeable KitchenAid small domestic business on the Amazon site. To put it in a little bit of context. And that's why I also said earlier Kenmore at Amazon is right now, I would say, is a neutral to even short-term slightly positive for us. And I think it needs to be seen how that finds traction in the marketplace. I think it's an interesting development and strategically there could be an interesting aspect for us, but again it's too early to judge it yet.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And so, it sounds like you haven't really seen any response from your traditional kind of retail partners with this news. They're continuing to partner with you and kind of work on their strategies.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah...","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah. We haven't seen any abnormal reaction. As you know, the U.S. retail market is a very competitive market, highly competitive with very efficient and strong players, and they have fairly strong online businesses. So as such, we haven't seen any changes and frankly I don't expect a short-term change.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Zener of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen, and congratulations to both of you.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Thank you, Ken.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","Thanks, Ken.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So, can you talk to why raw material was so pronounced now versus 1Q? And to prod you on, it sounds like it was actually more of an inability to get price versus actually a change in raw material costs. So, I kind of want to see if that's correct. And can you discuss the contract in China, why it wasn't more of an emerging market issue, dollar costs, the terms tend to be shorter, but it seems to be China and not other emerging markets.","And then in Europe, so it was mostly UK, again dollar denominated, but it seems like it might be the absence of price realization. So, can you talk about that actual raw material increase versus 1Q because it seemed to be really sharp in terms of happening very quickly this quarter as opposed to something rolling in, and if it's really just that price mix issue versus raw material inflation.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","So, Ken, it's Marc. I think you have multiple questions embedded in one question.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","You're correct.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","So, let me try to sort it out. Let me first talk about the raw materials in total and then specifically. The raw materials, as we indicated, we started the year thinking it will be around $150 million. Then in the last earnings call, that's where we had to say, $300-million-plus. And now we see it kind of stabilizing around $350 million. So that's pretty much where we are. The big move in particular from $150 million to $300 million, largely came from the plastics, (56:03) et cetera, all these ones, which as I indicated in Q1, these are contracts which can't set up on a full-year basis. So, these are typically quarterly or sometimes in spot contracts, where you're just much more exposed to short-term moves.","We also said, we saw Q1 and to some extent Q2, plastics prices which were significantly elevated in the outset what you would expect from a normal demand supply in terms if you look at input factors. The reason why we see it now stabilizing is, very honestly, the plastic prices have come down a lot in June, July and we see it kind of pretty much hovering about at stable level, certainly not in an elevated level.","We have a big component, which is big in terms of magnitude but didn't cause a huge surprise is steel. Steel, we knew coming into the year, is elevated. And there were particularly two factors which were on the high side of our original expectation. One was China, because in China prices moved up very quickly. And the other part was in North America steel prices, which and maybe versus speculative element in there around the Section 232. We clearly see the North America steel prices above where you would expect from raw material input costs in the demand side. And there is still on, I would say, stubbornly high levels compared to the rest of the world in steel prices.","So you take these two factors together, that's why we can right now see the $350 million. But frankly, the last weeks and for the last two months, we didn't see a big move in terms of our expectation. Right now, it seems to be fairly stable and also what I want to point out again is, there is a majority of raw material costs are already behind us. The $210 million of the $350 million is behind us. And in particular, as you get more to Q4, it gets to a more normal run rate.","Now to your other part of the question, yes, it is correct, we have not been able in some reason to fully offset and mitigate that through price mix. That's what I communicated in the prepared script, but particularly in Europe, where it's both raw materials and still some currencies in UK and China, where we have not been able to fully mitigate it.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","So, we'll take one more question.","Operator","We'll take a question from Megan McGrath of MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners LLC","Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones here. You mentioned the Whirlpool launch in the back half of the year. So, I wanted to get any detail you can give us, generally speaking, on how we should think about the product launch cycle, maybe over the next, however, you feel comfortable, 6 to 12 months?","And then Marc, the follow up is, you sort of off-handedly mentioned possible progress in terms of the pricing environment, in terms of antidumping, maybe if you could give a bit more color on that, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah. Megan, it's Marc. I mean, obviously, to give you a perspective about our product launch, the next six to eight months we need more than the two minutes which we have left. I mean, in the broader context, as we showed in the Investor Day, we have a very, very strong pipeline and we feel very good about the pipeline which we have.","The Whirlpool Kitchen Suite is a big deal. So, yes, it's part of a normal product pipeline, but it's a single event, it's a significant one because it impacts all Whirlpool kitchen products. It's a full suite, which will be launched in the course of Q4 and Q1. So that is a big deal, it's also a big deal because it's a, I would say, the first inroad into the mass IoT markets, because we bring connected kitchen suites to the mass markets. So it's significant.","Again, as we indicated, it's a Q4\/Q1. Obviously, as you roll out Kitchen Suite throughout the country, which is a big effort because you have to basically \u2013 it's a significant stall element also in there. But as such, I mean you should also, on a forward base, this is not that our pipeline is dry afterwards, we feel very good about what's coming in 2018 on refrigeration, there's a very significant frontload project for North America in 2018, so we feel very good about what we have in the pipeline. So that's on this part.","Jeff M. Fettig - Whirlpool Corp.","And on trade, as we announced, I believe it was late May, we've been involved quite a bit particularly on washing machine dumping in the United States where we've won the last two cases. But the companies that are dumping keep moving production, called country-hopping. We did file under Section 201 of the Trade Act, what we called a safeguard case, which is being worked with the ITC. There is a timeline for that, which we expect to be their final conclusion late in the fall. And based on a positive outcome of that that will go to the administration for a recommendation on how to address this.","So, as I said then and I'll say now, we wouldn't have filed this if we weren't very positive about it. The law absolutely supports what we're doing based on the facts and we're continuing to work the process.","So with that, again let me just sum up today. Thank you for joining us. Again, some challenges in the first half of the year, yet we're making great progress. We do expect to, again, have another record year here at Whirlpool. And we've got a number of activities going on, which we think will take place in the third and fourth quarter to get us back on track.","So with that, we're going to conclude the call. Thank you for joining us, and Marc and Jim will be here to talk to you next time. Thank you.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Thank you.","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's Whirlpool Corporation's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Call.

Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Max Tunnicliff.","Max Tunnicliff","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to our third quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpool.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on Slide 2 of the presentation.","Turning to Slide 3, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Bitzer","Well thanks, and good morning everyone. On Slide 5 you will see the highlights of this quarter. As we noted in our press release, in the third quarter we delivered revenue growth in line with our long-term goals and delivered free cash flow improvements versus the prior year, primarily driven by strong working capital improvements.","Our GAAP earnings increased $0.62 above last year and our ongoing earnings per share of a $3.83 compared to $3.66 in the prior year an increase of 5%. Our global operating margins were negatively impacted by two items, significant raw material inflation and price mix weakness including a slow progress on our European integration.","In response to these challenges, we are announcing strong actions to put us back on track to deliver our long-term goals. We will be executing a series of recently announced Global cost based price increases throughout the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2018 to fully offset the impact of the sustained global raw material inflation.","The price increases are expected to impact more than half of our business. We are also announcing a new cost takeout initiatives which will further streamline our global fixed cost base. This initiative primarily impact our overhead costs including salary headcount and third-party services and is an addition to our ongoing cost productivity programs.","Finally, we remain confident in the strength of our free cash flow and repurchased $200 million of common stock this quarter, which brings our year-to-date repurchases to $550 million or $125 million above sustained prior year period.","Turning to Slide 6, we show our third quarter financial results as they relate to our long-term goals. We delivered revenue growth of more than 3% during the quarter and in consistent with our prior expectations we expect to deliver full-year revenue growth in line with our long-term target of 3% to 5%.","EBIT margins were 6.6%, a decline of 80 basis points compared to the same prior year period driven by raw material inflation and price mixed weakness. We now expected to deliver EBIT margin of 6.5% both full-year due to slight increased raw material cost expectation and second half price mix challenges.","Free cash flow improved by approximately 120 million throughout the third quarter as we continue to focus on inventory optimization. We now expect to deliver free cash flow of approximately $900 million this year due to lower earnings than previously anticipated.","On Slide 7, we show drivers of third quarter margin performance. Price mix negatively impacted margins by approximately 150 basis points compared to the prior year and was partially offset by approximately 100 basis points of margin contribution from cost takeout. I will provide more detail on these items on the next two slides. Finally, currency was a slight headwind during this quarter due to British pound weakness versus the euro.","Turning to Slide 8, we will provide more detail on our price mix performance and expectation. In total, third quarter price mix was unfavorable by 150 basis points. Our North America region delivered flat price mix during the quarter and we continued to expect the full-year impact to be slightly negative in that region.","Price mix in Europe was unfavorable during the quarter, as we continued reducing our obsolete inventory related to brand transition, which was compounded by currency related pricing pressure in the UK. We continue to expect that price mix in Europe will be unfavorable for full-year due to these challenges.","In Latin America, the investor in Brazil shifted toward washer and away from refrigeration in the quarter, which had an unfavorable impact of price mix. However, we believe it represents a very temporary shift primarily impacting the third quarter and we continue to expect favorable full-year price mix in Latin America.","We also continue to experience significant price mix pressure in China, primarily due to investor weakness and related promotion intensity. We expect this pressure from China to negatively impact our full-year marks in Asia, despite very strong performance in India.","Overall, price mix has been a challenge for us this year and we have initiated strong actions to reverse that trend in 2018. We recently announced new global cost base pricing to offset the continuous impact of raw material inflation. This initiative effect our major appliance business across all regions and is expected to impacting more than half of our total company revenue.","We have already announced price increase in a number of key countries including United States, Brazil, most of Europe, and China. These price increases do not impact our laundry business in U.S., but we will continue to monitor the pending trade action covering washers and take appropriate steps to manage the business.","Turning to Slide 9, we provide more details on our cost takeout performance and expectation. During the third quarter, we delivered approximately $100 million of cost productivity and approximately 25 million of restructuring benefit. These benefit offset approximately 75 million of raw material inflation.","Net cost takeout contributed approximately 100 basis points for our EBIT margin for the quarter as productivity was slightly lower than initially anticipated. Going forward, we expect to deliver approximately 350 million of cost productivity in 2017 as slow progress in Europe and volume weakness in China result in 50 million less productivity for full-year. We now expect that approximately $375 million of raw material inflation this year and approximately $600 million of combined raw material inflation of 2017 and 2018.","As a result, in addition to our pricing action, we have announced a new $150 million fixed cost reduction initiative. This initiative primarily impact our overhead cost including salary headcount and third-party services. This is set separate from and in addition to our ongoing cost productivity program which we will continue to utilize going forward as a catalyst for margin expansion.","With that, I would like to turn it over to Jim Peters to review our region and financial results.","James Peters","Thanks, Marc and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 11, we review the third quarter results for our North America region. Net sales were $3 billion an increase of 5% versus the prior year. This growth was driven by continued market share gain and industry growth in the U.S. as well as strong performance in Canada.","We reported solid margins of 11.7% for the quarter in line with our full-year guidance of 11.5% to 12%. Compared to the prior year, margins were impacted by elevated raw material inflation of approximately $30 million which resulted in an unfavorable margin impact of approximately 90 basis points. We were able to offset the majority of that impact through a continued focus on cost productivity and unit volume growth.","Through the third quarter, the U.S. industry is growing 3.5% compared to the prior year, which is in line with our expectation and we expect strong fourth quarter industry growth. We continue to expect 4% to 6% growth for the full-year and currently see the industry trending to the lower end of that range.","We are pleased with our North America performance in the third quarter and we are confident in the underlying strength of our business. We expect to deliver the lower end of our full-year margin goals to 11.5% to 12%.","On Slide 12, we review the third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Net sales were $1.3 billion down 4% versus the prior year. We delivered sequential operating profit improvement of $11 million as product availability and overall system stabilization continue to improve.","Compared to the prior year, our operating margins were negatively impacted by approximately $20 million of raw material inflation which impacted margins by approximately 150 basis points. We also experienced unfavorable currency of approximately $10 million. Our [indiscernible] integration efforts are progressing slowly.","In particular, we continue to focus on reducing our inventory levels, which continues to be elevated as a result of product transition. For the full-year, we now expect to deliver 0.5% operating margin due to larger than expected currency and raw material headwind and the impact of the ongoing integration. We have taken steps this year to ensure that the vast majority of our brand transition and supply chain challenges are behind us as we enter 2018.","Turning to Slide 13, we have reviewed the third quarter results for our Latin America region. Net sales were $849 million, an increase of 6% versus the prior year. Operating profit was $53 million and margins increased 50 basis points versus the prior year.","For the first time in more than a year we saw industry growth in Brazil in line with our expectations. this growth was primarily in washers which created price mix pressure on our margin. We also experienced $15 million of raw material inflation which impacted our margins by 175 basis points. Despite these challenges we expanded margins to strong operational performance.","We continue to expect the industry to be flat for the full-year as the industry is starting to show signs of growth in Brazil and we remain confident that we are well positioned to benefit from manufacturing leverage and drive further margin improvement as the industry volumes begins to return. We now expect to deliver 7% operating margin for the full-year reflecting the impact of unfavorable price mix in the second half.","We now turn to the third quarter results of our Asia region, which are shown on Slide 14. Net sales were $357 million versus $338 million in the prior year period. Operating profit of $2 million and operating margins were 0.6%. We delivered record performance in India with very strong levels of growth, continued market share gain and market expansion.","We continue to benefit from demand growth and favorable demographic and we are well positioned for continued success in India. Raw material inflation of approximately $10 million negatively impacted margins by approximately 275 basis points in the quarter. Majority of that impact was on our Chinese business.","Price mix remain challenging directly related to continued demand weakness in China. We continue to expect flat to 2% industry growth for full-year with favorable demand in India offset by significant weakness in China.","We continue to expect margins to improve sequentially in the fourth quarter, but our exit rate in Asia will be below our prior expectation. We now expect to deliver 2.5% ongoing operating margin for the year.","Turning to Slide 16, we review our updated guidance assumption. We are revising our ongoing EBIT margin guidance for approximately 6.5%. We now expect our full-year effective tax rate to be approximately 15%.","Overall, we now expect to deliver ongoing earnings of $13.60 to $13.90 per share. We are also adjusting our full-year free cash flow guidance to approximately $900 million driven by lower earnings than previously expected.","Turning to Slide 17, we detailed drivers of our updated free cash flow guidance. We are making progress as expected on working capital and we now expect to generate approximately $300 million in free cash flow through our working capital initiative.","On Slide 18, we provide an update on our cash flow and capital allocation priority. We continued our share purchase program in year-to-date of repurchase $550 million, a $125 million increase over the same prior year period.","The strength of our balance sheet and more than $2 billion share we purchased authorization has provided ample of flexibility to execute share buyback and we intend to continue repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter at a similar rate for recent quarter while remaining committed to our balanced approach to capital allocation.","Now, I would like to turn it back over to Marc.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks Jim. Turning to Slide 20. I would like to recap our progress towards each of our 2017 business priority. Our year-to-date revenue growth is in line with our long-term goal; however our margins have been below our expectations this year and we continued to deliver significant free cash flow improvement remain full impact to deliver 90% free cash flow conversion.","This is my first earnings call as CEO and in light of this quarter\u2019s results, I want to take a moment to step back and discuss my cooperating principles. I\u2019m proud to have been part of this management team for several years and while I don\u2019t expect to make radical changes, I\u2019m not satisfied of our performance or predictability this year.","As a global company, there are macro factors which impact our business that we can\u2019t control, we will prepare for them while ensuring to remained focus on within our control, [indiscernible] cost, productivity and price mix plus innovation remains core of our company.","We will continue to make great products that consumers want to buy, and will continue to fully invest in our strong brands and products. And we strive for increased accountability and speed as we execute our priorities.","And as a management team, we will execute the strategic and tactical actions necessary to create long-term value remain firmly committed to achieve our long-term goals, and in particular of our long-term value creation goals we presented to you in April.","Now, I would like to end our formal remarks and open it up for questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks, good morning everyone, and quite a first quarter conference call for you Marc. It's going to be little rocky I guess near-term. First question, you might have seen there is news out this morning that Sears discontinuing to sell Whirlpool appliances, and it appears through the press it's related to pricing dispute which intern appears to perhaps being to be related to the price increases that you have just announced I'm assuming.","I was wondering if you could discuss couple of things on this. Number one, there is a lot of questions out there around roughly what Whirlpool's branded exposure is to Sears? And secondly. maybe if you take a on a broader basis, the confidence that you have in your ability to implement and realize these price increases over the next couple of quarters?","Marc Bitzer","Michael, let me give the answer in two sections, Sears and the broad pricing one. Obviously we have seen the article in Wallstreet Journal and we don't get into the details of the reasons why. What we can say is that in line with our contractual obligations, we did inform Sears in May that we would no longer supply Whirlpool branded products. As we simply we could not reach terms that were acceptable to both parties.","Now just to avoid any confusion, we are continue to supply 10 more branded products to Sears and this applies fully to our branded business. To give you a perspective of magnitude, the entire Sears business has declined overtime and now represents about 3% of our global business, of which the branded portion is only the small fraction and I will give you a little bit perspective on this one.","Now let me make a broader comment on the price increases. As I said in the prepared remarks, it is our intention to fully recover raw material cost increases over two years with the price increase which was just announced. The reason why we are confident behind this one, we have done in the past cost based price increases whenever we are faced with the significant material headwinds.","Particularly in market like U.S. and Brazil, we have been very successful and the sustained commitment, the sustained drive we are executing now what we have just recently announced. We have full confidence in the price increase we have experienced and we have experienced team in both U.S., Brazil and other markets which can drive that makes us more confident.","Michael Rehaut","Thank you, Marc I appreciate that. I'm going to shift to another area and I'm sure there will be other follow-ups on Sears. Just shifting to Europe for a moment, obviously another area of challenge for the company and very slight improvement sequentially over the last few quarters, but obviously well below what you are looking for.","I noticed that you raised your working capital cash flow and I'm curious if part of the near-term pain in turning this around is due to perhaps an acceleration of some of the excess inventory in the channel that you referred to last quarter in terms of skew rationalization et cetera and how to think about where you are in this process and if this is a one or two quarter fix or is this a one or two year fix?","James Peters","Yes, Michael and this is Jim. I think first off your assumption is correct that in Q3, we still did feel the impact of our product transitions and our reduction of inventory as we have moved through those. Additionally, within the third quarter obviously we had weak demand in the UK and currency impact as well as inflated of raw material prices you know we talk about.","So if you look at the actions we have implemented, again we will be through the inventory reduction by the end of this year within - we are implementing price increases there right now that we have talked about and then we are driving fixed cost takeout. So I think in the near next couple of quarters, near-term that will begin to improve the margin and continue the margin expansion quarter-over-quarter rate that we have seen in fact accelerate that rate.","Marc Bitzer","And Michael, it\u2019s Marc. Maybe in addition to Jim\u2019s comment. First of all, we did sequentially improve our margins in Europe, and we will also going forward. Having said that, we are not pleased with the pace of our progress and we would have expected more. You are absolutely right that the obsolete inventory is a key factor.","To put then in perspective, a year ago, we had roughly 12000 different SPUs in Europe, today we have 7000 and in that process we pretty much changed 80% of all SPUs which were sold. So of course, we want to sell the obsolete inventory as quick as possible and don\u2019t want to carry that inventory, that has a significant impact.","The other impact is still we are not pleased with the progress of our UK pricing execution and that is something which we are addressing this different intensity, but these are the key drivers, the progress is there, but slow than we anticipated.","Operator","We will take our next question from Samuel Eisner from Goldman Sachs.","Samuel Eisner","Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. So maybe sticking with the UK pricing story, I mean [indiscernible] certainly continued to the value fear and so perhaps you can talk about the competitive dynamics with our [indiscernible] in that marking, how positive you are and actually getting these price increase, I know you guys try to kind of reduce the regain mechanism, but how intense is the competition, is it as fierce as it is in North America with the Korea just maybe an overall kind of update on what you are seeing in that market?","Marc Bitzer","Sam, its Marc. So I\u2019m obviously not trying to speculate about what the competitive might do or will do. I can comment on what we have been doing, what we are seeing from a marketplace. Obviously this British pound now sliding, there is some up and down over 50 [months] (Ph). Whatever we first put out as price increase clearly what not sufficient, because the pound has sort of deteriorated and we can speculate about British pound may do going forward. But it is clear that the first increases were not remote enough to cover this at the same slide of British pound.","That\u2019s why we have announced additional price increases, so that is already out in the announcement. What makes for UK market is somewhat challenging is a very concentrated trade environment and that makes price increase a little bit more challenging. The flip side is we have a very strong brand positioning and that these are [indiscernible] where we can drive it, but of course it needs more effort, competitive dynamic are different than in U.S. we are just a different player. They may have different currency exposures and again I don\u2019t want to speculate about what they might to be doing or not.","Samuel Eisner","Alright. And then perhaps transitioning to the tax rate a pretty large delta there of 400 that I think its saving you about $50 million of cash flow for this year. Long-term tax rate for the company is over 20%, so how should we think about the medium term implications of or medium term cash flow for you guys as it relates to taxes. Thanks.","James Peters","Yes, and Sam this is Jim. In terms of the tax rate and obviously it's been driven by some of our strategic tax planning things in that. Right now we don't comment on any of the future of that, but we still believe that our longer term rate is in the low 20 some percent around 22% as we have said before and I think from a cash flow perspective that's the best way to think about it, because that's pretty close to what our cash tax rate is.","Operator","We will take our next question from Bob Wetenhall of RBC Capital Markets.","Robert Wetenhall","Hey good morning and thanks for the detail. I wanted to ask about pricing. The last time, Whirlpool got a lot of price whereas in 2012 which coincided with a lot of raw material inflation and since then price has been flat to negative on a consistent basis. And so it sounds like going forward, pricing is going to be lynched in towards restoring profitability and margin strength. I wanted to ask on the pricing specifically, if you raise prices, why do you think competitors will follow given the competitive landscape and if they don't how do you intend to protect volumes and market share?","Marc Bitzer","Bob, it's Marc. And again obviously we don't want to give any speculations about what competitors might do or will be doing. Let me maybe just step a little bit broader context with a size increase and a first off its raw material increases.","As we all know coming into the year we were expecting raw material headwinds of $100 million to $150 million which would return to $150 million then $300 million. And then we saw that [indiscernible] is not showing any relief it will be around 350 and not 375.","What has more changed is our outlook for next year, coming into this year we hinted would have expected significantly less raw material increase for the next year. And by now, we are talking about $600 million for two years, i.e. more than $200 million for next year. So what has really changed is our view of raw material are going to change to a positive in the short-term, and at one point we just got a face reality.","Now you could argue while it took us a long time to get to this conclusion, but frankly some of the outlook for 2018 has only changed for the last six to eight weeks in particular investments in steels, but also in some other raw materials which are important for us like zinc which has just gone through the roof.","So we are going up off price increases. I can just judge from the past and again I'm not trying to speculate what is going forward, you referred from a 2011-2012 price increases which were also cost based. It ultimately starts with us [indiscernible] do the right things for us based on our cost situation and that's what we are trying to recover.","Judging from the past, you need to be prepared to lose some volume from some time. But usually it is not over an extended time period. Again, that is just judging from the past, we got to be seeing what is happening this time, [indiscernible] it was a raw material, it's inescapable to some extent for everybody.","James Peters","And Bob, judging from the past too, typically in most cases our margin improvements through these cost based price increases has more than offset any potential volume loss.","Robert Wetenhall","Got it. And you guys you have reaffirmed your 2020 financial target. And obviously you have had three consecutive quarters where you have cut guidance. Can you give us some margin walk into 2018 given the fact that recent performance has fallen short of company expectations. What gives you confident both going into 2018 from a margin walk perspective and your long-term objective to 2020 that you can get there given the fact that there is a lot of environmental challenges like RMI and kind of a difficulty integration in Europe whereas this confident coming from given recent performance. Thanks to good luck.","James Peters","Yes and thanks Bob and this is Jim. I would say to begin with the first thing that is different from the last time we talked about our margin walk from now until 2020 is that we have announced significant cost based pricing and since then we had deterioration in materials. We now announced the cost based pricing to offset that, which we were planning on offsetting it before just with ongoing cost productivity.","Additionally, we have announced 150 million of fixed cost takeout on top of our ongoing cost productivity. o these are both new levers that we would include in our walk from where are today to our 2020 10% plus EBIT goal.","Outside of that, we are confident in the other measures that we have in there and including ongoing cost productivity, our ability to realize margins through pricing mix outside of the price increase and our volume growth that we still believe demand is healthy in many of the markets around the world and there is potential for demand recovery in emerging market.","Marc Bitzer","Bob, its Marc. Let me maybe just add all to given that you mentioned our 2020 long-term value creation goals. Jim and myself were both of communicating that in January and then in April when we all met in [Europe] (Ph) that we are fully staying behind this. We have been part of developing this target and we are not going to back off.","I know given that it\u2019s my first the old call on earnings call, probably will be an easy one put some question marks behind this one, but we don\u2019t. We are fully behind it, we are committed which also means we for next without getting any 2018 guidance. Our entire focus will be on margin expansion and we need to catch up what we lost this year.","Operator","We will take our next question from Susan Maklari of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Susan Maklari","Thank you. Good morning. Going back to the Sears topic for a bit. Can you just give us some sense, I know that you said branded is a small portion of the total there and given that they had several months to prepare, but what is the inventory position in that? How quickly shall we think about that actually moving through and how do you think about shifting that volume to your other customers?","Marc Bitzer","Susan, its Marc and again as you know we usually don\u2019t want to give too many specific details on our trade relation of trade strategy. Having said that, I said early in the first question from Michael, I said entire Sears business is about 3% of our global revenue base, the branded business is a very small portion of that.","So in terms of the impact what it means to shifting it, to be honest it\u2019s not a whole up, and that\u2019s the honest answer, relative to our North American business volume, these are volumes which are not a major issue. In terms of your inventory question, again these are Sears specific questions which only Sears can answer, but I think the common known fact that Sears does not hold lot of inventory.","Susan Maklari","Okay. And then thinking about 2018 and perhaps some of the changes that could come in terms of the competitive environment, given some other reasons ruling from the government and that that proceeding on. Can you talk to perhaps how quickly do you think you could ramp production in 2018 if demand shifts or if we get contingence there? And what is your ability perhaps as some of the retail side of this shift and granted its very small, but still it is kind of shifting a bit? How do you think about perhaps regaining some of that share and what it could mean for you next year?","Marc Bitzer","Susan, its Marc and I presume you are referring to the base competition.","Susan Maklari","Yes.","Marc Bitzer","And first of all also in broader context, we are pleased this year with the overall North American share gain. We are gaining share, we all expect we will probably on a full-year base gain half a point to full point and we are on track on this one. We have a specific issue where it was being harmed on large residential boxes and that is not a new story we had two dumping cases and we have now a safe guard petition.","Just to put them in context, and I know many of you are fully aware of this one. It is basically three step process, so the ITC needs the first confirm that there has been a injury and then the ITC devolves or recommends a remedy and finally this is up to the president to determine what the find remedy is.","We kind of won the very first step which is the determination of injury, what is important is what the four to zero vote. So that is I would say a strong confirmation of we have been injured and it's real. So we are waiting for the recommendation of remedies which will become two steps public, but we will expect this December 4 and then it up to the president to decide.","So I would say sometime late December or more realistic in January we will know what the final outcome of this one is. And to your question, yes, we are prepared to [indiscernible] volumes on our measures. Obviously if we had injury, [indiscernible] we have ideal capacity and we can expand the capacity and hire people there.","Operator","We will take our next question from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh","Good morning, Marc, Jim, Max how are you? Just got three very quick housekeeping questions. First off, how much price realization is embedded within the fourth quarter guidance?","James Peters","Well right now I would say for the full-year, you should assume that our price mix realization is going to be about minus 1%. So again that's about half a point worse than we were when we did the last earnings call. So that's what you should assume for the full-year.","Sam Darkatsh","I'm trying to isolate the price increase announcements that are going into the fourth quarter. How much of a benefit is that anticipated to be specifically in the fourth quarter?","James Peters","Okay I'm sorry, I took the question the other direction. Right now as we said most of the price increases have been announced and are implemented late within the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter. So it's going to be a very minimal impact on the fourth quarter.","Sam Darkatsh","Got you. And then second question, the raw material look that you gave into 2018, have you already determined your steel contracts for next year, or is that pending or you have decent visibility on that. I'm just trying to get a sense of this sensitivity around the numbers that you gave for next year?","Marc Bitzer","Sam it's Marc. No, we have not finalized the contract for next year on steel. This is an early look into 2018. But given what we have seen this year, we spend a little bit more time really trying to get understanding what is been most likely scenario for 2018. It's also ultimately cost based pricing decision. In late January or the earnings call from Q4 that's when we give you all the details the formal raw material outlook. But right now I think we highly likely to assume it will be north of $200 million as a raw material cost increase next year.","Operator","We will take our next question from Curtis Nagle of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Curtis Nagle","Thanks very much for taking the call. So just wanted to quickly focus on volumes in the U.S. So just as a first question, would you guys be able to comment on what drove weakness in the past couple of months of year so for August and September. And looking forward to 4Q, so you are going to be at the - obviously industry is going to be at the lower end of four to six, that still implies I think something like 6% increase at the low end of this year and [indiscernible] was around 10%. I guess what gives you the confidence that you should see such a big acceleration in the fourth quarter?","Marc Bitzer","Yes, it\u2019s Marc. Maybe first of all 4% to 6% guidance, yes but it still intact. Having said that, it will be clearly the lower end of that spectrum, probably more trending towards the 4% as appose to the 6%. The reason why we are confident in that industry forecast is simply to sell out, keeping in mind that the number we referred to in the 4% to 6% that to sell in all the AM statistic, but sellout has been pretty steady also over last couple of weeks and give us confidence to pursue within that range.","Curtis Nagle","Okay, fair enough. And then just a quick one on Latin America margin. It looks like in terms of the guide that you given for the year there will be a decline in 4Q, what is behind that?","James Peters","Yes, Curtis this is Jim. There is a couple of things, one, obviously we have stated that materials has had a continued pressure there. But the new thing is that the mix within the business in the back half of the year has shifted we think temporarily to more washing and less for refrigeration, which our market share is stronger in refrigeration as well as our margins are stronger in refrigeration. So it\u2019s mainly what we believe is a temporary shift in mix within the industry there.","Curtis Nagle","So it\u2019s actually continuation of trend you saw on 3Q, is what you are saying?","James Peters","Yes.","Curtis Nagle","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","We will take our next question from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Your line is open.","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning everyone. Marc, I wonder as part of you trade case filings you indicated that you were losing money in washers and I guess interested in your though process now that this is starting to take shape and I think starting to look like this may ultimately work in your favor. How should we think about how the outcome here if it\u2019s favorable to your interest would impact washer business and what that could mean to North American margins?","Marc Bitzer","Yes. Dave, of course it\u2019s probably too early to speculate about the final outcome, because of course also of magnitude for remedies will have a big impact on that question. Having said that and this has been documented in the ITC hearing we had damages and injuries that we lost money in large residential washers. The question is depending on remedy how much volume we can pick up and how much can we improve our margin. So it\u2019s entirely driven by the amount of revenues which we get, I would say let\u2019s wait until January and then in the earnings call we can give you a better forecast about what would it really means for our washer business.","David MacGregor","Does it imply that - I mean if you are losing money there, it\u2019s hard to believe the kind of volume that comes into play here could restore a sufficient level of profitability of that business. It would seem to imply the pricing is necessary, is an outcome of this, is that fair to say?","Marc Bitzer","David, we will take the right business actually going through we know we will have a remedy. But even to your point, if you are invest in your product and you put a lot of capital, in fact where you don\u2019t get the right leverage on these capitals that means you lose a lot of margin. So volume leverage depending on the kind of product has a significant impact all from a margin here. But yes, I mean it is true also that extreme promotion intensity by [indiscernible] has created significant damage.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ken Zener of KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Kenneth Zener","Good morning, gentleman. So I think the dominant sentiment around your stock has been related to North America yet. Your margin guidance at the lower end this year doesn't really support that. So Europe and execution I think are actually the key determinants of your earnings revisions this year as well as concern certainly in my focus for next year. So to that extent, when you are talking about material inflation, A, I mean is that disproportionate in Europe what we are facing this year in terms of the impact on margins, how would you break that out by region I guess. Can we just assume sales weighted or is there extra headwinds you are facing in Europe related to material cost.","James Peters","Well, and Ken this is Jim. I think if you were to look at what we saw within the third quarter here, it's about equal or about relative for EMEA compared to the rest of the globe. The only region that we have seen maybe what is a disproportionate share has been within Asia and within China.","So I would say materials has been a same proportion. As you mentioned, our bigger steps to improving the margin here begin with the exit - the integration activities and the finalization of many of those activities stabilizing our supply chain which will be in much better shape by the end of 2018 and that's probably are bigger, will drive a bigger expansion of our margin within 2018.","Kenneth Zener","Okay. That's obviously the bulk of my questions is going to be around this execution Marc and Jim. The 7% 8% goal you guys gave for 2020 originally and I was just looking at your Analyst Day from 2014, that was supposed to be an 2018 goal. I'm sure you guys recall that. That kind of reminds me [indiscernible] they had this $6 target and they missed it by multiple years and now the company is doing quite well.","What is happening over in Europe, I mean you knew there was 12,000 components SKUs, 7000 was your goals. Can you just perhaps walk us through, and may be very respectfully just how has the landscape changed today given the results versus let's say six months ago and nine months ago. I mean you must have had a roadmap and where did we take a turn to leave us that 50 basis points margins because that's a biggest driver for next year's earnings. And it's difficult to have a clear view on how that's going to slope up right now in my opinion.","Marc Bitzer","Let me maybe take me this one. First of all if you asking today, we are reconfirming that our long-term target for Europe was 7% to 8%. And our European team would exactly give you the same answer. And obviously we are kind of not happy with where we are this year. The reason for this one and Jim alluded to this one is we knew about the integration complexity. And that is a very huge complex undertaking.","The good thing is I would say 90% of a product platform factory move and brand transition are behind us. From the system side, we have now pretty much 70% behind us. So yes, to some extent, we knew about it, it's I would say the compounding effect of several integrations which make it very difficult.","Once you add on this one, the challenges which came in particular with UK and Russia which were currency related that just made it too much for the thing. And that's why we have a performance which we have and we are committed to turn it around. I would also want to point to is again we are not getting to give a guide for 2018 and the components. But it's clear that Europe will be an important but certainly not the only live of an improved performance next year.","Operator","And we will take a follow-up question from Samuel Eisner, Goldman Sachs.","Samuel Eisner","Yes, thanks so much for letting me get back on. Looking into next year and free cash flow, I think you guys have a couple of different things that are impacting, I was hoping to get some color on I think last quarter you talked about moving some investments spending without benefit this year presumably that\u2019s a little bit of a headwind for next year as you roll out the new products suite.","I don\u2019t know if CapEx would go up if you actually get the right remedy on the ITC ruling and I think you talked about that in the individual ITC ruling that you have projects that you could ultimately do from day one, tax rate implications and then also investments to drive the $150 million of cost out. So I\u2019m curious if you can give any kind of color of how you think about free cash flow to next year given those moving pieces?","James Peters","Sam, this is Jim. I think the first thing on free cash flow when we talk about CapEx, we still expect to stay within our longer-term capital allocation guidance range of 3% to 3.5% reinvesting within our business. So even with any projects that spending may have moved on we continue to look for opportunities to be more efficient in our capital spend and we are confident that we will be within that range on a go forward basis.","Working capital is we have talked about, we believe for next year there is continued opportunities within working capital especially within inventory. As we look around the globe we believe that will be a continuing source not to the level that it was this year, but it will be a continuing source of improved free cash flow.","And then on the tax rate as I mentioned while our GAAP tax rate for the full-year we expect to be in the 16% range. Our cash tax rate is actually closer to the low 20s at many of times. So I think next year there is not a significant change in terms of the tax rate impact on our free cash flow.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh","Yes, hi. Thank you. Two follow-up questions first off, are you still anticipated the $100 million in marketing and brand support spending to come back next year? And then my final question is, productivity looks like it was cut from $400 million to $350 million this year. Was that a timing issue, does that get pushed into 2018, what is the really read on productivity next year? Thanks.","James Peters","So Sam, on the marketing and technology spend, again we intend to continue to invest in that area and we will obviously look at the new product launches that we have coming for next year and then we will set the appropriate levels of spend in that area, but we do intend to continue to increase our investments especially in our brands and key market. And then what is the second?","Marc Bitzer","Let me first Sam on to clarify the $150 million fixed cost reduction that does not include brand investments and brand support. We keep these eyes separate so this is explicitly related to infrastructure cost. So just to avoid any confusions so this is a our declaration.","James Peters","And then on the ongoing cost productivity, right now in the back half of the year that\u2019s we talked about. We did have some increased material headwinds, but then on the ongoing cost productivity as our volumes have been less than we expected in certain markets and we have had to adjust our inventory levels that has had an impact on the volume leverage benefits that we get and additionally there are some opportunities for some of the cost takeout programs that we have that will continue to your question. There are some that we will be ramping up now as Marc mentioned, but these were on top of our ongoing cost productivity and you will start to see the benefits of those more into next year.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from David MacGregor of Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Yes, thanks for taking a follow-up question. Marc, can you talk about share gains in North America and I just wonder if you could elaborate where within the price point, where within the line structure do you think you are winning the bulk of that share?","Marc Bitzer","David, it\u2019s Marc. I mean first of all it's pretty much across the business, but we are particularly pleased with the progress which we have on [indiscernible] which as you know is largely in the laundry space. We are very pleased with the progress on the KitchenAid where we have a new kitchen suite out there. So from a branded perspective, that's probably where you see today by long shop of bigger share growth.","It also implies from where it's sitting giving of a [indiscernible] brand in the world and the kitchen branded fitting. That is I would say mass premium and premium segment. So we are actually very pleased that what we would call internally these are good share gains, that don't come at the low end. These are I mean one of our best branded business which we have and we are very pleased with that.","David MacGregor","If I could just quick follow-up. I wanted to just ask you for your question on promotional environment we are seven days away from the beginning of Black Friday, and how do you think that's going to play out versus last year. And then, just when we are talking about promotions, as the Korean manufactures relocates to the North American market with their manufacturing in due course however how long that might ultimately end up being. Does this create a less promotional environment, or more promotional environment. Or if you can just talk about your latest thoughts on in terms of how that shift is likely to impact kind of the competitive environment in U.S. market?","Marc Bitzer","So David first of all, I can't speculate about what is happening around the Black Friday period. What we can refer to is Labor Day and Columbus Day that has been a promotional tense periods, but not unlike what we have seen in the last 12 months. So it is kind of the same promotional ups and downs.","It doesn't change our stands and promotional actions. We participate when it creates value for us and we go into production, so that hasn't changed. But I would say it's the same level of fairly intense promotional environment which we can face and I don't know what that means for the rest of the year.","With regard to your question about the relocation of - announced relocations, because there is not yet any effect [indiscernible]. And again that's difficult for me to speculate. I would argue given that this obviously has not been their first choice, because their first move to Mexico then to China and then to Vietnam and Thailand.","I would assume that the cost base is not as attractive for them as it's been in other places, because now where it kind of there will be force to play on a level plain field, that's what it means. So I would say the cost based is probably not as aggressive, but I wouldn't conclude from that that they will change their promotion activities. We got to see that how it all spares out.","Operator","This concludes today's Question-and-Answer Session. I would be happy to return the call to Mr. Marc Bitzer for any concluding remarks.","Marc Bitzer","Yes. So let me just summarize the key message from this call, and we are back on Slide 22. First of all, we remain on track to our long-term goals for revenue growth and cash flow conversion and we remain committed to return to strong levels of cash to shareholders. Second, we are taking strong actions across all regions to offset the impact of sustained raw material inflation. And finally and most importantly, we remain firmly committed to our 2020 value creation goal which is growth margin, expansion and cash conversion despite a challenging 2017.","Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you again in January.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's Whirlpool Corporation's third quarter 2017 earnings release call. You may now disconnect your lines and everyone have a great day."],"22792":["Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call January 26, 2017 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Chris Conley - Senior Director, Investor Relations","Jeff Fettig - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Marc Bitzer - President and Chief Operating Officer","Jim Peters - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","Ken Zener - KeyBanc Capital","Bob Wetenhall - RBC Capital Markets","Denise Chai - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","David MacGregor - Longbow Research","Sam Eisner - Goldman Sachs","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James","Operator","Good morning and welcome to Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Call. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Chris Conley. Please go ahead.","Chris Conley","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation fourth quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Marc Bitzer, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with a presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on Slide 1 of this presentation.","Turning to Slide 2, we want to remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for a reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions in the first round and then time permitting we will address any follow-up questions after everyone has had a turn.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Fettig","Well, good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us today. As you saw in our press release this morning, we delivered our fifth consecutive year of record ongoing earnings, with a 14% growth in our earnings per share. This was done through focused execution and strong operational actions and we were able to more than offset the impact of global volatility to deliver good earnings growth. Our restructuring and integration activities remain on track and we delivered over $200 million of benefits during the year. Additionally, we continue to invest on our innovation pipeline. And last year, we launched more than 100 innovative new products throughout the world. We continue to execute our balanced approach to capital allocation, increasing our dividend by 11% and repurchasing $525 million of common stock. In total, we distributed more than $800 million of cash to shareholders, which was up by $300 million versus the previous year. As a result of these collective actions, we did \u2013 we are able to deliver total shareholder returns in the top quartile of the S&P 500.","Turning to Slide 5 to look at our full year results, our full year revenues grew by 2% excluding the impact of currency. We grew ongoing business earnings to a record level at $14.06 per share as we realized substantial acquisition synergies, delivered unit volume growth and drove strong productivity to expand our margins. We also improved our free cash flow versus the prior year.","Turning to Slide 6, you will see our 2017 priorities. We continue to see multiple paths for profitable growth and margin expansion. The demand trends we see in the U.S., India and many parts of Europe are positive and we expect currency to have a more moderate impact than we have seen during the last 2 years. Within this environment, our focus in 2017 is to drive our growth above industry demand levels while expanding our margins in all four regions. We expect another year of strong cost productivity and we have detailed actions to reduce cost in place around the world. We also expect to realize significant benefits from our integration activities in Europe, which we expect to be completed by the end of this year. We will continue to fund the business through strong investments in innovation, while leveraging our robust innovation pipeline, which we believe will improve price mix and drive continued growth. We also plan to significantly improve our working capital through inventory optimization plans primarily focused in Europe and North America. By delivering on these actions, we do expect to have the capacity to both manage through global volatility and deliver substantial earnings growth and free cash flow improvement.","Turning to Slide 7, we show our 2017 guidance. We expect to deliver ongoing earnings of $15.25 to $16.25 per share, which represents strong double-digit growth versus last year. We also expect to generate approximately $1 billion of free cash flow, which is a substantial improvement versus last year. And this is really driven by margin expansion and working capital improvements. So in total, our plans, our strategic framework and our record of execution gives us good confidence that we are going to continue to deliver sustainable value creation in 2017.","So with that, I would like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks, Jeff and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 9, we will review our fourth quarter performance in North America. Net sales were over $3.1 billion, an increase of more than 8% excluding currency. From an industry standpoint, we stated previously what we expect of the industry to rebound in the fourth quarter. It rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter to deliver a 6% growth rate for the second half, consistent with our 2017 guidance. The industry had a strong Black Friday period, especially in the mass and value segments as the benefits of real wage growth most significantly impacted low and middle income consumers.","Consistent with the prior three quarters, we leveraged investments in our new products to drive very strong growth in the quarter. Additionally, our sell-through outpaced our shipment volumes, indicating continued solid and consumer demand for our product and brands. Our operating margins were 11.1%, down from the prior year. This was largely driven by price mix and the impact of the Mexican peso. As many of you are aware, the Mexican peso has now devalued nearly 15% since mid-October and our margins were negatively impacted by approximately $20 million. While we have already responded with previously announced cost-based price increases in Mexico, it will take some time for them to fully be implemented. In the U.S., price mix was negatively impacted by the growth of value in mass segments of the industry as well as the elevated level of promotions by certain competitors in the fourth quarter, most prominently in washers. We have recently won an antidumping case against those competitors. But obviously, their activity has still impacted our fourth quarter results.","Turning to Slide 10, we have outlined our 2017 expectations and operational priorities for the North America region. We expect that the industry will grow by 4% to 6% behind continued solid macro trends, including housing, real wage growth and lower unemployment. Our expectation is that the industry\u2019s strength will continue in mass segments and we plan to pursue opportunities to drive positive mix through strong cases of new product introductions. As a result, we expect to continue delivering growth at or above industry levels while expanding margins. We also remain committed to aggressive cost takeout programs, which are expected to more than offset modest raw material costs and currency impact and contribute positively to margin expansion. For the full year, we expect to deliver operating margins between 11.5% and 12%.","Beginning on Slide 11, we will review fourth quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Sales were $1.4 billion, down 8% versus the prior year, excluding the impact of currency. Ongoing operating margins were 3.3%. Very similar to the third quarter, our margins were negatively impacted by approximately $40 million in currency and demand impact in our UK business related to the Brexit decision. Additionally, our margins were impacted by approximately $10 million for production and inventory reduction in response to lower demand. As discussed previously, we have already implemented cost-based price increase in response to the currency devaluation, but the full benefits were not yet visible in the quarter. We expect to recover this margin impact by mid-2017.","Turning to Slide 12, we outlined our expectations and operation priorities in Europe for 2017. We expect the industry to grow 1% to 2% in 2017 primarily driven by growth in Russia and Eastern Europe. We are pleased to see increased demand activity in these countries after several challenging years. Based on current market rates, currency weakness is expected to continue, especially when compared to the first half of the year as anniversary pre-exit rates. Operationally, brands and product transitions remain a key focus and we expect to complete these transitions by midyear. Our consolidated product and brand platform is a key driver to delivering growth in the coming years. In addition to these priorities, our focus in 2017 is on driving significant free cash flow improvements behind working capital reduction initiatives. We expect meaningful improvement in inventory levels as we complete our brand and product transitions. Overall, we expect to deliver operating margin of 5% to 6% for the year, a 1 to 2 point increase compared with 2016.","I will now discuss our Latin America results on Slide 13. Sales for the quarter were $860 million, an increase of 2%. Our fourth quarter operating profit totaled $70 million and margins increased 130 basis points versus the prior year. We continued to expand margins and gain significant market share for strong operational execution, focusing on delivering price mix and new product launches despite soft industry demand in the quarter. We are pleased with these results and are well positioned going to 2017. On Slide 14, we outlined our 2017 priorities for Latin America.","We are expecting demand stabilization in Brazil, with single-digit industry declines in the first half and modest growth in the second half. For the full year, we expect the industry to be flat. We expect currency to have a neutral impact to results in 2017 based on current market rates and our hedge positions. We will continue to deliver revenue growth and margin expansion both in and outside of Brazil, driven by price mix initiatives and the strong cadence of new product introduction in the region. We will also continue to drive cost out of the business, leveraging our right-sized fixed cost structure and maintaining our focus in cost productivity. For the year, we expect to deliver 7.5% to 8.5% operating margins, another year of meaningful margin improvements.","We now turn to our fourth quarter results for the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 15. Net sales were $352 million versus $312 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 18%. Our ongoing operating profit was $19 million compared to $11 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margins are 5.3%, a nearly 2-point improvement versus the prior year. We delivered strong cost takeouts and our marketplace investments drove above market growth.","Turning to Slide 16, you will see our 2017 priorities for Asia. Our expectation is for zero to 2% industry growth for the region. The demand trends remain favorable in India and we expect to deliver revenue growth for our expanded distribution network in China, despite a neutral overall demand environment with strong plans to deliver margin expansion by leveraging our investments and innovation. And we expect to continue delivering strong cost productivity. Behind the strength of our plans, we expect to deliver 7% to 8% operating margin in 2017.","Turning to Slide 17, we summarize our regional margin progression goals for 2017. We fully expect to deliver another year of record performance and we are confident in our ability to expand margins in all regions through disciplined and decisive execution of our priorities.","And now I would like to turn it over to Jim.","Jim Peters","Thanks Marc and good morning everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we delivered our fifth consecutive year of record ongoing results in 2016. We achieved this effectively \u2013 by effectively managing currency headwinds and demand weakness in our businesses outside the U.S. Turning to our fourth quarter results on Slide 19. Net sales were $5.7 billion and grew by more than 2%, excluding the impact of currency. We achieved all-time record ongoing earnings of $4.33 per share, driven by strong cost productivity, volume and revenue growth and acquisition related synergies, despite approximately $30 million of negative currency impact to our quarterly earnings. Our effective tax rate for the year was just under 17% due to the timing of our tax planning activities. Our guidance assumes a rate of approximately 22% in 2017. Consistent with what we have done in prior years, we will continue to evaluate our tax planning strategies throughout the year and it is possible that we may have some favorability to that number. We also increased free cash flow above the prior year.","On Slide 20, we provide an update on the progress of our restructuring and acquisition integration activities. We incurred restructuring expenses of $173 million and delivered $216 million in benefits. For 2017, we expect $200 million in expense and $75 million in benefits. These benefits are included in our total cost takeout guidance.","Our 2017 guidance is shown on Slide 21. I will walk through the key drivers and assumptions behind these numbers on the next few slides. On Slide 22, you will see our expectations for 2017 ongoing EBIT margin expansion. Our strong plans position us well for another year of EBIT margin expansion. We plan to deliver improved product\/price mix by leveraging the mix benefits of new product introductions. We expect approximately $300 million in total cost takeout, which includes initiatives to more than offset approximately $150 million in global raw material cost increases based on what we know today. We will continue to invest in our industry leading brands and innovative product portfolio to deliver above industry growth rates. And while we expect currency to be a headwind in 2017, we anticipate a more modest impact compared with the past 2 years. In total, we expect to deliver approximately 75 basis points of margin expansion over the prior year.","On Slide 23, I will highlight the first half versus second half timing of our earnings drivers for 2017. We expect volume to be a positive contributor to earnings in both halves of the year, although historically, the first quarter has been the softest of the year. We expect to see the impact of raw material inflation early in the year given the timing of most of our renegotiated supplier contracts. And consistent with prior years, we expect the impact of our aggressive cost takeout programs to ramp up throughout the year, with the majority of benefits to occur in the second half. As discussed earlier, currency will be a headwind, but the expected impact is mostly in the first half until we anniversary the effects of Brexit starting late in the second quarter and our previously announced cost based price increases are expected to be fully effective by mid-year. Overall, we expect full year earnings seasonality to approximate 40% in the first half and 60% in the second half. We would expect normal seasonality in our earnings split between the first and second quarters.","On Slide 24, we provide additional details on our cash flow and capital allocation priorities. We delivered $630 million of free cash flow in 2016. This includes the impact of $119 million in restructuring cash outlays and $162 million associated with legacy product warranty expenses in Europe. We expect approximately $165 million of restructuring cash outlays and $70 million from legacy product warranty expenses in 2017. We also plan to fund our pension obligations by approximately $45 million in 2017. During the year, we invested approximately $660 million in capital expenditures to fund our innovation programs and returned more than $800 million of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and increased dividends. We expect $700 million to $750 million of capital spending in 2017, consistent with our long-term goal of approximately 3% to 3.5% of net sales. And we plan to continue returning significant levels of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases under our existing buyback program, for which we still have $700 million of authorization remaining. In summary, we expect to deliver approximately $1 billion of free cash flow in 2017, a substantial improvement while continuing to execute against our balanced capital allocation strategy.","Turning to Slide 25, you can see our 2017 free cash flow improvement drivers. We expect to deliver approximately $200 million to $300 million of cash earnings growth through our margin expansion plans. We expect to generate an additional $200 million in free cash flow through focused working capital improvements, primarily through inventory management. Most of the inventory improvement will come in our EMEA region as we complete planned brand and product integrations related to our integration efforts. We see substantial opportunity to drive cash flow improvements through our optimized manufacturing footprint, simplified product and brand structure and increased supply chain deployment efficiency. In North America, we expect to continue realizing the benefits of previously implemented integrated supply chain initiatives. These actions are expected to structurally reduce inventory levels by approximately six days in 2017. We are planning a slight increase in capital spending to fund innovation throughout the world as we complete integrations in Europe and emerging market demand rebounds.","Turning to Slide 26, we show our cash deployment priorities, which are unchanged. We expect to continue share repurchases in 2017 in addition to funding the business and delivering a strong dividend.","Now I would like to turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff Fettig","Thanks Jim. I will turn to Slide 28 and I would like to provide an update on our long-range goals and our value creation framework. Since we first provided our 2018 goals over 2 years ago, we have experienced significant changes in the global economic environment. As we talked about previously, we believe that we are in a strong dollar era, which is not likely to change soon. Since early 2015, we have seen significant devaluations in many currencies and companies, where we operate, have a big position. These devaluations have had a significant impact on our results, causing $6.50 a share of earnings and reducing our revenues by $3.5 billion. Additionally, we have had demand shocks in several emerging markets. For us, that\u2019s most prominently in Brazil, China and many Eastern European countries. These demand shocks have impacted us by another $2 a share in earnings and reduced our revenues by $1 billion. We have responded to these changes with cost-based price increases and substantial fixed cost reductions, while at the same time, continuing to invest in our innovative products and strong brands. We do believe that emerging markets will be a catalyst for growth in the years to come. But the translational impact of currency is something that we expect that we will not be able to fully offset by 2018. Although the environment which we operate has changed, our commitment and our path to create long-term value for our shareholders has not. We remain very confident in our long-term value creation framework, which we again show on Slide 29.","We are the number one appliance manufacturer in the world, with a leading global market share position along with leading key positions in key countries around the world. Our unmatched scale gives us substantial opportunities to reduce cost and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our investments. We have 7 $1 billion plus brands in our portfolio and a strong innovation pipeline for new products. In fact, our brand portfolio remains one of our greatest assets enabled us to reach over 90% of all consumers globally. We are committed to aggressive cost takeout and productivity and we plan to further leverage our best cost global operating program as we have demonstrated this type of execution over the last several years. Our operating platforms and position in key emerging markets is also very strong and we will capitalize on future growth in those economies as they start to rebound. Finally, our strong free cash flow generation allows us to continue our balanced capital allocation approach. So, we are quite confident that collectively executing this framework will enable us to continue to create sustainable long-term shareholder value creation.","I would now like to turn to Slide 30 and I would like to summarize the components of our long-term value creation goals. We expect that with our leading portfolio of brands and our product innovation pipeline that we will be able to deliver 3% to 5% annual organic revenue growth per year. We expect to expand our EBIT margins to 10% plus by 2020 through both strong cost productivity and again by leveraging our brand portfolio and product portfolio to drive both consumer demand and positive price mix. With these growth and margin expansion actions, we expect to grow earnings per share 10% to 15% each year. We also expect to deliver free cash flow of 5% to 6% of revenues by 2018. Our 2017 guidance is another big step forward towards achieving these goals and our record of effectively managing through global economic volatility has been good. And we have proven that we can deliver sustainable long-term value creation for our shareholders in most any type of environment.","Finally, I will turn to Slide 31 and kind of summarize our key messages of the day here. Last year, 2016 was our fifth consecutive record year of ongoing earnings per share and our guidance for 2017 clearly indicates we expect that to continue. We have returned over $800 million to our shareholders, an all-time record. We are confident in our plans to drive significant revenue growth and margin expansion around the world, with a very good recovery, particularly in the European region in 2017. And lastly, we expect significant free cash flow improvement in 2017, which comes from earnings growth and working capital management. So as I step back, overall, we believe our long-term fundamentals are very strong and we look forward to sharing a lot more details about our plans at our Investor Day, which we are scheduling for early May. But at this point in time, I will end our formal remarks and we\u2019d like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We can take our first question from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mike Rehaut, JPMorgan. First question, and I think this is on a lot of people\u2019s minds with looking into the North American margins, is \u2013 and this is something Marc, I think, you alluded to in your prepared remarks earlier, was the pricing and promotion environment. And you mentioned Marc that promotions, I guess, particularly in washers continued in the fourth quarter despite the initial positive ruling and the subsequent final ruling in January. So just curious, since that final ruling, have you witnessed any change in the pricing or promotional environment? And do you expect \u2013 was there some type of perhaps flurry of activity in the fourth quarter before that? And have you seen any change in the marketplace since then? And then I have a follow-up.","Marc Bitzer","Michael, so it\u2019s Marc. Obviously, your question probably backed a little bit of long answer \u2013 implied many questions. Let me first comment on the North America volume and price environment and kind of the impact in our margin, of which what you alluded to the activities by certain competitors is the only one part of that. First of all, the volume, as to some extent expected, but came out even stronger when we originally forecasted. The Q4 industry was very strong. It came, as I pointed out before, largely at the mass and value segments, which is not surprising if you look at all the consumer confidence data on the lower, middle-income buckets. So I would say, finally, the consumer is entering stores. Now, that doesn\u2019t help your price mix to be honest and I will come back to this one later on. The back half, i.e., the second half of 2016 was 6% volume growth, which is exactly what we pretty much forecast for \u201817 if you take the higher end of our 2017 forecast. So yes, the volume was strong. I would also argue that industry sell-in may have been a little bit stronger than the industry sellout, which is different from our own numbers, but we had a very strong sellout. The pricing environment, I would say, was impacted by two factors. One was, as I mentioned before, the growth of the mass and value segments. And two, yes, there were still very intense promotional activity by certain competitors as we alluded \u2013 particularly in washers segment. In Q4, it did not come as a complete surprise because as we know we always talked about they stockpiled a lot of inventory from a summer and that has not completely sold in Q3. So, that was kind of a hangover from this massive stockpiling prior to the summer initial ruling. And particularly, one of them continued an extremely aggressive promotional cadence throughout the entire Q4. Now obviously, the final ruling, as you know, was not in Q4. That was in January. And I would say it\u2019s too early to say, doesn\u2019t really change their behaviors and we are obviously actively monitoring. Of course, our expectation will be that finally, a fair trade environment is reestablished, but the history of the past tells us we have a couple of question marks. But we are obviously actively monitoring and take actions whenever necessary.","Jeff Fettig","Yes, Michael. This is Jeff. I would just add to Marc\u2019s comments, couple of things. One as you look at the total North America margin, we did have a fairly impactful currency hit during the quarter. Two, we have \u2013 as you step back and think about it, Marc said it absolutely correctly is we basically had demand for the year of 6%, very steady in the first half, first half is up 5%. We talked last time about the unexpected stop in demand where it was basically flat, which was very strange and we all speculated as to why and then it doubled the run-rate in the fourth quarter. And so \u2013 but for the year it was 6%. I think the reality is that\u2019s pretty much what the markets ran at for the year. That\u2019s not the most efficient way for us to run our business with zero demand increase in Q3 and double-digit increase in Q4. So you obviously run \u2013 have a few inefficiencies in that kind of cycle, if you will. And we did and we have them behind us. And then the third thing, to Marc\u2019s point on margin, yes, we have said all along, we have been very clear publicly with investors, with the government, this illegal dumping that\u2019s been going on for a long period of time has had a negative impact on our margins, but it\u2019s already in our baseline. And we did have a situation in the second half of the year where one particular competitor had stockpiled massive amount of washers and that probably just added to that, but it\u2019s not new. We have been dealing with it. And that\u2019s all reflected in the fourth quarter.","Marc Bitzer","And Michael, it\u2019s Marc again. Just to maybe add one last comment and also as we turn the page to 2017 and obviously, the North America margins which is the center of many questions. Our Q4 margins in North America were at the low end of our guidance. They were within the guidance, but the low end. Now you have also seen, we have given the guidance for next year, which is the above for 2016 actuals. And we are strongly convinced we can drive volume growth above market growth and expand our margins. It\u2019s obviously at a more modest pace compared to a couple of years ago, but it is a margin expansion. I also want to emphasize, this is not based on some irrational hopes about certain competitors becoming all of a sudden completely different. We do believe we have opportunities on cost productivity. We have a number of product introductions, which help us on price mix and we took certain other actions. So we are strongly convinced we can expand margins and drive above market growth.","Michael Rehaut","I appreciate that guys and it\u2019s a comprehensive answer. Secondly, you also alluded to pricing in the UK and some of the challenges there and the price increases that I believe you enacted last quarter and I believe you said you expect it to be fully enacted by mid-\u201917, along with maybe not just price but also cost actions, just wanted to get a sense of where that price traction with price stands today, do you feel like you are a third of the way in or is it \u2013 in terms of the amount that\u2019s stuck or how you see that in the marketplace. And then just the technical question on the \u201817 guidance if that includes any share repurchase or not for the EPS line? Thanks.","Marc Bitzer","Mike, let me maybe first take the UK pricing question and Jim is probably going to talk about share repurchase or Jeff. First of all, again, to put for everyone on the phone UK business in context, historically that represented about 20% to 25% of our new Europe, Middle East and Africa revenues, but also historically represented a higher percentage on our profit, so it was an above average profit market, which also explains why our UK concerns weigh heavily on our European overall margins. On UK pricing, the honest answer is we have been slow in getting traction with pricing. Now, to give a little bit more color on this one. We went out with two price increases and what we have seen in Q4 and obviously, I cannot comment on competitors pricing. What I do can comment on is consumer pricing in the marketplace, okay. If you look at the consumer pricing in the marketplace, you would see that Whirlpool or Hotpoint, i.e., our brand, our branded products have high single-digits consumer price increase, in the ballpark of 7% to 9%. If you would look at the broader market, you would also see that in the second half of 2016, we were largely on our own with that price increase, which probably explains why in a very price elastic market like UK, we had a fairly significant volume impact. So yes, we got a high single-digit price impact, which came with a massive volume loss, but it also tells you that pricing is not yet enough to fully recover what we lost in the currency. It\u2019s just a simple reality. We have further pricing actions and obviously, given the nature of UK market, we have a fairly big mail order business and long-standing consumer pricing. It will be interesting to see in the month of January, which is particularly critical for UK, how the overall consumer pricing landscape is going to be impacted. But we remain confident we will, every month, month by month, find more traction with pricing.","Jeff Fettig","We talked about this on the last two calls. And in July when the Brexit decision first came out, we basically said we did not know what the impact would be. In the end of the third quarter, we said it cost us $40 million in the third quarter. And now it\u2019s cost us $40 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We think that will lessen somewhat in Q1 and hopefully some more in Q2 and then \u2013 but we won\u2019t see recovery on our business until Q3 when we start anniversarying this whole thing. So all-in-all, it\u2019s cost us just last year probably $0.80 a share. In the second half of last year, we have put a lot of pressure on the rest of our business. But it\u2019s a \u2013 we believe it\u2019s a matter of time. Unfortunately, we think it will be a full year before we see the full positive benefit.","Jim Peters","And Michael, to your second question, this is Jim. We \u2013 in the supplementary materials, we said that we modeled 76.3 million shares from a guidance perspective. And that includes any buybacks we have done up-to-date. And as we have said, there could be future buybacks, but also there are compensation plans where shares are issued. So none of that is incorporated at this point, but 76.3 million is what you should be using.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.","Ken Zener","Good morning gentlemen.","Jeff Fettig","Good morning Ken.","Ken Zener","Two compound questions here to address these issues, it seems that 300 basis points in EMEA tied to Brexit is the differential between the guidance you are giving this year and where we started out FY \u201816 as I look at your guidance there, so that\u2019s I guess kind of understandable. My \u2013 and I think investors\u2019 key concern is given that you also have to prove your success, Whirlpool that is, your guidance for North America margins this year of 11.5% to 12% compares to last year at this point, where you are 11.5% to 12.5%, yet the unit growth is the same, so can you put that in context for \u2013 is it just the peso and the Canadian currency, which seems to be about 60 bps drag year-over-year in the fourth quarter because you had good volume. Marc, you talked about the mass product price mix drawing you down, if you could really be a lot clear about that, because that always happens in the fourth quarter, all of your other businesses, which historically are higher margins, so can you talk about the margin pressure we are seeing in the U.S., isolate currency, isolate the product mix as it relates to these core issues of washers, which are now coming out of Vietnam and Thailand? Thank you.","Marc Bitzer","Hi Ken, let me try to answer it. First of all, because you started on the Europe margin progression, yes you are right, the kind of 1 to 2 full points of margin expansion in Europe, which we expect is partially driven by the UK pricing or currency recovery. There is also a significant part of synergies and restructuring carryover. We always allude to this one, so it\u2019s not just baked on pricing. There is also quite a bit of sustained cost productivity benefits and synergy benefits, which lead to that 50 mark progression. Now, more specific on the North America margin, first of all, I would argue that you can\u2019t compare with starting point of \u201817 with the starting point of \u201816 because the overall environment based on currency, raw materials, etcetera, is just not comparable. So I think you should always compare to where you would exit the year and where the exit run rates are, okay. I would say right now kind of first of all, there is ongoing cost productivity we have also in North America, which is more than what we expect as a raw material cost increase, which by the way, is a big difference to \u201816. You had entering \u201816 still raw material tailwinds and we now have raw material headwinds. That is the fundamental massive difference. Of course, there is a fundamental currency reset. Entering \u201816, you had the Canadian dollar reset and now we have a massive Mexico reset, which is from a magnitude kind of not even comparable to what we have seen before and it seems to be getting worse day-by-day. So these are the big differences. But again, the margin expansion is driven by cost productivity, and two we still have a whole bunch of product introductions, which will allow us to drive mix in this still fairly aggressive market environment.","Ken Zener","I guess, the second question, I think Whirlpool is one of these [indiscernible], if you will and there is a really interesting article in Cleveland.com highlighting the fact that production just stopped from China and immediately went to Vietnam and Thailand for LG and Samsung, by and large for their products and Jeff, I believe I know you don\u2019t want to talk about politics, but I believe your travel schedule last week involved DC, how \u2013 can you kind of put this in context, because clearly these firms went from Mexico to China and now to other parts of Southeast Asia and we do have a different environment, not only is it more fiscal oriented versus monetary, but we have a President that\u2019s a bit more focused on the imports, can you talk about how perhaps that impacts U.S. producers like Whirlpool and GE? Thank you.","Jeff Fettig","Yes. Ken, I mean the high level, I mean let\u2019s start with Whirlpool. We are a global company. We have a global operating platform. And for the most part, our production is local for local. 82% of what we sell in the United States, we make in the United States. We never left the U.S. from manufacturing. We spent probably $1.5 billion over the last 6 years upgrading all of our U.S. \u2013 nine U.S. facilities, not only to the state-of-the-art manufacturing, training of our people, product innovation and so on. So we are hugely committed to successful U.S. manufacturing. We manufacture more in the U.S. than everyone else put together in our category. Now \u2013 so we also have been a victim, if you will, of illegal dumping for a long period of time in the U.S. appliance business. And so as it relates to the \u2013 I can\u2019t comment on any particulars, because I don\u2019t know them, but in terms of the new administration asking input from U.S. manufacturers, the things really are about, how do we ensure that American manufacturer is competitive? How do we create good new jobs in manufacturing? And what kind of inputs could \u2013 in terms of specific, whether it\u2019s around regulations or trade or taxes, would help American manufacturers not only be competitive, but also be able to add new jobs. And so that\u2019s \u2013 we have been part of that as there are many industries and there is obviously no conclusions yet, but given our footprint in the U.S., our position in the U.S., absolutely, we want to both have great manufacturing competitiveness in the U.S. and we want territory.","Operator","Thank you. We will go next to Bob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Bob Wetenhall","Hey, good morning. I don\u2019t know who the question is for, but your volume was like 12%, which is awesome and you had a little bit of a pricing headwind yet you saw margin contract by 130 basis points. So, I just thought with given the fixed cost nature of the business, it would offset the price decline. Can you step me through \u2013 I didn\u2019t think the currency impact, in particular in 4Q specifically was like the driver of negative margin compression. What\u2019s going on specifically just for the fourth quarter in North America in terms of profitability?","Marc Bitzer","Hey, Bob, it\u2019s Marc. So let me try to take this one. First of all, yes, our volume growth was significant. As usual, that\u2019s the total volume growth, which we published in North America, which also includes Mexico and Canada and which also includes KitchenAid small domestic, so it\u2019s not fully comparable to whatever is the published market on T6 or T7. Having said all that, as I have mentioned before, the margin impact was largely driven by three elements: one, yes, the Mexican peso weighs heavily, ballpark $20 million and particular as we exited the year, so that is a pretty heavy weight on this one; two, lot of the market growth, it\u2019s hard to exactly tell you for 12% how much loss, but I would say the majority came in mass and value segments, which are profitable, but not as profitable as the high-end products. So, they don\u2019t have \u2013 they are profitable and you make money on them, but they don\u2019t help you lift the average profitability. And thirdly, yes, in particular in washer, we were impacted by the aggressive promotion environment and that was probably the most painful one, because there was a lot of growth in washers in the markets and we simply could either not participate, because it was not value-creating or it was not very attractive promotional environment for washer. So, these were the three big elements which really impacted the Q4 margins.","Bob Wetenhall","Got it. That\u2019s exactly where I was trying to get. Thanks for the clarity there. Your segment margin targets for EMEA and LatAm, just trying to get some context, obviously, some FX headwinds with Brazil, softer demand in the UK, you guys have done a great job stepping us through that. Are you confident that as you cycle through in next year, that you can get to this range, because it looks like an aggressive range to get that margin uplift? And by the same token, it sounds like the Brazilian economy is turning pretty dramatically. And is your Brazilian outlook in terms of margin performance and targets potentially conservative given the fact that economic growth seems to be reasserting itself?","Marc Bitzer","Bob, it\u2019s Marc again. So, let me maybe first start with Latin America and Brazil and this is maybe one of the most overlooked gems which we had in our Q4 results. Because if you look at the Brazil margins in Q4, despite a really soft market environment of double-digit down, it\u2019s actually fairly impressive. What it really means, we brought the cost in our pricing into a situation where even with low volumes we have actually fairly attractive margins. What we have modeled for full year is flat with some cost in the first half as I indicated and probably modest growth in the second half. So I would say yes, on surface, the Latin America margin target is 7.5% to 8.5%, they may seem aggressive, but you can imagine this is not too dissimilar from what we had in North America several years ago. We have now the right structure from fixed cost and pricing, you load a little bit of volume on this one or you start not losing volume, you have very attractive margins and we are highly confident in Latin America.","On Europe, yes, it is quite a bit of growth versus last year. I would also argue 2016 was impacted by \u2013 was an extraordinary event, which we are anniversarying through and where we had certain mitigating actions. And on top of that, our cost takeout is and has been fully on track. So, we have no reason to slowdown our perspective integration activities. We know how much is coming through. We have so far fully delivered on the integration cost takeouts. Actually, local currency and over-delivered and so take the two things, working through the UK issues, getting the integration benefits better how we get to these margin targets. And that does not yet fully factoring any stronger growth for Russia, which as you know is highly impactful in our margins in Europe. The one thing which you didn\u2019t ask, but I guess you implied it, we also want to be clear, we have not walked away from our long-term margin targets in Europe. Whatever we communicated around the acquisition, we still think it\u2019s fully achievable, because the UK impact has probably been delayed by a year, but we fully stand behind these long-term targets.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Denise Chai with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Denise Chai","Right, thank you. Can you hear me?","Marc Bitzer","Yes.","Denise Chai","Okay, great. Just going back to Slide 28, could you please breakout the drag from currency and emerging market macro in each year?","Jim Peters","In each year. So, if we go back and look at in \u2013 we were $200 million of a drag this year. And then last year, I believe we were $400 million drag from an EPS perspective from currency.","Denise Chai","How about emerging markets?","Jim Peters","Then emerging market demand, if you really look at, I would say approximately \u2013 that\u2019s approximately half and half, maybe a little bit more heavily weighted to the prior year, within that ballpark now, yes.","Denise Chai","And for \u201817, what are you assuming?","Jim Peters","So for \u201817, we are assuming currency has an impact of $0.50 right now. And then for demand, as Marc alluded to on the demand, we assume flat.","Denise Chai","Okay, got it. Thanks. And just looking at sundry and some which tends to swing around a bit, what are some of the swing factors for \u201816 and what\u2019s baked into your expectations for \u201817?","Jim Peters","Sorry, I didn\u2019t hear the sundry. We expect it to be flat year-over-year.","Denise Chai","Okay, flat, got it. Thank you. And so just one last one, just looking at your restructuring cash outlays, do you think that \u201817 will be the peak or how are you thinking about this going forward?","Jim Peters","Well, I think what you will see at \u201817 and \u201818 are the two heaviest years. And then once we get beyond \u201818, it drops off dramatically. So our expectations right now would be \u201817 and \u201818 are the peaks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning. I guess I had two questions. Jeff, first of all, in your prepared remarks, you made reference to some inefficiencies that you incurred on the, I guess, on the manufacturing side and the laundry given the strength in the quarter. And I am just thinking about that Western Ohio laundry complex, where I believe you are still running two shifts and not yet running a third shift. And I guess my first question is given the strength we have seen in laundry and your success in winning some share back there in 2016, are you beginning to bump up against some manufacturing constraints with the two shift model there that\u2019s creating marginal cost that was a factor in the margin performance in the quarter? And does this mean you have to bring on a third shift in \u201817 and what the economics of that might reflect?","Jeff Fettig","David, no, really what I was referring to was we did have a strained second half from a demand and shipment standpoint. Things were \u2013 as you know our industry well, I mean, it\u2019s fairly predictable going up or down or whichever direction. And the first half was pretty solid throughout the quarter, 5% growth. And then all of a sudden, we saw zero, actually, negative growth in July and August and September. And as you know, we don\u2019t wait very long to start digesting our inventories and production and so on and so forth. So we were surprised in the Q3 with 2 months of negative demand and shipments. And then it came roaring back even much more than we expected in the fourth quarter. And so my only point was is that we have kind of a plus 5% first half, flat third quarter and a plus, whatever it was 12% fourth quarter. There is a lot of gyrations in your supply chain and manufacturing adjustments and inventory and so on and it just cause inefficiencies. It has nothing to do with capacity. We can handle \u2013 I mean, you are right I mean we have a lot of options on capacity. We got installed capacity. We got shifts, little bottlenecks we can resolve in a fairly short period of time. So it was really just about the unusual nature of Q3 demand or lack thereof and then roaring back in Q4.","David MacGregor","Okay. Thanks for that. And then my second question, I guess with respect to again, you are talking about the recovery of demand and value price points, I am not sure if everyone on the call understands that in those price points, you play with some different brands Roper at Lowe\u2019s and Amana at Home Depot, but in our price checks over Black Friday, you were a full $100 below where the Koreans were playing and I am just wondering if maybe you got yourself a little overly aggressive on value pricing in the quarter and that may have been a factor in the margin performance as well?","Marc Bitzer","David, it\u2019s Marc. We saw what you wrote in your pre-call. Long story short, I am not quite sure I would concur with your observation. At one point, we may want to do store check. If you compare a high capacity top loader from certain competitors, which is brought down from a regular MSRP from $999 to $499 and you compare that with a lower capacity agitator model, it\u2019s \u2013 you may have $100 difference, but it\u2019s not remote to comparison. Bit line structure entire point, which we always made about price compression throughout the range. So you are comparing apples-to-oranges. And if you would have seen at some of the frontload pricing and high-end top-load pricing of certain competitors, it\u2019s being, by a long shot, the most aggressive in many years so completely different from apparently what you observe.","Jeff Fettig","And I would only add to that Dave, I think that\u2019s \u2013 the price point thing, you are probably right. But in terms of the apples-to-oranges is the issue. In fact that\u2019s what we proved decisively with the Department of Commerce and ITC was that it\u2019s not price points, it\u2019s like comparisons. And we are \u2013 I doubt that we are the lowest in the marketplace.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Sam Eisner with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Sam Eisner","Yes. Good morning everyone.","Marc Bitzer","Good morning.","Sam Eisner","So, just going to your total cost takeout number that you cited of about 1.5 point, which includes the $150 million of raw material headwinds, I think if you add that on top of the roughly $300 million, you have to drive about $450 million of cost takeout this year, can you just bucket where that\u2019s coming from, I think you called about $75 million from restructuring, but still is a pretty sizable chunk, if you can just highlight where that\u2019s coming from on a dollar basis that would be great?","Marc Bitzer","Sam, it\u2019s Marc. First of all, your math is correct, $150 million raw material headwind, that\u2019s what we see at this point. Obviously, associated with some uncertainty, but that\u2019s what we see from today\u2019s perspective between $450 million on all the other cost buckets. So yes, we have $75 million restructuring. There is also quite a bit, as I alluded earlier, of synergies from the acquisitions and our ongoing cost productivity, which basically means targeted cost takeout on certain existing products, etcetera. And also fixed cost actions, which we are taking. So we typically don\u2019t break it down in buckets in terms of what is fixed cost, what is cost takeout and what our synergy is, because and particularly between synergies and cost takeouts, 3 years of integration is kind of hard to split it out. We will split out of course, the restructuring going forward. But again, the total is $450 million in terms of cost takeout absent of raw material and we are - also if you look at historical run rates, I think that\u2019s a level which we absolutely are confident we can achieve.","Sam Eisner","Got it. And then just maybe going back to the North America pricing, if you look at the retailer comps, you think Home Depot as a proxy, right, they have seen basically double-digit comp in their appliances throughout the course of the first nine months of the year and so I was wondering if you can just opine on kind of how your customers are thinking about the promotional environment, how accepting are they of getting actually price increases into next year. And then ultimately, is there any kind of commentary that you would like to provide on how any announced price increases are looking through January? Thanks.","Marc Bitzer","Sam, it\u2019s Marc again. First of all, when you look at the numbers, which were communicated or published by Home Depot or Lowe\u2019s, yes, their appliance business was very strong. Keep that in mind that it was on the back of some fairly significant distribution shifts in the overall landscape, which has been going on for some time and probably was accelerated in particular back end of \u201816 and is not yet over. So I would see underneath was strong North America market, there is some fairly massive distribution changes, which I would say right now play in favor of both Lowe\u2019s and Home Depot. And we don\u2019t see that this is going to slowing down immediately. In that environment again, it\u2019s obviously \u2013 we don\u2019t comment on how certain retailers respond to our promotion offers or whatever we plan on price increases. It\u2019s \u2013 retailers compete against each other and usually there is not always a receptiveness to drive pricing up, but that\u2019s our day-to-day work and that\u2019s what we have done in the past.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Alvaro Lacayo with Gabelli & Company.","Alvaro Lacayo","Good morning. I guess my first question just on the sort of unique nature of the way that the demand for shipments worked out in the back half of the year, maybe if you can provide some more context or perspective on what drove the strength and if there is any sort of one-time items that made this number look stronger, I mean I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s destocking from competitors or if there is some pull forward in demand, but any commentary around that would be great. And then with the 4% to 6% growth that you are predicting for North America going into \u201817, what is the primary driver of that growth in terms of that mass and value segment, is that going to be the predominant driver and does that sort of weigh down on mix through \u201817?","Jeff Fettig","Let me take the first one since I brought it up. No. Like I said, I mean we were perplexed in July and August when we saw negative shipments from the industry after a very consistent plus 5%. And if you remember in the third quarter call, we said that didn\u2019t make a lot of sense to us. Candidly, all the underlying \u2013 our drivers of appliance demand were good, in fact very good. And the \u2013 anecdotally, the only thing we could really assess at that point in time with our retail customers was that that was the height of the political election campaign, a lot of negative stuff out there and that makes consumers cautious and for a period of time quit buying. We also said we think that would continue. And I think when we gave kind of our full year guidance in October, it assumed that we kind of popped back to 5% or so demand. Well, the fact of the matter is again, anecdotally, it looks like that was pretty much spot-on and that the pent-up \u2013 the delayed purchases in Q3 came back on full force in Q4. And I frankly think it\u2019s as simple as that. The full year was 6%. We always talked about 4% to 6%. So I think that\u2019s the natural run rate. And I would go back in Marc\u2019s comments for this year. The underlying demand drivers are all good. Replacement is good, new construction is good. Just the home sales is good and discretionary, which is largely remodeling, is good. So that\u2019s why we expect to see that kind of demand.","Marc Bitzer","Alvaro, it\u2019s Marc. Maybe just adding particularly for the \u201817 outlook again, we guide 4% to 6%, which will be kind of at the pretty much where the back half was. That is based on we still see strong housing environment, so we basically see 1.3 million housing starts, around 5.5 million existing home sales, low unemployment and consumer confidence above 90. And we \u2013 for today\u2019s perspective, we just don\u2019t see any reason why this would slowdown in \u201817. Now what you need to be careful as in the past is whenever you see monthly industry shipment data, always don\u2019t lose that these are sell in shipment data, which may be impacted by when certain competitors bring products into the country, how they manage, recall the units and shipment data so there is noise in the monthly shipment data. Unfortunately, there is no reliable public information of sell-out data, but from the data which we have, consumer sell-out is much more stable than you would expect from these sell-in data, which also is probably explanation between the strange Q3 versus Q4 numbers. Consumers act more stable from a sell-out perspective and what we see \u2013 what we saw on December, that\u2019s what we have seen in January so far. Now specifically answering your question on the mass and value, yes, we do and that\u2019s probably a positive perspective from a macroeconomic. The wage growth arriving finally in the middle and lower income levels, which drives them back in the stores and then drives some demand. Our job is through cost productivity and mix management to make us very profitable also in these segments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Megan McGrath with MKM Partners.","Megan McGrath","Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, just a couple of clarification, on your EBIT walk at the end of your presentation, in terms of price mix, you are expecting zero, I think zero to 2.5 this year, what was it in \u201816?","Jim Peters","So if we go back in \u201816, we would have been about a negative point of price mix as we look at for the full year. And then the 0.5, the zero to 0.5 we expect is based on our previously announced price increases going into 2017 as well as our new product launches.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our last question from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh","Good morning Jeff, Marc, Jim, how are you and happy New Year too.","Jim Peters","Thank you.","Sam Darkatsh","I understand we are up against it on the clock. I just have clarification questions, if I could. Of the $450 million in total cost takeout and $150 million in raw material inflation, how much of that is North America specific for both those line items?","Marc Bitzer","Sam, it\u2019s Marc. And as usual, we don\u2019t breakdown exact details. Now, what I can tell you first of all, $150 million, but $150 million raw material headwind is largely North America and largely globally on steel. And steel particularly see on North America and China. So if you want to say so, I would say of $150 million, North America and China sees a disproportioned amount, but we see a somewhat unfavorable environment pretty much throughout the globe. As I said before, there is some uncertainty around these numbers. We don\u2019t believe always raw material trends are demand-driven, so there are there factors coming to play and that drives some uncertainty. But that\u2019s what we see today. The $450 million, on the other hand yes, there is a North America portion. Keep in mind, there is still, I would say disproportionate amount off in Europe and that\u2019s just a result of restructuring and still remainder of integration benefit.","Jeff Fettig","Okay. Well, with that, we have hit the hour. I would like to just close again. Appreciate everybody being online. We finished a record year \u201816 and we are going to a record year in \u201817. There is a lot of volatility but hopefully as we have talked, we have got the plans in place to be able to deal with this. So we look forward to \u2013 thanks or joining us. And we look forward to talking to you next time. Thank you.","Operator","And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thanks for your participation.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Joe Lovechio.","Joseph Lovechio","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, as well as in the Appendix of this presentation.","Turning to Slide 3. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operation as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation.","Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation, beginning on Slide 31 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me start by noting that we delivered significant improvement in our third quarter operating results driven by our North America, Latin America and Asia regions. Year to date, we're delivering on our commitments to expand our operating margins, and we've significantly strengthened our free cash flow. In fact, these results marked the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement this year.","Overall, our actions have more than offset higher material cost inflation and unfavorable foreign currency. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives are on track to deliver the expected $200 million of cost savings benefits for this year. And very importantly, we continue to see strong price and mix improvement during the quarter driven by a strong cadence of new product introduction and our strong global consumer brand portfolio, which is enabling us to mix up in most markets around the world. As a result, we're increasing our full year ongoing business operation guidance for EPS to $6.90 to $7.10 per share and our free cash flow to between $125 million and $175 million.","Turning to Slide 6. You'll see that overall revenues were up 5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency and BEFIEX. This revenue growth was driven by our strong price and mix.","Our diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved 6x what they were last year to $1.80 per share compared to $0.29 in the prior year. And our underlying free cash flow improved significantly year-over-year from our ongoing business operations.","Turning to Slide 7, you can see our industry demand assumptions for the year. Globally, we continue to expect second half industry demand to improve from first half levels.","And although while industry demand remains in many markets relatively weak, we are optimistic about some growth that we're seeing in some particular markets, and particularly trends that we're seeing in the U.S. housing market. Additionally, our ongoing business performance shift continue to improve because of our strong pipeline of new product innovations coming to the market and the benefit of our cost savings initiatives that we've already announced.","On Slide 8, you can clearly see our positive price and mix and margin expansion trends over the last several quarters. Year-to-date, we made very strong progress towards our full year margin, and we fully expect to reach our full year operating profit margin guidance of between 5.5% and 6%.","At this point in time, I'd like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer for his review of our North America operations.","Marc R. Bitzer","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by reviewing North America's performance in the third quarter.","Starting on Slide 10. Both revenues and margins for the region grew during the quarter. And our strong operating margins exceed 9% for the quarter and were driven by price and mix. Our continuous investment in innovation, coupled with strong market execution, drove significant product improvement.","Turning to Slide 11. You see the net sales of $2.4 billion increased slightly over 2% from last year, driven by favorable price from lower volumes.","And as we've previously stated, our priority is margin improvement. We have gained share in the higher price segment across most products, driven by innovation, as evidenced by our positive mix. Our ongoing business operating profit was $227 million, which more than tripled as compared to $62 million in 2011. This means overall ongoing business operating margin was up almost 7 points year-over-year. In addition to price and mix, the year-over-year improvement was also driven by the benefit of our cost and capacity reduction initiatives.","Turning to Slide 12. You can just see just one example of a new innovation that is driving improved price and mix. The photo shows our new Whirlpool brand, White Ice Collection.","Lastly, as I mentioned on our last call, shown on Slide 13. It is important to point out that there is good upside for the business as underlying industry demand improves. And as we've already stated during our last earnings call, we continue to see some early but consistent signs of housing recovery, which makes us increasingly optimistic about a more structural demand recovery.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations.","Michael A. Todman","Thanks, Marc. Turning to Slide 15. Overall, our international operations were led by strong performances in our Latin America and Asia regions, which more than offset the effect of unfavorable currency and the weak economic environment in Europe. We delivered improved price and mix across our international business, as we continue to launch consumer-relevant innovations in every product category around the world.","If you turn to Slide 16, you'll see our Latin America third quarter results. Sales of $1.2 billion were flat to the prior year. Excluding currency and BEFIEX, sales increased more than 21% on higher volumes and improved mix.","Operating profit for the quarter totaled $118 million compared to $147 million in the prior year. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by lower monetization of tax credits.","On an adjusted basis, excluding Brazilian tax credits, our operating profit for the quarter totaled $105 million compared to $85 million, a 24% improvement year-over-year. We saw good market demand in Brazil and across the entire Latin America region.","Turning to Slide 17. We gained share in our core 3 appliances with a positive price and mix, offsetting the adverse effects of higher material cost. For our Latin America business outside of Brazil, we had a record operating profit across the region and our adjusted margin increased more than 1 point.","Turning to Slide 18. During the quarter, we faced continued weak consumer demand across the Eurozone, negative conversion due to reduced production, unfavorable currency and high raw material cost. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales declined to $703 million, with unit shipments down 9% compared to the prior period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 10%. The region had an operating loss of $35 million compared to the $12 million loss in the prior year period.","Given the environment, we have taken appropriate actions to position the business for a return to profitability during the fourth quarter as we realize benefits from our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives, benefit from higher seasonal volumes during the fourth quarter, improved price and mix within key countries and across our distribution, supported by new product innovations and realize the benefits from our ongoing productivity initiatives, which will ramp up in the fourth quarter. We will further accelerate these actions to ensure we move to a profitable position despite a continued negative environment.","Our third quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 19. During the quarter, we gained market share in India and expanded our margins across the region despite weak consumer demand and unfavorable currency.","Net sales decreased 6% during the quarter to $201 million, down from $215 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 2%. The region's operating profit was $7 million, up from $4 million in the prior year.","In local currency, we are on track for a record year of performance in India despite lower industry volumes and higher material costs.","Slide 20 shows the continued strong cadence of new international product launches and design awards during the quarter.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli.","Larry M. Venturelli","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As Jeff mentioned and as shown on Slide 22, given our strong year-to-date operating performance and trends, entering the fourth quarter, we are increasing our annual ongoing business operations EPS range to $6.90 to $7.10 per share compared to the previous range of $6.50 to $7.","We're also increasing our free cash flow guidance to between $125 million and $175 million. As you can see on Slide 23, we continue to expect the 5.5% to 6% ongoing operating profit margin for the full year. This translates into a 300 basis point improvement.","Our ongoing operating profit margins increased to approximately 6% during the third quarter and is expected to continue increasing in the fourth quarter, given higher seasonal volumes, benefits from our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives and continued sequential productivity improvement.","Our year-over-year margin improvement drivers for Q3 were price\/mix, which was up approximately 4 points and is trending higher than original expectations. Driven by both cost-based price increases, as well as favorable mix, we continue to expect positive year-over-year price and mix for the balance of the year.","Another positive margin contributor has been benefits associated with our cost and capacity reduction program, contributing over a point to our year-over-year margin improvement during the quarter.","Material cost inflation was approximately $60 million in the third quarter. While we did benefit from sequential improvement in productivity from the second quarter, our productivity was somewhat impacted due to continued weakness in demand, primarily within Western Europe.","Now turning to free cash flow on Slide 24. Consistent with our expectations, we did have cash outflow through the first 9 months of the year of $435 million, significantly better than the $740 million of outflow last year.","Adjusting for items impacting comparability, our underlying ongoing business cash flow improved by over $450 million compared to this time last year.","Let me spend a couple of minutes on some general topics embedded in our third quarter results and 2012 guidance. Before I do that, as a general reminder, Slide 33 and 34 in the Appendix will provide you with a reconciliation of our reported GAAP operating profits and EPS to ongoing business operations for 2012 and 2011.","Included in this table, our third quarter 2012 adjustments to drive our ongoing business operation performance, removing the impact of restructuring, tax credits, as well as the impacts from legal resolutions and an adjustment to normalize the third quarter tax rate to reflect the rate of 25% which is consistent with our full year tax rate assumption.","Turning to the financial summary on Slides 25 and 26, let me provide a couple of important observations. It's important to note that net sales in constant currencies and excluding, BEFIEX credits, were up approximately 5%. Monetization of BEFIEX tax credits were $13 million compared to $62 million last year as a result of the IPI tax holiday in Brazil. As of September 30, $202 million of credits remain. The IPI tax holiday in Brazil was recently extended to December 31, and we now expect to monetize approximately $40 million to $45 million for the full year.","Regarding interest and sundry. In the third quarter, we resolved some nonrecurring legal items. The net impact of these, $22 million in expense was recorded in interest and sundry for the quarter and is adjusted from ongoing business operations to provide better clarity of our underlying business results.","Slide 27 illustrates our cost and capacity reduction charges. The program is progressing very well. We are on track to deliver $200 million of benefit in 2012, with an additional $200 million of benefit in 2013.","In closing, 2012 is shaping up to be a very solid year of margin improvement. We have a vast majority of our legacy legal liability payments behind us, and our underlying operating cash flow is strong.","During the fourth quarter, the company completes its annual planning process, including contract negotiation with key stakeholders. Consistent with prior year's practice, we will provide guidance for 2013 during our next conference call in late January, early February.","Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","Thanks, Larry. Let me sum up by turning to Slide 29 and just highlight the following points. Again, we are delivering our margin expansion and cash flow commitments for the year. We continue to increase our cadence of new product innovation in the marketplace. We are realizing the benefit of our cost and capacity reduction initiatives, and we're beginning to see some positive growth trends, in particular recent U.S. housing trends. So overall, we're pleased with our progress, and we expect to finish this year strong.","Given our improving operating margins, we're upwardly revising our ongoing business operations and free cash flow guidance. And as we enter the fourth quarter, we are on track for the year to realize our full year operating margin target of 5.5% to 6%. I believe this will, we will achieve a record year for margin expansion across our global business. And we certainly believe at this point in time we are on track towards delivering our midterm 8% operating margin target.","As Larry mentioned, we're not giving 2013 guidance today, but we do fully expect our positive momentum to carry over into 2013 as we realize an even greater benefit from our restructuring and cost initiatives, as well as a continued strong cadence of new product introductions.","Finally on Slide 30. I'm increasingly confident in our opportunities that we see to grow in our business. These opportunities for us will come through our investments and consumer-relevant innovations. We see appliance growth opportunities in both developed and emerging markets. We are making good progress in expanding into higher margins, faster-growing adjacent businesses, and we continue to strengthen our global brand portfolio.","We continue to make progress on our roadmap for growth. And more importantly we're performing at levels, and we'll continue to increase those levels to create value for our shareholders.","So with that, I'm going to close in on our formal remarks and open this up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the site of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Two questions. First off, market share in North America and Europe look to be sharply lower. I know some of that's by design. When do you expect that to stabilize? And how important is it to you as opposed to incremental returns on capital? And the second question would be regarding sequential price versus mix. Can you throw a little color, specifically around the world, as to what you're seeing sequentially with price and mix as opposed to them combined?","Marc R. Bitzer","Sam, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me try to answer both questions for North America. First of all on market share, and let me give you a broader context. I mean we've said all along, I think over the last 5 or 6 earnings calls, that our focus is on restoring operating margin. And why? Very simply because it doesn't make sense to push for volume when you have sub-par margin. I think it's more than fair to say what we've delivered on that promise. We outperformed our competitors by a long shot in our operating margin in North America. With that in mind, our share loss actually is fairly small. And I think more important, and I'm coming to you coming on by line is if you break down the component of the share movement. We actually gained share in the higher end segment. That is evidenced by the strong, I mean with the exceptionally strong product mix, price\/mix which we got in Q3. And obviously you wouldn't get that kind of mix if you don't gain share in the higher end segment. At the same time, and that's by design element, we kind of -- we did not go up to a certain unprofitable low end market shares. [indiscernible] by design, and I would say that has certainly stabilized now. So I don't expect -- even as you know we don't give forward guidance, but I would consider that right now as a stable market share, and we're pretty comfortable with the levels right now. Pretty good. On your second part of your question, the sequential pricing. Actually, as Larry indicated, the global price in Q3 was 4%, slightly above 4% year-over-year. North America was quite a bit above that, which basically also tells you sequentially we were stable, which I would say given that we've kind of -- going to anniversary of the price increase of last year is a very strong performance. And again, as I mentioned before, it's largely mix driven, because obviously the like-for-like price impact basic levels of [indiscernible] anniversary for price increases.","Larry M. Venturelli","Sam, let me address your first question on Europe market share. We did lose some market share, although not significant in Europe. But again, it's clearly focused on making sure that we go after the share that really counts for our business. And so we don't expect that to continue. As a matter of fact, what we saw in September is that we started to recover share in key categories that we wanted to, and we expect that to continue as we go into the fourth quarter. In terms of your second question on sequential price\/mix. For the overall international region, we were stable. And then region to region, it was more or less stable in most of the regions I think slightly down in Europe, but everywhere else it was stable.","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, Sam. From both Marc and Larry's comment from a global perspective sequentially, price\/mix all look very, very well. We did have some nice margin improvement coming from restructuring productivity between Q2 and Q3. And as far as what we'd expect in Q4 due to the seasonality of the business, we'd expect the mix-up again in Q4.","Operator","Our next question is from the site of Joshua Pollard from Goldman Sachs.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My first one is on your 2013 restructuring benefit. I sort of think of your productivity and restructuring in 2 separate buckets. There's the ongoing piece, which is pretty hard to see in your margins. And then there's what you guys have done over the last year, which is obviously showing up in your margins. When you say restructuring for 2013, the benefit to be $200 million, which of those 2 buckets does it fall into? Should we see that in your margins? And if so, in what regions?","Jeff M. Fettig","Josh, this is Jeff. Absolutely. And we communicated it in 2 buckets. The restructuring benefits relate to the announcements we made 1 year ago at this time, where we said we were going to reduce our fixed cost. We were going to take out unprofitable capacity, and that we would deliver $200 million in net benefits to our P&L in 2012 and another $200 million net benefits to our P&L in 2013. And that's still the plan, and we're on track to do that. Separate from that is our ongoing net cost productivity, which takes into account material inflation, et cetera, et cetera, and then the productivity actions that we take to offset that. This year we continue to have, given the GDP around the world, very high raw material cost inflation. We had very high salary and benefits and electricity and things like that around the world. We did have a good -- we are having a good year of gross productivity. But that's an area where we have not been able to fully offset that inflation in our net productivity. Going into next year, we will see when we give guidance in late January, early February. We'll give you our assumptions on that but typically, we would try to offset all of that and have positive net productivity, particularly if we had stable or modestly growing volume.","Larry M. Venturelli","And then Josh, this is Larry. As far as the restructuring in the margin. An approximation, you'd see about 85% of restructuring flow-through. Gross margin, 25% -- 15% would be within the SG&A area. The regional split, 75% North America. Europe would be 15% to 20%, and the rest of the world will be the balance.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My second one is on your volumes by end market. I guess this question is going to be for Marc. Can you talk about your volumes in the contractor channel versus retail? And then within the retail, can you talk about how long it's going to take you guys before you lap sort of the market share losses that you guys have blatantly taken this year? In other words, should we expect relative to AHAM 6 that your retail volumes are sort of 5 to 6 points below the industry for the next 4 quarters? Or is it some shorter period of time?","Marc R. Bitzer","It's Marc Bitzer. First of all, when you look at our Q3 volumes, there's one additional comment which we need to make. There was a specific impact due to an exceptionally weak Mexican market, which had an impact on the overall quarter. But having said that, our volumes also in U.S. have been down in Q3. Now to answer your question about the split of retail versus contract if you want to make that simplification. Obviously, to date the weight of so-called contract to build the channel is significantly lower [indiscernible]. We're talking about a factor of 3. Now what has happened in the meantime is, I would say, significant strength in our position in that contract to build the channel and are therefore, in our view, very well positioned to an upturn in that market. Given the recent trends in the housing market, it is yet too early to see that impact in our numbers. Yet, you see an increase in the building contract channels, but it's not to a magnitude that has had significant weight in our overall business. Having said that, with ongoing good news in the housing market, I expect that positive momentum to more and more show up in our overall numbers.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","What was the difference in the growth between retail and contractor for the quarter?","Marc R. Bitzer","What I said, Josh, is that the contract channel in terms of impact or size [indiscernible] is down by a factor of 3 pretty much versus the 6. I mean we're talking about a very, very significant market.","Jeff M. Fettig","Year-over-year, Josh, absolutely we're seeing increase in the contract shipments year-over-year in strong double digits as we have all year. But I think Marc's point was it's just a small part of the total market.","Operator","We'll move next to that site of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","I guess you still have a few billion dollars of unrecovered cost inflation over the past decade. Just what's the opportunity to continue leveraging innovation to get pricing and rebuild margins? I guess that'll be the first question.","Jeff M. Fettig","David, we absolutely agree with you. Despite generally difficult economic conditions around the world, we continue to see every day the consumers pay for real innovation. And that's why our focus is and has been all through this downturn -- we never have stopped to reduce our level of investment in new product innovation or R&D. If anything, we've been increasing it of late. So you would expect the cadence of innovation from us to continue and probably at an increasing rate. Because that is -- that with strong brands is how you can sell and create value in our business, at least in our business model. But we don't take our productivity. That's why a year ago we said we did not know when global demand levels would return or what the new norm was. And that we were going to reduce our fixed costs by $400 million to adjust to this -- today's level of demand and expand our operating margins. And we'll have that again $200 million, which is almost a full point or is a full point going into next year that we fully expect to realize. And then lastly, I'd add productivity. Again, even during this downturn, prolonged downturn and weak global GDP growth, we've had tremendous amount [ph] of  material cost inflation. There are times, like we did this year and some last year, where it is imperative that we go out with cost-based price increases as we have. In some high inflation markets of the world, we even recently announced new price increases. So we're willing to do that. I think going back to Marc's question, we don't see a lot of value in chasing low end in our view profit, destroying pieces of the business when we have opportunities to invest in new product innovation that we get paid for. So we're committed. We're by no means done in our operating margin target that we laid out a couple of years ago for 2014, say, plus percent operating profit. We're still committed to that, and we see ample opportunities around the world to be able to achieve that.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","I guess the question is just with -- in light of the innovation that you bring into market, can you -- does that give you the means to achieve pricing despite a flat raw material market? The flat raw material market should continue fairly couple of years. Is innovation enough to allow you to continue to improve your pricing as you go and recover a couple of billion dollars of unrecovered cost inflation?","Jeff M. Fettig","Well again, I think a couple billion that you talked about, it is true that's what we absorbed. I\u2019ll put it a different way. I do believe we can sell our new product innovation at attractive value-creating levels which will, in fact, continue to drive us to mix up. So I -- we are, nowhere in the world today are we satisfied with our operating margins. So we're taking actions on both new product innovation in parts of the world and new pricing, but certainly also focusing on cost and productivity to ensure that we have a pipeline of margin expanding activities in our system to be able to deal with whatever kind of environment we see.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Second question, just last question. You're talking about the $200 million of restructuring benefits and creating net P&L benefit of $200 million a year for 2 years. If we get some kind of a cyclical recovery in 2013, presumably everybody's going to beef up their ad spend, and I'm just wondering how much of that $200 million for 2013 you think you can actually take to the bottom line versus having to redeploy into a brand support?","Jeff M. Fettig","Well, we've already been beefing up our brand in new product innovation investment. And as we have more and more new products to do, we'll continue to do that. So again, we're not giving 2013 guidance today. But the flip side of -- as we see recovery, we're going to have volume leverage as well. So I think there are a number of levers available to us in our business to both invest the right way to create value and to fund that while expanding our operating margins.","Operator","We'll move next to the site of Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Two questions. First of all, the increase in the full year guidance, it looks like Europe, you're probably going to make less money than you originally expected. So I'm interested in the moving parts within the increased guidance. That's my first question.","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, Eric. If you look at where we are year to date and again, we talk about continued seeing strong momentum as we finished the year on a full year basis, Europe is lower and North America is higher. And everywhere else is about the same.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","And then secondly with North America, you've been focused this year on -- focused greater on profitability and less on volume and your retail partners have gone along with that. I'm curious if you think this is sustainable for an extended period of time. How you think about that as we look into 4Q and even into 2013?","Marc R. Bitzer","Eric, it's Marc Bitzer. Again, let me reiterate our focus has been on margin expansion. I think the big difference in Q3 compared to prior quarters, it's more than just price\/mix, but we also have now price\/mix and productivity and part of that coming from the structure. I would say our margin expansion is now in better footing than it was probably in Q1, Q2, which as you know also speaks volumes about sustainability. And our ability to keep pricing up on several sequential quarters and getting cost gives us quite a bit of confidence to make it sustainable.","Jeff M. Fettig","And to add to that too is our trade partners certainly expect and benefit from our new product innovation. They expect us and benefit for -- as investing in our brands, which brings customers in their doors. Selling the better mix of product for them is as helpful to them as it is to us.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","And then lastly, the assumption for 4Q North America is an improvement in volume relative to the year-to-date and relative to 3Q. Interested in sort of what you're seeing in the business that gives you some confidence and a little bit of a step-up in volumes in 4Q?","Marc R. Bitzer","Eric, it's Marc Bitzer again. As you've seen, we've kind of kept our full year volume\/mix [indiscernible] or industry guidance on the same level [indiscernible]. If you mathematically would take the midpoint, that would give you a 3.5% to 4% growth. I think what is [indiscernible] affecting our guidance is at the lower end of that range, which is probably making the 1% or 2% growth in Q4. And that's pretty much what is the most probable scenario. We continue to see a lot of volatility in the market. But right now we're at, as I've said before, coming from the margin and cost take-outs, we're in very good position for Q4.","Larry M. Venturelli","And the other thing I'll add is just globally for the company, Q3 to Q4. Volumes, in general, are around 15% sequentially.","Jeff M. Fettig","Normal seasonality.","Operator","We'll go next to the site of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","A lot of questions already asked. If you could maybe give us a specific update on U.S. Home Depot, the pilot program. Give us a comment on Brazil, relative to your margin outlook as it relates specifically, I believe, to one of your competitors. Perhaps losing a land position to make a factory. That's the first question.","Marc R. Bitzer","Ken, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me first take your Home Depot question. As you know, we have a long-standing quality of not getting specific of trade partners' strategies or actions. But obviously, it's a well-known fact that we kind of participate with the Whirlpool brand, in addition to our success with Maytag and Amana business at Home Depot, in what Home Depot put out as a pilot, what they called the [indiscernible]. I would say the only comment which we can make, we're actually very pleased with the progress so far. And it's in line or even slightly above our expectations so far.","Jeff M. Fettig","And Ken to answer the question on Brazil. We feel good about our continued margin expansion in that region. We're expecting to see that progress continue in the fourth quarter. Our volumes have been very strong. As you can see in the core 3 appliances of the strategy that we deployed all year is working. And frankly, I won't speculate on what our competitors will or will not do. What we're trying to do is execute our strategy, have the right innovation in the market and ensure that consumers want our products [indiscernible]. So far, it's working.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess to the extent that you said the volume shortfall, while partly from Mexico was certainly related to walking away from some of the low end share. Marc, I believe you said that those share losses had stabilized. Would that imply to the extent you got margin growth in the third quarter due to mix, you're now not believing off share [ph] in lower margin product. Does that imply sequential margin pressure in North America?","Marc R. Bitzer","Ken, it's Marc. And obviously, it's a number of question embedded in 1 big question. On the volume, Mexico had a very peculiar and very soft market, I would say, year-to-date. It's kind of [indiscernible] emerging market pattern, which we expect to stabilize going forward. That had a very significant impact or had a significant impact in our overall Q3 unit business. My comment on the low end was referring to -- and that is again the context of margin expansion. We focus on selling on innovation, particularly the higher end of the market. And we also had a significant mix growth. At the same time, we kind of -- we did not aggressively go after some low end unprofitable market segment. And that's why we vacated [ph] some share. I would say that action is behind us. It's pretty much stabilized. I don't -- from that natural trend, we don't expect a big change, and we can't comment and won't comment much about Q4 specifics. But I don't expect that massive change in market share trend so far.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","All right. I guess,  and then just my last question would be taking a step back given near 600, 700 basis points margin move in the U.S. How much of the ITC petition -- there's 2 of them, obviously the refrigerator being appealed; but the current tariff in place on washers. How should we think about perhaps benefits you're already receiving from these petitions, relative to your internal actions related to price and not willing to back up? How much of the tariff benefit has already been, perhaps, incorporated?","Marc R. Bitzer","Ken, it's Marc again. Simple answer is 0. I don't think we have any benefit in our current Q3 performance, which also means if there's a positive outcome, which we count on, that should be outside.","Operator","The next is the site of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question on North American margins, obviously great performance and congrats on that. Looking at the performance sequentially though, up about 180 bps, excluding the gain from 2Q on slightly lower revenue and I guess part of that as you've been talking about is mix. Is that kind of the biggest driver, in terms of the sequential improvement in margin profitability? Or are there incremental benefits coming from price, or even perhaps on a sequential basis any benefit from lower raw materials?","Marc R. Bitzer","Michael, it's Marc Bitzer again. Just on your question with sequential margin. There's 2 components which you've got to look at. One is the pricing component as such, which pretty much held as an impact. However, the composition of the pricing impact has changed. And Q2 was a little bit more like-for-like and less mix. And now, it's a whole lot more mix and less like-for-like. And that's just the nature of us going through the anniversary of price increase from last year. The second component that has changed is we see cost and restructuring benefits in Q3 to a higher or much higher extent than we saw in Q2.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And also I guess looking at Europe, Mike, if you could shed some light, at least on stated revenue basis, revenues have inched up a little bit in 2Q and 3Q coming off of the first quarter. Yet margins have obviously deteriorated. Just kind of trying to understand it sequentially, in terms of -- because certainly, you've been getting some restructuring benefits from a cost side this year. But it seems like the profits have been going the other way despite higher revenues. So what's been going on there, and what's behind the confidence behind profitability in the fourth quarter?","Michael A. Todman","Yes, first, Michael, just to kind of look at, although revenues have been going up, we had to take out fairly significant amount of production. And just from a seasonal perspective, you normally see kind of increases in volume quarter-over-quarter. But still, if you look at the third quarter, revenues were down about 10%. But why we're confident going forward is both on the restructuring side, in terms of the benefit as you know takes a little bit longer to ramp those up. We're going to see more of those in the fourth quarter. We see more productivity coming in the fourth quarter. We have higher seasonal revenues in the fourth quarter and we already saw -- we were already profitable in the month of September, and we see that continuing in October. So we're pretty confident that we've -- that all of the actions that we've been taking very aggressively are really starting to work. And we're beginning to see that turn in Europe.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. One last question if I could sneak it in about bigger picture with product innovation. And Jeff and Marc, you've both highlighted that the shift to the higher end products, I think pitting, is that something -- I assume that's something that obviously you're counting on into '13. Just trying to get a sense of, I guess particularly on the mix side, the mix benefit, has that something that's been kind of just emerging over the last couple of quarters and you'd expect that positive mix shift in North America to flow over into '13? And if there's anything additional in terms of perhaps a volume benefit relative to the market in general from product innovation. And I guess both of these comments, I'm really centering around North America here.","Jeff M. Fettig","Michael, this is Jeff. I would say this is a trend we've seen for the last several years really, with the exception of late 2008, early 2009. Consumers buy that. And given the average points last for 10-plus years, and that we are still clearly in a replacement market. When people go into stores and see our products, they see things very dramatically differently than they did 10 years earlier when they purchased whatever product we're replacing. And that value's relevant. Yes, there is a small portion of the market who can only buy the affordable -- from a price standpoint, opening price point product, but that's very low in our market compared, certainly, to other markets around the world. And what we've seen with again, only a small, less than a half a year interruption is that when you bring value to the marketplace in the form of new product innovation, given consumers' choice, they will mix themselves up because the value they're receiving is a great value. It's a value in terms of performance of the machine, the energy efficiency, the water efficiency, the design and on and on and on. So I don't see this as a 2012 trend. I see this as a structural trend. And our view is, is to increase our cadence in new product innovation, continue to offer great values in the marketplace, supported by consumer demand and strong brand preference brands and that -- and we have a portfolio that's made to mix up.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Larry, one quick question on pension. I noticed that the cash flow guidance has benefit contributions or pension contributions up to $200 million versus previously up to $250 million. Is that something that also kind of works through the income statement in that perhaps there was less \"pension expense,\" or if you could just kind of describe what's -- what you expect to work through the income statement this year versus perhaps previously? And where you think pension contribution could be in '13 even?","Marc R. Bitzer","Yes, a couple things, Michael. We did adjust the pension contributions from up to $250 million to $200 million. That's to do with the new legislation. It has no P&L impact whatsoever. The cash change that you saw, we did have the higher operating performance. You mentioned the lower pension cash, a little bit lower restructuring cash. But I also mentioned in my prepared remarks that we have lower BEFIEX credits. This has less cash. And we have these legal resolutions that also occurred in Q3. We'll have a little bit slightly higher working capital than we originally expected. We're taking out a lot of working capital to generate cash. So net-net, operationally the business is doing well from a cash perspective. From a pension expense perspective, again, both in the U.S. and foreign, we have about $50 million of pension expense. We'll provide you with additional guidance when we talk next time regarding expense. The new legislation will increase our pension expense by about $12 million next year, but I don't expect a significant increase above that.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Not even with the lower interest rates?","Marc R. Bitzer","Remember, our pension plans are frozen. So we don't, on the expense side, have a lot of impact from pension for the interest rates. From a contribution perspective, we would expect to be -- to pay less cash next year.","Jeff M. Fettig","Well listen, everyone, we're going to conclude the call here. Thank you again for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you early next year.","Operator","This concludes today's program. Have a great day. You may disconnect at this time."],"22925":["Whirlpool Corp. (NYSE:WHR) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 23, 2019  8:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Roxanne Warner - Senior Director, Investor Relations","Marc Bitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Jim Peters - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","David MacGregor - Longbow Research","Megan McGrath - Buckingham Research","Curtis Nagle - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Mike Rehaut - JPMorgan","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli Research","Mike Dahl - RBC Capital Markets","Ken Zener - KeyBanc","Operator","Good morning and welcome to Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Release Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Roxanne Warner.","Roxanne Warner","Thank you and welcome to our third quarter 2019 conference call. Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before we begin, I will remind you that as we conduct this call we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and other periodic reports. We want to remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions. With that, I will turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Bitzer","Well, thanks and good morning everyone. On Slide 3, we show our third quarter 2019 highlights. We delivered very solid global results with ongoing EBIT margin of 7.2%, a 100 basis point increase compared to the prior year. We were pleased with our first half performance and continue that positive momentum this quarter. These results represent our third consecutive quarter of global margin expansion as we progress towards our full year and long-term goals.","In North America, we delivered impressive margin expansion for strong price mix, execution and focused cost discipline. In Europe, we drove near breakeven ongoing EBIT results as momentum from our strategic actions to stabilize volumes and right-size our business drove strong year-over-year and sequential improvement. Given our strong year-to-date performance which we expect to continue, we are confident that we are trending towards the high-end of our full year ongoing earnings per share range of $14.75 to $15.50. Lastly, in August, we paid down our $1 billion term loan, which resulted in significant progress towards our long-term leverage target of approximately 2.0. In total, we are very pleased with our momentum year-to-date.","Turning to Slide 4, I will discuss our third-quarter results in more detail. We delivered organic net sales growth, which excludes the impact of Embraco and currency of approximately 2%. Ongoing EBIT margin was 7.2% for the quarter, a year-over-year increase of 100 basis points as positive price\/mix and focused cost discipline more than offset the impact of slightly lower unit volumes. Our 9-month free cash flow reflects normality seasonality of cash usage and was impacted by our planned settlement payment to the French Competition Authority and cash taxes paid from sale of Embraco.","Turning to Slide 5, we show the details of our third quarter margin performance. Three of our four regions delivered positive price\/mix resulting in margin expansion of approximately 150 basis points as we continued to realize the carryover benefit of previously announced pricing actions. We continue to expect margin benefit from price\/mix through year end however at a more moderated level as we compare against last year\u2019s fourth quarter cost-based pricing actions in the U.S. kitchen segment and Brazil. Additionally, we continue to see the benefit from our cost takeout initiatives deliver favorable impact across all regions, resulting in a margin expansion of 25 basis points.","Lastly, improving trends in raw materials outside of North America partially offset the continued tariff headwinds resulting in an unfavorable margin impact of 25 basis points. The net impact of currency and hedging was neutral for the quarter. These margin benefits were partially offset by continuation of increased marketing and technology investments. Overall, we are very pleased with our ability to leverage our global scale, drive product innovation, proactively manage costs and deliver strong global results despite ongoing macroeconomic volatility.","And now, I will turn it over to Jim to review our regional results.","Jim Peters","Thanks, Marc and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, I will review the third quarter results for our North America region. We delivered a very strong financial performance with revenue growth despite weak industry demand in Canada. Additionally, we delivered record EBIT as strong price\/mix execution and disciplined cost takeout offset lower unit volumes and continued freight inflation. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter of margin expansion in North America highlighting the fundamental strength of our business. Lastly, we are excited to announce that we were awarded a 5-year exclusive supplier relationship with DR Horton, the largest homebuilder in the United States. This relationship further reinforces the strength of our brands, product portfolio and logistics network as we bring winning products to more customers beginning January 2020.","Turning to Slide 8, we review the third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Unit volumes increased 5% across our core European business led by growth in Russia, UK, Italy and Poland among others. This growth was offset by improving although weak Middle East and Africa demand. Despite the continued weakness in the Middle East and Africa and the impact of previous business exits, net sales excluding the impact of currency were essentially flat for the quarter. We delivered significant year-over-year and sequential improvements with ongoing EBIT near breakeven as momentum from our strategic actions continues to drive results. At our 2019 Investor Day, we highlighted the following key actions to restore profitability to EMEA: exit of Turkey, Hotpoint SDA, South Africa, fixed cost reduction and regaining volumes. We are pleased to say that we are fully on track. We have fully exited our Turkish domestic sales operations as well as our Hotpoint branded small appliances business. We also completed the sale of our South Africa operations and are continuing to deliver structural operating improvements in the region.","Now we turn to Slide 9 to review the third quarter results for our Latin America region. Unit volumes were negatively impacted by temporary trade inventory adjustments at a key Brazilian retailer. We have already begun to see unit volumes return to normalized levels and expect to recover volume in the fourth quarter and in early next year. Organic net sales, which exclude the impact of Embraco and currency increased approximately 4%. EBIT margins contracted in the quarter as positive price\/mix and favorable raw material inflation was more than offset by lower unit volumes related to temporary trade customer inventory timing, currency devaluation in Argentina and weak Mexico demand.","Finally, as a reminder, we completed the sale of our Embraco business unit on July 1, meaning this is the first quarter without the Embraco compressor business consolidated in our regional results. 2018 and first half 2019 results will continue to include the impact of our Embraco compressor business. Reference our appendix for a schedule of Embraco\u2019s quarterly results.","We now turn to the third quarter results for our Asia region, which are shown on Slide 10. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales increased 7%. Strong momentum continued in our India business delivering double-digit revenue and EBIT growth alongside continued share gains. Although unit volumes increased in China, the cost of the brand transition initiative resulted in elevated margin pressure. That said our brand transition strategy in China is on track with the value share of Whirlpool brands exceeding Sanyo brand for the first time during the quarter.","Before we move on to our full year guidance, I want to make a few comments regarding our third quarter consolidated financial results compared to prior year. Our SG&A favorability of approximately $60 million, was primarily due to strategic actions in EMEA and currency favorability in Latin America. Favorability in interest and sundry income of approximately $50 million is primarily driven by currency-related hedging gains. The net earnings impact from currency and hedging throughout the income statement was immaterial in our results.","Now, I would like to turn it back over to Marc to review our guidance.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks, Jim. On Slide 12, we are reaffirming our ongoing guidance assumption for 2019. Revenue guidance remains unchanged at $20.6 billion as moderate improvement in U.S. is offset by continued softness in Canada, Mexico and the exit of some of our European businesses. Our EBIT margin guidance is now 6.8% or slightly above reflecting our solid year-to-date performance and confidence in our ability to deliver fourth quarter results in line with our full year commitments. Our free cash flow guidance of approximately $800 million, which includes Embraco sales proceeds and related term loan repayment, remains unchanged. In total, we are trending toward the high-end of our full year ongoing earnings per share range and have decreased our full-year GAAP guidance as additional product warranty and liability expenses was partially offset by adjustments to Embraco gain-on-sale calculation. With strong momentum through the third quarter, we are confident our strategy and actions will deliver continued progress toward our long-term goals.","Turning to Slide 13, we show the drivers of our ongoing EBIT margin guidance. We now expect 200 basis points of improvement related to price\/mix benefits in 2019. Net cost benefits have been slightly reduced by 25 basis points as ongoing cost productivity actions are offset by the impact of lower unit volumes. With these revisions, we continue to expect at least 50 basis points of margin improvement year over year.","Now, Jim will cover our regional guidance and cash priorities.","Jim Peters","Thanks, Marc. On Slide 14, we show our regional guidance for the year. In North America, we saw moderate improvement in the U.S. demand environment for the second consecutive quarter providing confidence in our guidance range for the full year. In Latin America, we revised our industry guidance expectations to 3% to 4% as Mexico demand weakness continues to weigh on the region. Industry expectations for EMEA and Asia remain unchanged. In total, we continue to forecast approximately flat global growth for 2019.","Regarding our EBIT guidance, North America was revised to 12%-plus, reflecting our continued confidence in the region\u2019s ability to drive meaningful margin expansion. In EMEA, we are confident that we are executing the right actions to restore profitability and continue to expect EBIT margin of approximately breakeven for the full year. In Latin America, we have adjusted our guidance to approximately 6%, taking into account the impact of temporary trade inventory moves and weaker-than-expected Mexico demand. Lastly, our margin guidance for Asia remains unchanged. In total, we expect margin improvement of at least 50 basis points as we continue to leverage our year-to-date momentum and drive strong global results.","Turning to Slide 15, I will discuss the drivers of our 2019 free cash flow. We reaffirm our expectations to deliver free cash flow of approximately $800 million, including the net proceeds and term loan repayment related to the sale of Embraco. With our year-to-date momentum and strong global results, we continue to expect strong cash earnings. We reaffirm our capital expenditures and restructuring assumptions, and we are focused on driving sustainably lower working capital. As previously mentioned, we made payments to the French Competition Authority in the first half, which netted to approximately $100 million. And our restructuring guidance reflects ongoing asset optimization in our European region, inclusive of restructuring of our Naples, Italy manufacturing plant.","Turning to Slide 16, we provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for the year. The sale of our Embraco business unit is now complete and the proceeds from the sale were used to pay off our $1 billion term loan in August as we previously communicated. This brings our gross debt-to-EBITDA to 2.5 which puts us well on track toward our long-term target of approximately 2.0. Additionally, we completed the sale of our South Africa operations, which is another step forward in our plan to restore the EMEA region to profitability. Lastly, we repurchased $50 million of shares and expect to continue repurchasing shares at moderate levels going forward.","Turning to Slide 17, I would like to highlight our initial planning assumptions for 2020. We are anticipating industry growth of approximately flat in North America and globally as modest growth in the U.S. and Brazil is offset by continued softness in Canada, Mexico and China. The unfavorable impact of previously announced tariffs is expected to be offset by easing material cost. We anticipate approximately flat depreciation and amortization expense for the full year. Lastly, we expect restructuring expense to be approximately $75 million to $100 million on a go-forward basis and an effective tax rate of 20% to 25%. Further detail on our 2020 guidance will be provided on our January earnings call.","Now, we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","David MacGregor","Good morning, everyone.","Marc Bitzer","Good morning, David.","David MacGregor","First question just on EMEA, can you just remind us on the EMEA profit benefit from exiting Turkey and the Hotpoint SDA and then South Africa?","Marc Bitzer","Yes, David, it\u2019s Marc. As you may recall, when we laid out these actions, well, pretty much a year ago, we said the combination of Hotpoint SDA, exiting Turkey, the fixed cost action and everything else is about a $50 million annualized run rate profit. So I would say in the quarter, we got pretty much of the net share thoughtfully in there. And on top of that, you have the additional benefit of now having solid growth in the core key markets, which kind of gave us back some volume leverage. So I would say pretty much half of improvement comes back from our strategic actions, the fundamental strategic actions. The other part came back from \u2013 we see some growth in our core markets, and that\u2019s healthy.","David MacGregor","And just on the North America volume declines are you able to bucket that out across kind of value mass and premium?","Marc Bitzer","Yes, David, it\u2019s Marc. First of all, frankly, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the North America volume decline, which is slightly \u2013 minus 6.9% or 7%. It\u2019s almost entirely coming from the Canadian market weakness, but we didn\u2019t lose share, it\u2019s just an overall industry weakness, and the SDA or KitchenAid SDA volume. As you know, the KitchenAid SDA is a heavily Q4-focused business with a promotion period. And whenever \u2013 when you have trade inventory moves kind of last week\u2019s, September 1 through October that can have an impact. At the end of the day, our North America revenue, were still up 0.5%. And the core majors business, we didn\u2019t have a very \u2013 I mean, based on volumes, are essentially flat to slightly down. So we didn\u2019t see that kind of impact.","David MacGregor","Great. Thanks, Marc.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Megan McGrath from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Megan McGrath","Good morning.","Jim Peters","Good morning.","Megan McGrath","I wanted to follow-up a little bit on your 2020 comments I know you don\u2019t want to give that much more color. But could you tell us \u2013 just give us a little color on your RMI assumptions for next year. Are you assuming commodity prices as of this week or are you taking into account \u2013 I assume you are sort of in negotiation process for contracts. How are you thinking about that heading into next year?","Jim Peters","Yes. Megan, this is Jim. And again, what we really start with is we look at where the prices are today going into the period where we begin to negotiate contracts and take that into consideration. Additionally, we look at the tariffs that have come into play this year, and that could still come into play, and estimate those out. So at this point in time, as we have said, we do expect unfavorable tariffs to be partially offset by favorable materials. But then once we get to the January earnings call, we\u2019ll really detail that more, and we\u2019ll have a much better feeling at that point on where we think material costs will be for the full year next year.","Marc Bitzer","Megan, it\u2019s Marc. Maybe just to echo what Jim was saying and give some additional color, first of all, what we lay out today, that\u2019s a point-in-time assumption. That could well change until end of January. But right now, we certainly do see \u2013 on the raw material side, we see a moderation of raw material levels, keeping in mind we still have a cumulative inflation of two years in \u2013 pretty much in our baseline, but we see moderation. And when \u2013 from that perspective, we have a \u2013 certainly a slightly positive outlook for RMI. On the other hand, to Jim\u2019s point, even we have tariffs. There is element of carryover because not all tariffs were in effect for full year. And right now, we have to take into account what has currently been announced but not yet implemented, which will be a further slightly headwind. So the two of them pretty much net themselves out, but I would expect between now and January there will be some moving parts here.","Megan McGrath","Thanks. That\u2019s really helpful. And I want to follow-up on the warranty costs in the quarter. That was sort of an unexpected expense there. So any more color you could give on the $100 million? And any anticipated cash impact from that?","Jim Peters","Yes, Megan and this is Jim. To begin with, this is something that we are in the middle of the process of and we have identified a component-related issue with a product we sell in EMEA. And right now, we have put our best estimate out there of what it will cost to rectify that. And again, it\u2019s \u2013 at this time, that\u2019s an estimate and there is a lot of work going on to identify what the final remedies will be. If we look at it from a cash flow perspective, we would expect that more to be an early next-year type of issue in terms of when we will see the impact as I said as these actions are kind of unfolding as we speak.","Megan McGrath","Thank you.","Jim Peters","Thanks, Megan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Curtis Nagle from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Curtis Nagle","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So just a quick one in terms of, I guess, confidence in EMEA turnaround, another negative margin, although, I guess, some progress made this quarter? Looking at what\u2019s implied for 4Q, I think it\u2019s something around a 3% margin, which is a pretty significant uplift from where you are now. So I guess just what gives you confidence in what you have in place like right now, you think, could help you achieve that?","Marc Bitzer","Yes. Curtis, it\u2019s Marc. First of all, I would see \u2013 the way I would look at this Q3, it\u2019s a very encouraging sign that our actions that we\u2019ve put in place are fully on track. And to have pretty much a $35 million year-over-year improvement is \u2013 no matter where you come from is a big move. But we are still losing money, but we are pretty close to breakeven. Having said that and that\u2019s \u2013 I would call that the normal seasonality on European business, which is a little bit more skewed toward Q4 in our regions, with a normal seasonality, we are \u2013 we will be above breakeven and positive in Q4. I am not quite sure I fully agree with the math of 3%, and we can follow up separately on this one, but it will be in the positive territory but probably not to the magnitude of 3%.","Curtis Nagle","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Mike Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Marc Bitzer","Good morning, Mike.","Jim Peters","Good morning.","Mike Rehaut","I wanted to focus for a minute on the North American margins in the third quarter, very strong results, a little bit more than we were looking for. And I was curious if you could kind of drill down a little bit in terms of the drivers of that improvement, if it was all effectively price\/mix or if there were some other drivers there? And particularly, as part of that answer, if you could also address any changes in the competitive backdrop as LG and Samsung have been ramping production this year at their own facilities?","Jim Peters","Yes. Michael, this is Jim. And let me kind of start off here, and then Marc will add some more commentary to this, too. But as we look at North America, again it was a very strong quarter. We are seeing continuing benefits of many of the price increases that we have taken, as well as mix coming from recent product launches and all that. So that\u2019s one of the bigger drivers that we see. Obviously, cost has been a headwind within North America, whether it was material costs that have started to moderate some, but tariffs continue to be a year-over-year cost increase, as well as we\u2019ve talked about freight costs. So we have been able to offset that, obviously, with the price increases we took. But also, as we said, the mix of our business is very healthy. In terms of the competitive environment, what I would say is through Labor Day, we did see some increased levels of competition, again not outside our level of normal and not outside of what we expected. As we look toward the Black Friday holiday period, that will obviously be an indicator of where things are and all that. But as we have said in the past, we do participate in promotions when we see that they create value. And right now, I think we have had a very good track record within the North America business of continuing to balance margins versus the promotional periods.","Marc Bitzer","Yes. Michael, it\u2019s Marc. Maybe a bit additional color I want to give on North America. At the end of the day, not just Q3 but the entire year, this is an environment where frankly we do not get a lot of help from the outside. I mean the industry demand has been pretty much moving sideways entire year. We have cost inflation and tariffs and logistic costs. To your point, the LG and Samsung, we are fully in production, and yet we delivered 12.8% EBIT margin, which basically tells me no matter how you look at the North America business, this business is in a really, really good shape and we have very strong momentum, and we have a lot of confidence for that business.","Mike Rehaut","That\u2019s great. I appreciate that. And I guess secondly, just to revisit an earlier question on EMEA and the profitability there. And obviously, you still expect a lot of big things out of that region or a lot of improvement over the next year or two. Right now, as you kind of look at the business plus or minus breakeven, I was hoping you \u2013 given you\u2019re another quarter or two into the turnaround and you laid out some of the plans at your analyst day, if you could kind of just remind us of how we should think about the next year or two in terms of the next two or three steps that are right in front of you in terms of driving improved profitability for the region. Is it all essentially \u2013 is it much more driven by recapturing some of the share gains, some of the new product introductions and retailing wins that you hope to achieve, maybe if you could give us an update on how those initiatives are progressing and how we should think about the next 12 to 18 months, particularly in a backdrop where Europe is still overall somewhat challenging.","Jim Peters","Yes. Michael, this is Jim. I\u2019ll start off with that. And I think the way you need to look at it is we talked about the actions earlier, and Marc talked about these and we talked about them on investor day. Remember, those were implemented this yes. So you have carryover going into next year of benefits of that, of us being out of Turkey, of us having disposed of the South Africa business and of the cost takeout. You\u2019ll see a continued level of cost takeout within the EMEA business. Again, just because we\u2019ve done a lot of the big actions, it doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have a lot of other things we\u2019re focusing on there to continue to adjust our costs. But also then, we talk about the 5% core growth within that business, and we do expect that to continue into next year as we gain back share in some of the countries where we lost it. So again, we \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a balance next year of cost takeout with an incremental volume coming in due to a stability of that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Sam Darkatsh","Good morning, Marc. Good morning, Jim. How are you?","Marc Bitzer","Good.","Jim Peters","Good morning.","Sam Darkatsh","A couple of questions. First, regarding North America specifically and in light of the volumes being down 7%, how are you feeling about inventories? Was your production in line with shipments this quarter? What are you expecting for production? And then also, looking into 2020, are you where you want to be from a production versus shipment standpoint? I\u2019ll start there.","Marc Bitzer","Sam, it\u2019s Marc. In short, we are where we want to be in that. Give you a little bit more color, our actual \u2013 our inventories are in pretty good shape. As you know, we spent a lot of time this year bringing down our inventories early in the year, and we\u2019re pretty much well on track, obviously, but hurt us a little bit on the production leverage, but we\u2019ve dealt with that. The more important part, and that\u2019s behind the units which I was referring to earlier, we feel pretty good about the trade inventories out there. In particular small domestic where you have a lot of volume in Q4, I would even describe trade inventories as right now being fairly low. Now the more important thing for us is what we see on the sell-through, i.e. the sellout in the stores on both majors and small domestic, we\u2019re in pretty good shape. And we feel very good, and that gives us a lot of confidence for Q4.","Sam Darkatsh","And then my follow-up question is actually a follow-up on a prior inquiry about RMI. You mentioned that you expect a moderate tailwind from raw materials next year, perhaps offset by the tariffs. There is a fair amount of confusion though as to why that tailwind is only moderate based on what we can see obviously with the steel markets and copper and aluminum and what have you. So I am wondering why it\u2019s only moderate. Were you letting more of your steel purchases float this year? Do you have longer dated hedges for some of your purchases of base metals and plastics and what have you, just trying to get a sense of why that might be based on what we can see externally?","Marc Bitzer","Sam, it\u2019s Marc. Let me maybe try to take this one. First of all, as a reminder, on both steel and in particular base metals, as you know, we try to either buy very long or hedge as much as we can within our policies and guidelines. So by definition, the flip side means we never buy at spots. The spot barely impacts us. And in particular, during times of elevated raw material prices, usually we have quite a bit of a discount in our books versus the spot rate. So as such, yes, what you\u2019re probably referring to are the spots are coming down, and we see that. But again, it\u2019s \u2013 we bought below the spot, and our full-year costs are below spot prices. Having said that, we are certainly encouraged by the trends \u2013 certainly encouraged by momentum in raw materials, you may also know that the big steel contracts, they should really get negotiated toward the end of the year, early next year. And I think the current momentum puts us in a good shape, a good position toward these contract negotiations. But we will not know until end of January. We have a big, and that typically moves a little bit faster, element in raw materials. It\u2019s plastics. With plastics, you can\u2019t go out long. We will typically buy quarterly or even shorter term because you simply cannot go long. So any volatility you may have on oil prices ultimately, in most cases, reflects back on volatility on the plastics. And that is still a little bit in uncertainty even though that was certainly good guide for us in 2019.","Sam Darkatsh","Thank you both.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alvaro Lacayo from Gabelli Research. Please go ahead.","Alvaro Lacayo","Good morning. I wanted to start with price\/mix in North America. It looks like sequentially, there was an acceleration, which I assume is driven by mix, if you could talk and try to parse out for maybe between price and mix? And then maybe give some high color on how you expect mix to evolve from here and maybe call out some of the things you are doing to drive that mix going forward?","Marc Bitzer","Alvaro, it\u2019s Marc. And let me maybe first take that. First of all, what most people should avoid is to \u2013 don\u2019t try to just take the unit decline and then take the revenue and assume that\u2019s price\/mix because it\u2019s not that high. On our major domestic appliance business again where we have basically flat to slightly down volume, we had a revenue growth, which is indicative of we had very favorable price\/mix in North America. We communicated that for the entire company, we had 1.5% price\/mix in Q3, and North America was above that. So North America led that, and that\u2019s a very good performance. In particular, if we take into account that we\u2019re kind of running against already last year\u2019s price increases to some extent, not all but to some extent, which basically tells you the price\/mix we should get in Q3 is a combination of both the announced price increase and how we execute it, but we also feel pretty good about the mix management, which came from new products and what we\u2019re rolling out with markets. So we feel pretty good about the mix.","Alvaro Lacayo","Okay. Now with regards to the DR Horton win, can you give us a little bit more color? One, do you currently already do business with DR Horton or would this all be 100% incremental? If you could you talk about \u2013 does this include all major appliances? And then what does that mean for your overall margin? Would this be accretive, similar or how would you categorize that going into 2020?","Jim Peters","Yes. Alvaro, this is Jim. And I will probably start with it and Marc can add some comments to it. This is a new customer for us. And again, it\u2019s a big win that we\u2019re very excited about. It will involve all of our major domestic appliances. And so again, as we look forward to this, it is a volume increase for us next year and an increase in terms of the margin of the business. It\u2019s not outside of the norms of the margin of our overall business. So again, we feel very good about it.","Marc Bitzer","Yes. Alvaro, it\u2019s Marc. And obviously, we won\u2019t get in the details about the volume and the margins, but it is 100% incremental. I think the more important thing is we for years have been talking about us. We want to focus more on the homebuilder and the housing market. It\u2019s a big part of it. DR Horton is the leader in North America, a highly respected company. And we are very proud to have won this \u2013 happy to have won with an exclusive contract. So it\u2019s a big deal for us.","Alvaro Lacayo","Okay, thank you.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mike Dahl","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Jim Peters","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Dahl","Marc, just back on the North American volume, I wanted to just better understand that a little more because you called out Canada as being a headwind. And that makes sense, but last we saw, Canada is only 8% of that business from a revenue standpoint. So I guess I\u2019m still struggling to understand how any decline could really explain the majority of the 7% overall decline. So maybe a little more color on that, and when you talk about the KitchenAid timing, what exactly that contributed?","Marc Bitzer","Yes, Mike, I mean I can only repeat what I said earlier. The volume decline is largely due to Canada and small domestic appliances. Canada market has been down and our small domestic appliance. Again, you have got to keep in mind that the vast majority of sellouts on small domestic appliance happens in Q4, so whereas every year there is a lot of inventory moves to be happening around September, October in that industry, we feel good about the sell-through. But right now, the trade inventories are right now fairly low. So I\u2019m not overly nervous about it. At the end of the day, despite all of this one we showed 0.5% revenue growth in North America with these kinds of margins. So I am not at all nervous about these volumes and in particular knowing that our major domestic appliances, we did not lose any share. So we feel very good about that.","Mike Dahl","Okay, got it. And then the second question is a follow-up on the tariffs. I think there has been a lot of commentary this year that you guys have been able to provide around monthly numbers of tariff impacts. And on the website, you have posted what List 4 and a step-up if it happens, in Lists 1, 2 and 3 could mean on a monthly basis, but given your earlier commentary around just the carryover effect into 2020, can you just quantify how much is truly incremental to 2020 if we consider all current implemented tariffs and then the proposed increases and\/or List 4? Just give us kind of the \u2013 what impacted \u201819 and what\u2019s incremental to \u201820?","Marc Bitzer","Yes. Mike, it\u2019s Marc. So again, to your point, there is the element of already implemented tariffs where we have a certain carryover. As you may recall, at the beginning of the year, we talked roughly about $10 million every month, and now we talk about in the range of $12 million to $14 million, also depending on how much volume we have and how much you import. So put a number behind the carryover, it\u2019s probably around $20 million, but we can provide more details. Maybe a little bit more. But then you have the additional element of tariffs announced but not implemented. And right now, as it is prudent, we have to take that into account, and that is an additional element of a small headwind. But we, of course, all recognize there is uncertainty around the actual implementation and of course, at the end of January, we will know more.","Mike Dahl","Okay, thank you.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Ken Zener","Good morning, gentlemen.","Marc Bitzer","Good morning, Ken.","Jim Peters","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zener","So a lot of questions asked. So if we could just take a step back. I was looking at your 3Q presentation last year where you gave guidance for this year and you guys did pretty well obviously. If you look at 1Q, we can start seeing where the parts switched around. For example, we had lower volume, which hurt your net costs. You got better price\/mix by a little bit and the RMI tariff. That moved in your favor. So clearly, that was a variety of things moving. How does that kind of play out? I mean was that a one-off situation because RMI went down so much? I mean you\u2019re talking about modest tailwind for RMI next year. But how often does that occur given what you guys kind of experienced? We have volume come down, which hurt your net cost out capabilities, basically offset by RMI. That\u2019s kind of my first question. But is that something that is normal or does that tend just to happen once when inflation drops dramatically the first year?","Jim Peters","Yes. I would say, Ken, it\u2019s \u2013 to say that it\u2019s the norm would \u2013 and that would not \u2013 I would not say it\u2019s the norm. When you look at it, obviously when volumes come down, you do expect the pressure on demand to come down also and in terms of commodity costs and all that. So as we look forward to next year, again as Marc talked about earlier, that\u2019s really why at this point in time we\u2019re giving guidance on what we \u2013 or indications on what we see on materials but not necessarily giving the guidance yet because there are a lot of moving parts still. And once we get to January, we have a much better understanding just like we would have in the third quarter last year versus when we got to January this year.","Marc Bitzer","Yes, Ken, it\u2019s Marc. Maybe also some additional color, obviously, this year, our entire company business was riding heavily on the price increases, previously announced price actions. And we had to deal with cost inflation. The cost good news is as we come to the end of this year, we still have a benefit of pricing and we are really now starting to turn the corner on the cost side. So that\u2019s good news. So in a year from now, no, I don\u2019t think we will be reliant on one of these two drivers. I think you should expect more cost takeout from us in particular as you get a little bit more tailwind from RMI. And of course by definition, when you run into the anniversary of price increase, you will have less pricing. Having said that, keep also in mind we have in a lot of our business a lot of product innovation coming into play into Q4, Q1 and Q2 next year, which always gives us a significant mix opportunity. So in short, I don\u2019t think we will be entirely reliant on pricing. You should expect more from costs. But we will give more details in January.","Ken Zener","Understood. Now related to \u2013 I am assuming a lot of it is product innovation, Marc with the U.S. volume where it was for the year is yet the price\/mix \u2013 and I think you are obviously implying there was some good mix in North America given that you don\u2019t lose share. Does that seem strange to you all that you\u2019re seeing flat volume, but the consumer is mixing up as opposed to your initial expectations of volume growth? What does that \u2013 I mean, how does that sink in your mind that people are trading up, but the volume is flat?","Marc Bitzer","Ken, I am not quite sure I would \u2013 and I don\u2019t think we said that the industry or the total consumers is mixing up. Our business has been mixing up with good products in our business.","Ken Zener","Right.","Marc Bitzer","So I would...","Ken Zener","Yes, yes, yes, exactly, your business, yes.","Marc Bitzer","Yes. Our business is really \u2013 we have a good mix of opportunity. As you know, we introduced an entire Whirlpool kitchen range. We will have, next year, brand new dishwasher platform which will be really superior in the marketplace. We are introducing a new vertical top loader, which is a significant part of our business, which comes out in Q1. So the product innovation gives us the power to mix up in the marketplace and then consumer pay for it. I am not quite sure that is reflective of the entire market. The entire market, I would say is pretty much flat.","Ken Zener","Okay, if I could, one last question, comment on India. Thank you very much.","Jim Peters","India, India continues to be a very strong business for us. Again, we are seeing significant growth within the India market, very strong margins there. And so from that standpoint, it continues to be one of the bright spots that we have within the different countries that we do business in, but nothing significantly different. Again, we are performing very well there maintaining and gaining share and continue to see good results.","Marc Bitzer","Ken, it\u2019s Marc. But I certainly do appreciate that you let us end on a positive note on India because it\u2019s a really good business, something we\u2019re very proud of. So now, well, we\u2019ve come to the end of our Q&A. So let me just maybe summarize some of our key messages on Slide 19. As you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019re certainly very pleased with momentum in our global business and the level of margin expansion we delivered year to date. And having Q3 at 7.2% EBIT margin ongoing is a very strong performance. In North America, again, no matter how you look at it, our strong fundamentals have allowed us to be agile in a volatile macro-environment. And despite change in economic trade and competitive landscape, our North American business has delivered margin expansion now for eight consecutive quarters. And in Europe, we\u2019re pleased to see the continued moment from our strategic initiatives. And we delivered near break-even results on an ongoing basis. And it\u2019s now been pretty much a year since we laid out our strategic initiatives for returning the region to profitability. And since that time, we\u2019ve sold and exited unprofitable businesses we have regained volume in key countries across Europe and have successfully executed our various cost takeout initiatives. So overall, I think we laid out the plans, we\u2019re executing according to the plans and now we start seeing results. And additionally, we completed the sale of our Embraco business unit and used the proceeds to pay down our outstanding term loan and making significant progress toward our gross debt-to-EBITDA goal of 2.0. I would also like to mention a few key highlights that reflect our commitment to environment, society and governance issues. We are named in the 2019 Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America, and we were named a leading company on the 2019 Diversity Best Practices Inclusion Index. So I\u2019m very pleased with our performance year to date. I\u2019m confident we\u2019re executing on the right operational priorities across the globe. And I just want to thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter earnings call in late January.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Chris Conley. Please go ahead.","Chris Conley","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation second quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Marc Bitzer; our President and Chief Operating Officer and Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our Web site at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports, as well as on Slide 1 of the presentation.","Turning to Slide 2, we want to remind you, that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations, as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations.","Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on our Investor Relations website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analysts' questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants not ask more than two questions in the first round and we will address any follow up questions after everyone has had a turn.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Fettig","Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record operating results for the second quarter driven by strong ex currency revenue growth and substantial margin expansion of 1.6 points. Our integration activities in Europe and Asia continue to progress well and we remain on track to deliver significant soft cost synergies for the balance of the year.","Our strong operational execution more than offset currency and demand challenges around the world. And as a result, we delivered another record quarter of performance. Following a strong first half performance we're increasing our full year guidance for ongoing earnings per share to $14.25 to $14.75.","Before we move to the details of the quarter results, I'd like to highlight an important ruling by the Commerce Department on our washer trade fair-trade case. We are very pleased that this ruling confirmed that LG and Samsung continue to dump washing machines in the U.S. market. Both companies are now required to pay substantial deposits for these products which they import from China.","As we previously discussed, this unlawful behavior clearly had a negative impact on our washing machine market share and earning in 2015 and in the first half of 2016. But despite this we are pleased that we\u2019re still able to deliver record results through the strength of the rest of our portfolio of products and brands.","I\u2019ll now turn the Slide 5, where I\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll take a look at the financial results for the second quarter. Our revenues overall grew 3% versus last year ex-currency. Our ongoing earnings per share grew by 30% to a record $3.50 per share. And this came through strong execution of acquisition synergies, volume growth and ongoing cost productivity program and free cash flow improved versus last year.","Turning to Slide 6, you\u2019ll see that we are raising, our 2016 guidance volume due to strong first half of performance. Again, we now expect ongoing earnings per share to be $14.25 to $14.75 per share. We are reaffirming our expected free cash flow generation of $700 million to $800 million, which represents a significant improvement over the prior year. We are confident that our continued focus on execution and strong second half actions will enable us to deliver another year of record results.","On Slide 7, you\u2019ll see that our 2016 priorities remain unchanged. We do remain confident in our ability to manage economic volatility and have deploy strong operational plans, which we believe, will enable us to grow revenues and continue to expand our operating margins.","On Slide 8, our capital allocation strategy remains also unchanged. We continue to prioritize funding the business along with delivery\u2019s strong return to shareholders and we continue to evaluate opportunistic value creating M&A opportunities.","During the second quarter, we did purchase $100 million in shares during the quarter. We intend to continue repurchasing stock through the year and we currently have $900 million of remaining share repurchase authorization. So overall, we do remain confident in our ability to deliver long-term value creation through strong cash generation and the execution of our balance capital allocation process.","Before I move on to our regional businesses, I wanted to comment on the leadership announcements which we made in late June. As you probably know our Chief Financial Officer, Larry Venturelli has announced his planned retirement. We also have announced the Jim Peters currently our Vice President, Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer will succeed Larry as Chief Financial Officer.","First of all, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank Larry for his over 15 years of service to our company in a number of leadership roles including the last five years as Chief Financial Officer. Larry has played an integral part of our executive management team and in helping us in our global expansion, including most recently the successful acquisitions in Indesit Europe and Hefei Sanyo in China.","At Whirlpool, Larry will be greatly miss, but we all wish [indiscernible] and his family the very best in this upcoming retirement. At this time, I\u2019m also pleased welcome Jim Peters into his new role Chief Financial Officer. Jim does have a very broad background in our global finance leadership in a number of roles and in our business operations and I\u2019m very confident that under his leadership we will continue execute our global value creation plans.","So with that, I\u2019ll stop here and turn over to Marc Bitzer to review our global operations.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 10, we will review North America\u2019s performance in the second quarter. We delivered record operating profit by growing ex-currency revenues 4% and expanding operating margin of 12.3%. We improved key fixed market share versus prior year and saw strong consumer demand for our products.","Our record second quarter operating margins were driven by our ongoing cost productivity programs and operating leverage from revenue growth which more than offset $20 million in unfavorable currency impact in Canada and Mexico.","Turning to Slide 11, we outline our 2016 operational priorities for the North American region. We continue to expect the industry to grow 5% to 6% for the full year. As we\u2019ve done consistently, we will make targeted investment to grow profitably at or above the industry rates. We continue to leverage our strong cost productivity programs to drive marked improvement and we remain focused on growing our adjacent businesses. We are confident that these actions will allow us to deliver the higher end of our margin targets of 12% to 12.5%.","Turning to Slide 12, we highlight our exciting new French-Door Bottom Mount Refrigerator platform. The jumbo capacity products feature the most shelf-space among leading brands in the industry. It offers a first to market flexible pantry-inspired shelving system delivering both the capacity and flexibility our customer desire. ","Beginning on Slide 13, I will review second quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Sales were $1.3 billion, down slightly from prior year, excluding the impact of currencies sales were flat. Ongoing operating margin was 4.6%, a 40 basis point increase compared to prior year. This margin expansion included a 200 basis point unfavorable currency impact primarily from a British pound and a Russian ruble. We have deployed previously announced cost based price increases to offset this currency impact.","Turning to Slide 14, we want to put our European business in context by providing additional detail of our first half performance and the plan for the second half. We made significant progress on the integration of the Indesit, demonstrated by the substantial first half restructuring and synergy benefit that Larry will discuss in more detail. We are confident in our ability to deliver planned 2016 synergies evenly in the third and fourth quarters.","We experienced a negative first half currency impact primarily in UK and Russia and have deployed previously announced cost based price increases to improve our operating margins as we progress throughout the second half of the year. We are in the process of integrating product platform across Europe and expect to make strong progress by year-end. We expect to grow second half revenues with fully deployed marketing and sales activities.","We do believe we have the right actions to address the operating environment and as a result we expect operating margins to improve throughout the second half. We expect our exit rate on operating margins in the full quarter to be more to be more consistent with our long range expectations of 7% to 8%.","On Slide 15, in addition to the second half actions we discussed, our 2016 priorities remain largely unchanged, with a continued focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivities and growth from adjacent businesses. We also continue to expect the industry to be flat to up 2% for the full year while clearly there is some uncertainty in the European region. Through the strength of our operating plans and continued acquisition benefits we remain confident in our long-term guidance of 7% to 8% operating margins by 2018.","On Slide 16, we\u2019re proud to feature award winning build-in oven of our new build-in kitchen suite. This product incorporates advanced cooking technology and on demand recipes with elegant, contemporary aesthetics for sophisticated customers.","Turning to Slide 17, I will discuss our Latin America results. Sales for the quarter were $826 million, excluding the impact of currency sales increased 4%. The industry in Brazil continues to be challenging, however our topline performance in Brazil was strong, as we continue to leverage our leading portfolio of brands to drive growth and outperform the industry. We were able to gain several point of market during the second quarter while substantially improving our operating margins. Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $50 million, a 190 basis points increase compared to prior year.","The actions we have taken over past year's improved margins and challenging environment and grow market share have been successful and we now expect to deliver the higher end of the range of our margin targets of 7% to 7.5%.","On Slide 18 we summarized our priorities in Latin America which have not changed. As we've done consistently, we will manage economic volatility through strong cost productivity programs and by leveraging our right sized fixed cost structure. We will continue to invest in new product and remain well positioned to capitalize on growth in Brazil when consumer demand does return.","On Slide 19, we're highlighting our reward winning Brastemp brand. This year Brastemp was recognized in a nationwide study as Brazil\u2019s most engaging consumer clients brand building on six decades of inspirational performance and through pure design.","Now we turn to our second quarter results in the Asia region which are shown on Slide 20. Net sales were $363 million in comparison to $381 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales were flat. Our ongoing operating profit was $29 million compared to $31 million the prior year period. Ongoing operating margins were 8.1% flat to prior year as continued record performance in India and ongoing cost productivity offset weak demand in China.","Turning to Slide 21, you will see that our 2016 priorities for Asia have not changed. We remain focused on growth through distribution expansion and ongoing cost productivity program. We also continue to focus on the longer term opportunity in China as we navigate through demand uncertainties.","On Slide 22, we showcase our new front load washing machine for China. We leverage the integration between Hefei, Indesit, and Co. and Whirlpool using the best of the best to provide consumers with world class laundry performance.","Finally, on Slide 23, we summarize our regional margin guidance for the full year. Given continued global volatility in some regions and strong first half performance in others, we've adjusted our margin expectations as follows. North America increased to 12% to 12.5%, Latin America increased from 7% to 7.5%, Europe decreased to 5.5% to 6% due to negative currency impacts and the expected timing of our offsetting actions.","Asia remains unchanged at 7% to 8%. It is important to note that we are on track for strong margin expansion in all regions and have not changed our overall operating margin guidance. We remain confident in our ability to manage for global volatility and to deliver our strong second half plans.","Now, I'd like to turn it over one last time to Larry.","Larry Venturelli","Thanks Mark and good morning, everyone. Let me start with our second quarter results on Slide 25. As Jeff mentioned, we had strong performance in the second quarter despite a challenging external environment. Net sales were $5.2 billion excluding the impact of currency revenues were up 3%. We achieved record ongoing earnings of $3.50 per share which was up 30% primarily driven by acquisition synergies, yield volume growth and ongoing cost productivity.","In the second quarter, currency impacted our revenues by approximately $150 million, EBIT margin by about a point and net earnings by $0.50 per share. Our ongoing EBIT margin improved by more than one point and we're fully on track for our full year guidance of 8% to 8.5%.","On a GAAP basis, our second quarter tax rate was driven by the timing of tax settlements and planning activities and does not impact our previous guidance of 22% from full year. Our ongoing tax rate for the quarter was 22% consistent with our previous guidance. Overall, we are very pleased with the results for the quarter and\/or at the appropriate run rates to deliver a very strong second half.","Turning to Slide 26, let me take a moment to discuss the expected impact of currency on our results for this year. You may recall in our original guidance for 2016, we assumed a negative impact of $2.50 per share. During our first quarter call, as currencies began to improve, we indicated that if April fell, we would expect $0.50 per share lower currency headwinds for the year. Well, there was significant volatility in the key currencies in the second quarter, the net results for the basket of currencies were expose to have not change substantially since our last call.","We expect the impact of currency to be approximately $2 per share for the full year. We will continue to execute previously announced cost based price increases and deliver cost reductions to offset negative currency impact and our ongoing hedging programs continue to be an effective tool for us to reduce short-term volatility.","On Slide 27, you\u2019ll see an update on the progress of restructuring and acquisition integration activities. Through the first half, we incurred restructuring expense of $87 million and delivered $120 million in benefits. We now expect $200 million in expense for the year and are increasing benefits to $200 million. Overall, we are on track to deliver or previously announced synergy goals through 2017.","Turning to Slide 28, I will discuss our expectations for full year EBIT margin expansion. As previously communicated, we expect to expand our margin by over 1 point, primarily driven by ongoing cost productivity and cost in capacity reductions. Our first half year-over-year EBIT margin improvement continues to support our full year expectation. We expect to continue funding our global brand and product innovation and to absorb approximately 1 point of margin impact from currency.","On Slide 29, we highlight the cadence of second half earnings drivers. Consistent with historical trends, we expect a meaningful step-up in the seasonality of our volumes between Q3 and Q4. We expect negative currency impact to continue in Q3, but will lessen in Q4. As a result of these trends, we expect our second half earnings to approximate 45% in the third quarter and 55% in the fourth quarter, which is very consistent with what you saw last year.","On Slide 30, we share some details on our first half free cash flow results and capital allocation actions. Our free cash flow improved versus prior year primarily due to the improved earnings. Consistent with our strategy, we executed a balanced approach to capital allocation by funding the capital needs of our business and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and previously announced share repurchase program. We plan to buyback additional shares throughout the year.","Turning to Slide 31, we\u2019re adjusting our full year guidance in response to our strong first half results. As Marc discuss in the regional reviews, we have confident in our operational plans and as a result expect to deliver 15% plus growth in ongoing earnings per share in 2016 approximately 700 million to 800 million in free cash flow.","Finally, on a personal note, regarding my retirement. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with many of you in the financial community over the past several years, it\u2019s been an honor and privilege representing Whirlpool and I wish you all continued success in the future.","Now I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff Fettig","Thanks Larry. I\u2019ll summarize on Slide 33, which shows again our 2016 priorities, which haven\u2019t changed and our plan is to drive revenue growth, margin expansion and to generate strong free cash flow for the year. Overall, I think our ongoing efforts to deprive margins especially in the areas of volatility run roll have demonstrated our ability to manage the needed actions within our control in response to this global volatility and I think the first half of the year is a really good example of that because we had many changes that we\u2019re able to adapt to.","We do believe we are well positioned in the second half and we have deployed strong operational plans across the world to ensure we deliver our goals. So, overall we do expect to deliver record results and while at the same time executing the balance of capital allocation approach.","Finally, on Slide 34 and we do continue to execute our long-term value creation strategy overall we remain confident in our goals, we do expect to be able to continue to leverage our industry leading brands, keep bringing in a strong portfolio of innovation in the marketplace and our best cost position to ensure that we\u2019re delivering strong returns to our shareholders. ","So with that I\u2019d like to end our formal remarks and open this up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our first question from Denise Chai from Bank of America.","Denise Chai ","Okay, thank you so much and congratulations on a great quarter. I wanted to start with the anti-dumping rulings that came out, what\u2019s different this time compared to 2 years ago and could you just walk us through the mechanics of how duties apply and what it theoretically means for market pricing.","So for example is Samsung & LG moved production back to Korea and Mexico would the old duty still apply and really what are the next steps, so any color around that would be very helpful.","Jeff Fettig","Yeah, Denise this is Jeff. Yeah, the current fair trade action is for washing machines in the U.S. market. In one, since this is a continuation of the 2013 situation, but at the time dumping is -- the law is appeased to countries, not companies and the countries involved then were South Korea and Mexico and we won very decisively in that case. But the companies which are LG and Samsung basically moved their production to China immediately to work around this and continue dumping and so our new case is for dumping against manufacturers in China, but it specifically effects LG and Samsung.","So that required a new action, we\u2019re going through the process, we believe the evidence is compelling as evidenced by commerce department preliminary judgment with the duties they levy, they are now having to pay cash deposits on all imports and in fact one of them is actually retroactive through the last 3 months because of all the products they buy in the marketplace, there is a very clear commerce department process that is followed, they will make the final determination and duties in December, then it goes to the international trade commissions to evaluate injury and we expect that judgment to be mid-January. ","Marc Bitzer","Denise this is Mark, so maybe just one additional comment specific to questions of the 2013 order is still active and in place. So to your question, if they were moving back to Korea or Mexico, it doesn\u2019t help them because the old order is still active and in place. ","Denise Chai ","Okay, so what flexibility I guess do they have in terms of market pricing? I\u2019m just wondering with these rulings --.","Jeff Fettig","I can\u2019t speak to competitors market pricing, I\u2019m just saying based on the evaluation by the commerce department, they have -- their primary conclusion is they are dumping again from China, they\u2019ve already proven they\u2019re dumping from South Korea and Mexico and based on that they\u2019re going to charge substantial tariffs and I guess the company can either adjust their pricing or continue to pay these substantial tariffs, but that's really their decision.","Denise Chai","Okay. And sorry just last one, so to illustrate is a washing machine -- the Samsung or LG washing machine is retailing for say a $1,000 what are the tariff, of 110% and 50%?","Jeff Fettig","Well, if you just take only on the value forget retail price, you take the value it's somewhere in the neighborhood of -- in the case of the lower level probably $175 to $180 to the higher level of over $300. So, it's substantial.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Samuel Eisner with Goldman Sachs.","Samuel Eisner","Yeah. Good morning, everyone. So, going back to the EMEA commentary here I wanted to get a better understanding on FX. Obviously the detrimental, I think what you call that is about a 200 basis point, two point headwind to the quarter, but looks like detrimental for the total company were around 35% and we were close to the 25%. So just curious if you can talk a little bit about the transactional exposure within the EMEA business and how we should think about that going forward?","Marc Bitzer","Sam it's Marc Bitzer, so let me may be just provide some clarity on it and yes you're correct the currency predominantly impacts the margin and to put that in context, there is obviously a number of currency moves and currency baskets in the what flows via European regions. The most impactful one just given the size and movement have been the British pound and the Russian ruble. There are upper ones as well, but these are the most impactful one.","And what it means operationally in the UK, like us most competitor don't produce in UK, almost nobody produce in UK. So basically any currency weakness of a British pound turns into kind of lower margin for us that's the present immediate impact. It's somewhat similar in Russia may be to a lesser extent because we produce more in the Russia. The combination of these two ones just to put it in absolute terms was basically $30 million just in the quarter, just these two big markets. So we're talking about massive and substantial, so you calculate it back on a European level that' s more than 200 basis, so that's where the number comes from.","Now and just for clarity I am referring to year-over-year impact of a currency. As you also know the Russian ruble even though on a weak level has stabilize. So I think sequentially we don't see big surprise, but still a year-over-year impact. And as you also know the British pound for the quarter average has deteriorated, but obviously particularly post Brexit, the decline has been significant and it has a significant effect on our margins.","Jeff Fettig","And we're adjusting our actions accordingly.","Marc Bitzer","So to that point, obviously what you -- what we're doing as a company in this kind of environments we basically have cost based price increases which we have communicated and largely implemented in some of these markets, obviously the UK one is fairly recent, but we expect in the second half to fully compensate the currency losses through these cost based price increases.","Samuel Eisner","That's very helpful Marc thanks. And then when I think about the North American business, if I see back into the pricing, pricing looks to be down about 1% and the second quarter is slightly down than the first quarter. So it seems as though you could argue that you are using price as a tool to accelerate volumes. If we look out to 2017 where may be raw materials are not as [technical difficulty] how do you think about that dynamic going forward and your ability to continue to gain share when raw materials are maybe not as much of a toll for you guys anymore?","Marc Bitzer","Sam it's Marc again. So let me first talk about the Q2 pricing that you observed in North America and there is actually a very straight forward and easy explanation for this one, Phase 2 components. One is Mexico, the impact of Mexico, keep in mind in the North America we have three countries along through overall North America revenues.","You have Mexico\u2019s significant currency decline year-over-year. And also still in Canada, even though now to a less extent. So roughly, we had an $8 decline in the quarter of the AC more than half of that is just coming from currency. Also combined with a little bit of mixed impact with growth we have pretty strong volume go from Mexico, profitable volume growth in Mexico, but it had the mix impact on the ASV.","The other part and go straight back to Jeff\u2019s earlier comments. Yes, we are exposed to continued and sustained dumping practices in the washer business and that has an impact on our ASV. I\u2019m pleased that despite all that we delivered very strong operating margin, which just shows you how strong the underlying business is. But these two factors explain the ASV in Q2.","Jeff Fettig","Adding in just on the washer side, as we\u2019ve said it had a significant negative impact on our market share, which is volume, but also on our earnings. So that\u2019s embedded in there based on the kind of type of promotion we saw in the second quarter.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take the next question from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning and best of luck for you Larry, great working with you.","Larry Venturelli","Thanks Mike.","Michael Rehaut","Question on just kind of going back to North America with the sales growth and clearly this has been an area of focus for Whirlpool and reaccelerating that. With roughly a 4% revenue growth rate ex-currency in 2Q, as you look forward -- I mean, this is obviously also a big focus over the next couple of years to get to the 2018 goal. I mean is this sort of a number that you are expecting to be sustainable or perhaps even accelerate excluding currency as you continue to get some momentum on the new product front and perhaps a little more stability with the anti-dumping?","Marc Bitzer","Michael, its Marc. Let me maybe just comment on this. So yes, in Q2 we had a 4% excluding FX revenue growth and a very, I would say solid volume growth of 5% and you also know the ins and out of market [indiscernible], it was our unit, so we\u2019re very pleased with the market share progress and revenue growth. I would also -- and that probably gives us confident or full year points out to be what you\u2019re seeing is our sale in unit growth from selling market share our sell out trend are very strong, and probably out pacing even the selling in pace.","So obviously a very positive development which we are seeing and as I also said in my remarks earlier, our commitment is to grow at or above market for 2016 and we\u2019ll reaffirm on that commitment. It\u2019s obviously way too early to talk about \u201917 and \u201918 target, but I would expect tender guidance from our sale, that we grow at or above market.","Michael Rehaut","That\u2019s very helpful Marc. I appreciate that. And then just on the restructuring benefits increased by 25 million for \u201916. How should we think about the total amount of benefit over the entire period? If you could just remind us of that number and does that number change at all as well?","Larry Venturelli","Mike, this is Larry. We did increase the restructuring benefits from $175 million to $200 million for 2016. As you know what we committed to is $350 million by 2017 and we\u2019re fully on that path. ","Operator","Thank you, we\u2019ll go next to Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Please go ahead. ","Sam Darkatsh","Good morning Jeff, Mark and Larry and Larry I\u2019ll also say it\u2019s been a real pleasure dealing with you over the number of years now, congratulations and kudos to you. ","Larry Venturelli ","Thank you.","Sam Darkatsh","Couple of questions if I could, first the washing machine profitability or at least the ability to expand margins if you were able to normalize washing machine profitability. I think you mentioned in the petition that you\u2019re not -- that you\u2019re losing money currently in washers. If you were able to return the washer part of the segment in North America to appropriate margins, what might be your margin upside for overall North America margins?","Marc Bitzer","Sam its Marc. First of all and I hope that was clear in our earlier comments, washers as defined in the anti-dumping case don\u2019t equate to what we call laundry, okay. Laundry is broader has other driers, has other capacities and there is a very specific definition of the washer case. So don\u2019t equate this two ones. Having said that, if you look at the pure washers, their profitability is clearly, clearly below where we would expect at any normal time and we\u2019re losing money on top of the volume impact.","So your question unfortunately for short-term probably is a more theoretical question. The reason I am saying this one as evidenced by the ruling, there has been a significant amount of stockpiling by LG, Samsung at the end of the Q2 and the inventory loading and unfortunately we see that still entering the market in Q3. So there is still an impact and that\u2019s just a reality, I would also not be surprised even go to some extent that speculation that both players continue to circumvent. So I would see some relief on our margins, on washers but it needs to be seen to what extent LG and Samsung actually follow the order and that\u2019s not our decision. ","Jeff Fettig","Yeah, it\u2019s safe to be clear. Short-term we have to get through the year and get this completed successfully, gauge the reactions on but to your point, the theoretical question it\u2019s worth a loss on North America business, at least a couple of points.","Sam Darkatsh","And then my second question, if I could re-ask what one of my peers asked, in terms of 2017 the ability or willingness of either of the consumer or the retailer channel partner to accept pricing increases. What do you think the willingness might be and the elasticity would be over the industry if you do have to raise prices or the industry participants have to raise price next year.","Jeff Fettig","Yeah, Sam we\u2019ve had this discussion in the past and the reality is there are -- the price points won\u2019t change, model feature per content change, okay. So it\u2019s not affordability and therefore not an elasticity question at all. Whatever number, 5% increase on it, 500 ASP is $25, there will still be a 499 and so on.","So first we have made no decisions nor are we talking about any future price increases. We\u2019re going to see how the environment evolves and we\u2019ll make the decisions as well. We have great levers to improve margin through mix and many other tools, But the one I guess directly to your question I'll point out is, I don't see any price elasticity at the kind of levels that we've historically looked at.","Marc Bitzer","Sam its Marc. Also may be in addition to this one, I guess you wouldn't have asked the question if you developed a context of concerns about material price trends. So let me proactively also address this one because we're seeing some of the earlier comment about material price. Of course we do observe material trends and of course there are certain elements in the global material markets like the steel prices which are somewhat of a concern.","I want to just comment two things on this one. A, we have long term contracts particularly in steel. We have on several commodities very strong and now favorable head positions, so we're I'd say for 16 certainly very well positioned on the material side. And I'd saw right now it's way too early to speculate about the \u201917 material trends. We of course see certain spot prices, but I'd also argue of a demand on certain materials is just not strong enough to see that going into fully into 2017.","Jeff Fettig","And the only other thing Sam would be if you go back at history you follow this for a long time. When we've had material inflationary environments before, we've been able to overcome that through a lot of different tools and continue to improve our earnings and our margin also. But it's too early to call on pricing.","Operator","And we'll go to next to Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead.","Ken Zener","Just for one and I'm going to go back in the queue. So, I'm not going to ask too many all at once. Europe, you guys talked about 30 million EBIT hit in 2Q the margin guidance revision to 5.5% to 6% implies more than 30 million. Could you please tell us what that dollar value is and how that would fall kind of sequentially 3Q and 4Q within that guidance?","Marc Bitzer","Ken, its Marc. And there is obviously a number of timing and moving parts. So the 30 million refers to the exact what we lost in Q2 predominantly due to British pound and ruble. Obviously that is an average currency rate of a quarter and you need to be aware that the exit run rate of a British pound was way below the average. So version the impact of a British pound if we wouldn't do anything going well in Q3 and Q4. The offsetting element of, I have previously announced [indiscernible] already implemented or ones which we have not just fully implemented, but announced might take to certain ramp up here.","So, the negative part of a currency which right now we just have to assume it\u2019s going to be with us for rest of the year. We're starting to offset that every month more through previously cost price increases.","Jeff Fettig","That we will fully answer that in the third quarter.","Marc Bitzer","Just the time doesn't work because in most markets and every market is different you have certain pre lead time between many communicator trade [ph] when you can actually implement there are certain contracts in place. So you have a ramp up time of these price increases. The important thing is however, by particularly as we go in Q4 and the exit run rate we expect to be this fully offset by cost based price increases.","Ken Zener","So the 30 million would be obviously higher given the run rate spot versus the average is my assumption. Do you have a dollar value that you're kind of are assuming in that margin degradation then just so we can be clear in [Multiple Speakers].","Jeff Fettig","Ken if you look, someday the original [ph] is at, midpoint 7.5 we\u2019re seeing 5.5 to 6, so you're talking about 1.7 points time our revenues in Europe is about $85 million, we took 30 million hit at the very end of Q2. Again as Marc said we put it into actions in placing it through so it would be -- if everything stays the same actually the biggest impact will be in Q3.","Ken Zener","Right. Okay, that\u2019s I\u2019m going. Marc\u2019s comment about the run rate, if it\u2019s December versus the average of obviously it makes a difference, but it seems like at current volume currency et cetera, you are actually going to be a lot closer in 4Q margins then to what you are actually targeting.","Jeff Fettig","Right. Right.","Ken Zener","Now how much of that is volume base. I know in Brazil you guys were very exclusive and we had that 250 earnings hit in terms of the inventory being higher than price. And I guess that\u2019s Marc, what you\u2019re referring to about, it takes a little while to recover that. It\u2019s not so much -- can you address, I guess a lot of investors I speak with the other cases, who knows what Europe\u2019s going to do, I think reply is that\u2019s a lot of industry restructuring. Could you kind of give us a sense about how the volume assumptions and what gives you comfort right now around that piece? And then I\u2019ll get back in the queue? Thank you.","Marc Bitzer","Okay. And again let me zoom out on European total. First of all, I really want to reiterate the synergies and the integration is fully on tract. So the cost side is to save that i.e. what we control, we do control and actually we deliver more as evidenced by Larry\u2019s earlier comments, so the increase of restructuring benefit that\u2019s largely Europe. So because that it\u2019s fully on track might just be going very well.","You have two elements in Europe, there is a little bit overlap. One is the currency, the currency impact to the operating margin. The offsetting action are cost based price increase that takes the time to ramp up. So I expect the margin impact in this month to go with every months be less in this, but of course right now it\u2019s a Q3 pending issue.","The volume impact is to a lesser expense. We\u2019re not in Q1, if you may recall when in Q1 a volume decline of 4%, now in Q2 with plus 2.1%, so it\u2019s getting better. But it\u2019s not yet fully at the pace of the market. That is largely expandable directly by the platform integrations. And again that something, which to some extent is expected, but it\u2019s still a pain as you go through it. We\u2019re basically replacing 80% of our SKUs in Europe this year.","These are massive factory moves, product platform moves. That is basically, we expected it to be largely completed by the end of the year. That is probably the single biggest drive behind the top-line issue. But again, I want to reiterate the top-line has the -- we don\u2019t like to see it but it has a lesser impact in the bottom-line than the currency.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to Rob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Rob Wetenhall ","Hi. Good morning, everyone and nice quarter. And Larry good luck, you\u2019ve been a big contributor and you\u2019ll be missed. Just wanted to see if you guys could step me through what\u2019s going on, in the slide deck on Page 27. You\u2019re taking down your expenses by 50 million for restructuring and you\u2019re boosting the benefit this year by 25 million. Then I\u2019m trying to understand and to just tie this maybe the Marc\u2019s comments about where is this kind of trade off occurring? It\u2019s obviously a very positive development. Can you step us through kind of the puts and takes share?","Larry Venturelli","Bob, this is Larry. On the restructuring size, we did take down the restructuring expense for this year down about $50 million. Now part of that is currency related, but some of that has -- quite frankly has to do with timing between years. So and we\u2019ll provide, obviously provide guidance for next year in a few months. But overall some point towards the integration being going well, restructuring being going well.","The benefit of then just we\u2019ve been able to accelerate some of the benefits from the acquisition in the integration, that continues to go well and we remain fully committed and what we communicated back 2017 to 350 million plus. ","Marc Bitzer","Bob its Marc, keep also in mind that there is always a time lag between the expenses and the benefits. So I think the way you should read this one is the increase of benefits has largely to do with actions taken in \u201915 which are really and we get the strong yield out of this one and the expense that there is one or two little pieces which we had in mind which would probably be do in \u201917 and we will announce it at the appropriate time. ","Rob Wetenhall","Okay, so this just sounds like a timing issue. Zooming out a little bit on the next slide on Page 28, you took your price mix down from 50 basis points to 1% up to 0 to 0.5. I was trying to understand why you kind of tweaked that downward a little bit and your volume growth in Asia and Latin is excellent and you didn\u2019t move up your outlook in terms of industry shipments or what you guys could do there and I was trying to understand if for attending weakness in the second half or just an abundance in caution?","Jeff Fettig","Bob, I would just say there has been a number of moving parts in the first half of the year and we\u2019re assuming there will be a number of moving parts in the second half of the year. The compositive the margin walk simply is our 6 months actual versus run rates going forward and we\u2019re doing a little bit better and as we\u2019ve said on the cost synergy side we\u2019ve seen a little bit of -- I won\u2019t say weakness, but lessening of the total on the pricing.","Volume nets out about the same in total, but it varies a lot. You know I think as I looked in the first half of the year and for the full year it will be another great example of having our balanced global representation offering platform allows us to take advantage of markets that are going well and offset markets that face challenged during the year and second quarter is a great example of them, I imagine in the second half will be the same way. So there is no real big changes in any of our assumptions with the one exception that Marc pointed out in terms of short-term European markets.","Marc Bitzer","And Bob let me maybe also add a Brazil because they specifically asked for Brazil also. Don\u2019t read our performance in Q2 as an indication of the overall market environment, the market environment continues to be very challenging, I would read it a bit as, we were decisive on actions early on, maybe earlier in the cycle, took maybe also some hits early in the cycle and now we\u2019re starting the benefit of these actions earlier than maybe other people. So I would say right now given the unfortunate confidence of political, economic and ultimate consumer confidence quite in Brazil, I don\u2019t think we can count any recovery in this one in \u201916.","Operator","Then we\u2019ll go next to David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","David MacGregor","Yes, good morning and congratulations on a good quarter Jeff. Larry congratulations on your retirement. Hope things go well for you, best wishes. A couple of questions here, first of all, you know your competitor talked a lot about weakness in private label business in North America, I was just wondering if you could comment whatever trends you\u2019re seeing in the private label business this quarter?","Marc Bitzer","David its Marc. I don\u2019t know and I can\u2019t comment on competitors comment, what I can comment is on our own private label brand and business. So did we see over the last five years a trend from our private label business to our brand business, absolutely and that\u2019s ultimately the reflection of the strength of our brand portfolio. That trend is continuing and so it\u2019s nothing shocking or surprising or all of a sudden it\u2019s been I would say a multi-year erosion and again that\u2019s a variable portfolio strong brand helped us very strongly. I would say also in addition and I think we\u2019ve been talking about this repeatedly where we take pride in our very balanced distribution footprints. What it means we have I would say a very similar balance of trade partners [ph], most of our national trade partner. So whenever you see movements or wins and losses of one trade partner in the market we typically don't feel the pain because we have a very well balanced distribution footprints which obviously also helps us mitigate any trends you might see in the marketplace by private label or OEM business.","David MacGregor","Okay. So you don't see anything that was really kind of discontinuous or would be different from the trend you've been seeing over that past five years just to discuss.","Marc Bitzer","Very specifically we did not see a sudden acceleration of the trends. We did see a continuation of a trend, what it basically means our private label also in Q2 went down and we saw a very strong growth of our Maytag business and that worked for us.","David MacGregor","Good to hear. Second question is just if you think about all the volume that you're doing in North America over the course of the quarter or even you can talk about this at the industry level if you want to at the end level, but is there a growth in the percentage of the quarter's volume that's being sold into the markets through retail sales events versus day-to-day non discounted business. Is that changing materially year-over-year?","Marc Bitzer","Dave again its Marc here. Not, short answer no, we didn\u2019t see massive change. Again the expanded answer is and it's my usual comment is the AM sell-in is not reflective of our total volume and there is always like in every quarter there are inventory moves and differences between the sell in and the so called sell out. I would say in this quarter some of these numbers may be a little more distorted just because of a stock buying by LG and Samsung, is just the reality. But I would say from every single truth even if we take all data points into account that's why we still say that we still say a 5% to 6% steady state in the growth this year.","Operator","Now, we will go next to Eric Bosshard, Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Eric Bosshard","Thanks. In terms of the sell through, Marc to continue that point the AM shipments were notably softer in 2Q relatively to 1Q and it sounds like they may them stock piling that benefitted within that shipment number. I guess what I am trying to understand is in terms of the sell through pace that you've observed through the first half of the year. And what you're seeing in terms of expectations and activity in the back half of the year. Any change in that relative pace is the question.","Marc Bitzer","And Eric it's Marc. My comments particularly refer to our sell through we don\u2019t have unfortunately there are no reliable industry sell through data it's just a data source issue. So we have sell through data in about 65% of our customers are there. So we have a pretty good proxy of what happens in our business.","And that pace has been ahead of our sell in volumes and though it always stays quite [ph] a bit ahead of our overall market. To your point earlier, it's hard to gauge the exact market sell through, yes you could say July 4, may be a little a bit slow and some partners expected, on the other hand the rest of the quarter was a little bit stronger and I wouldn't read anything into what it would mean for Labor Day or any of the other promotional periods.","There will be ups and downs and of course the more aggressive people will be like on events like memorial day you may see an offsetting item on July 4, but these are the normal, what I will call the normal promotional ups and downs and I don't think that changes any of our view on the full year industry guidance.","Eric Bosshard","So, I guess just to make sure I understand from a sell through perspective throughout the first six months of the year ups and downs, but is there a trend is it strengthening as the same as weakening that's what I am trying to figure out?","Marc Bitzer","I would say it's actually pretty constant there is probably more noise actually in the sell in and the inventory data, than there is in sell-through that. So that's I think it's pretty steady now. Again there is differences by promotion, there is also difference by channel. For example, we continue to see very strong sell through and sell in on the builder and contract segment. The very subtle difference is across the different channels. But the sell through is actually pretty steady.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Alvaro Lacayo with Gabelli & Company.","Alvaro Lacayo","Good morning. I just want to get a little more color on Latin America. How you saw demand progression in the second quarter? And then maybe talk about for taking any competitive actions and better leading to that the market share gains, you guys are seeing in the market?","Marc Bitzer","And let me take this again. First of all, as a reference point, the minus 10%, which we gave as guidance refers to Brazil. That is not Latin America in total and I would argue from the outside Brazil, the rest of Latin America is probably stronger than the minus 10%. So minus 10% particularly in Brazil, I would say given the extreme volatile which we\u2019ve seen in Brazil over the last five, six quarters. I would right now say close to impossible to predict exactly what happens by quarter or\/and if we know, we probably wouldn\u2019t give that guidance. But right now it\u2019s actually, we still expect the full year industry will be down minus 10% nearing to one about the worse. So maybe stabilizing, but bear in mind it\u2019s stabilizing in a very low level, because last year was over the significant reduction.","So we do not see any recovery or any significant recovery in Brazil in the back half of this year. To your question about competitors direction, we simply do not know, we do not ask them. And frankly we focus in our own profitability. We did the actions a year ago, this all be associated pain and I would say our business is very well and keep also in mind, this are not just mechanics of pricing up and down, this are new product, product introduction and innovations, which would go through the markets.","Jeff Fettig","I just add to that. In Brazil, as we talked about last year, we had three waves of disruptions. The demand has been constant carry -- negative demand has been constant and is carried over in this year. We have three major currency valuations. The last one being in September and October and we had to adjust each time to those and then thirdly is the inflation.","So this year demand is pretty much playing out as we expected and we expected it to be down, were both through costs and cost based price actions, we\u2019re dealing with both currency and inflation. But the third factor is we continue despite the environment to invest very strong in a new portfolio and brand innovation. That is enabling us to improve our market position. The cost and the price position are allowing us to improve our margins, but the market share gains are purely the fact that we continue to bring new products in marketplace.","Alvaro Lacayo","Okay. And I just clarification on guidance. So and Q1 you didn\u2019t include the $0.50 of currency or any share repurchases. Is any of that already included in the guidance you provided in the second quarter?","Larry Venturelli","Well everything is all up. Remember our original guidance, in our original guidance we said we would exhaust our previous share repurchase during 2016, which is 225 million repurchase you saw in Q1. We did do $100 million on a new authorization in the second quarter that will have a modest impact on our guidance, which is included in there and then the currency piece is now -- the 200 million is now in our guidance and that\u2019s reflected in each of the regions that Marc took you through from a margin perspective.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Megan McGrath with MKM Partners.","Megan McGrath","Good morning. Thanks. I guess, I\u2019ll touch on a region that we haven\u2019t touched on a lot so far today, which is Asia. Wondering if could walk through you view of the market demand in China and India and I know you\u2019ve said in your presentation that China was down, do you think that you are gaining share yet from your distribution expansion or is still too early for that to be happening?","Marc Bitzer ","Megan its Marc. As you pointed out, first of all let me zoom out a little bit on Asia. We are very pleased and satisfied with our operating margin. 8% in such a volatile region and a competitive region it\u2019s non-frivolous, we are very pleased with that progress. But you\u2019re also right, it\u2019s a little bit a tale of two stores right now.","India in particular which is a big part of that region and we had exceptionally strong results they\u2019re both strong markets, but we also make very good progress in markets with cost productivity in new product introductions and we gain shares. So I would say India is really a very bright spot in that Asia one. China is impacted even though the integrations is on track, but it\u2019s impacted by a soft market demand. And then I talk about China market demand took the year to so called T-2, so it\u2019s not the same destination as North America. But right now even though we don\u2019t have the latest June data, I would right now assume Q2 China was high single-digits negative. So this is also obviously non-trivial in a very competitive market which is characterized by little bit over capacity.","So specifically to your question, our distribution expansion yes translate into market share gains, I would say not yet because they are also underlying two opposing moves. We\u2019re expanding the local brands distribution and we\u2019re actually gaining volume of local brands but at the same time we\u2019re staging out or reducing some value brand business. So there is two offsetting items and that\u2019s why net-net you don\u2019t get to see the market share growth, which overtime you should expect.","Megan McGrath","Okay, thanks that\u2019s really helpful. And then switching gears a little bit of a follow-up on the UK, we\u2019re sorry to hear some groaning about construction starting to already pull back or folks are talking about, can you give us a sense of your exposure to the new construction business in the UK versus retail and if you\u2019re also starting to see any early signs of weakness.","Marc Bitzer ","Megan, its Marc. So first of all every market around the world is slightly differently set up, so the kind of construction business which we have in U.S. what we refer typically to as a buildup of contract channel, same magnitude in UK because there is no typical, there is fewer national builders, so you don\u2019t have the national build business.","Having said that of course like any other markets in particular when you talk about kitchen demand, it\u2019s still impacting the housing stability. I would say not to the same extent as North America in terms of statistics and correlation but there is an impact. Do we see any signs of a pullback, here yet? No, I just simply do not see it and so -- but could you expect that overtime? Maybe, I would say it\u2019s too early to tell.","As you also know and just right now try to draw the analogy of other markets where you had certain currency swift. You may see odd behaviors on the market demand. We have -- it wouldn\u2019t be the first market where short-term you will see an increase of demand because people are still going for lower price appliances and when you see the opposite effect. So it\u2019s too early to see that in UK and it\u2019s speculation but best pattern which we\u2019ve seen in many markets. So you may see the odd combination of first increasing demand and then softness of demand. ","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll return the floor to Jeff Fettig for closing remarks.","Jeff Fettig","Well, again thank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you next time. Thank you very much.","Operator","And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great weekend."],"23058":["Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 24, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Joseph Lovechio - Senior Director of Investor Relations","Jeff M.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Joe Lovechio.","Joseph Lovechio","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q, as well as in the Appendix of this presentation.","Turning to Slide 3. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation.","Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 34 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As you saw in our press release from earlier today, we delivered a strong improvement in our Q2 operating results. We continue to deliver on the commitments that we outlined at the beginning of the year, and we're reaffirming our full year guidance. Overall, I believe we executed well during the quarter and the first half of the year, and our margin expansion initiatives remain on track. In total, these actions fully offset weaker than expected demand, unfavorable currency and material inflation during the quarter.","Our North America and Latin America businesses continue to perform extremely well. In North America, our ongoing business operating profit more than doubled year-over-year. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives are on track to realize the expected $200 million per year cost savings benefit this year. And we continue to see very good -- a very strong price\/mix improvement during the quarter, which has been enabled by our innovation, which is winning in the marketplace; our strong global consumer brand portfolio, which is enabling us to mix up our mix; and our continued support of our brands through ramped up investments.","Turning to Slide 6. Overall revenues for the quarter were up 3%, excluding the impact of currency and BEFIEX, driven by strong product price and mix. Our diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved to $1.55 per share compared with $0.81 in the prior year, and our underlying free cash flow significantly improved year-over-year from ongoing business operations.","On Slide 7, you can clearly see our continued positive trend of both price\/mix and margin expansion. During the first half, we made very strong progress towards our full year margin target. And we expect to improve our margins to 6% to 7% during the second half of the year and reach our full year operating profit margins of between 5.5% and 6% in line with our original guidance.","Turning to Slide 8. Globally, we now expect second half industry demand to improve versus first half levels. We have revised several of our regional forecasts on a full year basis. Our full year U.S. industry demand is now forecasted to be flat to down 2% for the year. In Latin America, the Brazilian tax holiday was extended through the end of August. And with this extension, combined with good underlying economic fundamentals throughout the region, we now expect demand growth to increase from our original guidance to the range of 5% to 7%.","In Europe, we continue to see an industry decline for the year in the range of down 2% to down 5% for the full year. And of course, as you know, the European markets continue to face very challenging macroeconomic conditions, which are impacting consumer demand.","We are managing our business accordingly with cost and previously announced price actions along with very disciplined inventory management in this weak demand environment. And finally, we now expect full year unit shipments in Asia to be flat to up 2%.","Slide 9 shows our key business drivers for the year versus our original guidance. As I just outlined, demand was weak in the first half of the year and currencies were volatile and had a negative impact on operations. Raw material inflation was in line with our forecast, and we continue to expect a range of $300 million to $350 million for the year. However, if current raw material trends continue, we would expect this to move towards the lower end of the range.","We continue to expect to fully offset all of these items with positive price\/mix, driven by our cadence of innovation and improving productivities, which we fully expect in the second half of the year. As I mentioned, our restructuring costs and capacity asset reductions are on track, and we will realize those benefits as they ramp up in the second half of the year.","So overall, throughout the first half, we're on track to deliver our EPS and free cash flow guidance, and we're reaffirming that guidance for the year.","So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Marc Bitzer to talk about our North America operations.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance during the quarter.","Starting on Slide 11. First of all, you see our revenues and margin for the region grew significantly during the quarter as margin expansion is due largely to our previously announced and fully implemented cost base price increases and an overall improved price\/mix, which has been now a consistent trend for the past 4 quarters.","In addition, our cost and capacity reduction initiatives are delivering benefits as expected for the region. And during the quarter, we saw a record working capital, driven by aggressive inventory management, which means we took down production volumes, which had a negative impact on profitability.","Turning to Slide 12. You see net sales of $2.5 billion increase 4% from last year, driven by favorable product price and mix. Our ongoing business operating profit was $186 million, which more than doubled as compared to $76 million in 2011. Overall, ongoing business operating margin was up more than 4 points year-over-year.","Turning to Slide 13, you can see just a few examples of our innovative products. The cooking products you see are just a couple of examples of how we are growing our premium cooking business. Earlier this year, we opened a new manufacturing facility in Cleveland and Tennessee to continue to provide the world's most innovative cooking products, including ranges, ovens and cooktops.","Turning over to Slide 14. While today, we are providing our perspective in second quarter results. It remains important to highlight the significant opportunity while our businesses' underlying industry demand start to slowly improve. Today, demand is at recessionary low levels, and yet we were able to restore operating margins at 8%. And yet, we expect only relatively modest demand growth in the second half. However, we are beginning to see some early but consistent signs of housing recovery, which makes us increasingly optimistic about a more structural demand recovery. And obviously, with operating margins now already at 8%, there is significant opportunity once demand returns to more normal levels.","And now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations.","Michael A. Todman","Thanks, Marc. I'll begin with an overview of our international environment during the quarter on Slide 16. Overall, we have solid performance in our Latin America and Asia regions. We saw improved product price and mix across our international businesses as we continue to launch consumer-relevant innovations in every product category around the world.","Europe remained challenging during the quarter with continued weak consumer demand across the Eurozone. We took aggressive actions during the quarter. Our cost reduction initiatives for the region are on track, and when combined with previously announced cost-based price increases, are expected to deliver sequential margin improvements and a return to profitability in the second half and into 2013, although the demand environment remains uncertain.","During the quarter, we saw volatile movements in the global currency markets, particularly in Brazil and India. We continued our disciplined approach to inventory management, and we expect to see some improvement in emerging market demand trends going forward.","If you turn to Slide 17, you'll see our Latin America second quarter results. Sales were $1.2 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year. Excluding currency and BEFIEX, sales increased more than 8% on slightly higher volumes.","Operating profit for the quarter totaled $103 million compared to $166 million in the prior year. Favorable product price and mix was partially offset by unfavorable currency and lower monetization of tax credits.","On an adjusted basis, excluding the Brazilian tax credits, our operating profit for the quarter totaled $101 million and approximately 9% of sales compared to $87 million and approximately 7% of sales in the prior year period.","Turning to Slide 18. As we previously discussed, we have focused on higher margin products in Brazil. As you can see illustrated here, excluding a less profitable category, in this case microwave ovens, our T8 appliance units for our business in Brazil grew 7% versus last year. Our decision to shift the business has positively impacted price and mix and profit during the quarter.","Turning to Slide 19. In the second quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased 18% year-over-year to $692 million with unit shipments down 7% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 7%. The region had an operating loss of $26 million, down from the $20 million profit in the prior year period. Favorable price\/mix in the quarter was more than offset by unfavorable country mix, volatile currency and significant production takeout to adjust for market demand and reduce our inventory levels.","Today, inventories are in good shape, and we do not expect that to be a headwind going forward as long as demand remains at current levels. We also continue to execute our restructuring plan, and we expect that our actions will allow us to return to profitability in the second half.","Our second quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 20. Net sales decreased 7% during the quarter to $241 million, down from $257 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 6%. The region's operating profit of $14 million improved sequentially and was essentially flat to the prior year.","Overall, favorable product price\/mix and consumer preference for our new product launches, particularly in India, was offset by volatile currency and unfavorable material cost. In local currency, India achieved record sales and operating profit for the quarter, and this confirms that our consumer-relevant innovation is winning in the marketplace.","Turning to Slide 21. You can see just a few examples of our international product launches during the quarter. These products show just a glimpse of how we are advancing our global brand portfolio in more than 130 markets around the world.","Finally, we continue to see tremendous growth potential in emerging markets, where product penetration levels remain low as you can see on Slide 22. Despite the temporary slowdown, we expect to see a return to growth in these emerging markets as more consumers are able to purchase appliances and benefit from the quality and convenience they provide. The potential in developing countries is tremendous if we consider the population and economic growth trends combined with these low penetration levels.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli for his financial review.","Larry M. Venturelli","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. First, let me start by putting into context first half performance relative to our full year guidance.","As you recall and shown on Slide 24,  we are guiding to annual GAAP EPS of $5 to $5.50 per share and ongoing business operations EPS of $6.50 to $7. For the first 6 months of the year, we have earned GAAP EPS of $2.60 per share, essentially the midpoint of annual guidance, and ongoing business operations EPS of just under $3 per share.","As you know, we do not provide quarterly earnings guidance. It's important to note, however, that our first half earning results are ahead of the plan we established entering the year. These results are driven by our ongoing operating profit margin, which has essentially doubled from the second half 2011. Our run rate continues to support the full year guidance we've provided several months ago, which we are again reconfirming today. Our lower tax rate, which I will discuss in a moment, is offsetting the unfavorable currency impact on our business. Operationally, our EPS guidance for the year remains solid and unchanged.","As you can see on Slide 25, we continue to expect 5.5% to 6% ongoing operating profit margin for the year, which translates into a 300-basis point improvement. With our first half results on plan and close to the low end of this range, we fully expect margins to continue improving during the second half of the year.","Let me spend a minute on our year-over-year margin improvement. For the first half of the year, the drivers of our performance have been price\/mix, which is up approximately 4 points and is currently tracking higher than original expectations. We continue to expect positive price\/mix in the second half of the year. However, we will be comping against prior year price increases.","Another positive margin contributor has been benefits associated with our cost and capacity reduction program, which continues to remain on plan. We expect benefits to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year.","Material cost inflation was approximately $175 million in the first half. And given industry demand levels, we did take actions during the second quarter to reduce production to ensure inventories remained at appropriate levels. The production cuts negatively impacted our conversion productivity.","As you can see on Slide 25, our second half margins are expected to be, as Jeff said, between 6% to 7%. This sequential improvement is expected to be realized by the combination of improving productivity, given a solid midyear inventory position, higher volume in the second half of the year, productivity program ramp up and lower material headwinds, continued price\/mix improvements from recent price increases. And finally second half margins will also benefit from higher restructuring benefits, as well as seasonality of our portables business.","Now turning to free cash flow on Page 26, and consistent with our expectations, we did have a cash outflow for the first half of the year of $540 million. It's important to note that current year cash flow includes the final installment of $275 million associated with the Brazilian collection dispute.","We also note that adjusting for items impacting comparability, our underlying ongoing business cash flow improved over last year's first half. Now we continue to expect to generate positive free cash flow between $100 million and $150 million for the year. With legacy legal liabilities and the majority of our restructuring cash outlays behind us after this year, we are very well positioned to generate significantly higher free cash flow in the future.","Let me spend a couple of minutes on our second quarter results, which further solidified our full year guidance, as well as some general topics. But before I begin, as a general reminder, Slide 36 and 37 in the Appendix will provide you with a reconciliation of our reported GAAP operating profit and EPS to ongoing business operations for both 2012 and '11. Included in this table are second quarter adjustments to drive our ongoing business operations and performance, removing the impact of restructuring expense, BEFIEX tax credits, as well as the impacts from benefit plan curtailment gain, the antitrust resolution, investment impairment and adjustment to normalize the second quarter tax rate, which I will discuss in a moment.","Turning to the financial summary on Slide 27. Let me make a couple of observations. While reported net sales declined 5%, it's important to note that net sales from constant currencies and excluding BEFIEX credits were up more than 3%. Our ongoing business operations operating profit improved by over 40%, driven primarily by positive price\/mix and cost and capacity reduction initiatives, a very solid performance given lower industry demand, unfavorable currencies and higher material cost.","On Slide 28, I'd like to make a couple of comments. First, prior year GAAP results included the Brazilian collection dispute and antitrust settlement, benefits from energy tax credits, as well as significantly higher BEFIEX credits. These items are presented for your reference on Page 38.","Second, regarding our 2012 tax rate, in the first quarter, we reported an effective GAAP tax rate of 27%; for the second quarter, it was 4% on a GAAP basis, which is lower than our full year expectations and driven by a timing of our tax planning. We now expect our full year tax rate to be 25%. For our ongoing business operations EPS, our second quarter tax rate is 22%. Now this reflects an adjustment to bring our first half tax rate to 25%.","Slide 29 illustrates our cost and capacity reduction charges. The program remains on track, and there are no changes from previous guidance. We are on track to deliver $200 million in benefit in 2012 with an additional $200 million of benefit in 2013.","Let me turn now to the monetization of BEFIEX tax credits, where we monetized $2 million in credits compared to $79 million last year as a result of the IPI tax holiday in Brazil. As of June 30, $215 million credits remain. Given the most recent extension to August 31, we continue to expect to monetize $60 million to $80 million this year, unless the program will be extended for a third time. If the program would be extended to the end of 2012, we would expect to monetize $40 million to $50 million for the full year.","One other item I'd like to note is on May 1, $350 million of 8% notes matured and were repaid. On June 1, we completed a 10-year debt offering of $300 million of 4.7% notes.","Before I close on Slide 30, I want to review our short-term cash flow priorities, which remain unchanged funding the business, including capital expenditures and pension contribution; dividends, as I previously mentioned, funding the remaining legacy liabilities, which are largely behind us after this year; and debt repayment.","Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","Thanks, Larry. Let me sum up by saying that we are pleased with our execution of the strong actions to improve our operating margins for the first half of the year, and we are on track to achieve a record year of margin expansion throughout our global business. And I think it's important to point out that we're able to do this in a period where both in North America and Europe are at or near recession lows in terms of demand and Asia is showing -- showed the weakest negative demand growth we've seen in many, many years.","But I think looking forward, more in line with our strategy, there are many positives that we're starting to feel better about. We are positive about what we're seeing in the U.S. with housing trends.  We're seeing a foundation beginning to form in that sector, which we think will benefit us over time. We do have significant future opportunities for our business in emerging economies such as China, India and the countries throughout Latin America.","We continue to see improvements in price\/mix driven by our leading global brand portfolio and best-in-class innovation in our product launches, and we do know that innovation sells in good markets and in difficult markets. We will accelerate and we are investing to accelerate our innovation in both existing core business and adjacent spaces to further accelerate revenue growth and increase shareholder value. Our ability to expand our operating margins and the conclusion of the legal -- the legacy liability payments position us very well for generating strong free cash flow in the second half of the year and going into 2013.","So overall, we're positive about the progress we're making to continue to build our position as a strong global brand and consumer products company.","With that, I'm going to end the formal remarks and open up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the side of David MacGregor.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","I guess I'm struck by data that was out this week just indicating that Lowe's has lost quite a bit of market share year-over-year in the second quarter, and I'm just wondering how that might influence your North American business. And secondly, talk a little bit about how you become a little more retail agnostic, given the concerns about what may ultimately happen at Sears and your recent news -- good news at Home Depot, if you could just help us better understand that.","Marc Bitzer","David, it's Marc Bitzer. As you know, we're not typically commenting on specific retailer strategies or issues. And in particular also, I think you're referring to track end data, which is not the only data source in the industry. So I would -- let me just try to answer from a broader perspective. I mean, it's not driven by a particular Lowe's or Sears perspective. We always -- we try to have a very good distribution position of all our brands across the entire country. In that context, that's probably also our Home Depot expansion, where our addition of the local brand fits into. So yes, we're trying to have our brands appropriately represented at many or most outlets in the U.S. so kind of be probably less exposed to an individual up or down of an individual retailer.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, maybe we can continue that conversation offline. As well just in terms of the $200 million cost savings program you have going on, is there anyway to talk about how much of that actually made it to the bottom line or what the contribution to the bottom line was from the cost reductions in the quarter?","Larry M. Venturelli","Are you talking about the restructuring, David?","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, I am.","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes, for the quarter, from a benefit perspective, we had about 1%, which is about $46 million; for the first half, we're about $84 million. So we'll get another, let's call, $115 million plus in the second half. We'll be more weighted towards the second half of the year.","Jeff M. Fettig","And David, on that, as Larry mentioned, we had very positive PMR. We had positive restructuring benefits. We had negative currency, and we had negative net productivity due to raw material increases and a significant reduction in production volumes as we kept inventories in line. What we think is different in the second half is we think the production adjustments are more or less very well balanced, and we expect productivity turn from a negative in the first half to a positive in the second half.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","So what you're saying, that you don't expect production curtailments to be significant to margins in the second half?","Jeff M. Fettig","No, we don't.","Operator","We'll move, our next question is from the side of Sam Darkatsh.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Talk about why you're taking your U.S. expectations down in the second half. I think the second quarter came in pretty much what you were expecting, Jeff, and you were talking about some encouraging signs you're seeing in the end markets. So why be more sober on the expectations in the second half?","Marc Bitzer","Sam, it's Marc. Let me try to answer that. Again, I think it's more a question of math and just about we took down the full year expectation to kind of -- well, the previous is that -- the previous guidance was 0 to slightly up but there's an emphasis on 0 more, and now we're seeing 0 to a minus 2. Again, that is basically more a question of math. If you would take a minus 2, that basically means the second half grows slightly less than 1 point. If you go to higher part of our range, 0 for full year, that would mean that the second half grew by 4.7%. And I think the truth will be somewhere in between. I also want to take the opportunity to emphasize more -- yes, we're still a little bit cautious about a strong dynamic growth in the second half, but we are more confident about the underlying long-term and midterm demand trends and particularly by the housing, the housing starts, rental market activity, which is the large of consistent signs which made us increasingly optimistic. So I think it's more a question of when as opposed to if.","Jeff M. Fettig","And Sam, just -- again, if you look at the numbers and the normal seasonality, to Marc's point, so we're really forecasting the second half between 1% and 5% to get to that guidance, which is profoundly more positive than the first half.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And would you expect the second quarter share trends in the United States to continue also?","Jeff M. Fettig","Sam, first quarter, we were up. Second quarter, we're marginally down. We're stable. As we bring out innovations, we're gaining shares. So overall, share trends aren't big concern right now.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","My second question, you're going to have prodigious free cash flow in the second half of this year and then considerably more in the out-years than you saw this year because of the absence of a lot of costs. Looking back over time, you've had only 3 dividend increases over the past 20 years. You haven't bought any stock back really over the last 4 or 5 years, as I recall. Do some of those type of cash flow uses begin to become much more appealing to you? And how should we look at that prospect over the next 6 to 12 months?","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, Sam, for this year, Larry outlined our 4 priorities, and we've been executing to them all year and will continue to do so. As we get out of 2012, and I'm not here to talk about forecasting 2013 or beyond, but I would go back to the same list where clearly we regularly, with our board, sit down and review cash allocation. And certainly, as we get these legal liabilities behind us and we're generating -- our run rate from operations is very strong and will improve with earnings growth and, certainly, return to shareholder would be something we'd evaluate.","Operator","Let me turn to the next question from the side of Ken Zener.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Two things. I want to focus on U.S. demand as it relates to new construction first. Can you talk about how the competitive dynamics might be or are different there versus the retail channel based on your distribution capacity? So I think you and GE are more focused there versus retail where other competitors easily service that.","Marc Bitzer","Ken, it's Marc Bitzer. First of all, and once again coming back to the housing, when I refer to early signs of housing recovery,  we're still talking about very low levels. But I think what is encouraging to see is that now start significantly out paces completions, which just is already in the 6 to 8 months a better perspective. Inventory is coming down. And I don't think we should underestimate the dynamics of the rental market as a catalyst for the overall housing market. There's just a lot of positive signs. I think without getting too much specific, and as you may often know the market share data on this what we call the building channel are not very well documented. But I would just argue, we have a very strong position in that channel. And in particular, over the last 2 or 3 years, through the gains of some fairly large long-term contracts, I think we're certainly better positioned coming out of the recession than we were coming into the recession.","Jeff M. Fettig","And Ken, your basic question is correct. There is a very different market share structure in that channel than there is the retail channel.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Can you talk about -- you talked about lower volume impacting margins, all else being equal. Was that -- -- excuse me if I missed it, was that in the order of, let's say, 150 basis points in terms of gross margin or how would you frame that?","Jeff M. Fettig","I'm sorry, Ken from the...","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","From the lower volume, how that impacted your margins, excluding cost and pricing, et cetera, what that absence will be in the second half or the headwind in the first half?","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes, I'd say versus our expectations for the year, I'd say we expected, if you did the math, that overall industry volume would be flattish in our original guidance. And now I'd say you'd probably see it down 0.5 point in the industry. So from a production perspective, I'd say that costing is about 0.5 point.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And they were referring to North America, is that correct?","Larry M. Venturelli","Actually, globally. We had to take out a lot of production in Europe and also North America.","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, yes, I would say it was most profound in Europe, secondly in North America.","Operator","We'll move next to the side of Michael Rehaut.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, just on Europe, I was hoping to dig in a little bit there. The revenues -- I thought you said that you benefited from price\/mix, but I thought the units and revenues declined both 7%. So I was a little confused there. And also -- I was wondering if you could also go into a little bit more detail in terms of the return to profitability in the back half, if that's more driven by just maybe the year-over-year declines not bad as -- this is a pretty low watermark for revenues or if there are -- maybe you can describe the timing of the restructuring benefits.","Michael A. Todman","Yes, Michael, this is Mike Todman. First of all, just addressing the first point, we did have constant currency 7% decline in our sales, which was equal to our unit shipment. But our country mix is less favorable, if you will, or more geared towards those markets that were more negative, and so that impacted us overall in terms of our European performance. Secondly, what we did in order to respond to that and respond to the demand environment is we significantly reduced our production in order to get our inventories in line, and so that is not something that we expect to see reoccurring in the second half. And therefore, that negative should go away as we come through the second half, and that's why we feel pretty confident on returning to profitability.","Jeff M. Fettig","And in addition, price\/mix should continue to improve as it has been, and you will see it. And restructuring benefits will ramp up and then, of course, what Mike said, will show up in productivity.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Secondly, in North America, you've made great progress there, and the ability to execute the price increases have obviously been huge in driving that better performance. Are there any price increases scheduled for the back half of the year? How do you think about pricing, let's say, on a go-forward basis? I know you're not going to be giving -- you don't give guidance per se. But on a go forward, now that you've got profitability in this 7% to 8% range, is further -- maybe thinking about bigger picture, further expansion more purely going to be driven by just volume and mix? And also, how much within North America should we expect the restructuring benefits to apply down into the North American segment in 2013? So few parts to that question, I apologize, but...","Marc Bitzer","Mike, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me first try to address some of that. First of all, it's a pretty good point, as you highlighted, we are back to this 8%, which is a number which we communicated in the Investor Conference, and that's in a recessionary environments. So that's a good starting point. What I want to point out on the price increase, first in the past, first of all, I do believe we had a very, very strong execution in this one because it's not just in this price increase we managed our mix very well, which is typically something difficult to maintain once you go up with price increases. As you know, and we made that statement several times in the past, we simply cannot comment on any forward plans. We are, as a company, focused on the margin expansion and that's our course, and that's a course which we will stay on.","Jeff M. Fettig","And Mike, I would add to that. We talked about our restructuring activities. We'll get $200 million of benefits to our P&L this year, and we fully expect another $200 million benefit to our P&L next year with the completion of these activities of which these will largely fall in North America and Europe. The second thing I would point out is that through our innovation, we continue to invest significant both capital and R&D. And we get -- on our innovation projects, we do get margin i.e. mix upgrades from that. So I guess the way I would put it is that if you look at demand, if you look at price\/mix, if you look at restructuring, if you look at ongoing productivity, those are all the levers that we're focused on to drive and expand our operating margins both in North America and around the world. Some have a bigger impact during different periods of time, but we're very focused on -- we're not satisfied with today's margin levels. Anywhere in the world, we're very focused on expanding those margins.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One last quick one, if I could, just the tax rate for 2013. How should we think about that, given some of the changes this year?","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes, I think, Michael, what we said before, we're -- from a guidance perspective, we'll provide that in -- when we release our fourth quarter earnings. But certainly from a normalized basis, mid-20s to high 20s will be the range that we'd be looking at, probably closer towards the mid-20s.","Operator","And we will take our final question, this one from the side of Joshua Pollard.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Let me start with Brazil. I'm trying to understand how much of your 1.7 points of margin improvement came from getting out of the microwave business, ultimately trying to split the organic versus inorganic changes in your margins there.","Michael A. Todman","Well, Josh, I won't split up specifically that. But clearly, getting out of unprofitable businesses has a positive impact to our overall margin. But having said that, we also had positive price\/mix in the rest of our business in Latin America and our business grew. So really, all of those are contributing to the improvement in margin.","Jeff M. Fettig","As well as yield, as we talked about throughout -- really beginning last year at this time, and we have announced and implemented selective cost-based price increases almost throughout our entire range over the last 12 months. So that's showing up positive mix from innovation. And to Mike's point, the absence of selling -- a significant part of that microwave business is well over half is loss making, and  we've chosen not to participate in that.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. I'm just wondering is it a big benefit? I can't tell if the 8.8 that you got -- could you say that again?","Jeff M. Fettig","It's material.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Immaterial or material?","Jeff M. Fettig","It is material.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. My second question is in what areas should we expect the $115 million of remaining productivity gains from your cost program to flow through? I mean, it seems like the areas where you guys are expecting the most improvement in the second half is in your Europe margins overall, but I'm also noticing that your SG&A is up almost -- is up 5% to 7% or almost $40 million year-on-year in the second quarter. Can you talk about what areas investors should expect to see the reductions from your cost program?","Larry M. Venturelli","Josh, this is Larry. A couple of things from an SG&A perspective, we did guide at the beginning of the year that we would have a higher SG&A for the year. And a part of that has to do with the higher employee benefits, the other part has to do with just increased investments in advertising and consumer support. From a productivity perspective and the balance in the back half of the year, a couple of things to keep in mind is one is that the second half volume for us historically, and will be this year, is higher volume. And we just mentioned, for the second quarter, we took out a significant amount of production. So you don't have the same headwinds from a conversion perspective as you did in the first half. Our inventories are in very good shape, so we'll have higher volumes in the second half of the year. From a productivity perspective on some of the programs, our cost change programs ramp up throughout the year. We've got programs going within the distribution network. Material content is within cost change. So things like that are what kind of builds throughout the year. And then along with that, we have restructuring we said was more back end weighted. So those are some of the things that help us improve our productivity in the second half of the year.","Jeff M. Fettig","And Josh, you'll see the lion's share of that in the gross margin.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then if I can sneak one more in. Commodities at current levels, I'm not calling it guidance by any stretch of imagination, but how much of a benefit could you see in 2013? My simple math is you guys went from the high end of the range at the end of 1Q to the low end of the range at the end of 2Q. If you assume that $50 million, that you saved over a quarter, annualize that, could it be $200 million or is that thinking too big?","Jeff M. Fettig","Josh, in February, we gave our guidance of $300 million, $350 million. At the end of April, we actually guided towards the higher end of the range because things were moving strongly in that direction. And we're reaffirming our guidance for the year now and said that if current trends continue, it could be towards the low end. So I mean, even within this period, there's quite a bit of volatility. It's just too early for us to give you any kind of outlook for 2013. There's a lot of moving parts as you very well know in raw materials. And as we get late in the year and that's -- or actually early next year is will be the earliest that we give guidance for 2013.","Well, listen everybody, thank you for joining us today. We look forward to talking with you next time.","Operator","And this concludes today's program. Have a great day. You may disconnect at this time."],"22919":["Whirlpool Corp.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Max Tunnicliff.","Max Tunnicliff","Thank you and welcome to our first quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chief Executive Officer and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpool.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports. We want to remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","As a reminder, effective January 1 of this year, we are reporting and guiding segment results as earnings before interest and taxes. In addition, our segment results reflect the Mexico business as part of the Latin America segment and certain adjacent businesses that have been moved from the North America segment to the Asia segment. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Bitzer","Well, thanks and good morning everyone. Before we discuss our first quarter results, I would like to discuss the announcements we made earlier this morning following the close of the Tokyo market and board approval. We take pride in our strong global portfolio of consumer brands and Embraco was essentially our only B2B business and we made the strategic decision to focus our investments on growing our consumer-facing businesses. Persistent with the strategy, earlier today, we announced agreement to sell our Embraco compressor business unit for approximately $1.1 billion in cash. Embraco is a leading global manufacturer of refrigeration compressors, which is currently reported as part of our Latin America segment. And in 2017, Embraco contributed approximately $1.3 billion in sales as margins approximating the segment average. The deal is expected to close in early 2019 subject to regulatory approvals.","Based on the anticipated closing date, the deal is not expected to have material impact on our 2018 financial results. However, we have secured financing in an amount similar to the anticipated net proceeds from the transaction, which we intend to use to significantly increase share repurchases in the second quarter through a modified Dutch auction tender offer targeting $1 billion. The impact of this tender offer is not reflected in the guidance we issued last night. After this Embraco announcement, let me now comment on our first quarter results in Slide 3.","As you saw in our press release, we delivered record first quarter ongoing earnings per share of $2.81 in line with our expectations. We also delivered year-over-year improvement in EBIT dollars after six quarters of pressure on our EBIT margins driven by positive global price mix and the successful implementation of our previously announced cost-based pricing actions. We also completed the actions related to our fixed cost reduction initiative during the quarter and expect to continue realizing the benefits of these actions throughout 2018. In addition to solid global results, we are very pleased with our margin expansion on North America regions despite significant raw material inflation. These results give us continued confidence in the strength of our overall business and the reflection of this confidence and consistent with our balanced approach of capital allocation, we have increased our quarterly dividend for the sixth consecutive year.","Turning to Slide 4, we show our first quarter financial results and full year 2018 guidance. We delivered revenue growth of 2.6% during the quarter. Ongoing EBIT margins were 6.0% for the quarter approximately flat to the prior year as positive price mix offset 150 basis points impact from raw material inflation. Finally, our first quarter free cash flow was impacted by the timing of certain payments and accrued compared to the prior year. We expect those impacts to be temporary and remain committed to our full year free cash flow guidance.","On Slide 5, we show the drivers of our first quarter margin performance. During the quarter, we began to realize the benefits of a cost-based price increase we announced in late 2017 contributing to strong global price mix positive in three out of four regions. I will discuss price mix further on the next slide. Raw material inflation was significant year-over-year headwind impacting our margins by 150 basis points. We delivered positive cost productivity in line with expectations and our fixed cost reduction actions more than offset increased marketing technology investments in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 6, we show our price mix performance in more detail. In total, first quarter price mix improved by approximately 100 basis point compared to the prior year period. Throughout the world, we realized the benefits of a cost-based price increase we implemented over last two quarters. In North America, our U.S. kitchen actions were implemented in January and as a result we drove strong sequential improvement to price mix throughout the quarter. In Europe, in addition to our previously announced cost-based price increases we implemented a strategic reduction of certain private label volumes, which will drive positive mix for the remainder of the year. In Latin America, price mix was favorable as a result of new product launches in addition to our previously announced cost-based price increases. In Asia, our overall price mix was flat. China performed well and planned distribution expansion efforts negatively impacted India\u2019s mix in the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our progress in price mix and expect these benefits to continue.","With that, I would like to turn over to Jim to review our regional results.","Jim Peters","Thanks, Marc and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 8, we reviewed the first quarter results for our North America region. Net sales were $2.5 billion, an increase of 3%. We also drove unit volume growth in our core appliance business, which was partially offset by softer volumes in Canada and certain adjacent businesses. Margins improved 20 basis points to 11.4% consistent with our expectations. We delivered this margin expansion through favorable price mix and fixed cost takeout more than offsetting a 100 basis point impact from raw material inflation. Of note earlier this month, we began to implement previously announced cost-based price increases in our U.S. laundry business. We expect these actions to drive additional price mix benefits during the remainder of the year. In summary, we are pleased with the North America performance in the first quarter and continue to expect strong results throughout the rest of 2018 in line with our guidance.","Turning to Slide 9, we reviewed the first quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Net sales were $1.1 billion. EBIT declined versus the prior year as positive price mix was more than offset by unit volume declines, currency headwinds and significant raw material inflation. In total, raw material inflation impacted margins by $25 million or 225 basis points. During the quarter, we took a number of steps to improve our business. First, we renegotiated a number of unfavorable trade customer agreements to better align with our strategic goals and the timing of these negotiations had an impact on first quarter shipments. We completed these negotiations at the end of March and expect to recover volume in the second half as we regained retail flooring. Second, consistent with our efforts to streamline our business and focus on improving profitability, we executed a targeted reduction of certain private label volume. As a result of our proactive strategic actions in the region, we continue to expect to deliver our full year EBIT guidance of approximately 2%.","Turning to Slide 10, we review the first quarter results for our Latin American region. Net sales were $898 million. We delivered EBIT of $57 million and margins were 6.3%. Our home appliance business performed well both inside and outside of Brazil driving favorable price mix and benefiting from new product launches. We drove solid appliance results despite soft industry demand on washers and refrigerators. Our global compressor business results were soft due to weak global demand, raw material inflation and inefficiencies related to the planned Italy plant closure. For the region, raw material inflation impacted EBIT by approximately $15 million or 150 basis points. Finally, during the quarter, we realized a $22 million favorable impact in the monetization of certain tax credits in Brazil, which was partially offset by a $17 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange hedges. Overall, we expect the region to expand margins as industry demand improves through the year.","We now turn to the first quarter results for our Asia region which are shown on Slide 11. Net sales were $448 million, an increase of 3% versus the prior year. We delivered EBIT of $19 million, a $7 million sequential improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2017. Our EBIT was impacted by raw material inflation of $10 million, which impacted margins by 200 basis points. Additionally, currency unfavorably impacted margins by approximately $5 million. Our business in India continues to deliver strong growth of both unit volume and revenue as we drive share gains through distribution expansion and new product introduction. As Marc mentioned earlier, price mix in India was slightly unfavorable as the benefits of our previously announced cost-based price increase were more than offset by mix impacts related to the distribution growth. We expect our India business to continue growing at a strong pace. In China, we delivered strong sequential improvement to EBIT. Our actions to improve price mix and focus on profitability were effective despite continued raw material inflation.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Marc to review our guidance.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks, Jim. And turning to Slide 13, we review our guidance assumptions for 2018. We now expect growth of approximately 1% driven primarily by temporary volume weakness in Europe and soft global compressor demand. We continue to expect growth in North America and overall positive global price mix. We continue to expect to deliver ongoing EBIT margin of approximately 7.5% for the year. I will update \u2013 as discussed, we updated drivers of our EBIT margin guidance on the next slide. Finally, we now expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 20% as shown in our first quarter ongoing results. Jim will provide additional color in our current tax rate assumptions later in the call. We continue to expect to deliver ongoing earnings of $14.50 to $15.50 per share and we expect our first half year earnings pacing to be consistent with historical earnings pacing. As a reminder, our guidance is not inclusive of a tender offer we intend to exclude later in the second quarter.","Turning to Slide 14, we show the updated drivers of our EBIT margin guidance. We now expect to deliver at least $275 million of net benefit from improved price mix. This includes the benefits of our previously implemented actions in addition to our recently announced cost-based price increase in our U.S. laundry business. Over the last few months, raw material costs have risen substantially and as a result we are revising our raw material inflation guidance for 2018 by approximately $50 million to a range of $250 million to $300 million primarily due to previously announced U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum. In addition to existing steel and aluminum tariffs, there continues to be uncertainty regarding potential future tariffs and trade actions. We will continue to monitor, evaluate and take the right actions for our business in these areas.","Now, Jim will cover our regional guidance and our cash priorities.","Jim Peters","Thanks, Marc. On Slide 15, we show our regional industry and EBIT margin guidance. Our regional industry expectations are unchanged and we continue to believe that the global appliance industry is well-positioned for growth. In North America, we continue to expect to deliver at least 12% margin. The benefits of our recently announced cost-based price increases in our U.S. laundry business are expected to be partially offset by increasing raw material costs. In EMEA, we continue to expect to deliver approximately 2% EBIT margin. We expect improvements throughout the year especially in the second half as our final factory move is completed by July and volumes improved following trade customer negotiations in the first quarter. In Latin America, we continue to expect EBIT margin of approximately 7% as the compressor weakness we experienced in Q1 subsides and we continue to benefit from favorable price mix and cost takeout in the appliance business. Finally, we continue to expect to deliver approximately 5% margin in Asia, but continued strong performance in India and improved price mix and cost takeout in China.","Before we get to our free cash flow guidance, I would like to provide some additional color on our tax rate assumptions. As Marc mentioned, we are revising our tax rate guidance to approximately 20%. As we said last quarter, there continues to be potential for changes through provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other legislative actions. Although we do not expect the rate to be lower than our current guidance, we will continue to assess and provided updates throughout the year as necessary.","Turning to Slide 16, we review our free cash flow guidance for 2018. Overall, we continue to expect to deliver $1 billion to $1.1 billion this year. We continue to expect higher cash earnings year-over-year. We remain focused on reducing inventory to drive working capital improvement this year. In total, we continue to expect to drive significantly higher free cash flow this year and achieve our cash conversion goal.","Turning to Slide 17, we show our capital allocation priorities for 2018. We remain committed to our balanced approach to capital allocation. We raised our quarterly dividend for the sixth consecutive year, which is a reflection of our confidence in the business. Early this morning as Marc mentioned, we announced the planned sale of our Embraco compressor business unit. In light of the related deal negotiations we temporarily paused our share repurchase program during the first quarter. We have secured financing of an amount similar to the transaction amount and we intend to execute a modified Dutch auction tender offer of up to $1 billion under our current share repurchase authorization with an anticipated purchase price not less than $150 per share and not more than $170 per share subject to market conditions. Following the completion of the tender offer, we intend to continue repurchasing shares on the open market in the second half of 2018. Overall, we remain committed to returning strong levels of cash to shareholders this year. Now, we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh","Good morning, Marc. God morning, Jim. How are you?","Marc Bitzer","Good morning, Sam.","Sam Darkatsh","Two questions. First off, with respect to the guidance and recognizing it\u2019s excluding the accretive effects of the Dutch auction, if I look at your individual line items it would seem as though you should be raising guidance, so it looks like your tax rate incrementally might be a $1 benefit, pricing might be an incremental $0.50 benefit, then this is offset by raw material inflation of $0.50 and offset by global volumes of $0.30, that comes to $0.70 all-in unless I am missing something material. So, why wouldn\u2019t you raise your guidance range for the year to reflect that or at least the midpoint?","Marc Bitzer","Sam, let me maybe take that and Jim can add to this one. So, first of all, stepping back also in Q1 we would say our business is on track and we told you in January we talked about the pricing actions, we talked about fixed cost actions. We delivered on both these big parameters and we delivered an all-time record Q1, which \u2013 but gives us the confidence our business is on track. I do agree with you, but if you take the individual components you come to the high-end or even above our margin guidance, at the same time and we alluded to this one in the script, there are still some aggregate risks out there in the form of \u2013 there is still uncertainty about what happens this tariffs so-called Section 301. There is still a little bit uncertainty out there on tax rates. So there are still some aggregate risks and that\u2019s why we kind of at this point we wouldn\u2019t raise the guide, but having said that, we are highly confident in the business, but actions are on track and in a certain way, you also got to look at the tender auction as we feel very confident of our business. That\u2019s why we grow up with a very significant buyback of our shares.","Sam Darkatsh","Which leads me to my second question why the modified Dutch, clearly if it\u2019s under $150 that\u2019s even more attractive to buy the stock and then over $170 you spent most of 2017 buying the stock at or above $170, so why even bother with the range?","Jim Peters","Yes. So, Sam this is Jim. We looked at the different mechanisms and we believe that the modified Dutch tender offer is the most efficient and effective way to repurchase the large amount of shares very quickly in the market. It\u2019s beneficial to both us and the shareholders in the way that we do it. And again, it sets the price, it was pretty close to today\u2019s trading price and then with a range on it that we feel as will be effective in terms of achieving what we want to achieve from a capital allocation perspective.","Sam Darkatsh","Okay, thank you.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question just to talk a little bit about margins and margin guidance for the year, I guess another way some people might be looking at the guidance with some of the math in terms of the share repurchase in that let\u2019s say $0.70 movement when you exclude the reduction from lower sales. Some people are focusing on the fact that your margins by region are approximately and to the extent that you are truly still looking at the midpoint and working off of that math that the approximately of the different regional margin guidance could now be kind of at the lower end of a range to the extent that when you say roughly 7% or roughly 2% for Europe, that implies somewhat of a little bit of movement or cushion within that number? So, in response to that, Marc, you just kind of said if you do the math you could get to the higher end of the range, it is early in the year, but given for example that Europe is starting off a little bit more in the whole than we were expecting, for example, is that a fair way to look at it as well that perhaps some of these margin ranges are coming in perhaps a little bit at the lower end or are you really saying that you are likely to be at the upper end of the $14.50 to $15.50 range?","Marc Bitzer","Yes, Michael, it\u2019s Marc. First of all, as I have said earlier, I would rob a point to broader global aggregate risk again as the biggest one still buries the uncertainty about raw material even though I mentioned the Section 301 which is more North America topic, but in reality, raw material weighs pretty heavily in all parts of our regional business \u2013 our global businesses. So, I think that\u2019s the prime reason why we still on see certain factors out there, certain risk element. At the same time are also very transparent there is also some upside opportunities, which we want to see how that plays out throughout the year. So, yes \u2013 and again I can only repeat to what I said with them, you take the components of which we are pretty highly confident you probably come to a higher part of the range, but at this point and early in the year, there is uncertainties out there, we don\u2019t want to raise the guidance.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. No, I appreciate that. I guess just secondly I believe you mentioned earlier in the script that the first half earnings or EPS would approximate what you have done in the past and just some quick math it looks like the last 2 years you can take a range and the numbers \u2013 the numbers can vary, but just over the last 2 years, it looks like the first half EPS was around in a 42%, 43% which would place 2Q EPS around 3.50 if you were using the midpoint of the full year guidance. Just wanted to make sure that math is right and that\u2019s kind of what you are effectively saying about 2Q?","Jim Peters","Yes. I mean, Michael and obviously we don\u2019t give specific quarterly guidance, but you as I said on the last call is we do believe the first half of the year to be in line with prior years. And even if you look at the last 2 years or you look over a larger window over the last 5 to 6 years, you are in the low to mid 40s range there so in the percentage that you are talking about. And as we said, we expect to be around that percentage in terms of seasonality of earnings for this year very similar to the last 5 years.","Marc Bitzer","And just to clarify, but it\u2019s not misunderstood and Jim referred to similar to last year, we of course talk about the dispersion of profits we delivered in Q1 $0.30 above last year and you know what our full year guidance is and I would say Q2 is directionally along the same trends.","Operator","Our next question is from David MacGregor of Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Yes. Good morning.","Marc Bitzer","Hi, David.","David MacGregor","I wonder if we could just talk about pricing in North America and you referenced the kitchen price increase that began in the first quarter. I guess, the question would be is there more to come from that particular price increase in 2Q kind of maybe comment about where you were on a exit basis at the end of the quarter in terms of traction and just how much more upside there could be to that? And then also on pricing, I guess what are you assuming within the 1% guidance for North American price mix?","Marc Bitzer","David, it\u2019s Marc. So, first of all, on the North America pricing and I can\u2019t comment on forward pricing, but I can comment about what we already announced. Obviously in January, you felt pricing we started implementing and executing with price increase in the kitchen side and we \u2013 as you also know we announced the laundry pricing, which is kind of in effect as of April 10 or April 7 which of course we do expect to have a material positive impact on Q2 going forward. Now, one thing which we also communicated and met no new news we \u2013 I would say on the kitchen side, what we are seeing as pause in Q1 is not necessarily the end of the road. What I mean with that is we have introduced and are introducing a major new kitchen suite for Whirlpool brand and that\u2019s only now ramping up. That\u2019s a great innovative product and it gives us quite a bit of mixed opportunities and that\u2019s of course gives us further confidence that we get the pricing what we have in mind.","David MacGregor","The kitchen price increase actually got traction fairly late in the quarter I believe. So, it would suggest that there is maybe more upside there, it just seems given the magnitude of the kitchen or the laundry tariffs combined with what you are doing in kitchen that you maybe being very cautious in terms of your price mix?","Marc Bitzer","And again, David, just \u2013 so don\u2019t take, first of all, we don\u2019t give regional PMR guidance, we have given the company guidance. Having said that, you are correct, I mean, Q1 PMR in North America is not reflective of what we would expect on a full year, but we also recognized we are living in a highly competitive environment, but we are very confident behind the actions we have taken.","David MacGregor","Okay. Just follow-up question on Europe, I guess inflection point is really what I am trying to get to, are we going to see an inflection in the second quarter or I know Jim had talked a little bit about some manufacturing things that are going on in 3Q. It just seems like to get it to a 2% number for the full year you got to kind of get to a 2% number in the second quarter. Am I thinking about that the right way?","Jim Peters","Yes, David. I will start and then Marc can kind of add some commentary if he wants to it. I think you should expect it to the inflection point more closer to midyear. You know as I mentioned with some of the trade partner renegotiations we have done, we will begin gaining back some floor spots within the second quarter and expect the volumes to recover in the second half of the year additionally with previously announced cost-based pricing actions that we have taken and the cost takeout that we have done at this point in time there being more than offset by raw material inflation. So, we expect to see that through the second quarter, but then the volumes to pickup in the third quarter and that\u2019s where the inflection point should be around midyear.","Marc Bitzer","And David just to add to Jim\u2019s point, of course we don\u2019t like wherever European business is and we all have a different expectation. At the same time, we didn\u2019t change the full year guidance. If you want to look at any positive in the European business in Q1, it is the underlying pricing actually has been very significantly positive. So, we took strong pricing actions. And despite the significant volume drop which as you know typically hurts you a lot from a production base, we still had a positive cost takeout, so kind of take the core business, deposit pricing cost that gives you at least a little bit of more promising sign. At the same time and what Jim mentioned is at the end of the day over the last 1.5 years of our integration challenges, supply chain challenges, we lost a lot of floor spots and we are slowly regaining them, every month just a little bit better, but it\u2019s \u2013 I would more expect it towards the midpoint of the year, but we see regional inflection points.","Operator","Our next question is from Susan Maklari of Credit Suisse.","Susan Maklari","Thank you. Good morning.","Marc Bitzer","Good morning.","Susan Maklari","First question is around the cost-cutting and the benefits that you are clearly starting to see from the actions you took last year. I guess can you just give us a bit of an update on where that stands? And then as we think about inflation to continuing to come through how much more can you do there and may be if there is any geographical differences that we should be thinking about with that?","Marc Bitzer","Susan, it\u2019s Marc. So, first of all, also stepping back, but the fixed cost reduction which we referred to, that is our $150 million net fixed cost reduction, which is in addition to ongoing cost productivity efforts. On the fixed cost reduction, we mentioned that already in January, we did already or initiated lot of actions in Q4 and I would say pretty much completed most actions by kind of end of February in Q1. So, what you see in the Q1 numbers is part of that effect, but not in full effect, but very important thing is such the actions have already been taken, so it\u2019s already behind us. So, you would see some ongoing benefit through the rest of the year and that\u2019s fixed cost. We know it, I mean, but there is certainty. Now to your other question about of course, there are inflation trends throughout the world. And I also want to use this as an opportunity, because I think if there has been some confusion outside, whenever we give raw material guidance, we take a forward look, we don\u2019t take spot look and then we look at the raw material. So, whenever we change our raw material guidance in a certain way, it\u2019s changed against our forward-looking perspective. So, yes in our forward-looking perspective, we have already certain inflation baked in. If it would be more, which at this point, you cannot exclude, of course, we would try to further increase the cost actions, but there are certain limits. So, of course \u2013 there are certain limits, but we will initiate initial cost actions.","Susan Maklari","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just following up on the inflation I know that you cited steel was a really big factor in the higher or raising that number, but can you give us a little bit of color on what you are seeing in terms of resins and maybe some of your other inputs?","Marc Bitzer","Yes, I can add to this. So, first of all, as most of you know, steel and resins are highest \u2013 our biggest raw material inputs and steel had seen a significant climb, even though it\u2019s now reasonably stable, but it\u2019s U.S. steel is right now significantly elevated versus rest of the world and that\u2019s just a reality. And resins have been elevated now pretty much for three quarters and now obviously with oil price at $70 that just puts further pressure, but we don\u2019t see massive new moves on the go forward base, but it\u2019s also outside steel and resins, aluminum is a factor, zinc is a factor, copper is a factor. Now, again, our current assumptions above the rest of the year are baked in our raw material guidance about the forward-looking view. And at this point, that\u2019s our best view on the future.","Operator","We will take our next question from Curtis Nagle of Bank of America.","Curtis Nagle","Great. Thanks very much. Just beginning on the raw material pressure, I guess should we consider or should we I guess expect to consider around 65 to 70 mil a quarter or would you expect to see maybe even price increase in 2Q and then a tail off in the back half of the year?","Marc Bitzer","Curtis, it\u2019s Marc. First of all, we experienced almost $80 million of raw material in Q1, so we had a significant amount of raw material already in Q1. So in a certain way, if you take our full year guidance, we already took a big chunk in Q1 and we were able to mitigate it. Initiated price actions and cost take out actions. So, on a go forward, we should expect to see more benefits from pricing, but on the raw material year-over-year on a quarterly basis will be very similar to maybe a little bit less towards the year end, but the next couple of quarters very similar to Q1.","Curtis Nagle","Okay. That makes sense. And then just I guess could you provide a little more guidance on what you guys are expecting on the interest and sundry line. It looks like that was a positive for the quarter. I don\u2019t think you gave it guidance? And yes, I mean, how much is that factored for the quarter and for the quarter in the going margin expectations for 2018?","Marc Bitzer","So, Curtis, one thing to \u2013 there is actually a simple change that goes into there is that the way that you used as we mentioned the credit that we monetized in Latin America, those actually under the accounting rules used to sit on a different line and they now go into there. So, with the amount that I gave you earlier that you can help use that to just normalize what you should expect that line to be, but that\u2019s what the difference would have been.","Curtis Nagle","Okay, thanks very much.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks, Curtis.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Ken Zener of KeyBanc Capital.","Ken Zener","Good morning, gentlemen.","Marc Bitzer","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zener","Can you guys talk to the shift down in sales guidance and the margin? So, my first question is, is the sales split equally between Europe and the U.S. given the margin impact of 7.5% seems to be an average of the region? And then my second question is to the extent the sales is coming down the U.S. Can you talk about the decision to forgo sales to protective margin given what seems to be the strength in your portfolio? Thank you.","Jim Peters","So, Ken, I will start off and then I will have Marc kind of add some commentary here. As we look across at the kind of the reduction in revenue outlook globally and look across the globe, I would say that it\u2019s not heavily weighted significantly more heavily weighted to one region another. Obviously, within EMEA, we do see the volumes lower as we mentioned earlier in the first half of the year, but we do expect to recover some of that in the back half of the year. Additionally within North America what you would saw especially in the U.S., the first quarter from an industry perspective was stronger \u2013 was significantly stronger and we still do expect our industry guidance of 2% to 3% for the full year. So, again, we expect that to normalize itself out throughout the year. So, I can\u2019t say that I would skew that either heavily to any specific region at this point in time.","Marc Bitzer","Yes. Ken, the only other comment which I would make in the components of our updated guidance, I think at the end of the day, without getting to the details of numbers, what you got to read into is the strong reconfirmation of what we gave in Q1. We will drive for margin expansion and the cash generation. That\u2019s our number one focus. In particular, after last year where we had a margin drop, our number one focus is margin expansion. We don\u2019t necessarily want to lose market share, but our number one focus is margin expansion.","Ken Zener","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Alvaro Lacayo of Gabelli & Company.","Alvaro Lacayo","Good morning. I just have a question on unit productivity both in North America and in Europe and in \u2013 with North America, the question is what kind of an impact that the washer load-ins from competitors have on Q1 and is it over? And then maybe if you could provide unit productivity, excluding the washer business to see what kind of an impact that had in overall in North America? And in Europe just the minus 14 regarding the trader negotiations, was that in line with what you are expecting or was it a little bit more elevated? And then in the back half, is it correct to assume that you expect to grow above the industry growth rates as you recover some of that volume?","Marc Bitzer","Let me try to address both questions. First of all, on North America, on the washers and first of all, I would say as we indicated several times, there was a lot of odd movement when you look at the AHAM industry statistics, because it\u2019s kind of \u2013 it\u2019s a sell-in, i.e., included, it\u2019s not necessarily a sell-through. The sell-through over time will follow, but the AHAM is very much a sell-in and it\u2019s as such impacted by shipments of us and certain competitors and certain trade moves in there in terms of how much trade inventory is being carried. With that in mind and we hinted towards this one already in January, but we didn\u2019t yet have the data. The stockpiling by LG and Samsung was massive on unprecedented levels even higher than any prior case and has dramatically dropped off in February. So, it\u2019s kind of \u2013 it\u2019s probably the extreme case of stockpiling which we have seen. So as such confirmed what we had \u2013 what we predicted, but once you see the data, it\u2019s been very significant. And of course, that has certain impact on AHAM market shares kind of December January on how it all shows up. We expect it will, but we don\u2019t know, but it will take some time until that is kind of being fully sold through in the market, but that is to your point, that has an impact on laundry volumes, laundry market share and has a couple of other movements in there. Having said that, our laundry business has still been sold in Q1, we have a set of good innovations in the markets. We implemented a price increase and we feel confident about it.","Now to your second question about Europe, as Jim alluded to there are certain private label volumes which we knew we didn\u2019t want to continue. So, a certain amount of a drop is expected and was actually productive in a certain way, but having said that, there was also something on top and that is just we lost floor spot over the last 1.5 years and it\u2019s just hard to get that back. In addition, we had following the European calendar of trade negotiations, we had a whole set of trade negotiations in particular in Russia, UK and also in other markets where we had to renegotiate certain trade terms which we were not \u2013 we felt were not favorable and that dragged on pretty much until March, but we have it resolved now.","Alvaro Lacayo","Got it. And then with the sale of the compressor business, was that included in the original guidance when you guys gave Q4 guidance and I assume whatever operating margin impact is already included now, if it wasn\u2019t in Q4 just want to clarify that?","Jim Peters","And I\u2019d say prior to this, there was no assumption in terms of the sale of Embraco. Additionally, as we have said, the transaction should close closer to the end of this year. And so at this point, it really won\u2019t have a material impact on 2018. Additionally as we have said once we have gone through the tender offer process around the share repurchase that we are doing associated with this. We will come back and update our guidance to reflect any changes to the number of shares we have repurchased.","Marc Bitzer","And just to echo what Jim was saying, we negotiated for our Q1 with a set of multiple bidders, which is also the reason why we did not buyback shares in Q1. We actually signed it last night if by definition we couldn\u2019t include in the prior guidance. So, Jim\u2019s point is of course if there would be a final closure of a transaction somewhere in Q4, which at this point I will consider unlikely you would see a few cents, but you are literally talking about few cents. If it does include in 18, there is no impact on our guidance whatever. So, it\u2019s not \u2013 I mean we didn\u2019t include it, but I also want to reiterate, we also did not include the impact of a tender offer what it does in our share count and the EPS guidance.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to return the call to Marc Bitzer for closing comments.","Marc Bitzer","Alright. I now like to summarize the key message from this call on Slide 19. We delivered improved EBIT and record ongoing earnings per share in the first quarter and our global price mix and fixed cost initiatives have been successfully implemented and we expect to continue realizing the benefits of those actions throughout the year. We remain committed to returning strong levels of cash to shareholders this year, moved through our increased quarterly dividend and through our increased share repurchases. And finally, consistent with our vision of being the best brand consumer product company in the world, we announced the sale of our Embraco compressor business. This transaction will enable us to fully focus on providing compelling consumer-facing innovation, while returning strong levels of cash to our shareholders. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter earnings call on July 24.","Operator","This does conclude Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s first quarter 2018 earnings release call.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Joe Lovechio.","Joseph Lovechio","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation first quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Presidents, Mike Todman and Marc Bitzer; as well as Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and other periodic reports, as well as in the appendix of the presentation.","Turning to Slide 3, we want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 35 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us here today. As you saw in our earnings release from earlier this morning, we are very pleased with the progress that we made in the first quarter. Despite some challenging global markets and foreign currency impacts, we were able to deliver our fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth and our ninth consecutive quarter of expanded margins, which in total resulted in a record first quarter operating profit.","We have been able to do that while at the same time we're increasing our investments in our business to continue this profitable growth trend going forward. Overall, we're firmly on track and remain confident in delivering our operating profit margin guidance, our earnings per share, and our free cash flow guidance for 2014.","If you turn to Slide 6, I'll summarize our financial results, starting with, excluding the impact of foreign currency, our revenues were up 6% versus last year. Our ongoing business earnings per diluted share were up approximately 12% to $2.20 compared to $1.97 last year.","Next I'll turn to Slide 7, where our regional industry demand assumptions or forecasts that we gave you earlier have not changed. For North America, specifically in the U.S., despite a challenging first part of the quarter, we remain confident in our industry demand assumption of 5% to 7% demand growth for the year, as we expect growth in U.S. housing for the full year, increased demand related to the replacement cycle of appliances, and significant improvement in discretionary demand that we're currently seeing improving.","In Europe, we continue to expect flat to up 2% industry for the full year as the region has stabilized and now is beginning to recover. And for Latin America for the full year, we expect a flat industry, which is unchanged. And finally, our Asia forecast remains flat to up 3%, but varies significantly across the region.","So in total, we do continue to expect positive global demand for the full year. Overall, we remain confident in the underlying drivers of our business and our focus on multiple paths to drive profitable growth. Our confidence in these areas has allowed us to significantly increase our investments in parts of our business, continue our profitable growth trend, as well as enhancing our returns to shareholders, as demonstrated by our recently announced 20% dividend increase and the new $500 million share repurchase authorization.","So at this point in time, I'll turn it over to Marc Bitzer. Marc?","Marc Bitzer","Thanks Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Slide 9 by reviewing North America's performance in the first quarter. Starting with the top line, in spite of flat industry driven mainly by the extreme weather in January and February, our unit volumes were up approximately 4% as we gained market share in the quarter. Net sales of $2.3 billion for North America were also up compared to the prior year period and up 5% excluding currency. We saw gross margins expand by 60 basis points in the quarter due to higher sales and ongoing productivity, more than offsetting higher material costs and unfavorable currency. We also increased our investments for our brand marketing and support of new product launches to drive continued growth.","Our ongoing business operating margins were up approximately 10% for the quarter and a record first quarter ongoing business operating profit of $228 million compared to $218 million in the first quarter of 2013. The consistent and disciplined execution of our actions resulted in the fourth quarter of year-over-year revenue growth and the 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year ongoing business operating margin improvement.","Now let me take a moment to talk about our expectations for 2014 as shown on Slide 10. While extreme weather created a temporary softness in U.S. appliance demand in January and February of this year, we've already seen a significant increase in March [indiscernible] industry up almost 9% and we continue to see positive trends in April. Additionally, we remain optimistic about both new construction and existing home sales, and we see increased demand from normal replacement purchases as well as discretionary purchases driven by improving consumer confidence. So we remain confident in our 2014 industry guidance of up 5% to 7% for the year, and in addition we expect positive net cost productivity for our business.","We continue our focus on launching innovative new products, especially in the second and third quarters of this year. During this quarter, we also have a few examples of how we're driving growth beyond our core business, with our EveryDrop Water Filter and the expansion of our Greenville, Ohio plant to increase our capacity for small domestic appliances, just to name a few.","Turning to Slide 11, you can see an example of our increased investments in marketing, technology and products, as we highlight a new phase of dependability for our Maytag brand with a massive TV and print ad campaign. On this page, you see our durable, reliable and powerful Maytag knobs and handles as well as a couple of [indiscernible] marketing pieces for our Maytag laundry and dishwasher products.","I will now talk to our first quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region as shown on Slide 13. Sales were $720 million compared to $668 million in the prior year. Excluding currency, sales increased approximately 4% for year driven by higher volumes from share gains and growth in our small domestic appliance business. The cost and capacity reduction initiative we put in place last year combined with ongoing productivity helped to deliver another quarter of positive operating profit. The operating profit of $7 million improved by $15 million compared to the prior year period and the operating margins improved 220 basis points.","Now turning to Slide 14, while the market environment in the Eurozone remained somewhat soft, we are seeing some recovery and expect normal seasonality as we progress throughout the year. We expect positive operating profits and margin expansion driven by continued benefit from our ongoing cost productivity programs and our previously announced restructuring initiatives, and we continue to focus on our innovative new product launches and growth beyond our core.","Turning to Slide 15, we're highlighting a new line of gas cooktops with glass surfaces and these cooktops have multiple design to complement a variety of kitchen styles, high power, high efficiency burners to reduce cooking times, and twin and full-coverage grids that allow maximum flexibility for our consumers.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Mike.","Michael A. Todman","Thanks Marc. If you turn to Slide 17, you'll see our Latin America results. In the first quarter, the industry was up 10% while our unit volume grew over 15% as we continue to gain share. Sales for the quarter were $1.2 billion. Excluding currency and BEFIEX, net sales increased approximately 11% compared to the previous year, primarily driven by the higher volume.","GAAP operating profit totaled $123 million compared to $130 million in the prior year period. Our ongoing business operating profit for the quarter totaled $109 million compared to $114 million in the prior year period. Favorable price and mix including price increases and ongoing cost productivity were offset by higher material cost and foreign currency.","Turning to Slide 18 for our expectations of the region. As previously discussed, we expect the second quarter appliance industry can be down due to the World Cup, and given the government elections in Brazil and uncertain impact of inflation on consumer sentiment, we have kept our industry assumption flat for the year. We expect to continue outperforming the industry and growing our revenue, given our strong market position and current competitive environment.","We recently announced the price increase for the second half to help offset negative currency impacts and significant levels of inflation. Our innovative new product launches are winning with consumers and we will continue growing beyond our core business. We remain confident in our Latin America business, and in particular expect improved performance in the second half of this year as we expect to realize the recent price increase benefits and the World Cup and tough currency comps will be behind us.","Slide 19 shows how we continue to capitalize on the opportunities for growth in Brazil. Consumers in Brazil love their soccer and love their beer as well, particularly ice cold beer. The Consul brand is already a leader in refrigeration in the Latin America market, so we are excited to introduce a home beer cooler with a professional cooling system.","Our first quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 21. Net sales during the quarter were $166 million compared to $187 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 4%. Operating profit of $5 million improved by $2 million and operating margins improved 120 basis points compared to the prior year period. Favorable price and mix, including cost based price increases, as well as ongoing cost productivity offset lower unit volumes from a lower industry, increased raw material cost and foreign currency.","Turning to Slide 22, despite challenging market environment, our margin expansion continues as our innovative products drive market share and improved mix and our ongoing productivity actions reduce costs. Additionally, we are on track to become the majority shareholder of Hefei Sanyo to accelerate our growth in the emerging Chinese market. We were pleased to see that Hefei Sanyo recently reported full year 2013 sales of approximately 860 million in U.S. dollars and increase of 33% compared to the prior year and operating income of approximately 60 million over 7% of sales. The transaction remains subject to approval by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, certain other regulatory approvals required by the relevant Chinese authorities and other formalities. We continue to expect the transaction to close anytime between the end of the second quarter and the end of 2014.","Slide 23 shows an example of our product leadership in Asia this quarter where we highlighted the Whirlpool Icemagic refrigerator with best in class ice-making and bottle cooling, a Powercool zone to help consumers keep food safe during power outages common in India, and innovative storage solutions for our consumers' medicines and spices.","Now I would like to turn it over to Larry.","Larry Venturelli","Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone. We are pleased with our first quarter results and are on pace to deliver a record annual performance which we communicated last quarter, as shown on Slide 25. We expect to deliver annual GAAP EPS in the range of $11.05 to $11.55 per share, and annual ongoing business EPS of $12 to $12.50. Our expectations for free cash flow remain at approximately $700 million. Overall, the underlying fundamentals of our business remains strong as evidenced by our continued sales growth and margin expansion as well as a strong balance sheet.","As I speak to the financial results on slides 26 to 28, you will see how we continue to expand our ongoing business operating margin in the first quarter and expect to deliver another balanced approach towards margin expansion resulting in an 8 plus percent margin for the full year 2014. Price mix was up 0.5 point and we continue to expect to realize a 0.5 to 1 point of margin driven by our cost base price increases, innovative new product launches and growth beyond our core business. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives contributed another 0.5 point, consistent with our full year guidance.","For the quarter, our cost productivity more than offset material cost inflation of $52 million to deliver a positive 0.25 point of margin expansion. Our ongoing cost productivity for the year is on track to fully offset approximately $150 million to $200 million of material cost inflation, and is expected to deliver a positive 0.5 point of margin.","As planned and previously communicated, our increased marketing technology and product investments primarily reduced margins by 0.75 points during the quarter, and we expect to have a negative 0.5 point to 1 full point of margin impact for the year. Overall, our first quarter margins were on track with expectations and consistent with our expected full year improvement.","In summary, for the first quarter, ongoing business operating profit increased driven by higher sales, positive price mix, ongoing cost productivity and the benefit from the cost and capacity reductions, more than offsetting higher material cost, currency and investments in marketing, technology and products.","As we said back in January, we expect a stronger second half as productivity ramps up, Latin America price increases take effect, and World Cup and tough first half currency comparisons are behind us. Our continued margin improvements, combined with positive revenue growth enable us to deliver double-digit improvement in ongoing business earnings per share.","The graph on Slide 29 illustrates expenses associated with our cost and capacity reduction initiative. The actions we have been taking over the past couple of years and into 2014 represent a generational change to our footprint in cost structure. As mentioned last quarter, we took additional cost and capacity reduction actions to address the soft but recovering European market and to continue to expand our margins. For the year, we continue to expect approximately $100 million of charges and $80 million of ongoing benefits.","As we continue to improve margins and grow revenues, our plans to deploy the cash generated from our business are solid, as shown on Slide 30. We will fund the business for growth including capital expenditures between $625 million and $675 million. Last week, our Board approved the 20% increase in the quarterly dividend to $3 per share on an annual basis. Our Board also approved the new $500 million share repurchase authorization. Finally as Mike mentioned, we are on track with our acquisition of majority stake in China's Hefei Sanyo. The proceeds from our recent bond offering will be used to pay off $600 million of maturing debt during Q2 and Q3 that was for the acquisition of Hefei Sanyo.","In summary, given our profitable growth trends, increased investment capacity and strong balance sheet, we will balance funding for all aspects of our business to ensure the best long-term value creation for our shareholders. Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","Thanks Larry. Let me turn to Slide 32, where I'll summarize. Again, we continue to grow our revenue and expand our margins. With our innovative solutions for consumers, we are winning the marketplace and we are well-positioned to capitalize on positive global demand trends. As Larry and Mike mentioned, the Hefei Sanyo acquisition is progressing and provides an opportunity for transformational growth for us in China.","We also continue to make investments and see very good growth in our beyond the core businesses are expand and extend, and in total as a result, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver a record year of performance in 2014, but equally important is our ability to continue to build upon this revenue growth, margin and earnings momentum to deliver medium and long-term shareholder value.","Finally, I turn to Slide 33 which is our roadmap for growth and value creation, and I would just say we are very confident that we're executing in line with our long-term growth strategy. We are appropriately investing in our business and enhancing returns to our shareholders. As I said previously, as we achieve our 8% plus operating margin target and close the Hefei Sanyo transaction, we will provide updates to our shareholder value creation targets at the appropriate time later in the year. In the meantime, we'll continue to execute this strategy to ensure the best long-term value creation for our shareholders.","So with that, I will conclude our formal remarks and we'll open this up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We'll go first to David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David MacGregor - Longbow Research","I wonder if we could just talk about Latin America for a moment, I'm just trying to understand some of the moving parts here. You say the volumes were up about 15% against the 10% industry number, which is looks like you're holding your share gains down there, which is great to see. Revenue excluding FX up about 11%. But you say as well in your slide that the price increases are offsetting inflation and currency. Is it possible that price increases were achieved became the 4% difference between those numbers shy of FX?","Michael A. Todman","David, let me answer that. We took a price increase earlier on in the year at the beginning of the year, and now we were just executing a second price increase. So what we're expecting is the combination of all these price increases will offset all of the currency impact. But we're also looking to offset inflation, and inflation in the environment has been high. And so the price increase will offset both of those.","David MacGregor - Longbow Research","Your competitor earlier this morning talked about a 15% revenue growth in Latin America and said it was attributable almost entirely to price mix not volume. Can you help us understand the discrepancy?","Larry Venturelli","David, this is Larry. I think again what you're seeing is a little bit similar to what we saw in the quarter last year is, you got to remember on the unit side that we just have appliance units in there, we have a compressor and an appliance business. So what you're essentially seeing is the fact, if we were to combine both units from compressors and appliances and then calculate the ASVs on there, you would see the combined businesses being very positive. So it's just the abnormality we have as we're just reporting appliance units and not compressor units.","Jeff M. Fettig","David, this is Jeff. I just want to add one last point. I think you know there are three pieces of our Latin America business, Brazil appliance, the appliance market outside, 32 markets outside of Brazil, and our global compressor business, and of that it was under different conditions and Brazil appliance business is going very strong, very well, a large nation with countries like Argentina and Venezuela, et cetera, has been very unpredictable, and the global compressor business particularly because of China has been I would say weak in the first quarter but we're starting to see recovery as we go forward. So it's a number of these things but the biggest part, Brazil, we had a very good quarter.","David MacGregor - Longbow Research","Thank you for that detail. Could I just ask you to elaborate a little further on your observation as April has been good in the United States?","Marc Bitzer","David, it's Marc Bitzer, and let me expand the April comment more into the first quarter or so, not forward but backwards. As you well know, January and February was impacted very strongly by weather and quite still a lot of trade inventory moves. We've seen in March a very strong demand by way of both sell-in and sell-out, and we pretty much see almost the same level of strong momentum in marketplace throughout April, both sell-in and sell-out, which gives us a lot of confidence.","David MacGregor - Longbow Research","And can you speak to the builder business as part of that or is it retail, I mean just could you distinguish between those two elements?","Marc Bitzer","No, I mean, David, first of all, it's both, but be also clear we saw \u2013 if you go back further in time, Q3, Q4, we saw exceptional strong momentum in builder business that by definition came down a little bit in January and February because of the momentum and you just could not complete certain houses and never \u2013 you know our appliances come in pretty much last, so you saw a little bit of dip on this one, but our builder business also in Q1 and the builder market from what we see has been up in solid single digits to high single digits.","David MacGregor - Longbow Research","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Rehaut, JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","First question I had was on North American margins, a little bit up year-over-year but down sequentially, and I think in the past couple of years, I guess from a seasonality standpoint, sometimes it's up sequentially 4Q to 1Q, sometimes it's down, so I was wondering if you could highlight if there were any drivers on a sequential basis that took you down from the 11% that you did in the back half of '13 and also in 4Q itself down to a little under 10%, if those are kind of temporary, if you would expect to kind of get back to that 11% run rate that you did in the second half of last year?","Marc Bitzer","Michael, it's Marc Bitzer. First of all, to make a long story short, we see the same strength for our margin in Q1 as we saw in Q4. Typically, what you expect between Q4 and Q1 is a slight dip in margins that comes largely from the seasonality of certain product types. It's less when you would for example see in Europe or other markets, but there is a small dip what you historically see.","The other thing which I want to highlight or point towards also, and I made reference about it in the script, our margins in Q1 year-over-year, the gross margin is up 60 basis points, and you see that also that is offset largely by the brand investments. Most brand investments are also up sequentially even versus Q4 because we simply ramped up this massive Maytag campaign. So long story short, I mean our margin momentum I would say continues that strength.","Jeff M. Fettig","And I would just add and again we're not going to dwell. The only surprise we saw at all in the first quarter what we talked about in January and February. We went from an industry which was running high single digit to low double digit in the last six months of last year to January February combined was like negative 5, and as soon as we got out of the challenging weather conditions in half the country, we went right back to the run rate industry demand before. So that was really the only difference. Our decision to invest more in new products and brand investment is very consistent with our strategy. We didn't stop any of those because of Jan-Feb shortfalls in volume because these were more long-lasting and these will fuel further revenue growth for us.","Larry Venturelli","Michael, it's Larry. Just keep in mind, when you look at volumes in North America Q4 to Q1, volumes are 20% to 25% lower in Q1. So you're just not getting the same leverage.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks for that help. And also on Latin America, just trying to get arms around the timing of the price increase, if that's something that you expect to go into effect in 2Q or is that more of a second half event, and as the flowing through of inflation and currency continues to impact that business, certainly on a year-over-year it was a solid, still solid result, but in terms of 2Q itself, given the timing of the price increase, et cetera, some of the cost, would you expect margins to dip a little bit in that quarter and then rebound in the back half of the year, just trying to get a sense of the timing?","Michael A. Todman","Michael, it's Mike. The price increase has already been announced and it will go into effect throughout the second quarter. So we'll likely see the real benefits of that price increase in the second half of the year. In terms of, and we stated, our experience has been this World Cup means that we're going to have lower demand in the second quarter, and so as you pointed out, yes, we do expect margins to be slightly lower but we expect a very strong second half as we both recover on the volume slide as well as the full impact of the price increases.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","Great, appreciate it, thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Denise Chai with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Denise Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So just want to follow-up on your North America SG&A, you mentioned the Maytag campaign, so will we see that kind of spend continuing in the coming quarters or was that really a drag on SG&A in the first quarter because it's a small quarter and also it was weather impacted?","Marc Bitzer","Denise, it's Marc Bitzer. First of all, also let me elaborate on SG&A and that is consistent with what we said earlier. If you look \u2013 if you will break down our SG&A into two components, one, call it infrastructure which is basically the [indiscernible] fixed cost [indiscernible] revenue generation which is [indiscernible] by investments, we held in North America our infrastructure expense as flat for the last two or three years and we will not change that going forward. So we will have a strong \u2013 we had a strong focus on maintaining that fixed cost for that.","So the thing which we basically did is we dialled up our brand investments and [indiscernible] Maytag launch, we also have significant amount of product launches in Q2 and Q3 of a magnitude which we probably haven't seen in a long time, and that will be supportive by rev gen.","Now having said that, let me get back to Larry's point, we have these brand investments, of course on a low volume base, you lose just some of the leverage, and that's by definition, but I mean with the revenues growing Q2 and Q3, that will probably somewhat change [indiscernible].","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, Denise. So what you expect is \u2013 no, this wasn't a one quarter, this was kind of the rate we're spending. We had a very low demand quarter. As a percent of sales, it will likely decrease with the same dollar spend.","Denise Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, got it. And then, were there any kind of direct one-off costs from weather disruptions given the factory closures and the fact that you couldn't even ship out of that ladder for over a week, were those material?","Marc Bitzer","Denise, again it's Marc. First of all, that may be specific to [indiscernible]. We were not only impacted by consumers, but keep in mind we have a majority of factors up north. So, we have a lot of production in Ohio. Yes, indeed, it was very hard to get trucks out of Ohio which had a temporary impact on our logistic cost and [indiscernible] supply chain will always cost you something. It's not a huge [indiscernible] but it involves a one-time impact probably around $10 million to $20 million.","Denise Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you. Just one last one, you gave us the North America gross margin. Can you give us some sense of the other regions please?","Larry Venturelli","What was your question?","Denise Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Gross margins in other regions besides North America?","Larry Venturelli","I mean I think what you saw across the regions, as Marc just mentioned, international margin is also up. So what you're seeing is the benefit from the price mix improvement in the international businesses that have been able to offset a lot of the material cost inflation and FX that we have. So I would say globally very consistent to what Marc talked about in the North America picture.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ken Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets","So, no good deed goes unpunished. You beat AHAM but [took out] (ph) margins. So I just want us to walk through what I think you already said. Marc, you just said $10 million to $20 million hit from weather, is that correct?","Marc Bitzer","Yes, that's what we said.","Ken Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Would that be considered \u2013 hopefully one time, but that would be a sequential benefit, right, to whatever the run rate is?","Larry Venturelli","That would be correct.","Ken Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Now the $10 million to $20 million hit that you just described, does that represent more of a margin drag if you will or the cause for lack of margin expansion, is that greater than the SG&A investments that you just described, given your 60 basis point improvement in gross margin, just trying to get a sense of magnitude here?","Marc Bitzer","Ken, it's Marc Bitzer. Obviously you can do the math. If SG&A went up 0.5 points, on the revenue base you can do the math. So by definition, it's even the ballpark is much likely less and [indiscernible] logistics cost is slightly less. I mean logistics cost technically flows into our gross margins. So that is not showing up in the fixed cost, that is in the variable cost.","Jeff M. Fettig","Ken, this is Jeff. If you start back, take a global look and go down the key drivers of our business, volume was a little bit weaker than we expected, largely due to the U.S. that we talked about. We know, we've seen that [indiscernible]. So that's \u2013 we don't see any other big changes around the world. Price mix, we were up I think 0.5 point, we've guided for the year to 0.5 point to 1 point, and with some of the cost based price increases that are kicking in, we still feel very good about that.","Next one, productivity. As always, our productivity ramps up throughout the year. That will be especially true this year where we had a weak demand in the first quarter or so, that's a negative productivity, so a return to normal demand plus our normal ramp up during the year productivity will be a big lever. Restructuring benefits, those will flow and we got them in the first quarter and those will flow throughout the year.","The offset is increased brand and product investment, but in total, the walk if you will from last year to this year, we remain confident in delivering our 8 plus percent margin for the whole year. So by definition, yes, our run rate will increase.","Ken Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thank you. If we look at the \u2013 well, let me ask about your cash flow because I think we're getting to the point now that investors are getting more focused on that, as you are, with the pending Hefei acquisition as well as the announced share buyback, now you guys did some buybacks last year but it was mostly for share options if you will, could you comment on how much of that $500 million is dedicated to net share repurchases, A, and then B, given that you talked about Hefei on the call here and you did mention China in relation to your compression being kind of weak, could you just start giving us a context so investors have some context when you guys do acquire the company for what is happening in China and we can start getting used to your language for that region? Thank you.","Jeff M. Fettig","Ken, this is Jeff. I go back to use of cash, investing in the business which we're doing at an interest rate, paying down debt [indiscernible] et cetera were very predictable on drag, return to shareholder, as we did last year we both increased the dividend and have an authorization for $500 million, and we have the very important M&A in Hefei Sanyo. So, we're very much executing to what we've been communicating is our plan. Last year we purchased $350 million which was by the way our authorization. We don't have any defined time period for the current authorization. We typically fund out of free cash flow generation.","Your question on dilution at today's stock price would probably run around 1 million shares a year dilution. So I mean clearly that's, if done today it would be a net reduction but again that we've done over some period of time, and we really can't give you, as we said in the very beginning I guess last July, that as soon as we close, because this is a publicly traded company, in China we cannot disclose non-public information of Hefei Sanyo.","So, we will not be able to give you all the details of the impact it has on us. I mean you do have the end of the year data point which is clear and shortly after we close or whatever is appropriate, we'll go through in great detail both the impact on earnings standpoint on an ongoing basis, our expectations of growth in earnings and cash.","Ken Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Right, I understand that. I guess just trying to keep the commentary constrained to your current business, you did highlight compressor, when you're talking about Latin America, different business, and you did highlight compressor had some weakness in China, related to China, that's the\u2026","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, Ken, the Chinese market and depends on which product category, but first quarter was weak. There's different data but it was double-digit declines. We don't think that's a forever thing there it's going through, there has been some slowdowns in China. We were comping over a really big previous year of growth. It looks like it's starting to level out. So, yes, China was \u2013 which affected both our compressor business and our appliance business, and Hefei Sanyo has not reported their first quarter yet, so there's nothing we can really say about that.","Ken Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets","I understand. I was just [indiscernible]. And then if you would \u2013 I'll follow-up with you guys offline. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James","Two more broad questions if I might. First about Europe, a few years ago, Jeff, you mentioned that I think you needed about 6% operating margin in order to earn your cost of capital. That was prior to I believe all your restructuring efforts. What margin do you now need to earn your cost of capital in Europe and can you achieve that without further material restructuring and\/or industry consolidation at this point?","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, Sam, that's correct. I think I said 5.5% to 6% given our asset base and so on is where we needed to be. We absolutely believe we can get there and now are starting to show the path to get there, and it's a combination of what I call self-help, what we're doing from a fixed cost reduction in that which is support by the restructuring that we're doing, and by the way getting the benefits for, our ongoing productivity, our investment product innovation, and I think you're starting to see the accelerated growth that we're getting, and absolutely, a stable or modestly growing market will certainly accelerate that. So, we are on track for that. I think we're going to make a very large step forward this year quarter by quarter and every asset that we have has to be able to earn us return and Europe is no different.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James","So to paraphrase then, the 6% or so, 5.5% or 6% is still the necessary bogie and you don't need anything dramatic to happen incremental to prior \u2013 to previously announced actions then?","Jeff M. Fettig","Well, what I've said is that we will take the appropriate cost and capacity and investment decisions needed to do that, and we have, we've announced a number of them. On the go \u2013 I can't tell you go forward what we need to do, but I will say go forward we will get to 5.55 to 6% or hopefully better.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James","Got you. Second question, your U.S. market share, at least domestic market share, was quite good this quarter. You did have an easy comparison on a year-on-year basis. At least directionally, I won't hold you to specificity, but directionally how should we think about your U.S. market share over the next few quarters? Knowing the comps get harder and you're not going to be matching a whole lot of promotional activity but you do have some new products coming and you have a builder mix that's favorable. So how should we directionally think about your market share trends over the next few quarters in the U.S.?","Marc Bitzer","Sam, it's Marc. First of all, pleased to hear the compliment on Q1 markets. I wouldn't call last year's baseline easy in any case, and as you know, we really don't give quarterly guidance on market share. Having said that, our market share is both sequentially and year-over-year up, that is correct. It was not done through promotions or by [indiscernible] activities, what you've seen in gross margin. This basically tells you the product launches, this innovation without overly aggressiveness on promotion, we get to steady good run rate in market share and we're comfortable with current levels.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James","Last question, just real quick. The BEFIEX, I think if my math holds, you will not be recognizing anymore BEFIEX credits this year and are we done or what's the status on that program?","Jeff M. Fettig","Based on what we know today, we did monetize 14 million in the first quarter and right now we would not anticipate anything if it stays for the rest of the year.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James","What's left to be \u2013 what's still unrecognized?","Jeff M. Fettig","There's $53 million left there tied into legal or large that will be settled over the next few years.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James","Very good. Thank you, all.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","On the U.S. market share showed us for some further detail, it seems like the Maytag and the bigger than normal year of the product launches are still in front of you. So talk a little bit about what allowed the share progress in the first quarter, and if I'm correct, there is incremental new product coming to market that should sustain or perhaps expand the market share benefit in 2Q and beyond?","Marc Bitzer","Eric, it's Marc Bitzer again. I mean what we saw in Q1 in particular are still carryovers of largest product launches [indiscernible] particularly top loader line just called [fusion] (ph) and where we're going to help the market share gains. Our cooking products are running extremely well. It's exceptionally strong category, and we said it's also carrying over in Q1. And on top of that you had just the Q1 industry just from the overall industry, and that's impacted by Q4 promotions, and as we said last year, we are not participating that much in aggressive promotions. So you see we expect all of this met [indiscernible] for Q1 lift. But at the same time, you're correct. There is a significant amount of product launches ahead of us in Q2 and Q3 that were based on initial trade partner reactions very confident about.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research","A follow-on on that, if you could give a little bit of color of Maytag which has been around for a while but it seems like you're more excited about the new product efforts and attraction and the response from the trade, can you just frame a little bit of strategically what you're doing with Maytag in terms of channel or price point or position and then also the magnitude of the uptake you're seeing from the channel on these new products?","Marc Bitzer","Eric, it's Marc again. I think to really get into detail, it's probably more subject to a [one point] (ph) investor conference to really show you the entire Maytag value creation strategy. But to basically make it short, I mean the Maytag as a brand still stands for exceptional quality and reliability. I think it's fair to say that the last decade probably and before the Maytag brand [indiscernible] all the product deserves, but this is what we're changing, okay. We have a complete new product line which I think fully represent what the Maytag brand and consumer mind stands for and that is accompanied by a very big brand we launched with both TV and ad.","To be also clear, we started the TV and ad campaign, the products themselves will be launched end of May or early June. So you don't yet see that in the market. But of course we already introduced it to the trade and there is a lot of additional flooring which we will get from this.","Jeff M. Fettig","Okay, well, if there's no more question, I would just like to thank everyone for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you next time. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's program. You may disconnect at this time.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Max Tunnicliff.","Max Tunnicliff","Thank you, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2018 Conference Call. Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the investor section of our website at whirlpool.com.","Before we begin, I'll remind you that as we conduct this call we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and other periodic reports.","We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations.","We also think the adjusted measures will provide you a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask the participants to ask no more than two questions.","With that I'll turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks and good morning everyone. On Slide 3 we show our fourth quarter highlights. As you saw in our press release, we delivered strong results for the quarter, including a record ongoing EPS of $4.75. Excluding currency we delivered revenue growth of 2.5% driven by very strong price mix actions across all regions, as we continued to realize the benefits of the actions we initiated earlier in 2018.","Additionally, our North America region continued to deliver impressive results, driving 5% revenue growth while again expanding EBIT margin 40 basis points despite a soft industry and significant cost inflation.","In Europe, we drove sequential quarterly improvement in volume and EBIT margins which were in line with our expectations, as we began to benefit from previously announced actions directed at returning the region to profitability.","Lastly, I want to remind you that our prior year results included the benefit of certain tax credits in our Latin America region, a 50 basis point positive impact to our fourth quarter 2017 consolidated EBIT margin.","Turning to Slide 4, I will discuss our full year highlights. We delivered solid global results and expanded margins in North America despite a number of challenges such as, softer than anticipated industry, significant cost inflation, trade tariffs and currency volatility.","In total, these challenges amount to an approximately 200 basis point impact. Additionally, our performance in Europe was worse than expected and drove a miss in revenues and margins for the Corporation.","Faced with these challenges, we quickly adapted our plans and took strong actions to address and offset them. These actions included; strong execution of our previously announced cost-base price increases, delivering on our fixed cost reduction initiatives, refocusing and rightsizing our European business, and continuing in our disciplined approach to capital management.","Lastly, we delivered very strong free cash flow of $853 million for the year, driven by disciplined working capital management, including significant improvement in inventory and the favorable timing of certain payments. The actions we took in 2018 coupled with favorable exit rates in Europe gave us confidence that we would deliver results in 2019 that put us back on track to our long-term goals.","Turning to Slide 5, we show further details of our margin performance, which we highlighted on the previous slides. Full-year margins positively benefited from the successful execution of our global price mix and innovative product launches throughout the year, impacting margins by approximately 200 basis points.","Additionally, our previously announced fixed cost reduction actions continue to progress in line with expectations. As a result of a strong price mix and cost reduction actions, we successfully offset the significant raw material, tariff and currency challenges we faced throughout the year.","Now, I'll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results.","James Peters","Thanks Marc, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, I'll review the fourth quarter results for our North America region. We delivered very strong results in the quarter with both revenue growth and margin expansion despite continued challenges in the external environment. Net sales increased 5% despite negative industry demand.","Overall, we expanded our ongoing EBIT margin approximately 40 basis points, as we overcame more than 150 basis points of cost inflation. Our ability to once again deliver strong margin expansion, regardless of external volatility and significant inflation, demonstrates the fundamental strength of our North America business.","Turning to Slide 8, we review the fourth quarter results for our Europe Middle East and Africa region. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales were down 6%, but reflect sequential quarterly improvement. EBIT margins were positively impacted by continued year-over-year price mix improvement, which was more than offset by approximately 225 basis points of cost inflation and currency.","We delivered sequential EBIT improvement as we began to experience the benefits of our actions centered around stabilizing volume. I will provide an update on these and other actions later in the guidance portion of this presentation.","Now, we turn to Slide 9 to review the fourth quarter results for our Latin America region. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales increased approximately 1%, driven by share gains and positive price mix.","Our underlying home appliance business drove EBIT margin expansion which was more than offset by approximately 300 basis points of cost inflation and currency. Also, prior year results were favorably impacted by the sale and monetization of approximately $30 million in certain tax credits.","We now turn to the fourth quarter results for our Asia region, which are shown on Slide 10. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales increased 11%, as we benefited from unit growth and share gains in India. EBIT margins declined as strong price mix was more than offset by raw material inflation and an increase in our bad debt provision.","Now, I would like to turn it back over to Marc to review our guidance.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks Jim. On slide 12, we review our guidance assumptions for 2019. In line with our long-term goals, we expect to drive net sales growth of approximately 3%, adjusted for the divestiture of our Embraco compressor business and the carry over impact of currency.","In addition to previously announced pricing actions, we are bringing innovative and compelling product launches across all regions in 2019 which will positively impact mix.","We expect to deliver ongoing EBIT margins of 6.5% to 6.8%, a 40 basis point increase compared to 2018 and free cash flow of $800 million to $900 million, progressing strongly toward our long term cash conversion goal.","Turning to Slide 13, we highlight the drivers of our ongoing earnings per share expectations of $14 to $15. As you can see on this chart, there are certain elements which make our 2018 ongoing earnings per share not fully comparable to our 2019 EPS guidance.","Most notably is our tax rate assumption of 15% to 20 % compared to 6.6% in 2018 as well as the absence of Embraco business for three quarters of the year. At the same time, the EPS measure has a carryover benefit from share buybacks in 2018, while at this point we have not included a specific number for share buybacks in 2019. The ongoing EBIT margin expansion is expected to drive approximately $1 earnings-per-share growth, which I will discuss in further detail on the next slide.","Turning to Slide 14, we show the drivers of our EBIT margin improvement in 2019. We expect approximately 150 basis point improvement related to continued price mix benefits and net cost improvement of 75 basis points as our fixed and ongoing cost reduction initiatives remain on track.","If macroeconomic pressure is remaining elevated, we continue to expect an increase of approximately $300 million in raw material inflation and tariffs, and would anticipate additional investments in our brands and products in support of upcoming product launches. We are confident that we have put the right actions in place to drive margin expansion in 2019","Now, Jim will cover our regional guidance and cash priorities.","James Peters","Thanks Marc. On Slide 15, we show our regional industry and EBIT margin guidance for the coming year. Starting with industry demand, we anticipate continued economic and trade uncertainty to temper overall demand resulting in moderate but positive industry growth of approximately 1% globally, with the exception of our Latin America region, where we expect a strong improvement in consumer demand. As previously discussed, we expect to deliver margin expansion across every region, driven by price mix actions and strong cost takeout.","Turning to Slide 16, I would like to update you on the strategic actions we announced last quarter to refocus our EMEA business and return to profitability. First, we have taken specific actions to stabilize volume across the core EMEA business. We saw volume improvement in the second half compared to the first half of 2018 and we expect volumes to be positive in the first quarter of 2019.","Discussions with our trade customers are focused on recovering floor spots lost during the peak of the integration. These negotiations began late in the fourth quarter of 2018 with the majority expected to be completed by the end of Q1. Our efforts to refocus marketplace investments toward our most profitable segments are on track to deliver benefits throughout 2019.","Second, looking at the bottom half of the slide, we are on track with the strategic actions we announced last quarter to refocus and right-size our EMEA business. The exit of Turkish domestic sales operations and Hotpoint branded small appliance businesses is in process and is on track to conclude by the end of Q2. And we are actively marketing our South Africa operations for a potential sale. Finally, the previously announced $50 million fixed cost reduction initiative for the region is on track.","As a result of all these actions, we expect to drive approximately $100 million in annualized EBIT improvement in EMEA before exit costs. For 2019, we expect to realize approximately $75 million for this first year of implementation and $100 million in total gross benefits thereafter.","From a quarterly earnings perspective, we anticipate year-over-year EBIT improvement in the first quarter and expect to be around breakeven in the second quarter. We are firmly committed to improving our regional cost structure and restoring profitability in EMEA, placing us back on track toward our long term margin targets for the region.","Turning to Slide 17, I will discuss the drivers of our 2019 free cash flow. We expect cash earnings to positively impact free cash flow as margin expansion is partially offset by the sale of Embraco. Additionally, we remain committed to driving sustainably lower working capital, which is expected to result in $200 million of working capital improvement in 2019. We also anticipate lower cash outlays as major restructuring initiatives wind down.","Lastly, free cash is impacted by several one-time items, which have a neutral impact to cash, overall. These items are explained in more detail in the appendix of the slide presentation. In total, we expect to drive $800 million to $900 million in free cash flow, excluding the anticipated proceeds from the sale of Embraco.","Turning to Slide 18, we show our capital allocation priorities for the year. We remain committed to fully fund the business for growth while maintaining strong cost discipline across all regions. Additionally, we continue to expect to close the sale of Embraco compressor business in early 2019 and use the anticipated proceeds to pay down debt.","Consistent with our balanced approach to capital allocation, we intend to continue share buybacks albeit at a moderate pace, while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet. We are committed to maintaining a strong investment grade rating and optimal capital structure as we target a gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 2.","Now we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mike Dahl","Good Morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to start off on the North America guidance and what you guys are thinking from a price and a volume perspective, just given some of the moving pieces in the industry, tariffs rolling off, new capacity coming online, some of the other items.","Marc Bitzer","Good morning Michael. It's Marc. So, let me maybe just talk a little bit about the 2019 North America guidance. First of all, as you have seen we guide toward a very strong EBIT margin of 12 % plus and we expect the industry to grow approximately 0% to 1%.","Let me just elaborate on both items; with 12%, it's pretty close to where we are already running at 2018. As you have seen also Q4, we had 11.8%. On a GAAP basis, we are even above 12%. So even in the somewhat softer than expected market environment which we experienced in Q4, we are pretty close and we are already running at 12%.","So we are highly confident with 12%-plus. And that is also result of the carryover of a pricing which we had in 2018 and the effects of previously announced price increases in Kitchen segment which came into effect late December.","So there is a significant portion of carryover benefit from a pricing, coupled with what we still expect to be a somewhat inflationary cost environment. But at the same time, we are having confidence that we are getting more and more traction on the cost takeout actions. The combination of that leads to a further expansion of margins.","And on the industry, as you see we are guiding 0% to 1% and that is on the back of what I would say a stable replacement market and housing market which as you have seen in Q3 and Q4 went somewhat sideways, as we also said in the previous earnings call, we are not surprised about the sideway moves of the housing market, we are still fundamentally bullish on the long-term demand driver of US housing market. So - and that probably explains the broader context.","Now particularly with regards to tariffs and I presume you are talking about the laws on tariffs, the 201 tariffs. First of all, as we already indicated, one competitor was already fully kind of live and up and running kind of Q3, Q4, so we wouldn't see any further changed or impacting the marketplace and the other one has been partially online. So I don't expect dramatic changes coming out of this one because we have seen already most of that.","With regards to the other tariffs and that may be also a point of clarification for just the broader guidance. We, at this point, have included the tariffs as they have been announced or as they have been communicated by the government, which also includes the 301 List 3 part, which is supposed to go to 25%, I think early March. So we have fully factored that in, but also recognize, of course, there is a lot of uncertainty or moving parts on the tariff side.","Mike Dahl","Got it, lot of helpful information. And then, just a quick follow up. When thinking about the overall guidance and the different moving pieces in there from the segment region, I think if you look at it from a segment standpoint there is upside to the numbers. So, on a consolidated basis, is there somewhere that you guys are baking in conservatism or is there another moving piece that would help explain how to square away all of these numbers to the consolidated range?","James Peters","Yes. And Michael, this is Jim. I think if you step back from it to begin with, as we give the different range on the regions, obviously there is some rounding that comes in there and all that. So, if you take it perfectly, you may get a little bit higher and lower than our overall range. Second is, we believe overall that guidance is set at the appropriate level. And again, as you look at the different regions, I think that is pretty close to where we expect to be. Outside of that, I think it's just rounding and nothing else in there.","Marc Bitzer","Michael it's Marc, maybe just elaborate a little bit further. First of all, stepping back on the guidance, and I think that is an important thing to note and recognize. As we said in our prepared remarks, the 2019 guidance for EPS is not fully compatible with 2018, because there is a big element which just comes from what I call a more normalized tax rate of 15% to 20% and the absence of Embraco.","So you take these two elements out, that is basic $2.25. So that is, particularly when you look at the broader guidance, is a big element. Underneath that, we are still planning margin expansion, margin expansion on the back of pricing but also recognizing some cost elements.","So to Jim's point, I would call our guidance realistic but I think as we have evidenced in Q4 and hopefully what you hear, we are very confident. We are very confident and we are control of all the actions. We delivered good margin and good performance, also from cash flows side in Q4, despite the soft industry.","So we are highly confident but I also recognize there is uncertainty, as we experienced in 2018 there are probably going to be volatility in 2019. Right now I think volatility points more toward, call it upside risk i.e. raw material is going in right direction but we all recognize on the currency side on the raw materials, there is still a lot of uncertainty out there and that is what we have appropriately reflected in our guidance. But again, I want to reiterate, we are highly confident in our actions.","Mike Dahl","Understood. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Susan Maklari","In 2018, we saw you get really significant price action in North America especially sort of relative to the way the volumes came through. Can you just give us some color on how you are thinking about pricing in 2019? I know that there will be some sort of continued benefit that comes through from what we saw last year. But just how should we think about the breakdown in terms of pricing as we move through this year?","Marc Bitzer","Susan, it's Marc. So first of all, I want to also reemphasize, it's not just North America. We had globally very strong price mix; actually across all four regions in Q4. So that is a pretty remarkable progress. Now, North America was particularly positive on the pricing side. And, to your point about 2019, there is a significant part which is carryover; carryover from the price increases which we announced early in the year.","And of course there is kind of a new announced price increase from kitchen which came in effect late December. As you also know, we are not making any forward statements about what we might or might not do in pricing. The only thing which I want to reiterate I do believe, based on our strong product pipeline and the product launches, we have significant mix opportunities ahead of us, beyond list price increases. So beyond the list price, our mix opportunities are big, our product pipeline is strong and we are confident behind that.","Susan Maklari","Okay. And then, I just wanted to dig in a little bit more into the $300 million of raw material and tariff inflation in there. Can you just talk to what you have been seeing in steel, maybe any color around how much or to what extent you were able to lock in prices and how we should be thinking about maybe some tailwinds that could perhaps flow through over the next few quarters?","Marc Bitzer","Susan, it's Marc again and this all comes back to what we said in the previous earnings call, the $300 million as you rightly pointed out, is both a combination of raw material inflation and the effect of tariffs. So these are the two big components in there.","On the raw materials, when we first kind of indicated $300 million, we took a forward assumption on raw materials into account. So we factored in a certain, call it normalization of steel prices and we also factored in a kind of improvement on particularly plastic prices, because as you know, these are the two big components in our raw material purchase.","So I think, sitting here today, well of course we saw the steel price coming down and plastics coming down, which is in line with pretty much what we expected. And given the kind of long nature of our steel contract we locked in I would say reasonably good conditions, but they still mean a year-over-year increase, because we are comparing not against spot but against kind of full-year average.","So we still have some increases, but I would agree right now, this steel and plastic are pointing in right direction, but as you also know, there is other raw materials which have a lot of volatility. The other big part which has not changed, because at this point we just don't have new information is the tariff landscape, the combination of 232 and the three different lists on 301.","And as I mentioned earlier in my answer to Michael, particularly on 301, we have fully factored in a potential of a likely increase of 25% as of end of March or mid-March. So that is sitting in these assumptions, but frankly we can't speculate about whether it's happens or not. We right now took into account what is known and what has been communicated by the U.S. government.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Rehaut","The first question, I just wanted to circle back a little bit and just make sure I'm thinking about the components of the margin guidance correctly. I think earlier, as kind of pointed out that, if you kind of sum up the regional components you will get something maybe slightly above the 6.5% to 6.8%. By contrast actually, if you sum up the components of price mix costs raw material inflation on slide 14, you actually get right at the lower end of the range.","So obviously, it is a little bit of rounding, Jim, as you said - are we just to take it that, each of the components on slide 14 you might want to slightly - that you are being a touch overly conservative.","I'm just trying to understand how perhaps if you look at the components on side 14 if there are any areas where, let's say price mix, maybe it's not a 1.5 points, you are really thinking 1 point in 160 basis points, 170 basis points, if there are movement within those components that gets you little bit to the closer of the midpoint of the range?","James Peters","Yes. And Michael, this is Jim. I think as you start out, and you pointed out here that as you start to go through the different components there, and I think Marc highlighted this earlier in some of his answers is that, all of these are a point in time estimate and there is some variability within them. Right now as we look at RMI, we would say yes, based on what we have said we see the conditions similar to maybe slightly favorable. Tariffs are in the same situation, as we had expected before.","But there still could be some movement throughout the year in there. Net cost with inflation in there, again this is an approximation and we do expect to see obviously some variation in there. As you continue to work down the list there as I said, I think if you add up all the pieces, could it be 0.25 point either direction in aggregate? Yes, and that is why we put a range around this right now.","These are our best estimates at this point in time. If you look at across the different regions, I think also as we have said there that there is probably some rounding as you add it all up and try and get - but we feel very comfortable, as Marc said, we feel very confident about the range we have given on EBIT margin. We feel very comfortable where it's coming in, that it reflects the best information we have today.","Michael Rehaut","Appreciate it. I guess secondly, I just also wanted to go back to price mix more broadly. You talked about some of your expectations around the carryover of 2018 price mix actions as well as new price increases effective the first quarter essentially. On the mix side, you think you have some positive or upward potential there. I was hoping if you could just talk a little bit about the industry backdrop in North America right now from a mix standpoint, how it's trending?","One of the things that we have observed across different building product companies is somewhat of a negative mix shift or strength in lower price points across different building product sectors in 2018. I'm curious if you have seen any of that in the appliance world this past year from a mix standpoint and how your own business has performed against that and what you expect for the upcoming year?","Marc Bitzer","Michael, it's Marc and let me try to answer that. To your point about the building products and kind of more of the lower end growing, I would say in the pure new housing side I would see yes, there is some trends or some signs, but in particular, the first time buyers are coming more into the market which overall I would see as a good news and its demand which comes with a slightly lower mix.","But keep in mind, that it's only a fraction of our total markets, the new housing. On the broader base, we don't see that massive shift down. I actually would say, the broader mix is pretty stable. But then, I would also again point back to what we are doing on product launches and innovation.","I mentioned in one of my earlier calls, we have, this year, for Whirlpool brand, an entire new global brand language for the kitchen products. We just launched a new front load washer - an entire new front load washer platform in North America. And we will, in Q2, launch an entire new top loader line.","So I think we are bringing out a lot of new products with a lot of innovation, which ultimately I think - and that is our job to kind of bring the consumer to buy it and to mix up, and I think we feel very good about what we have in our pipeline.","Michael Rehaut","Great. If I could just sneak one more in; Embraco, what was the contribution from a revenue and profit standpoint in 2018, and I think you are only baking in one quarter of that in 2019?","James Peters","Yes, I mean, right now, Michael we have assumed that that is about - as we have said in our margin walk, our EPS walk, it's about $0.50, is the difference, so we pull that out. We have factored in approximately one quarter of that, and then, from a top line perspective, approximately $1 billion.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","David MacGregor","Yes sir. Good morning.","Marc Bitzer","Good morning, David.","David MacGregor","Just, a high level question first of all and then I have got a follow-up. I guess, having covered you guys for a long time now, this is a pretty strong pricing environment and probably the strongest pricing environment I ever remember seeing with you in 20 years. And I'm just wondering if something has changed here with regard to the tariffs, you have got foreign manufacturers adjusting to US cost structures; you truly have an acceleration in new product introductions and innovation going on as well.","But the big risk to the 2019 guide seems to be your ability to hold on to pricing in the North American market. And I'm just wondering if something has changed structurally in the marketplace competitively that would suggest that maybe the industry as a whole has a little more pricing power. In other words, maybe the space is becoming a little more rational. What are your thoughts there?","Marc Bitzer","David, it's Marc. So, I mean - so yes, you are correct. In 2018, we had a very significant positive price mix for the entire company. I also want to remind everybody; we had also very significant cost inflation out there. So it was a cost-based need and I think that explains a big part. The other part which, and I can't speak for the industry, I can speak for ourselves, we shifted, I would say, several years ago, where we said we will participate in promotion then we believe it creates value for us as company.","That policy hasn't changed even under pressure. I think that there is a strong commitment on our side to expand margins. We saw our cost increases reflected appropriately in the product pricing. And on top of that, and again I can't be - stress that enough; we launched a lot of new products.","We invest every year $600 million in capital and almost the same amount in engineering and that ultimately pays off. I mean, we feel very good about our product pipeline. There is not a single platform in North America which I, right now would see as behind. We feel very good and that helps us often having these prices stick.","David MacGregor","Okay. Follow-up question, just regard to balance sheet, you talked about trying to get your leverage down to 2.0 or approaching 2.0 by the end of the year. Can you just talk about how that plays out in terms of your share repurchase plans versus deleveraging plans and what we should expect there?","James Peters","Yes. So David, this is Jim. And the first thing on the deleveraging that is obvious is when we close the Embraco transaction, that brings $1 billion worth of debt off our balance sheet within a very short period of time.","The second thing is, we have highlighted we do expect our cash flows to be very similar to strong this year, so we will have adequate free cash flow to handle all the various things we have talked about in our capital allocation from a cash - and we have talked about that we want to get our debt levels closer to two and very close to two by the end of the year.","If you look at share buybacks, right now as we have said, while we don't give a solid number, we do say we will continue to do it opportunistically throughout the year. I think if you look at the back half of 2018 that is probably a good example of how we intend to buy back shares at least in the near-to-mid-term on an ongoing basis.","Marc Bitzer","And David, it's Marc, let me maybe just add the Jim's point. First of all, I also want to underline, we have today a very strong balance sheet and our debt rating is a very solid one but it - and this is consistent with what we have communicated for quite some time on capital allocation, we want to have directionally a balance sheet or a debt leverage of two.","We will not be exactly at two, but we will get pretty close to two by the year end, so we have combination of strong cash flow, kind of the reversal of this Embraco related loan, and kind of a moderate share buyback that exactly leads it to do that level and that is, I think then we have a very strong balance sheet which leave firing power and prepares us for whatever might happen.","David MacGregor","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James, please go ahead.","Sam Darkatsh","Good morning Marc, good morning Jim. Happy New Year.","James Peters","Good morning Sam, Happy New Year.","Sam Darkatsh","I was kicked off earlier so I apologize profusely if you have already covered this, but I have got two questions and both of them have to do with Slide 5. So, first with net cost, for the year, it was a favorable 25 basis points to margin. But I think last quarter in October you were pegging that at 75 basis points for the year, which is a pretty significant swing. It's like $100 million negative variance. And I'm trying to piece together why that would have occurred in such a truncated period of time in the quarter. I'm guessing that there is some freight and warehousing in there, but could you talk about what happened with net cost in the quarter versus plan?","James Peters","Yes. Sam, this Jim and let me start off, and then Marc can add some color commentary here. I mean the first thing is, we had some of it that was just a shift from marketing and technology to net cost. But again, as I said, these are always approximate buckets and we had some movement within the different cost lines, but being close to where we expect it to be.","The other thing you have got to remember, if you look at our strong cash flow that we generated, a lot of that came through inventory reduction and that continued to put pressure on our net cost takeout throughout the fourth quarter and so it was slightly below where we would expect it to be from a conversion perspective, but we had a significant benefit within working capital and inventory that we really felt was appropriate.","And the other thing that you highlighted is that we saw continued trends in inflation outside of raw materials, especially in logistics costs that continue to put pressure on those areas. So those are three of the big items that really caused that to move from where we thought it would be at the end of Q3 to where it was at the end of the year.","Marc Bitzer","And Sam, the only thing which I want to add is - one is on the tariff, and particularly if you compare the first half with second half, the tariffs largely sit in the second half. So that is - what we saw in Q4 that is pretty much reflective of what we expect to see in Q1. The good news is we delivered North American margins with all the tariffs already being in effect.","Now the other point and again that is echoing what Jim was saying on the inventory, we drove, year-over-year, a very significant inventory reduction in a pretty much flat demand environment. So, depending on [indiscernible] we have more than $400 million, actually close to $500 million inventory reduction.","You also know versus certain fixed cost leverage which is fairly significant, so kind of a negative impact of not having that production volume is fully sitting in these net cost elements. The good news is, we are starting the year with, I would say, very balanced inventory levels and we don't have to reduce that as we go into 2019.","Sam Darkatsh","And my second question, the marketing and technology investments were ultimately trimmed, although again there may be some definitional things as you suggested Jim in the fourth quarter. But for 2019 guiding to a 25 basis point headwind, that seems like you are taking your discretionary expenses lower, especially in an area where one could argue it's designed for long-term growth and brand support. Is that you getting more efficient with marketing and technology investments or is that a decision you are making based on perspective of end-market activity and elasticity? Why take those investment spending numbers down?","James Peters","No. And Sam, I would say you kind of hit the nail on the head on part of it there. We are becoming a lot more efficient in what I'll say is our R&D or engineering spending and we have talked about that. Over the last few years the reorganization we have done in that group and how we have aligned to get more projects done with less spending and make ourselves much more efficient in that area.","We continue to invest significantly in our products. Additionally, in that space, there are some technology investments that we have had that can ebb and flow throughout periods of time especially with some of the integrations that we have done. And so we are seeing a slight reduction or a reduction in some of those as we wrap up some of the integration within EMEA. So those are the big drivers that we have there. But we do continue to invest in our products, significantly.","Sam Darkatsh","And if I could sneak one more in real quickly. The Embraco sale proceeds, are they guaranteed no matter what the regulatory timing or ruling is ultimately on the sale?","Marc Bitzer","Sam, it's Marc. As you know and I think we mentioned that in one of our previous calls, the buyer is required by contract to do whatever is needed to get the regulatory approval by the end of April. So that is, technical English called hell or high water clause. So they have to take all actions necessary to get the regulatory approval. They got already a lot of regulatory approvals, but ones which are still missing is Europe and Turkey. But we are confident that the buyer will get it by end of April. And then kind of that triggers - that happening that would mean the reversal of short-term loan which we took on the share buybacks last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Ken Zener","Very solid North America margins, could you talk a little bit, Jim, maybe just to start, is there a first quarter or first half weighting ratio that we should be focused on? If I missed it I'm sorry.","James Peters","Yes. And Ken, we really haven't said anything about weighting. I think you should expect it to be similar to our normal pattern of seasonality within the year and especially as you look at Q1, just I would say it's going to be very similar to prior years.","There is no distinct items. Obviously, Marc did mention earlier, the tariffs do weigh a little bit heavier in the first half of the year on us because they accelerated throughout the year. And we do have some additional interest costs within the first quarter due to the term loan we took out in the second quarter of last year, and we will have that until we get the Embraco proceeds in. But outside of that, it's going to be relatively similar from an operational perspective.","Ken Zener","Okay, appreciate that. Marc, you mentioned that - I just want to be clear, because it affected another company that I cover. You said the 25%, I assume tariff increase, was fully priced in, could you go over that again in terms of - clarify that as well as quantify that in case the 25% does not go through. I mean, is that - how much is that worth if it doesn't go. I assume you are talking about the tariff?","Marc Bitzer","Yes. So ken, I mean as you know and given that you cover it quite extensively versus a lot of tariff components, there is the 232, there is 301 which had three different lists. And what we have factored in everything which has been communicated or announced at this point, which means basically everything on the 301, all three lists, including the increase to 25% off of famous List 3 of - part of the 301 section. That is all factored in.","We typically don't split kind of different components between List 1, List 2 and List 3. But it's needless to say that if List 3 stays at 10 % yes, that would be positive impact. But in total it's - there is will be a headwinds, but it will be positive impact.","Ken Zener","All right. I'm just trying to get a little, because there was another company that had 10% and said that 25 % would be an x percent headwind. So if it doesn't go through I'm just trying to extract from you a - perhaps benefit that might accrue to your guidance, but...","Marc Bitzer","Ken, maybe to just help you a little bit - frame it a little bit more, in total and again, without going into all the details on the components. In total, you should assume the net of all tariffs right now weight about or $10 million to $12 million every month on us, and that is just the reality.","Ken Zener","Every month?","Marc Bitzer","Every month. So the 301 is a part of it, and the 301 List 3 is part of that. So yes, if it would stay 10%, it will be a few million every month, and that will be good news, but in total, it's right now still a headwind.","Ken Zener","Okay. And I think I'm going to cheat here, so with AM flat kind of your guidance for this year, you have a positive outlook on housing fine. Can you split it up a little more in terms of the suites that you are selling, so steps that little more R&R versus replacement demand and just quantificate on that a little. Thank you very much.","Marc Bitzer","Okay. Now you have successfully sneaked in four questions. Having said that right now, again, we guide North America to a very modest growth of 0% to 1%; and that is against a housing market which is right now steadily moving sideways. However we expect the fundamental demand drivers to be intact and still are reasonably good; actually if we look at the numbers, actually very good consumer confidence.","With that in mind, on a - in the traditions between replacements and discretionary, right now we see slightly more than half of our market around replacement and discretionary being less than half as a comparison but discretionary volume is still way below what we saw, for example, in 2005 or 2006 at the peak of appliance demands.","So if you want to say so, I mean replacement is a pretty predictable number because that is just typically comes with a - for life of appliances. So the discretionary - yet in the long-term, you could argue still has some upside potential but we did not factor that in, in our 2019 guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Curtis Nagle from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Curtis Nagle","Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. So, I guess just kind of the first one coming back to North America volumes. I guess could you give any color in terms of - how things look from a cadence perspective given that is - the comparisons are just a little bit choppy kind of quarter-to-quarter?","Marc Bitzer","Curtis, this is Marc. Let me first of all talk about Q4. As you have seen in Q4, frankly we expect the industry to be a little bit stronger in Q4, largely driven by, we expected Q4 industry to have probably a little bit more inventory load by retailers which did not happen to full magnitude. On the sell-through base in turn we probably would have expected a 1% to 3% sell through growth and probably now in Q4 the sell through from consumer perspective was probably around 0% to 1%. So a small change versus what we originally had in mind.","So I would expect also, on a quarter-by-quarter basis, you will see a plus or minus 1% up and down quarter-by-quarter. But having said that, the fundamental driver of consumer confidence in housing we considered to be intact. It doesn't mean that we will have a strong growth but we just don't see right now the scenario that you would have a significant quarterly contraction of the market. Again, we see consumer confidence and the fundamental drivers of demand being fairly intact.","Curtis Nagle","Okay, fair enough. And just quickly go back to $300 million. I understand, I guess the basis of why it's still at $300 million, but let's just say hypothetically steel and perhaps resins continue to be weak and maybe get a little bit of relief there, would you have to pull back any of your cost-based price increases, say later in the year if that would happen?","James Peters","Curt, this is Jim, I would say, right now, as we said we based the $300 million on what we have seen to date and what we expect obviously throughout the year different dynamics can drive that. The costing or the price increases that we have announced are based on the cost increases we have seen.","And so at this point in time that is also our best estimate of that. Obviously, we - throughout the year, as we see different trends within the marketplace around cost and all that, you know we will update our guidance in those areas but there is a lot of different lines of volatility in addition our RMI that we are seeing today.","As we mentioned tariffs, there is still some unknown on; currency, obviously some up and downs on; and inflation in other areas of our P&L, especially around logistics and other areas that, that can fluctuate also. So at this time in aggregate, we really feel that in terms of what we are seeing in cost in terms of cost increases are appropriate for the year right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alvaro Lacayo from Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Alvaro Lacayo","Just two quick questions; on North American, the expectations you see for that 0% to 1% growth, if you can maybe just talk to us about your assumptions and what do you think repair and remodel spend growth will be and what your expectations are on new construction?","And then secondly, with regards to the tariffs, particularly the piece that would step up to 25% in March. If that were to change or if that doesn't materialize - if the step-up doesn't materialize, would that impact pricing realization in any way based on the conversations you have with your retailers on what price increases may be, especially the ones in kitchen that were just announced?","James Peters","I think Alvaro, let me start with your second question. As I just mentioned previously, there is a lot of different moving parts within our cost structure today in terms of raw material increases, tariffs, logistics cost increases. And so the 301 tariffs and that last piece is only a small part of all those increases that you see.","So I think there is a lot of other moving pieces and cost pressures that we are seeing right now on top of that. And I think, as Marc mentioned, that - well, it could be a benefit to us, it's not going to be a significant benefit against that total bucket of cost increase that we are seeing right now.","The second thing, and then I'll kind of let Marc talk a little bit about the demand. As we have looked over time in terms of how much of the demand is replacement versus discretionary? It typically treads around the 50% range plus or minus 5% from there. And as we look forward to 2019, we don't see a significant deviation in that in terms of what we expect to be just versus the last three or four years what we expect to be discretionary versus replacement.","Marc Bitzer","Yes. And Alvaro, It's Marc. Let me maybe just add a few additional comments on, particular about housing. And obviously, we all follow the present analyst reports on housing and it almost feels like there was a first a period of overconfidence and now over pessimism, and I think both extremes are wrong I think about fundamental housing, yes we saw some moderation, but fundamentals are solid.","Now to give a little bit more color, and I think I made some comments on this one on previous earnings call. The U.S. housing market ever since recession has been supply constraints. That supply constraint led to probably an acceleration of home prices ahead of where you would expect in the demand cycle, and kind of that started to stifle down demand a little bit. Come on top of that the mortgage increase which were particular in, I think, August-September of last year. That together led to a small moderation.","Now, having said that, if you look at the fundamentals of household formation, entry buyers, age of housing stock, rental occupancy, et cetera, et cetera, the fundamentals actually leave a lot of upside opportunity. So, with that in mind, whenever people talk about the housing market, it's not even remotely comparable to what we saw like a decade ago.","We are still on the new housing way below 25 year average of new housing and even existing home sales are far away from high numbers. To be more specifically, yes on existing home sales, we would expect the number of clearly north of 5%, probably somewhere around 5.3% to 5.6% in that ballpark.","And of new housing, we would expect the number getting close to $1.3 million, which again is way below kind of what you have seen in previous cycles and way below long-term average. At the same time, we don't expect kind of a double-digit to high single-digit growth of that market. It will be a solid, probably low single-digit growth in the housing market.","Alvaro Lacayo","Thank you.","Marc Bitzer","I think we are coming to the end of the Q&A section. So let me maybe just quickly summarize little bit some of our key messages from this call and also from Q&A on Slide 20. As we exit 2018, we are encouraged by the results of our actions to overcome significant external pressures and volatility.","Now looking back at 2018 we took decisive actions to overcome these headwinds, including the successful execution of our previously announced cost-based price increases, delivering our cost takeout commitments, refocusing and rightsizing our European business, and driving sustainable improvements in working capital.","We are confident that the strategy and actions currently in place will generate margin expansion and strong free cash flow in 2019. Regarding capital allocation, we will continue to buy back shares at a moderate pace, while we are on track to further strengthen our balance sheets.","And finally, we will be providing you with a strategic update on our long-term plans at our Investor Day in New York City on May 23rd. With that, I just want to thank you for joining us today. Wish you all a good week and looking forward to talking with all of you at our earnings call in late April.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Max Tunnicliff.","Max Tunnicliff","Welcome to our second quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chief Executive Officer and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpool.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports. We want to remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks and good morning everyone. On Slide 3, we show our second quarter highlights. As you saw in our press release, we expanded our ongoing EBIT margins in a very challenging cost environment. We delivered second quarter ongoing EBIT margin of 6.7% and ongoing earnings per share of $3.20. Since mid-May, a number of elements in the macro environment worsened significantly. In addition to continued raw material inflation, we experienced a temporary, but significant decline in U.S. industry demand headwinds related to U.S. tariffs as well as the Brazilian trucker strike and currency fluctuations in Russia and Latin America. While these macro challenges impacted our results negatively, the actions we have put in place over past few quarters, including cost-based price increases and targeted cost reductions throughout the world enabled us to largely offset these challenges and expand ongoing EBIT margins year-over-year.","We are very pleased with strong price mix driving significant year-over-year and sequential improvement on a global spot basis and positive in all regions. In Europe, we were unable to overcome macro headwinds due to slower progress than expected as we work to recover volumes in the region. As a result, we are taking strong actions to restore growth and profitability in the region, which I will discuss in further detail later in the call. We drove strong performance in our North American region delivering over 12% EBIT margin despite a 5% decline second quarter industry demand, continued raw material inflation and rising freight costs.","As previously announced during the quarter, we agreed to sell our Embraco compressor business and in anticipation of the proceeds from that sale, we executed a tender offer during the quarter and repurchased approximately $1 billion of common stock. GAAP results were negatively impacted in the second quarter by approximately $860 million due to asset impairment charges primarily related to our Europe results, which should not improve as anticipated and a preliminary settlement on a previously disclosed French Competition Authority and Mitigation.","Turning to Slide 4, I would discuss our second quarter results and 2018 guidance. Our revenues declined approximately 4% during the quarter. Sales were impacted by weaker than expected industry demand in the U.S., slow progress on volume recovery in Europe and the Brazilian trucker strike. Ongoing EBIT margins were 6.7%, 20 basis points above the prior year as strong global price mix more than offset unit volume declines and significant cost inflation. Year-to-date, free cash flow below the prior year primarily driven by working capital time related to lower production volumes. Regarding our full year forecast, we reduced our guidance components due to weaker than expected second quarter results and increasing cost headwinds in the second half, which we now expect to be more significantly than previously forecasted. We will discuss our guidance in more detail later in the call.","While our second quarter results were below our original expectations due to additional headwinds towards the end of the quarter, we are at the same time encouraged by the strong price mix progress and margin expansion year-over-year. This gives us the confidence that the underlying fundamentals of our global business are strong and we therefore continue to expect to deliver significant shareholder value in the coming quarters.","On Slide 5, we show the drivers of our second quarter margin performance. Our global price mix improved both sequentially as well as year-over-year and was positive in all four regions. I will discuss price mix curve on the next slide. We delivered positive gross cost take-out as our restructuring and fixed cost reduction actions continue to progress. However, these benefits were partially offset by rising freight cost, primarily in the U.S. and Brazil due to oil price inflation and fleet shortages as well the conversion impact of short-term volume weakness in multiple regions. Raw material inflation continued to be a significant year-over-year headwind impacting second quarter margins by 125 basis points.","Turning to Slide 6, we demonstrate our commitment to delivering significant price mix performance. In total, second quarter price mix improved by approximately 200 basis points compared to the prior year and we delivered positive price mix in all regions. This represents a sequential improvement of 100 basis points as we continue to realize the benefits of global cost-based price increases implemented late last year and into the second quarter. Average price per unit improved over 5% on a global basis, including a double-digit improvement in Europe and 8% improvement in North America. Finally, we recently announced additional cost-based price increases in Canada and Latin America, which are effective during the third quarter.","Given the weak second quarter performance in Europe, I would like to discuss the Europe business in more detail on Slide 7. Over the past several quarters, challenges related to the Indesit integration, continued execution issues and changes in the macroeconomic environment have led to weak business performance. During the integration, we experienced product availability issues as we completed factory, platform and system integration. During the first half of 2018 for a customer negotiations which positioned us well for future had a significant impact in volume, especially when combined with our implementation of cost-based price increases. At the same time, our business continues to be impacted by raw material inflation and currency volatility in the region. While these challenges have led to results well below our expectations, we continued to have confidence in our structural position in Europe. The Indesit integration activities are now complete. Our factories are optimized, platforms and systems are integrated and our streamlined brand portfolio is well-positioned to build upon our leading positions in many European countries, while we are encouraged by our structural position we have made slower-than-expected progress to regain volumes in the region. As a result, we have identified strong actions necessary to address disappointing execution and drive value creation. While we are pleased with our progress in improving price and mix, including double-digit average price per unit improvement in the second quarter, we will now balance our efforts around stabilizing and recovering volume through targeted actions on a country-by-country basis.","We are also redefining our overall business strategy in the regions to drive value creation, including a stronger focus on the profitable kitchen business, the implementation of additional opportunities for cost reduction and a focused portfolio optimization. Finally, we are implementing broad leadership changes in the Europe region, including a change in the Norwegian President. While our short-term focus in the second half is on restoring the breakeven business, we now expect to deliver roughly 4% to 5% margins by 2020 and in the long-term, we continued to expect 8% margin in Europe.","With that, I would like to turn it over to Jim to review our regional results.","Jim Peters","Thanks, Marc and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 9, we reviewed the second quarter results for our North America region. We delivered strong margins demonstrating the fundamental strength of our North America business, while overcoming significant external headwinds. Net sales of $2.8 billion were impacted by soft unit volumes primarily driven by weaker than expected industry demand in the U.S. We believe this current quarter weaknesses largely represents the volumes shipped between the first and second quarters related to the competitor stockpiling of inventory to avoid the safeguard remedy on washers and cost based price increases in laundry.","As we move into the second half, we believe that industry shipments will return to more normalized levels as the underlying drivers of the U.S. industry remain favorable. Overall, we delivered strong 11.9% margins through significant price mix improvement which offset significant industry demand weakness, unfavorable conversion due to volume reductions and a $40 million impact from cost inflation. We expect to continue benefiting from our previously announced price mix actions in the second half as well as innovative new product launches and strong cost takeout programs.","Turning to Slide 10, we reviewed the second quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Net sales were down 9% versus the prior year. Ongoing EBIT margin declined versus the prior year as positive price mix was more than offset by unit volume declines, significant raw material inflation and currency headwinds. In total the combination of raw material inflation and unfavorable currency impacted results by approximately $30 million or 300 basis points. While we are pleased with double digit improvement in our average price per unit and strong price mix, we are not satisfied with our progress on recovering volume following the trade negotiations and private label volume actions we took during the first quarter. As a result we are taking strong actions, the strong actions Marc discussed earlier. These actions are the right mix steps for our business and will enable us to get back on track to our long-term goals for the region.","Turning to Slide 11, we reviewed the second quarter results for our Latin America region. Net sales and EBIT were both down versus the prior year. Our cost based pricing actions continued to progress as we delivered positive price mix in the quarter. However, unit volumes declined versus the prior year primarily due to the Brazilian trucker strike which impacted both our home appliance and compressor businesses in Brazil. In total the strike unfavorably impacted volumes by approximately 300,000 units and EBIT by approximately $20 million. Due to the timing and scope of the trucker strike, we were unable to recover the volumes in the quarter, but we do expect some recovery in the second half of the year. In addition to the trucker strike impact, continued weak global compressor demand led to a $10 million EBIT decline. As a result of continued cost pressures in June, we announced new cost based price increases in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina effective July 1. We will continue to focus on balancing price, mix and volume in the region while aggressively managing costs to improve profitability.","Now we will turn to the second quarter results for our Asia region which were shown on Slide 12. Ongoing net sales increased 6% versus the prior year. We delivered ongoing EBIT of $43 million, a significant improvement versus the prior year. Our second quarter results were positively impacted by double-digit unit volume growth and positive price mix. We delivered strong results despite raw material inflation and currency impacts totaling approximately $15 million. We continue to deliver strong relative results in India with double-digit unit volume growth, share gains and positive price mix. In China, we delivered positive price mix and the net impact of discrete items favorably impacted both GAAP and ongoing EBIT by approximately $15 million, primarily driven by government incentives. We continue to focus on improving profitability in China through price mix and disciplined cost management.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Marc to review our guidance.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks, Jim. And turning to Slide 14, we review our updated guidance assumption. As I mentioned earlier, we have revised our 2018 guidance as a result of stronger macro headwinds and weaker than expected performance in the second quarter. We now expect flat revenue for the year as our strong global price mix is expected to be offset by volume weakness, primarily in Europe. We are reducing our global growth expectations, but we expect the U.S. industry to recover and contribute to growth in North America in the second half. We now expect to deliver ongoing EBIT margin of approximately 6.9% for the year. I would discuss the updated drivers of our EBIT margin guidance on the next slide. As a result of lower earnings expectations, we have reduced our cash flow guidance to approximately $850 million. Overall, we now expect to deliver record ongoing earnings of $14.20 to $14.80 per share.","Turning to Slide 15, we show the updated drivers of our EBIT margin guidance. We now expect to deliver approximately $400 million or 2 points of net benefit from improved price mix as our global cost-based price increases have delivered strong results. We reduced our expectations for growth cost takeout and volume weakness in multiple regions, have impacted conversion and fuel price inflation in certain countries has impacted our freight cost. However, our fixed cost reduction actions remain on track to deliver $150 million benefit for this year.","Finally, we now expect raw material inflation to be approximately $350 million in 2018. We continue to see significant inflation across a number of commodities and in particular with our biggest purchase items, steel and resins. The global steel costs have risen substantially and in particular in the U.S. that have reached unexplainable levels. While the U.S. steel has also historically priced at a premium to the rest of the world most recently, the U.S. steel is 50% more expensive than rest of the world and simply cannot be explained by the input costs. Our annual steel contract and hedging contracts with our base metals give us some protection, but do not insulate us from these more material trends. And recently, we also experienced cost inflation increases due to rising oil prices and U.S. supply chain capacity constraints. As we mentioned in prior earnings calls, we cannot hedge resins and it was exposed to the quarterly price inflation.","Finally, uncertainty related to tariffs and global trade actions have all led to increased cost of certain strategic components and finished goods imports and exports. While these increased raw material headwinds are significant, we have also demonstrated our ability to overcome these types of challenges in the path for a variety of means, including cost-based price increases, cost reductions and efficiency improvement and we will continue to do so.","Now, Jim will cover our recent guidance and cash priorities.","Jim Peters","Thanks, Marc. On Slide 16, we show our regional industry and EBIT margin guidance. We have slightly reduced our expectations for full year industry growth in the U.S. and Brazil as a result of the weakness in the second quarter. In North America, we are encouraged by the strength of the U.S. economy, including low unemployment and healthy housing demand. We believe the industry is well-positioned for growth in the second half of 2018. Despite significant raw material inflation, we expect to deliver approximately 12% margin in North America with industry growth now expected to be approximately 1% to 2% given the Q2 softness. In EMEA, we now expect to deliver ongoing EBIT margin of approximately negative 1% as a result of soft volumes and continued external headwinds. In Latin America, we expect to recover a portion of the trucker strike impact in the second half and now expect to deliver EBIT margin of approximately 6%. Finally, we continue to expect to deliver approximately 5% EBIT margin in Asia.","Turning to Slide 17, we review our updated free cash flow guidance for 2018. We have reduced our guidance for cash earnings as a result of slower recovery in Europe, increased cost inflation expectations and unfavorable currency fluctuation. The asset impairment, Marc discussed earlier, does not have an impact on cash and the preliminary French Competition Authority settlement is expected to impact cash in 2019. In total, we now expect to deliver free cash flow of approximately $850 million.","Turning to Slide 18, we show our capital allocation priorities for 2018, which are unchanged. During the quarter, we announced the sale of our Embraco business and continued to expect to close the deal in early 2019. In anticipation of the closing of the sale of our compressor business and the receipt of the sale proceeds, we entered into a term loan facility and repurchased $1 billion of common stock in the second quarter and we expect to continue repurchasing shares in the second half.","Now we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take a question from Curtis Nagle of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Curtis Nagle","Thanks so much for taking the question. So just my first is just can you talk a little bit more about the balancing between volumes and pricing and I guess specifically what are the strong actions you guys plan to take to narrow that gap and how you think you will achieve that given that it appears that competitors aren\u2019t being quite as aggressive on pricing?","Marc Bitzer","Curtis, it\u2019s Marc. So I presume you asked the question on global and not particularly on the specific region though. And of course, the situation from competitive environment and what\u2019s the timing of our price increase is different region by region. So let me maybe try to address it for both North America and Europe and when we can also go \u2013 if you wish so more into Latin America or Asia. In North America, as you know we went out of the kitchen price increase, which was effective from the first quarter and the longer price increase in the second quarter. As you can tell from our remarks and from the numbers we had very strong pricing target year-over-year and sequentially, we also go into the promotion period around July 4. We decided to stand firm in our price increases and we executed accordingly. Obviously I cannot comment on what competitors are doing or not doing, it\u2019s their decision. We have seen over the July 4 period, but not everybody was sticking to similar price increases, but again that\u2019s normal promotional environment and I am not reading too much into this one. Again, I can only reaffirm we are standing firm on our price increases and because we have committed the only right thing to do in such a cost inflation environment. On Europe I would say we would kind and this country-by-country very different. We started going up with some price increases in October and executed a lot of them until February, but again on a country-by-country basis, I would say here and again the competitive environment is highly fragmented into country-by-country, very different, there is no generic comment. I think we saw volume impact, but I wouldn\u2019t only tie it back to the price increase, because at the same time we were trying to address terms and certain unfavorable trade contractors or certain trade partners, I wouldn\u2019t put it all on pricing. But again also here and this is what we have communicated before, now our job is to hold firm on these price increases and rebound some of our volumes and some of the volume losses in the second half.","Curtis Nagle","Okay. Maybe just to segue and I guess my next question on EMEA, so just from an EBIT perspective another disappointing quarter, it sounds like a lot of the same issues that dragged earnings in 2Q, we are still there. So I guess what is there is happening, why has it been so difficult to retain those slots or regain those slots as you have mentioned and can you be a little more specific about some of the actions you plan to take aside from what sounds like some leadership changes and a change in strategic direction?","Marc Bitzer","So Curtis obviously in Europe and we have said that before, we are disappointed by Q2 what\u2019s not yet any better. First of all putting global context the same inflationary challenges that we have throughout the rest of the world also impacted our European numbers as you have seen in some of the numbers, so that\u2019s an additional burden which we have had in this one. On the volumes side frankly it took us a very long time to resolve some of these trade contracts which are not by and large results, but as you also know in a competitive environment, it\u2019s not that easy to just regain the floor spots which we lost over last 6 months quickly overnight. We are making progress and right now even in a disappointed Q2 we got better month over month over month, but again that\u2019s the number one priority for the second half as we have regained the floor spots, rebalanced without giving up our price increases and in the same time re-focused our strategy particularly on the what is in Europe very profitable in the kitchen business.","Operator","Our next question is from David MacGregor of Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","Yes. So good morning.","Marc Bitzer","Good morning Greg.","David MacGregor","Just start off with a question on raw materials I guess the guidance has been 250 to 300, it was supposed to reflect not where raw material inflation was at the time that you posted that guidance, but rather where you thought it might eventually get to. So presumably some cushion in there, now they increased to 350, can you just talk about where in the world which geographic segments or which materials did you see the incremental inflation is responsible for the upwards adjustment and how much cushion do you have now?","Jim Peters","Yes, David. So this is Jim and I think if we go back to our previous guidance what we have seen since then is we have seen continued pressure on field costs, primarily in the U.S. but also some globally. Resin cost, especially as oil has risen and the last \u2013 in recent times we have seen an increase in oil prices that have pushed that up on a global basis, but some of it concentrated more within the U.S. market right now. Additionally, even as we look across many of the base metals, those have all gone up from our assumptions earlier in the year. So, it\u2019s been rather broad-based with the significant concentration in steel and a disproportionate amount hitting us in the U.S. at this point in time.","Marc Bitzer","So maybe David, I will also add on this one. First of all, you are correct when we give a raw material guidance, it\u2019s a forward-looking assumption and so this is not reflecting spot market of the past, which also tells you our forward-looking assumptions for the year have changed and it\u2019s coming back to what Jim said before, if I basically put it in call it four different buckets, we almost follow the size of our respective raw material purchase. The biggest concern structurally is steel, steel across the world, but particularly in U.S. have increased. Now, we have some protection due to our annual contracts. But as I said before, we are not completely insulated. Two, it\u2019s the resins, which have risen substantially and as you know and we indicated that before we cannot hedge for resins, so we basically are exposed to quarterly inflation and the resins have not come down. And then 3 and 4 almost the same order is kind of the freights, not just impacted by few, but by freight shortage that has risen substantially in kind of a second quarter not technically, but it\u2019s not sitting in our raw materials, but sits in our ongoing cost productivity, but it\u2019s also an element. And lastly \u2013 and again that has only limited impact Q2, but on the forward basis, it has some impact, is we are impacted by the tariffs, either when we are import of records or via our suppliers who have to basically pay the tariffs. So that is an impact going forward, but to a lesser extent in the second quarter.","David MacGregor","There has been one of your competitors has gone for small price increase effective in August, can you just talk about the extent to which you feel when you have already raised prices again here this summer for second half benefit?","Marc Bitzer","Yes. And David as you know that\u2019s consistent with all our prior info, obviously I cannot and will not comment on future price increases and so you need to judge us from the past, I would say, across the world, but also particularly in U.S. when we saw the first sign of cost inflation throughout the business, we decide to go forward with price increases and that\u2019s what we have done in U.S. and probable and of course we are monitoring the situation very closely. And as I said in my prepared remarks, whenever you faced there is a significant raw material inflation, you look always at it, multiple set of options cost based price increases, cost reduction programs, supplier negotiations as one of them and we intend to do so.","David MacGregor","Second question if I could was just on Europe, you talked about sort of consolidation of a lot of different markets as it strikes me that maybe UK was just proportionately negative contributor to the results there and the problems that you are facing, can you just sort of deconstruct the European aggregate for a moment and just talk about which countries are of particular problem and how you are planning to remedy that?","Marc Bitzer","Yes. I mean, David again without breaking down the last detail, but more in a call it 2 years perspective as opposed to just the quarter. Historically, our European business particular in Indesit out of the business used to make a lot of profits in Russia and UK. Both markets have, as you know, significant currency and also demand volatility to downward and that is still structurally burden them, because obviously this all products being imported to UK, we just don\u2019t realize the same margins on top that demand is very slow in UK. To some extent, same is true for Russia, where had a significant currency exposure over 2 years. I would say, UK in the second quarter was not necessarily the decisive factor. Russia impacted us, because the currency got a lot weaker, but we also had some challenges in other markets. I would say the encouraging thing is I think our historically core markets, like France to some extent like Italy and Germany, but have started to stabilize that we see some positive signs there.","Operator","We will take our next question from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh","Good morning, Marc. Jim, how are you?","Marc Bitzer","Good morning.","Sam Darkatsh","A few questions I wanted to make sure I am clear with. So what you are saying, Marc is that subsequent pricing from here is not in the guidance and so if you were to take pricing from here it would be incremental to guidance is that how to understand your commentary?","Marc Bitzer","Well, again, Sam, obviously, we cannot communicate for number of reasons upon future price increases. Apart from it all, there is also competitive reality which I don\u2019t want to put all our cards on the table. Having said that, our margins, our guidance assumption right now includes current raw material assumption of 3.50 and of course includes the continued discipline on the cost based price increases and as you have seen we upped what we assume on a full year price benefit from 1.25 to 2.0. So we have included in the guidance also technically we included already in the Canada and the Latin America price increase, because we have announced them, but not anything beyond.","Sam Darkatsh","Okay. And then my question, here my real question would be twofold, first off, when do you expect laundry margins, specifically wash machine margins to approach or approximate fleet average for North America? And then secondly for raw materials, I know you said that you are insulated this year based on contracts and hedging and forward purchasing, but if you were to mark-to-market what you are seeing right now, what would 2019 inflation look like at present?","Marc Bitzer","Sam, these are two questions. So let me first talk about raw material, obviously we are not giving 2019 guidance on raw materials at this point and also to be \u2013 because I think it\u2019s important to be clear in my earlier remarks. On steel, we have annual contracts, they protect us to some extent, but given that there is some element of indexing, they don\u2019t completely insulate us. There is still some steel elements. Second of all, not all parts of what we have annual steel contracts and some of them you buy short. Certainly, there are certain steel parts, not necessarily the cold-rolled steel, but specialty steels like duct stainless steel, where we don\u2019t have annual contracts. So we are impacted by steel prices on our current base. The ever big ticket item are resins, we are not on the annual contract in resins, because you simply can\u2019t get annual resins contract. So, we are fully exposed to the quarterly inflation what we see in this market. And on the all the ever base metals which as Jim mentioned earlier, where we have also inflation, we have hedges in place, but of course at one point you run out of hedges and you are not 100% hedged at any given time. So there are certain exposures and we have got to see also how the future price trends evolve. Having said that, we also convinced that certain spot prices which we see right now in particular on steel we do not believe are sustainable in the external markets, because they are simply disconnected from the input costs and they are also disconnected from rest of the world. Now coming back to the washer margins and again we \u2013 as you know we don\u2019t reveal margins by region or by product platform. Having said that, the washer business as such in Q2 was impacted by very slow market demand in Q2, which you probably can relate back to strong demand in Q1, so probably first half was more balanced, but the Q2 demand in washers were very soft and we have a benefit from a cost-based price increases. So, I would say our EBIT margins on loan we have improved, but they have not yet reached fleet average.","Operator","Our next question is from Susan Maklari of Credit Suisse.","Susan Maklari","Good morning.","Marc Bitzer","Good morning.","Susan Maklari","I guess, first I wanted to get a little bit more color on North America you know you said that you expect things to recover. So, coming out of the quarter, have you started to see volumes improved for either your business or for the industry broadly and how do you think about that coming together in the back half of the year?","Jim Peters","Yes, Susan, this is Jim. I think as we mentioned before the first way we look at it is that in Q1 was significantly strong and some of that we believe was due to some load-in, especially of laundry products during that quarter, which balanced itself back out the second quarter. As we look at the third quarter, we are very early in the quarter at this point in time. And so as we look at what we believe the underlying drivers of demand are in and sell-through and other things, what we have really reflected and said as we have taken our industry guidance from 2% to 3%, down to 1% to 2% as we do believe a little of that softness within Q2 will not be made up in the back of the year, but we expect at least U.S. demand to normalize that closer to the levels where we had expected for the full year, just realizing that the first half of the year was flat and we probably won\u2019t make that up.","Marc Bitzer","Susan, it\u2019s Marc, so let me maybe also add some additional color. So as Jim indicated Q1 industry was very solid, Q2 it was down by 5%. So in the first half it was approximately flat. Frankly we did expect some rebalancing of the inventory which was also related to the price increase in the pre-buy. We expected some rebalancing in April, May. I think the \u2013 but if you want to say the surprising element the June demand was slow which is an indication of July 4, but as an overall period was softer than usual years. So I think that\u2019s impacting the first half. Having said that and of course we look at housing data and everything else, we still believe the fundamentals of healthy U.S. market are in place but of course we are observing all parameters. But missed that first half softness if you wanted to say particularly June 1 we took out full year guidance despite the confidence in the structure of the market down to 1% to 2%.","Susan Maklari","Okay. And then I guess in thinking about the pricing have you seen a mix shift as a result of that, do you see consumer sort of moving down in terms of pricing, is that changing any of the broader market share positions out there?","Marc Bitzer","Susan and again it\u2019s Marc and it\u2019s of course different region by region. But if I stay focused on North America typically when you go obviously these cost base price increases you sometime have a mix elements. I used sometimes to have \u2013 that you mix down. Having said that on this one, because it\u2019s so heavily cost base, we have driven price increase for our entire product range, so we didn\u2019t see a massive mix shift if you want say so, what it did impact we lost some volume from the low ends in particular around the promotion period and vis-\u00e0-vis typically the most advertising promotion active product in ASU. So it\u2019s not necessary, but from an ongoing basis we lost mix, but yes we have the promotion periods, on the low end we lost some volume.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Zehner of KeyBanc Capital.","Ken Zehner","Good morning gentlemen.","Marc Bitzer","Good morning.","Ken Zehner","If I could just take a step back, I really want to try to put this quarter and your outlook in the right context, so if I think back to 2011, going to 2012 when you pursue pricing then your margin focusing on North America, your margins were 3% going to ultimately 8% in 2012 which was good, so as you thought and now you are looking to get price to attain your 12% margin targets, so in \u201812, 2012, fell like 2% that year, can you talk to the implied elasticity in appliance demand because obviously you are talking about a normalizing second half and I am just trying to discern the cost elasticity on pricing you talked about of July 4 promotional weakness as opposed to cyclical softening I just want to kind of clarify your macro thoughts there first of all? Thank you.","Jim Peters","And Ken before Marc kind of goes into some of the elasticity, let me just take you to that with 2011 and \u201812 that you talked about. The margin expansion there, yes there was significant pricing and there were multiple cost based price increases during the time. But also there was a significant amount of fixed cost takeout. So you can\u2019t compare the pricing results necessarily of 3% to 8% to what we have now. But you are correct on the margin expansion there, but there were multiple drivers.","Ken Zehner","Okay.","Marc Bitzer","So Ken, let me maybe also add a couple of comments. First of all before we can get to the price elasticity, also you should take it in broad historical context, of course with Q2 numbers were not in line with our expectation or your expectation, at the end of the day we also got a recognized that despite an extremely challenging cost environment we have expanded our ongoing margin. And I am really encouraged by the actions which we have taken in October and in the first quarter around the fixed cost reduction price increase because it just showed even in extreme environment, we can weather and we can extend the margin and these actions will also give us quite a bit of momentum in the back half. So as much as we are kind of disappointed about the short-term, we are encouraged by how the total business was able to expand the margin in this environment. Not specifically on the price elasticity and again this is a lot has been written and there is a lot of moving parts obviously and this is very different by category by category. The fundamental thing which you need to keep separate is what is kind of call it category price elasticity i.e., industry is such versus cost-price elasticity i.e. versus our competitor to get price point. Of course you have a substantial cross-price elasticity in particular when you come to laundry low end price points, not necessary the high end price points. And that\u2019s just the \u2013 given that\u2019s the reality of the competitive environment. The category price elasticity, we repeatedly said that in the past, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very high yield. Of course in the short-term we may see some moving pieces, but in the developed mature markets like U.S. there is so much, particularly on the laundry side, it\u2019s not necessarily all housing related, its replacement related, innovation related, you typically don\u2019t see on a full year basis, the massive of a big price elasticity on the entire category. Kind of months-to-months you might see it, but not on a full year basis.","Jim Peters","I think Ken one other thing to point out too and if you look back historically that the price increases that you had referred to earlier we had taken more at the tail end of the commodity inflation period. Right now as Marc pointed out, we are taking the \u2013 we have taken cost based pricing in the middle of the commodity inflation period that\u2019s continued. And it\u2019s allowed us to expand our margins this quarter year-over-year despite the fact that that we are dealing with significant raw material headwinds. And I think that\u2019s the positive point out here that we have really we have taken these cost based price increases much earlier in the process.","Susan Maklari","Thank you. My second question is regarding you are considering the 4% margin in 2020, if we think back to the Indesit acquisition, how much is kind of \u2013 could you isolate some of that shortfall just to the UK in competitive situations there or is there something I heard you say the 8% long-term margin as well, but it seems like it\u2019s getting farther away, so is there something structural that changed within the different countries your \u2013 obviously you lost watch floor space, so your relationships, the retailers was weakened within country which I think is very important, but could you talk about why that seems \u2013 that 8% seems so far away now, so what\u2019s the structural change as it was UK or really IT transition that led to the market share that\u2019s not as quickly recoverable? Thank you.","Marc Bitzer","And Ken let me try to address it even more obviously [ph] but it\u2019s probably \u2013 at one point analyst conference we got to give you the full story, but the short one is first of all when we talk about the 4% let\u2019s not also not lose sight we have in the business already 4% posted in this acquisition. Actually in \u201814, \u201815 we had 4%, 4.5%, so it\u2019s not kind of \u2013 it\u2019s not a new number, we had it we are also looking at our competitive sets, you would easily come to 6% to 7% margins in this environment are achievable. Now to your question about the sources of the losses, I am not trying to blame at all on UK and Russia, I would say that is approximately half of the losses which we have and that\u2019s just the currency which we don\u2019t think that will recover in the short-term. The other half is also what I would call broader internal execution issues which are related to supply chain and some other elements. So now to your question why does it take us longer to get to 8%, A. Yes, because we don\u2019t expect the UK and Russia to recover in a 1 year or 2 year period. I think ultimately it will come back, but it will take a little bit longer. The other element and this is just a reflection of a long integration with some called internal focus as opposed to external focus. We lost a little bit aside of our profitable kitchen business, that is structurally the most profitable business in Europe, but that takes longer to regain because of typically annual contracts and it\u2019s more than just a floor spot. These are annual contracts which you have to regain and that will take us a little bit longer. But that\u2019s the key element to get this business to 8%.","Operator","Our next question is from Mike Dahl of RBC Capital Markets.","Mike Dahl","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Marc, the first question and I want to follow-up on the EMEA discussion and you talked about some of the rebalancing around the kitchen, but it sounded like there is kind of some retrenchment and reallocation of resources there as well, could you give us a little more detail around whether there is an underlying cost plan and whether we should expect some pull back in some of the non-kitchen related businesses as you kind of shift your focus back here?","Marc Bitzer","Mike, let me just try to address it. I mean first of all there is a short-term rebalancing of the volume which is more related to specific trade actions and floor spaces where we can get it which is typically more of a free stand. The kitchen takes as I mentioned before a little bit longer. I think what you referred to in my prepared remarks in terms of call it focus portfolio optimization and basically it comes back to the European business is very different market by market asset by asset. And of course we are looking at certain very specific assets in terms of the way we have generated the kind of value which we expect is an alternative way to get some value out of this one or should we do alternative paths for some of these assets. That is not across Europe but very specific out of countries of product categories where just structurally you need to step back and say does it make sense from a shareholder perspective and that\u2019s part of the effort which we are looking at. Coupled with further cost reductions, Europe has had actually an unfortunate little bit loss in results, but it\u2019s the cost take out was on track, in line with what we had in mind from integration and acquisition. But obviously given the volume trends over the last 18 months you have to dig deeper and that\u2019s the effort which are undertaking right now.","Mike Dahl","Got it, okay. And on a broader note around the cost takeouts I think you guys mentioned that there are some offsets around your ability to obtain the gross cost takeout targets originally envisioned just given the lower volumes, but I think if I look across our coverage and what companies are typically doing in the face of these rising raw materials rising freight costs, it is digging deeper across the portfolio to if anything lean into cost actions and whereas now we are seeing the cost takeout figure come down against a rising inflation environment, can you just help us bridge that a little bit more and are there other outside what we just talked about in EMEA, what are some other actions you can take to recapture some of this?","Jim Peters","Yes. So Michael this is Jim and let me kind of start and then Marc can fill in here. To begin with it late last year we announced the $150 million fixed cost takeout program for this year which we are on track to achieve and halfway through the year we have got about half of the benefits we expect to see in there. The second thing is on our ongoing cost productivity and we have kind of talked about this earlier while with what we are seeing progress we are seeing some that offset with the increased freight and warehousing and oil costs that we see and we don\u2019t put that in our raw material bucket. So right now that is an offset. But the third thing is especially within the second quarter here and I talked about this some with the free cash flow outlook. As we are bringing our inventories in line and reducing some of our working capital levels, but that\u2019s primarily by bringing our inventory levels in line with where sales have been and demand has been in the first half of the year. And that\u2019s caused us to incur a conversion to take a hit within our conversion costs within our factories. Additionally with as we look at within the first half of the year with the Brazilian truck strike most of the costs of that as we were unable to produce and deliver goods is sitting within that. So we do expect the second half of the year to see more a positive type of picture from ongoing cost productivity.","Marc Bitzer","Yes. Michael again, I will echo what Jim was saying. First of all, what is really important for you from an analyst perspective if you look at it, when companies talk about inflation you got to keep in mind inflation which hits across a number of parts of our business. What we put in raw material is literally only steel, the direct resins and some base metals. And by and large all our inflationary elements sits technically as we showed on this ongoing cost productivity, so we have higher freight costs because of the shortages or if you have labor inflation, all these aspects they reduce the ongoing cost productivity of course that impacted us. The second part is what Jim was alluding to was really important. We exited the year with elevated inventory levels and we decided to take down inventory levels in a very aggressive manner. And as you have seen our inventories are flat to even down versus last year end of Q2. What is also basically beyond the volume decline in Q2 we took additional actions to reduce our production and of course as such had a de-leveraging in our conversion costs and that was material and significant and that was reducing the ongoing cost productivity. On a go forward basis and that gets back to your question, of course we are doubling down on all cost initiatives and we are shifting some resources into what further cost reductions you can do either on variable costs or on fixed costs.","Operator","We will take our next question from Alvaro Lacayo of Gabelli & Company.","Alvaro Lacayo","Good morning, I just wanted to touch on Latin America, the full year guidance seems to incorporate a rebound in the second half, maybe if you can just go over the dynamics that impacted the second quarter and maybe make some comment around what gives you the confidence that you will be able to improve from Q2 given that consumer confidence seems to be declining over the last few months and in Brazil particularly?","Marc Bitzer","Alvaro, it\u2019s Marc, first of all structurally I mean that the Q2 results were impacted by Brazil. What we call lower North i.e. from Mexico down was actually in a very healthy state and we had good business there and we also expect that going forward. We do consider and we have said that in our remarks before despite all things [ph] out, the Brazil trucker strike was temporary one. Now to be more specific in May it cost us almost 30% of the sales in Brazil and so that was substantial. And the industry and us, I am talking about the broad industry not just appliance was slow to recover from that one because it\u2019s still quite a while to get the trucker availability back etcetera, etcetera. So that\u2019s loss in Q2 is just there but at the same time we considered temporary, because what we will see from the June and July trended back to normal trend. Having said all of that, probably until the elections in Brazil are over I think you should not expect a big boost from consumer confidence. I think that we would still expect the Brazil industry to be about flat on a full year base, so no major momentum probably until the elections. But again I want to echo we do consider the Q2 impact temporary and then you got to keep in mind Brazil had solid Q1. If you take out the trucker strike it would have been a solid Q2 and that\u2019s what we expect on a full year basis.","Alvaro Lacayo","Got it. Thank you. And then with regards to EMEA and now the additional actions that are being taken maybe if you can discuss when you will begin to see in a meaningful manner sort of the benefits from the additional actions being taken and how you see that you reset 4 to 5 by 2020, but maybe if you can give a little bit more color in terms of timing of how you see these benefits flowing through the business and when you will begin to show improvements as time goes on?","Marc Bitzer","Alvaro, first of all I want to come back to 2018, in our guidance we adjusted the European margin guidance to minus 1%, that\u2019s what we have right now based into the numbers and that\u2019s what is you see there. You put that on top of a first half, it basically tells you the second half we would expect to be above breakeven. And that is based on our current actions in short-term, levers which we can pull in the second half. So again in the second half we expect to be about breakeven and we also guided towards this 2020 4% to 5% and I would expect with 2019 it\u2019s too early to give specific region numbers is somewhat midpoint in between.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning everyone. First question I just wanted to kind of better understand a couple of the comments around Europe and Marc you have just mentioned that you are expecting may be closer to breakeven in the back half as opposed to down 2% to 3% in the first half, at the same time you have commented that it will be hard to regain some of the floor space in the meantime, I guess particularly on the kitchen business and you have leadership changes going on, so I was just trying to understand what are the specific actions that give you confidence in getting to breakeven in the back half, you had mentioned a little bit of cost, maybe a little bit of other businesses getting some poor space back and also how does this interact with the leadership changes, because it seems like you have kind of already putting in promotions, different elements of the strategy, do you have had new leadership in place already or is it internal movement and you are already kind of pushing some strategy forward and you are just kind of putting in the personnel to implement that?","Marc Bitzer","So Mike let me just address it. So like in any business there are certain things you can do in the short-term and there are certain things which take a little bit longer. In the short-term, again we are guiding to breakeven and above amidst implied in the entire full year margin for Europe. There are certain floor spaces and trade businesses which you can regain in the short-term, particularly around the free standing business and there is also certain markets that just \u2013 certain things are moving faster than other markets. What takes longer to regain the structural profitable of the kitchen business, because again as we have said before that is typically tied to either annual contracts or what is also very typically in kitchen that the floor spaces are negotiated on an annual basis, it\u2019s not something to regain shorter. So again the freestanding business and I would say in particular in some of the Eastern European markets, but also to some extent, we can regain floor spaces a little bit faster other parts take a little bit longer. So the reset in strategy that is not something which we are counting on completing the back half of \u201818. but there is operational measures which we can take in the back half of \u201818. What is encouraging is that at least our volume loss got a little bit less every month in the quarter and that\u2019s what we have pretty much seen also now for Q3, so things are slowly getting in place. The every element is we have taken additional cost action towards the end of a quarter in Europe and got some benefit out of this one and that will carry also into Q3 and Q4. So we have added some further cost actions for the back half which will help us to regain that breakeven.","Michael Rehaut","And just in terms of the leadership changes, could you give us any color there how much is in place, how much will be in place over the next few months? And then I had a follow-up on second question just on inventory levels you had mentioned kind of a reduction in trying to get that in line. Does that further impact margins in 3Q versus 2Q as is you have some inventory rationalization and that kind of reduces factory optimization or can we expect across the board kind of more of a stable narrative there?","Jim Peters","I think Michael, let me \u2013 I will take \u2013 this is Jim, I will take the inventory one first here and just say that as we mentioned we believe we took most of the actions within Q2 to bring our inventories in line with us that at the end of Q1 where they were higher than the prior year, once we got to the end of Q2, they were even to the prior year or better. So we have worked that higher inventory level out and then throughout the back half of the year, we expect to continue to reduce inventories, but it will be on what we expect to be a slightly higher level of demand than we saw in certain markets within the first half of the year. So, we don\u2019t expect significant impacts within the back half of the year due to reducing inventories.","Marc Bitzer","So Mike, the short answer to you, these are changes we announced, but internally last week, we have a change of President in Europe until we name the successor, I will at interim run it. I have run year before, so I know the market very well, but of course that\u2019s not a permanent and long-term solution, but expect us to announce the former successor in the next one or two quarters.","Operator","And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d be happy to return the call to our host for any closing comments.","Marc Bitzer","As we wrap up here the call, let me also try to summarize some of the key messages on this call, which is also on Page 20. First of all, we delivered strong global margins on the front, but we delivered solid global margin expansion despite the significant macro challenges. We will continue to take actions to mitigate those headwinds and are pleased with strong sequential improvement to global price mix. We have also delivered strong margins in North America despite cost inflation in what we believe is a temporary soft U.S. industry and this performance highlights the fundamental strength of our business and we are taking finding strong actions to restore profitability in Europe region and we remain confident that our global business is well-positioned to deliver improved ongoing margin expansion and an all-time record ongoing EPS in 2018. So thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you again in our third quarter earnings call on October 25.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude our conference call.

We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation, beginning on Slide 37, for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Fettig","Well good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. In our press release this morning, we reported record revenue and ongoing earnings for the second quarter. As expected, the global economic environment continue to be challenging with currency volatility and weak emerging market demand, primarily in three core countries for us in emerging markets. First in Brazil, we saw a decline in demand of about 12%, Russia was down about 25% and China was down about 3%. At the same time, our integration activities in Europe and Asia are progressing well, and we will continue to accelerate these integrations as we move into the second part of the year.","As we outlined in April, we\u2019ve deployed actions to deliver second half margin expansion and those plans are on track to deliver record revenue and ongoing earnings performance for the year. Our ability to deliver these results in this environment reflects the strength and focus of our execution and the benefits of our expanded global operating platform.","I\u2019ll now turn to Slide 5 to briefly review the financials. You\u2019ll see here that we had strong revenue growth year-over-year in the quarter. Excluding the impact of currency, our revenues were up 25% versus last year. Our ongoing business earnings per diluted share were a second quarter record at $2.70, compared to $2.62 last year and this was primarily driven by strong earnings growth in Europe and Asia. Our free cash flow was slightly higher compared to last year, primarily due to the stronger \u2013 strong working capital management, partially offset by the impact of our acquisitions.","On Slide 6ix, you see that we\u2019re reaffirming our ongoing business EPS guidance with ongoing EPS forecast for the year of $12 to $13 a share and we expect to generate approximately $700 million of free cash flow. Turing to Slide 7, you can see that our business properties, which we\u2019ve shared previously for the year, are unchanged, and we believe that are fully aligned where we see growth and margin opportunities.","There\u2019s three core areas where we\u2019re driving opportunities for the year. Certainly, our integration activities in Europe and China, as I mentioned, are on track and we expect to accelerate those integrations in the second half. We have deployed cost-based pricing and inflationary and currency markets and we continue to focus on cost productivity programs around the globe. Combined, we believe these will expand our margins in the second half of the year. We do also expect our investments in new products and growth beyond our core business \u2013 our core appliance business to continue to drive both revenue growth and margin expansion.","Finally, I just reference Slide 8, where we outline what we\u2019ve showed you before, our long-term growth strategy, which we believe remains on track. We continue to leverage multiple opportunities for growth in our market expansion, which fall under three main pillars: geographical expansion, product and brand innovation, and leveraging our right-size fixed cost structure. So in summary, we are making good progress so far this year, and we expect to deliver record sales and ongoing earnings in 2015.","So, with this, I will turn over to Marc Bitzer.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. Let me begin on Slide 10 by reviewing North America\u2019s performance in the second quarter, starting with the top line. Net sales of $2.7 billion for North America were up slightly compared to the prior-year period and nearly 1.5% excluding currency. Our second quarter ongoing business operating profit was a record $290 million, or 10.8% of sales, compared to $285 million in the second quarter of 2014.","We continue to expand our operating margins behind the strong ongoing cost productivity and fixed cost leverage. While we\u2019re pleased with our second quarter margins, we did experience a few challenges. One, Canadian currency continued to be unfavorable with roughly 14% year-over-year devaluation and we have already executed cost base price increase to offset that impact.","Two, due to very strong demand for our newly launched products, including our new KitchenAid line, we experienced some short-term capacity constraints. We have made several investments to improve our capacity for these new products and expect to meet demand in the second half. Three, we also adjusted our production levels to appropriately match inventory risk demand. These challenges had an unfavorable impact of approximately $40 million on our second quarter margins. As you might recall on our fourth quarter conference call, we provided operating margin expectations of 10.5% to 11.5%. After a strong first half, we are already at the lower end of that range.","And turning to Slide 11, we layout our second half actions to continue improving margins. We believe the industry is on track to grow by 4%, consistent with our expectations for multi-year recovery. If our new products fully floored, we expect to continue leveraging consumer demands to drive improved price mix and volume growth in the second half. And our previously announced Canadian cost-based pricing actions are designed to offset the impact of currency. And we will also continue to deploy a strong cost productivity plans. We expect these actions combined with our normal seasonal improvement to deliver growth and margin improvement in the second half of 2015, consistent with our prior expectations. And on Slide 12, we highlight our new suite of black stainless steel KitchenAid appliances. These products are designed to bring professional-style appliances, without a commercial stainless steel look, and has been exceptionally well received in the U.S.","I would now share the second quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, as shown on Slide 14. Sales were $1.3 billion, compared to $0.7 billion in the prior year, driven by the integration and continued recovery in Western European demand. Ongoing operating profit was the second quarter record of $56 million with ongoing operating margins of 4.2%, compared to $2 million and 0.2% in the second quarter 2014. During the second quarter, positive volume, ongoing cost productivity and the planned acceleration of integration activities more than offset the unfavorable impact of currency and lower demand in Eastern Europe, delivering yet another quarter of significantly expanded operating profit and margin.","On Slide 15, as we look towards the full-year 2015, we expect our integration activities to continue building in the back half. For 2015, we expect the industry to be up 0% to 2%, although it is currently trending at a higher-end of the range as Western European demand recovery is more than offsetting the weakness in Eastern Europe, most prominently in Russia and in Ukraine. The benefits from previously announced cost-based price increases are designed to offset the impact of currency.","And in summary, we remain focused on accelerating integration activities, ongoing cost productivity programs and growth from new product launches, both within and beyond the core. And on Slide 16, as an example of product leadership in the region, you can see our new Whirlpool branded refrigerator that is designed to optimize food preservation by reducing freezer burn by up to 50%.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mike.","Mike Todman","Thanks, Marc. Let me begin with our Latin America results on Slide 18. Compared to what we shared on our first quarter call, the macro environment in Brazil has weakened further and currency has remained significantly devalued. As a result, sales for the quarter were $854 million, down approximately 22% from the same period of prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased 1% from the prior year period.","Our ongoing business operating profit for the quarter totaled $36 million or 4.2% of sales compared to $87 million and 8% in the prior year period. These results included an unfavorable operating profit impact of $25 million due to currency and another $10 million due to reduced production levels. These impacts were partially offset by previously announced cost-based pricing, the benefits of cost and capacity reduction initiatives, and strong results in our appliance business outside of Brazil.","On Slide 19, we layout our actions to improve margins and return to run rates more reflective of our expectations. We now expect 2015 industry for Latin America to be down approximately 15%, reflecting the further deterioration in Brazil. As mentioned earlier, currency continues to be a challenge for us, as we expect the reais to U.S. dollar exchange rate to be between $3 and $3.25. As discussed on our previous call, we have executed strong and decisive actions to offset the impact of the demand decline and currency devaluation. These actions include previously announced cost-based pricing, new product launches and fixed cost reductions.","And in the weaker demand environment, we are taking additional actions targeting fixed cost reduction to improve margins. Additionally, in the first half, we rebalanced production levels to match reduced demand, and we will continue to monitor and adjust if needed for the remainder of the year. It is important to note that we expect to see the impact of all these actions beginning in the second half of 2015, at which time we expect to deliver improved operating margins compared to the first half. As we implement these actions, we expect margins to strengthen in the third quarter and then to grow significantly in the fourth quarter.","While we will likely be lower than our long-term margin expectations for Latin America, we believe we have the right actions to address the operating environment and improve the trajectory of the margin profile. Turning to Slide 20 as a demonstration of our global leadership in the laundry category, we launched a Whirlpool laundry product with the smart load system that reduces water consumption, in addition to delivering best-in-class capacity and superior washing results.","Now turning to our second quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 22. Net sales were $381 million in comparison to $211 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by the impact of the integration. We have delivered a second quarter record ongoing profit of $31 million, compared to $4 million in the prior year period. Ongoing operating margins were 8.1%, up significantly compared to the prior year period, behind the record performance in India and the expanded benefits of integration activities in our expanded China business.","Turning to Slide 23, we continue to see favorable macro trends in India and negative macro trends in China. Our industry guidance for Asia as a whole is flat. In summary, for 2015, we expect continued growth from our integration activities, strength in India, and as a result continued strong margin performance in the second half from our larger growth platform. On Slide 24, you can see our Diqua front-load washing machine with a five-inch interactive display and a sensor that reduces vibration and noise. This product is an example of how we continue to leverage products from the integration to accelerate our growth in China.","Now, I would like to turn it over to Larry.","Larry Venturelli","Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. Let me start with our second quarter results on Slides 26 and 27. As Jeff mentioned, we have record net sales and ongoing operating profit during the quarter. Our revenues were $5.2 billion compared to $4.7 billion last year, an increase of over 11%. Currencies impacted our revenues by nearly $650 million, EBIT margins by 1.75 points and net earnings by approximately $1 per share. The diversification of our regional profit contribution, cost and capacity reductions, ongoing cost productivity, and benefits from our acquisitions, more than offset the headwinds we\u2019ve discussed. And as expected, the company delivered record ongoing earnings of $2.70 per share up from the $2.62 reported last year.","Allow me to make a few more detail points on our financial results. First, SG&A as a percentage of sales on a GAAP basis increased by one 1 point, approximately half of this increase is due to acquisition related costs with the remainder primarily associated with the deleveraging effect of a weaker demand environment in Brazil. We do expect the SG&A margins to return to prior year levels, as we realized integration synergies, additional fixed cost reductions and higher volumes in the second half. Additionally, the interest in sundry line improved year-over-year, driven by a gain from a business investment in Brazil, which had no impact on ongoing earnings.","Finally as shown on Slide 27, on a GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 32% and year-to-date is approximately 20%. We continue to expect our full-year tax rate to be between 22% to 25% for both GAAP and ongoing earnings. On Slide 28, we reaffirm our guidance for ongoing business earnings of $12 to $13 per share here, as well as our expectations of approximately $700 million for free cash flow.","Turning to Slide 29, let me make some additional comments, regarding expected earnings per share drivers for the second half as compared to the first half of 2015. We expect strong second half earnings, given the seasonal ramp up in demand of our business and the benefits from actions we have already taken. In North America and Europe, we expect demand growth to continue, in addition to the price mix benefit from prior product transitions and our new product launches.","In the second half, we expect our previously announced price increases will be in full effect in Canada, Brazil and Russia. As a result, we expect $1 in earnings per share from price mix and another $1.50 from normal volume seasonality in the second half. And additional $0.50 in earnings per share improvement is expected from ongoing cost productivity and positive raw material trends. Our acquisition integrations are firmly on track in Europe and Asia and we expect an additional $0.50 in the second half as those synergies continue to ramp up throughout the year. Finally, we expect currency to drive a negative $0.75 in earnings per share impact, primarily due to the translation effect of higher seasonal volume in the second half.","In summary, we expect earnings per share to accelerate in the second half, as our previously announced cost-based price actions, ongoing cost productivity, acquisition synergies and price mix benefits ramp up to more than offset the negative currency impact. And as a result, we expect to deliver between $7.16 to $8.16 per share in the second half from an EPS perspective.","On Slide 30, you can see an update on the progress of our restructuring and integration activities in both Europe and Asia. We incurred $90 million in restructuring expense and $65 million in benefits during the first half, which was consistent with our expectations. For the full year, consistent with prior guidance, we expect $300 million in expense and $175 million in benefits. And as previously discussed, these benefits are more weighted towards the second half of the year. As we continue to grow revenues and improve margins, we have solid priorities to deploy the cash generated from our business as shown on Slide 31.","In the second quarter, we continued our balanced approach to cash allocation. In addition, we raised our quarterly dividend by 20% and $0.90 per share and repurchased $50 million of stock through our share buyback program. We also signed an agreement to purchase the American Dryer Corporation, which closed in early July. In summary, given our profitable growth trends, increased investment capacity and strong balance sheet, we continue to balance funding for all aspects of our business to ensure the best long-term value creation for our shareholders.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff Fettig","Thanks, Larry. Well, just to sum up our priorities, as you\u2019ve heard throughout the call, have remained focused on the successful integrations in both Europe and Asia and we have very strong operational plans to deliver the expanded margins we\u2019ve discussed for the year. These actions do include cost-based pricing and \u2013 already communicated the key markets as well as cost productivity programs.","Overall, we expect these actions to move us towards the run rates more representative of what we outlined in our long-term planning. Our strategy is progressing well and we continue to execute many actions on the three paths I described earlier, in terms of providing opportunities for both revenue growth and margin expansion. And we continue to believe that these plans provide us with an outstanding opportunity to not only have another record year this year, but also to deliver significant shareholder returns.","So, with that, I\u2019m going to close our formal remarks and I would like to open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Megan McGrath [MKM Partners]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Megan McGrath","Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I wanted to start on North America \u2013 pardon me. First on the demand environment, it does look as if you may have underperformed the overall market a little bit in the quarter, I know that there are some differences between your numbers and AHAM, but was that part do you think of the inventory adjustment or was there sort of more aggressive pricing happening in the quarter that you decided not to participate in?","Marc Bitzer","Good morning, Megan, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer. I\u2019m going to take your questions. First of all, let me just reiterate what I said in the couple of previous calls also. First off all, our reported unit shipments versus a T6 market share what you typically see were not fully comparable. We sell more of just T6 major appliances. We also report non-T6 major appliances as well as Canada and Mexico units. We\u2019ve also have extended \u2013 expand business made of many products, like small domestic appliances.","So, obviously, you should focus on revenue growth and margins. And as you know, we delivered strong margins and we did deliver growth in Q2. Admittedly, that growth lacked industry and it\u2019s important to keep a few issues and I will get to your question in mind with regard to our second quarter unit performance. One, we completed one of our larger product transitions in the middle of the quarter with a rollout of a KitchenAid suite of kitchen products, which is a side note. The last time we did that was 10 years ago. So, this is a very significant product launch. Because we have been transitioned in large product lines for much of the past few quarters, we haven\u2019t yet seen the full capability of our new product lines in the market.","Obviously, going forward, we expect that the healthy growth from these new products in the markets. Second, during the quarter, we saw stronger than expected demand for our recently launched new products, while our production capacity is still ramping up. We\u2019ve made investments to improve our capacity, and we also expect to see marked improvements in the third quarter and fourth quarter as a result.","And thirdly, yes, during the quarter, we did see some moderately aggressive promotional activities from a few competitors, which we choose not to participate in. As an example, we saw validate strong promotions in front-load laundry, where we sustained dumping by certain imports or top-mount refrigerator and we\u2019ve seen promotions in spite of cost increases due to the energy efficiency investments. So, whenever there is a promotional activity in the market, we evaluate whether or not, we can create value for our shareholders and rank [ph] by participating. When we see value, we participate. When we don\u2019t see value, we do not participate.","Megan McGrath","Great, thanks for that. And I just wanted to clarify. You mentioned in your opening remarks, a $40 million negative impact, was that just from the inventory adjustment or was that all three things that you mentioned, the Canada, the product transition and the inventory adjustment?","Marc Bitzer","Megan, it\u2019s Marc again. It\u2019s all three things combined.","Megan McGrath","All three things, okay.","Marc Bitzer","So, and of course that is a rough estimate, but that gives you a sense in terms of probably what our potential in Q2 was.","Megan McGrath","And can you give us any sort of breakdown of what was the biggest impact of that 40?","Marc Bitzer","No, I mean, we took it \u2013 first of all, the 40 is already a rough estimate. So, it\u2019s kind of difficult to really break it down to components. But the inventory adjustment was a big part. Back to you other question, Megan, just trying to bring our working capital levels in line before we saw as a top-line growth from the first half of the year.","Megan McGrath","Great, thanks. I\u2019ll get back in the queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from David MacGregor [Longbow Research]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David MacGregor","Yeah. Congratulations on some of this progress. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about Latin America and specifically you\u2019ve referenced pricing initiatives aimed at offsetting FX. Can you talk about your level of confidence in the Latin American price increases for holding and what\u2019s obviously difficult macro-environment? And then secondly, if you could just maybe provide a little bit of color on your non-Brazilian Latin American business, you said it was doing better, if you can maybe give us a little more elaboration that would be helpful? Thanks.","Mike Todman","Yes, David, it\u2019s Mike Todman. With respect to the price increase in Brazil, in fact, we held as well as holding our market share. So we had sequentially flat market share and the pricing has held and that\u2019s what\u2019s allowed us frankly to offset the huge currency impact, as well as the demand \u2013 the market demand environment, but pricing is absolutely held. In terms of the business outside of Latin America, actually we saw a growth of around 12% in that business. So that business continues to perform very well and we saw a significant as well improvement double-digit in operating profit from that business. So, we feel very good about that in the markets outside of Latin America.","Jeff Fettig","David, this is Jeff. I just add to that, in Brazil in particular, when we say \u2013 there is really three impacts. There is obviously the demand environment, which is negative. We have the devaluation year-over-year of about over 40%, so you have the translation impact. And when we talk about pricing offsetting currency, it\u2019s really offsetting the inflation consequences of the currency in the Whirlpool market. Well, we will not offset translation currency.","David MacGregor","Okay, thanks. And then if I could squeeze one more in. And just if you could comment on raw material deflation and you know your competitor adjusted their guidance for the year, any thoughts on how you\u2019re tracking versus that $100 million target, is it possible that you might have ultimately outperformed that number in the second half?","Larry Venturelli","Yeah, David, it\u2019s Larry. As we stated in our prepared remarks, we do expect a higher second half contribution of about $0.50 per share versus the first half from net productivity, which would include materials versus our first half performance. During our last call, we did say that materials would be approximately $100 million lower this year and you know I\u2019d say if current commodity rates hold, it could be better than that. We\u2019ll see how the rates continue to evolve, but we\u2019re confident in $100 million and we are \u2013 if rates continue to improve, we should potentially have some upside. I would mention that, it\u2019s important to remind \u2013 remember that we are experiencing headwinds in currency, which in currency outside of the U.S. and from when you\u2019re purchasing U.S. denominated current commodities.","David MacGregor","Okay. And if you are to revise the raw material guidance, would that also imply that you\u2019d be revising your cost synergy guidance on Indesit, given that a large portion of the early stages in the synergies are raw material related?","Marc Bitzer","David, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer, I can take it. No, in a nutshell, we wouldn\u2019t because, when in the particular \u2013 Indesit in particularly applies what Larry just outlined. You still have a large amount of purchases in U.S. dollar denominated. So, even while you may see increase in tailwind from a raw material side, it\u2019s pretty much eaten up by currency a bit, because you buy still in the U.S. dollars.","David MacGregor","Got it, thanks very much.","Jeff Fettig","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Denise Chai [Bank of America Merrill Lynch]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Denise Chai","Okay, thank you. Just going back to Latin America, could you talk about how Brazil performed during the quarter? I mean even just over the course of the quarter, do they continue to deteriorate, and how are you looking at the back half? And could you be a little bit more specific in terms of where you expect second half margins to come in?","Mike Todman","Yeah. Denise, it\u2019s Mike Todman. During the quarter, what we saw was just a continued deterioration of the overall market environment. So and as you all know, it\u2019s kind of the political crisis that\u2019s been led to an economic environment and challenging environment. And, the fact of the matter is, what we\u2019ve said is, we\u2019ve adjusted our outlook for the year to now minus 15%, which implies that the second half will be slightly worse, if you will than the first half. The first half was about minus 14%. So, we continue to see a fairly challenging environment.","What we\u2019ve done is obviously adjust our business to that particular market demand environment. And so, the actions that we\u2019ve taken, including the cost-based price increases, which we\u2019ve already announced, but we\u2019ve taken some significant fixed-cost reductions and are taking more just to make sure that we can improve the margins. I\u2019m not going to give you an exact margin number for the second half, but we do expect for it to improve significantly, substantially over the first half.","Jeff Fettig","Denise, I would \u2013 it\u2019s Jeff. I would add that I mean clear of the two variables are \u2013 right now are demanding currency and they moved quite radically. Our assumption, we\u2019ve kind of laid down is that it\u2019s pretty much stays the same as where we see it today. But if you accept that, I would just say as I said in my comments, we expect over time our Latin American business to deliver double-digit operating profits. We clearly didn\u2019t with all this in the first half. We won\u2019t get there in the second half, but we will be \u2013 if those assumptions stay the same, we will have significant improvement from what we see in Q1 and Q2.","Denise Chai","Okay, got it. Thank you. And then, just in North America \u2013 sorry, you have the $40 million negative impact in the second quarter. Will there be anymore of that to come in the third quarter from Canada\u2019s upon transition et cetera?","Marc Bitzer","Hey, Denise, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer. I would say, on the capacity constraints, we\u2019re slowly working our way out and again that\u2019s just normal ramp up as we launched brand new product line. And capacity in this case not only our own production capacity, it\u2019s also applied capacities. So that\u2019s been a normal ramp-up coupled with strong demand. So, I would say it\u2019s largely behind us. The inventory adjustment is completely behind us. And the Canadian currency unfortunately not actually \u2013 this week it got worse. So, I think it would \u2013 it\u2019s a mix bag, but I would still characterize the majority of issues are behind us.","Denise Chai","Okay, got it. And just really fast, the value of the strong promotions that you saw in the second quarter, have those continued as well?","Marc Bitzer","First of all, Denise, you\u2019ve got to bear in mind that there\u2019s certain promotion of [indiscernible] throughout the year, and obviously July 4 is a key element. So, right now, we\u2019re kind of end of July or mid July, there\u2019s no active big promotion out there. And it\u2019s too early to speculate on what might be happening on Labor Day or on Black Friday. But what I would like to emphasize is the promotions were not across all categories. With our certain categories, it is just our choice when to participate or not to participate.","Denise Chai","Understood, thank you.","Marc Bitzer","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Ken Zener [KeyBanc Capital Markets]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ken Zener","Good morning, gentlemen.","Jeff Fettig","Good morning, Ken.","Mike Todman","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zener","I might have more than two questions. So, if we look at Brazil LatAm, Jeff, I think \u2013 and Mike, please jump in. 1Q was down 20, the mark was down 15. You said LatAm net overall you now expect to be down 15 versus 10 to 12. But your comments seem to be that Brazil is getting weaker, but with all that decline, your 10 to 12, down to 15. Is that all Brazil and what does that mean about the second half comp? Is it seems like you have kind of stabilized in May. So, did it get worse since May and how much was attributable to Brazil versus other markets? First question.","Jeff Fettig","When we refer to the market data, Ken, we\u2019re only talking about Brazil. And I don\u2019t know that it got worse, it\u2019s just been consistently bad kind of since the first quarter and it\u2019s still bad. We thought \u2013 when we talked in April that it might not be as bad in the second quarter given we\u2019re comping against a weak prior year World Cup driven type of thing, but it just stayed double-digit negative. And so, our view is \u2013 given the environment there right now is that we don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s going to change that in the very near-term.","Ken Zener","Okay. And again respectfully, but it seems like it got worse from where you had kind of talked about and I think Mike you alluded to the margins being second half better than first half. It\u2019s specifically they are being a big ramp in 4Q versus 3Q, where I think before the baseline was kind of at the back half would it be 9% to 10% margin? Could you give a little granularity there to the extent your pricing in the quarter was very strong at 2015 price mix versus your down volume 2014, so what\u2019s causing that I guess delay in that margin expansion that what Mike referred to a significant in 4Q versus 3Q in the second half versus first half?","Larry Venturelli","Hey, Ken. I think \u2013 it\u2019s Larry. I think what\u2019s important to remember is Brazil has had to take out a lot of production in the second quarter to meet that demand. So while we are \u2013 well Mike is absolutely right. We are getting the price mix of some very strong price mix. You have two things happen. One is productivity from taking inventories down and with the lower sales base right now, you\u2019re not getting as much leverage on SG&A.","We expect that actions we\u2019ve taken, the right-size inventories are largely behind us now. The price increases we\u2019re taking are now in full effect, which should continue into the second half of the year. And then I think the combination of those in the fixed cost reductions we\u2019re taking, the exit rate for Latin America will exit at a nice strong margin.","Jeff Fettig","And there is also the normal \u2013 even there depressed demand levels are still the normal seasonality. Q4 is going to be a much higher volume, although lower, much higher volume than Q3 as Q3 is traditionally one of the weakest seasonal demands.","Ken Zener","Okay. And then how much does currency plays into not only in terms of how it translates, but in terms of how you\u2019re bringing right inventory to be then priced in. It sounds like you gave a currency of 3 to 3.25 for the reais, which would be I think it was kind of just above 3 when you guys reported in April. So you kind of had another 4% or 5% deterioration there, it seems in that currency, does that play into that delay of EBIT?","Jeff Fettig","Well. You know actually, I mean it\u2019s been all over the management I think even in April, it\u2019s 335.","Mike Todman","335.","Jeff Fettig","So, we again, we got two critical assumptions on the Latin America, and Brazil forecast. And, that\u2019s currency levels, which we\u2019re just saying that we\u2019re basing our \u2013 of our discussion around where our planning is that it\u2019s going to be between 3% and 3.25%, and it\u2019s kind of right in the middle now. And the demand will remain basically negative by about 15% for the full year. Now, those can change, but that\u2019s what we base things on. And, that \u2013 and, based on that environment, we know our pricing actions and our cost actions, taking into count those negatives will improve as we go throughout the year.","Ken Zener","Okay. And, I guess this last one for North America. Mark, you referred to seasonality being stronger in the second half versus the first half. Just looking at them out, I mean there is a lot of different variance, but it generally seems like you\u2019re on the order of 100 basis points higher than the second half, because that volume leverage. Would that be a fair characterization? Thank you.","Mark Todman","Yes, Ken, it\u2019s Mark. So, first of all, on the margins particularly, as you recall, we gave a guidance or expectation of 10.5% to 11.5% full year. We finished Q2 with 10.8%. We still firmly believe that we\u2019re in that range on a full-year base, which also tell us in the back half clearly margins, on the average or to the high-end of that range. Back to your point, [indiscernible] versus certain amount of volume leverage in part of Q3, there is also certain seasonality, in particular, of a small domestic, which lifts typically out Q4. So, it\u2019s a combination of both volume leverage and the seasonality of certain products.","Ken Zener","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll move to [indiscernible]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to inquire, what was the organic volume growth in EMEA and the Asian businesses? And your margin performance was a lot better than we were expecting. Now, I was just wondering to ask you, how much in the back half, can we see further expansion?","Marc Bitzer","Bob, it\u2019s Marc. I maybe start with the Europe piece. So, I\u2019m glad to hear that the margins meet your expectation, but it didn\u2019t meet our expectation very exactly in the range of what we guided towards. On a full year basis, we guided European margins 4% to 5%. We finished Q2 with 4.2%, which is encouraging that we\u2019re already in Q2 in that range. We do see a further margin expansion and probably more to the high end of that range and that is largely coming from a build of synergies and restructuring activity. There is some top line growth. On your question about the top line growth, I understand, obviously, in particular, when you look at revenues, it\u2019s a little bit confusing that\u2019s exchange rate. In local currency, i.e., in euro, we had a very healthy growth, pretty much across all base business despite our now much stronger exposure in Eastern Europe.","Mike Todman","Okay. And Bob, let me just talk about China. We had a strong growth in China. I think it was slightly over 80%. If you look at both businesses combined in fact, we picked up market share. But, it\u2019s a lower demand environment in China than we had originally thought it was going to be. So, we\u2019re on a minus 3% or so market. So, that obviously, impacted the total volume, but the growth was about in line with what we thought it was going to be. In terms of our margins, we were at 8.1% margins for Asia and we guided at the beginning of the year to be between 7% and 8%. So, we\u2019re already at kind of top end of that range and that\u2019s what we expect.","Jeff Fettig","And there is some seasonality in emerging markets in Asia as well. Second quarter \u2013 first and second quarter were good, third quarter is usually weak and then fourth quarter it recovered. So, there is some seasonality effort. To Mike\u2019s point, we\u2019re pretty much in track in the way we want to be.","Unidentified Analyst","That\u2019s good and I just want to get a little clarification on your North American volume outlook for 4% growth. I was just hoping, you could slice a little bit, is the benefit by your implied guidance would point towards mid single-digit unit volume growth. And is that a function of working through the inventory destocking or is that a sign of better organic demand and sustained consumer spending on appliances. And if you get that, if the second piece of that\u2019s right, it is better consumer demand, would you expect to see firmer pricing. Thanks a lot and good luck.","Marc Bitzer","Bob, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer, again, let me just comment on the volume outlook. As you may recall, the very beginning of the year we guide towards 4% to 6% than we kind of \u2013 a little bit more [indiscernible] that\u2019s what we technically still have today. And that\u2019s all based on Q1 being a little bit softer, Q2 actually being in a reasonably healthy shape, and if you basically do the math that would imply a back half volume growth in the market of 4% to 5% just to get to the math.","I would see \u2013 I would say, first of all, we have seen as of the second quarter pretty sustained healthy sell-in and also increasing sell-out trends. So from today\u2019s perspective, we absolutely firm behind this one, and we\u2019re also firm behind our \u2013 what we said long-term positive prospect and the growth in the U.S. markets.","Jeff Fettig","Just to add to Marc\u2019s comments, if you just look at last three months AHAM, would have probably been \u2013 we\u2019ve been averaging about 4.5% growth.","Unidentified Analyst","Right. And just if I could speak one, if you capture that kind of growth, do you think you\u2019re going to get a pricing boost as well?","Jeff Fettig","No. Bob, we can\u2019t really comment about what we think others are going to do. We know what we\u2019re doing. We said very clearly, we think we\u2019ll amp up our growth rate with the full availability of our new products, and that we fully expect to expand margins.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Sam Darkatsh [Raymond James and Associates]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Sam Darkatsh","Good morning, Jeff, Larry, Mike, Marc. How are you?","Jeff Fettig","Very good, Sam.","Mike Todman","Very good.","Sam Darkatsh","Two questions if I could. One a clarification question, Larry. On Slide 42, I think you\u2019re mentioning interest in sundry expense of $100 million for the year. I think that was $150 million targeted last quarter, what\u2019s the reasoning behind that variance?","Larry Venturelli","The interest in sundry and the GAAP, if you look at the GAAP financials, that Sam I believe, the favorable delta is the one-time gain, this in GAAP results, this on a business gain in Brazil investment \u2013 business investment in Brazil. That\u2019s in GAAP, but not in ongoing results, okay. It\u2019s just in GAAP. Visibly, we have right now on an ongoing basis for interest in sundry, you\u2019re probably looking at about $130 million for the year.","Sam Darkatsh","Make sure I\u2019m understanding that because the non-GAAP and GAAP gets a little confusing for me. So, back half of the year, what should interest in sundry be then on average?","Larry Venturelli","Yeah, $52 million in the first half and figure is going to be $130 million for the full-year and then you got your second half.","Sam Darkatsh","Got you. Thank you. And then, the other question and if I \u2013 and if you mentioned this, Mike I apologize. In Latin America, I think you were trying to stabilize or rationalize retailer inventories in the quarter. Where are you in that process, where are retail inventories? Have they stabilized? And would you imagine that sell-it and sell-through look like each other in the second half?","Mike Todman","You know, well, Right now, we did make the adjustments that I talked about in terms of overall demand. We think we\u2019re about where they need to be, but it does all depends now on demand going forward. So, we made all the adjustments that we thought. We think the inventories are more in line, but all depending on demand in the second half, we\u2019ll see. But right now, we\u2019re comfortable with where we are.","Jeff Fettig","And we\u2019re comfortable with where we are and assuming that the market is down by 15%, but we\u2019re comfortable. If it changes radically either direction and obviously we\u2019ll adjust.","Sam Darkatsh","Very helpful, thank you gentlemen, I appreciate it.","Jeff Fettig","Thank you.","Mike Todman","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","Thank you. Next we\u2019ll move to Michael Rehaut [JPMorgan Securities]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks for taking my question. Good morning, everyone. First question, just going back to the capacity constraints in the quarter in North America with the product transitions. Do you have any sense of what that might have impacted the top line volume in that segment?","Marc Bitzer","Okay. Mike, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer again. I would say on a total revenue base but it\u2019s just rough estimate, it\u2019s a low single-digit percentages, but very low. It\u2019s up 2% or 3% in that ballpark. And that\u2019s just because A, KitchenAid suite launch, it\u2019s a fairly complex and taking it\u2019s an entire kitchen set of products across multiple factories, and you just need to get them all ready to ship it. And two, we\u2019re still in the tail-end, but now have a very tail-end of this huge laundering refrigeration change. But as we know, we\u2019re pretty much started Q3 last year, now we\u2019re at the tail end and we have huge demands against certain products like Mimix where we\u2019re just still ramping up our production capacity. And the...","Michael Rehaut","Okay. So that 2% to 3% you\u2019re referring, that\u2019s the impact on the North American segment.","Marc Bitzer","That\u2019s on the North American. And again that\u2019s roughly \u2013 that\u2019s a rough indication.","Jeff Fettig","And the mix \u2013 margin mix on that kind of product is substantially higher than the line average.","Michael Rehaut","That\u2019s helpful. Also can you just describe quickly the acquisition you mentioned at the end of the prepared remarks, I believe you said the American Dryer Corporation closed in July?","Marc Bitzer","Yes and Michael, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer. Again, the American Dryer Corporation is active in the professional commercial laundry segments. It used to be a supplier of our, so we know them for many years and it\u2019s what we would describe as a nice tuck-in acquisition in our non-core business. The reason why we like commercial laundry, it\u2019s inherently \u2013 it\u2019s a healthy margin business, cash accretive; it fits perfectly in our \u2013 grow beyond and then expand beyond the core business, so it\u2019s a nice tug-on. We didn\u2019t reveal or communicate because we have an agreement with the seller any purchase price. Obviously, it\u2019s only a fraction of previous acquisition, so it\u2019s a much smaller one and then we now stopped our integration activities.","Michael Rehaut","And just a sense of rough size of revenue and when you say healthy margins below or above the line average in North America?","Marc Bitzer","We should be don\u2019t get into the details, but American Dryer Corporation is kind of \u2013 I think it\u2019s a largely published, it\u2019s a $40 million, $50 million revenue business. It\u2019s not a huge one, that\u2019s why we call it a tug-in acquisition.","Michael Rehaut","Perfect. One quick last one if I could, just the Asia margins. I think you referred to continued expectations for continued healthy margins in the back half and you\u2019ve already done pretty well in the first half. Does that imply margins in the back half similar to the first half or should it drift higher perhaps with the acceleration of integration benefits.","Marc Bitzer","No, I think, Michael, you can expect \u2013 there\u2019ll be plus or minus within the range that we gave 7% to 8%, so similar, we don\u2019t see any expansion. And as Jeff mentioned, there\u2019s seasonal business in Asia and third quarter is generally the lowest quarter in terms of volumes and sales and then in the fourth quarter it kind of ramps backup. So the margins will be kind of commensurate with that.","Michael Rehaut","Perfect, thanks for your help.","Marc Bitzer","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Next we\u2019ll move to Eric Bosshard [Cleveland Research Company]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Eric Bosshard","Two things, first of all in North America, I understand the difference between that AHAM and your units, so curious on how you view your market share performance in the second quarter and also what your expectation is in the second half of the year?","Marc Bitzer","Eric, its Marc Bitzer. I mentioned before, our top line revenue even though growing, admittedly lack industry demands, which also implies our market share just in Q2, is slightly down year-over-year. That\u2019s the fact. Okay. It is, if you read in between my lines from my previous comment, it\u2019s not across all products. This is certain categories where we saw high promotional activities or where we ran into some capacity constraints. So, is that our expectation going forward? No, it\u2019s not. But we will also, you know we basically add value principles as we\u2019ve done in the past.","Eric Bosshard","Okay. And then the, just to clarify a little bit, the KitchenAid, you\u2019re missing 2% to 3% of revenue, is a pretty material number, what was that, what you expected, was there something that was different than expected that didn\u2019t allow you to come through with the capacity? I would just love to understand that? A little bit more especially considering that you also were taking extended downtime, it sounded like elsewhere in the business to balance inventories? Can you just help explain that a little bit?","Marc Bitzer","Yeah. Eric, it\u2019s Marc again. With 2% to 3% applied to KitchenAid and the capacity constraints on the laundry transition in particular. So, it\u2019s \u2013 and a little bit to refrigeration, but it\u2019s largely laundry, a little bit of front-door bottom mount and the kitchen. So, it\u2019s all three businesses. So, it\u2019s not KitchenAid on its own. Particularly, the laundry one that is very frankly, it\u2019s much stronger demand coupled with a shift of inventory back into the top loader and that\u2019s where we\u2019re just ramping up in terms of overall capacity.","On the KitchenAid, to some extent that\u2019s you could say as expected, because you know, the kitchen suite, you don\u2019t launch every year. As I mentioned before, we \u2013 the last KitchenAid suite was launched 10 years ago. So, this is a pretty complex undertaking, the flooring and retailer. So, it\u2019s just, we knew it would drag a little bit for one quarter or two quarters and that\u2019s just what it is. The good news is the reception [indiscernible] very, very strong.","Eric Bosshard","Okay. Your participation and promotions in the back half of the year is the discipline similar to 2Q, such that you could still like the industry, is that how we should be thinking about you strategically?","Marc Bitzer","Eric, as you know, we typically don\u2019t comment on forward promotions et cetera, but, I think we \u2013 you see in the last three years to four years that we had a very good discipline around how we manage our margins, how we expand our margins and how we drive certain promotions and you should expect that going forward.","Jeff Fettig","Eric, I just \u2013 I mean, we feel pretty good, pretty confident about our ability to win share through our new product innovations by creating demand for them as opposed to buying share, and that\u2019s a discipline. Every quarter, it may go up or down, but we think there\u2019s a value creating way to do it, and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re doing it.","Eric Bosshard","And then secondly, in terms of Europe, the margin progress there has been impressive. And I know that there are announcements that come out over there about your capacity efforts there. I\u2019m just wondering, if you could give us a little bit more color on what you\u2019ve accomplished to date and what else is coming here in 2015? It sounds like there is an expectation, there is more synergy benefit there, but if you could expand a little bit on what you\u2019re doing with the Indesit and what\u2019s your core capacity in Europe?","Marc Bitzer","Eric, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer again. So, first of all, yes, the Indesit acquisition in Europe is a fairly complex and frankly, of a challenging task. But so far, it\u2019s \u2013 I mean it\u2019s very, very well on track. It\u2019s almost like a clock work, which was not [indiscernible]. In terms of the major restructuring announcements, so far in the press and in our filings, we basically had referred to three ones, one was kind of a high level SG&A, which is largely a leadership team; two, what we call the Italian industrial plan, which is a significant undertaking across our Italian factories, in terms of capacity rationalization; and three, was a relocation of an R&D center, and goes up in R&D center in Germany.","So, these were the three ones which we announced. Throughout the first half, there are obviously, big elements and big blocks, but we\u2019re well on track and we signed these agreements already. In a broader scheme of things, we\u2019re exactly consistent with the framework which we\u2019ve made at the beginning of the year about the full-year restructuring expenses and benefits to expect that.","So, I would say, yes, it\u2019s fully on track, but it also tells you, just by the fact that we just signed some of these agreements now. You obviously, don\u2019t yet see the benefits in the first half and you will only see a fraction of it in third quarter, but now it\u2019s starts building every quarter, because we know it signs. It\u2019s now needs to be implemented and that just takes a certain time.","Eric Bosshard","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next, we\u2019ll move to Jay McCanless [Sterne, Agee and Leach]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jay McCanless","Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask on North America, could you give us some color about what you\u2019re expecting for the back half of the year in terms of currency translation effects, or is that \u2013 and how much of that would you guys contemplate with the recent move, higher in both the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar?","Marc Bitzer","Jay, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer again. As you pointed out, obviously, for North America, it\u2019s the peso and the Canadian dollar. The peso has weakened, yes, but keep in mind, we have a certain element of natural hedge because we also produce in Mexico. So, when the peso moves, it hurts us on the top line, it does not necessarily hurt us on the bottom line. So, margin-wise, causes less concerns. Top-line, of course, they will always hurt you, okay. And that\u2019s also embedded in already our Q2 numbers.","Canadian dollars were different, because we [indiscernible] from the U.S., where year-over-year, we have a dramatic change, it\u2019s fully impacting margin. We had now a number of cost base price increases in Canada, which we implemented. But as you can tell also, right now, Canadian dollar went down, weakened to $1.29, which is an average deterioration versus Q2. So, yes, that impact will be with us throughout the back half, both on top line, which is fairly significant on the North America level, but also on the bottom line, as we are catching up on the cost base price increases.","Jeff Fettig","But there will be a drag at today\u2019s level in the second half.","Jay McCanless","Okay. But it \u2013 but that potential drag you think is already captured in the guidance that you provided?","Marc Bitzer","Yes, it should be....","Jeff Fettig","Yes, it\u2019s embedded in the guidance....","Marc Bitzer","And it should be less assuming the currency range that we have forecasted remains there, as our pricing catches up with that.","Jay McCanless","Got it, okay. And then, just I missed some of the comments you made about SG&A. Did you \u2013 I would assume that SG&A should deleverage in the back half of the year. Did you guys give specific targets for that?","Jeff Fettig","We said we will return to prior year levels for the full year. So yes, you\u2019re right, we will have leverage.","Jay McCanless","Great, thank you.","Jeff Fettig","Thank you. Yes, we have one more question.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take that question from David MacGregor [Longbow Research]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David MacGregor","Yes, thanks for taking the question. Can you just talk a little bit about your North American builder channel business, and what you\u2019re seeing in terms of demand conditions in growth and to the extent, which your share their maybe be improving? And then secondly, maybe if you could just talk a little bit about share repurchase program, you\u2019re active in the quarter. Is it your intent at this point to maintain a fairly regular cadence or are you trying to purchase a little more opportunistically? Thank you.","Marc Bitzer","So, David, you just sneaked in two questions, I\u2019ll take the first one. So, first one, the North American builder two components the demand and I know there has been some noise about the demand. We continued to see strong sustained demand on U.S. housing. I wouldn\u2019t see any sign, which makes us change our opinion compared to what we\u2019ve said several quarters ago. To put back clearly housing starts, we still expect $1.1 million for this year and next year you can probably put it somewhere between $1.3 million, $1.4 million in the ballpark. So, we see sustained or even stronger demand, driven by household formation and increased consumer confidence.","David MacGregor","Okay, Marc. Could you remind us just what that represents as a percentage of your North American business?","Marc R. Bitzer","Yes again, it\u2019s careful \u2013 I\u2019m careful about dotting down number, because you have two parts of the bill-to-business you have a direct bill-to-business, which we do have a national contracts and then of course you have a lot of small bill-to-business which typically flews for Home Depot and Lowes. So, you have two components, it\u2019s kind of \u2013 but it\u2019s a healthy component of our North American business.","So having said that in that channel, as you know, we made over last three years or four years, I would say substantial market share improvements and we are certainly from direct bill-to-business where we know the contracts that are stable to slightly increasing. So, we\u2019re very satisfied and very bullish going forward in the North American bill-to-business.","Jeff Fettig","Share repurchase from capital allocation David, we\u2019re going to continue to apply same methodology we have over the last several years as far as funding the business. We do have a debt-to-cap ratio, which we stated one to one and a half times, we\u2019re at well above that with the acquisitions. We have repurchased over $1 billion of stock over the last several years. We\u2019ve recently increased the dividend and as we shown again we have opportunistically take advantage of M&A. So, we\u2019re not going to give you a target or what we will be repurchasing, but we\u2019ll balance all of those elements going forward.","David MacGregor","Great. Thanks very much.","Jeff Fettig","Thank you, David, and thank you everyone. We look forward to talking to you in October. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect at anytime and have a great day."],"23094":["Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call July 23, 2014 10:00 AM ET","","Executives","","Christopher Conley \u2013 Senior Director-Investor Relations","Jeff M.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Chris Conley.","Christopher Conley","","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s second quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Presidents, Mike Todman and Marc Bitzer; as well as Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation\u2019s future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and other periodic reports, as well as on Slide 2 and in the appendix of this presentation.","Turning to Slide 3, we want to remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 39 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","","Well, good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As you saw in our earnings release from earlier today, overall, our results were largely in line with our expectations. As we\u2019ve managed through a challenging short-term global demand environment. Our second quarter ongoing business earnings per share were up 11% versus last year, and these results were primarily driven by record profits in our North America business. Overall, the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong. we received global demand trends improving, and we expect second half earnings to ramp up due to a variety of reasons.","If you turn to our financials on Slide 6, excluding the impact of foreign currencies, our revenues were up about 1% versus last year. Our ongoing business earnings per diluted share increased by 25%, or up approximately 11% to $2.62 compared to $2.33 last year.","Turning to Slide 7, and factoring in the first half actual performance for industry demand, we have revised our regional industry demand assumptions. Globally, we expect second half industry demand levels to improve versus first half. For North America, and specifically the U.S., we have revised our industry demand assumption to be up about approximately 5% per year.","We did have a slow start for the year in January and February, but March \u2013 since March, March through June, we\u2019ve had very strong growth over 6%. So this adjustment really just reflects the slow start, which we saw in January and February.","In Europe, we see about the same. we continue to expect flat to up 2% industry for the full year as a region continues its recovery. For Latin America, we are revising our industry assumption to flat to minus 3% for the full year. Again primarily due to the short-term impact that we expected and saw from this year\u2019s World Cup and some uncertainties around government elections in Brazil. And finally our Asia industry forecast is flat for the full year, with China being down for the year and India being up. Again overall we remain very confident in the underlining fundamentals of our business and have multiple opportunities to achieve profitable growth.","Today our business performance has put us in a very strong position as a company. This has allowed us to enhance our returns to shareholders as we announced in April dividend increase and $500 million share repurchase authorization. We have significantly increased our brand and product investments and we will see acceleration in new product introductions in the second half of the year.","But at the same time we are significantly improving our global operating platform. And this has demonstrated by our recently announced agreements to purchase majority stakes in Indesit Europe and Hefei Sanyo in China. This will allows us to significantly increase the scale and size of our operations in both of these important markets in the world. So on total we are very well positioned we are on track for a record year of operating performance. And we are setting up a platform for future growth and very strong value creation.","So at this point in time we will get into regional details and I\u2019d liked to turn it over to Marc Bitzer.","Marc R. Bitzer","Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. Let me begin on slide 9 by reviewing North America\u2019s record performance in the second quarter. Starting with the top line, net sales of $2.7 billion for North America were up 3% compared to the prior year period and up 4% excluding currency.","So operating margins expand by 60 base points in the quarter due to unit volume growth in US major appliances and the benefit of ongoing cost productivity along this cost and capacity reductions. More of an offsetting unfavorable currency and higher material cost, we also increased our investments for our brand marketing and support of new product launches that drives continued growth.","Our ongoing business operating margins were 10.6% for the quarter, the record second quarter, ongoing business operating profit $285 million compared to $262 million in the second quarters of 2013. The consistent and disciplined execution of our actions resulted in the fifth quarter of year-over-year revenue growth and the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin improvement.","Now let me take a moment to talk about our expectations for 2014 as shown on slide 10, overall we were pleased with our record operating profit in the first half. US appliance demand has rebounded from a slow winter start as March through June T7 industries up 6.6% compared to the prior year. However we are adjusting our full year industry forecast to approximately 5% which is the lower end of our previous guidance range as we don\u2019t expect benefit to fully make up from a slow start with 7% growth level. Macro economic indicators point to a strong second half as we are seeing the lowest unemployment rates in September 2008.","New housing starts and existing home sales are improving and live in ranges of our expectations for the year. And finally we believe strong replacement demand will continue as consumers replace older appliances for our innovative energy efficient product. In addition we expect positive net cost productivity from our ongoing programs to accelerate in the back half of the year. And in the second half of the year we are excited to launch many innovative new products in almost every four business product category. We are also driving growth beyond our core business as shown by our recent announcement that Procter & Gamble to introduce a revolutionary at-home clothing care system called Swash. And our expansive fleet of launches within the KitchenAid small appliance business.","Turning to slide 11, you can see an example of our new Maytag dishwasher that is part of our new Maytag brand design that follows our successful Maytag Man brand campaign. Maytag dishwashers are our quietest dishwasher ever with strengths to handle tough loads. It also features in the industry exclusive stainless steel silverware basket and a tiered upper rack to hold large plate and taller items.","I will now talk to the second quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region as shown on slide 13. Sales were $746 million, compared to $731 million in the prior year, excluding currency, sales decreased approximately 3% year-over-year.","The cost and capacity-reduction initiatives, which will put in place combined with ongoing productivity programs and improved product mix, have delivered another quarter of positive operating profit. Operating profit of $2 million improved by $8 million compared to the prior year period and operating margins improved 110 basis points.","Now turning to slide 14, our market environment in the Eurozone remains somewhat soft and expect \u2013 and we are seeing some recovery and expect normal seasonality as we progress throughout the year. We expect positive operating profit and margin expansion driven by continued benefits from our ongoing cost productivity programs, and our previously announced restructuring initiatives. And we continue to focus on our innovative new product launches and growth beyond our core, specifically with the growth we\u2019ve seen in the KitchenAid small appliances categories within Europe, Middle East and Africa.","Turning to Slide 15, as Jeff mentioned, we were extremely pleased to sign the binding agreements to become majority shareholder of Indesit. We are trying a 66.8% voting stake in Indesit from Merloni family for \u20ac11 per share. To date, we have acquired 4.9% of voting shares of Indesit. Value of this transaction is \u20ac758 million, or approximately $1 billion.","In addition to the share price, Whirlpool would assume indebtedness of Indesit front loading, and we intend to pay for this acquisition with cash on hand together with private, domestic and international public debt financing. And we expect judicial and the regulatory approvals by the end of 2014. Once the transaction is closed, we will launch a mandatory tender offer in accordance with Italian law to acquire additional shares.","Slide 16 highlights our opportunity to create significantly more efficient and value creating appliance business in Europe. With a tremendous strategic fit for complementary country positions, products, brands and distribution, and with efficiencies in R&D, capital spending and value chain costs, as well as operational scale, which increased volume and more effectively, integrating our product platforms.","Now given our proven track record of generating value with our acquisitions with high confidence and our ability to execute this transaction successfully, and we expect to more than double our presence in the world\u2019s largest appliance market and create value for our shareholders. Once we complete the integration for the reason that I previously described, we expect our combined European business to EBIT margin of 7% to 8% and free cash flow generation of 6% to 7%, which will make Europe a significant contributor to the overall financial results of Whirlpool Corporation. And we expect it will take about three years to fully achieve its benefit.","Following the closing of a transaction, we will provide investors with our detailed plans on how we intend to create this profitable growth and shareholder value with recent important acquisition in Europe. And now, I would like to turn it over to Mike.","Michael A. Todman","Thanks, Marc. If you turn to slide 19, you will see our Latin America results. As expected our second quarter results were primarily impacted by lower demand as consumers focused on ground goods purchases during the World Cup. Sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion, despite industry volumes being down approximately 17%, our net sales excluding currency and BEFIEX decreased approximately 4% compared to the previous year.","We continue to gain share both year-over-year and sequentially as we benefited from our compelling brands and the beginning of new product introductions. We also benefited from previously announced price increases for which the benefits will accelerate and increase in the second half of this year. Our ongoing business operating profit for the quarter totaled $87 million compared to $111 million in the prior year period.","Improved product price and mix was more than offset by lower unit volumes, higher material cost, and foreign currency. GAAP operating profit totaled $87 million compared to $135 million in the prior year period which included $24 million of BEFIEX tax credits.","Turning to slide 20, for our expectations of the region and given the continuation of the World Cup in July and the government elections in Brazil, we are now lowering our industry assumption to flat to down 3% for the year. However, we continue to believe that the macroeconomic indicators in Brazil point a long-term healthy demand growth as unemployment is at historically low levels below 5%. Real wages are growing, inflation is within the target range, and debt as a percent of income is primarily driven by increased investments in housing.","All of these signs are positive for appliance industry growth. We also expect to continue outperforming the industry and growing our revenue given our strong market position and current competitive environment. Our recently announced price increases will impact the second half by helping to offset negative currency impacts and significant levels of inflation experienced throughout the year. And we are launching over 100 new models in the second half across all product lines and with exciting innovation.","In summary, we do expect the strong second half performance in our Latin America business due to the already discussed price increase benefits, the launch of exciting new products and the tough currency comparisons being behind us.","Our second quarter results in the Asia region are shown on slide 23. Overall market demand will soft, but improved versus the first quarter as the Chinese economy continues to grow at a more moderate pace. In addition to the overall slow down in China, our business was down significantly. Our trade customers began reducing their Whirlpool inventory in anticipation of the integration with Hefei Sanyo and the expected delivery of new product lines. This resulted in a sales decline of over 80% for the second quarter compared to prior year period and therefore had a significant impact on margins and production.","We expect that after the transaction closes, we will return to far more positive revenue growth as we launched our new integrated product lines. The short-term trade actions are having a significant impact on our current business due to reduced shipments and production volumes as indicated in our adjusted guidance.","Post-approval, we are confident this acquisition will put us in a very strong position as we entered 2015.","Net sales during the quarter were $211 million, compared to $246 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 9%. GAAP operating profit of $4 million, compared to $14 million in the prior year, and operating margins declined 370 basis points, compared to the prior year period. The benefits of cost based price increases in ongoing cost productivity were more than offset by the trade adjustments of volume in China, higher material costs, and foreign currency.","Turning to slide 24, we continue to execute ongoing productivity actions and cost based price increases across the region to offset inflation and currency and to execute new product launches. We are also on track to become the majority shareholder of Hefei Sanyo to accelerate our growth in the emerging Chinese market.","As shown on slide 25, and as previously announced, we are in the process of acquiring a 51% stake in Hefei Sanyo for approximately $547 million. Hefei Sanyo\u2019s expanded distribution, competitive products, and complementary manufacturing combined with a proven management team and significant capacity to enable growth will provide us with an outstanding platform for growth in China.","As you can see on slide 26, the approval process in line with our expectations, and we have received the majority of the required approvals for this transaction over the past 12 months. The transaction remains subject to the Chinese securities regulatory commission approvals, tax clearances, and payment approvals as well as share registration at closing. We continue to expect the transaction to close by the end of this year, or possibly by the end of the third year.","Investment, integration, and transition cost, which began in the second quarter, will have a negative impact to earnings and cash during 2014. However, once combined, we expect this transaction will be meaningfully accretive in 2015, which would be the first year post-integration.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Larry.","Larry M. Venturelli","Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone. Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we are on pace to deliver another record year of ongoing business operating performance as shown on slide 29. We are adjusting our full-year guidance to reflect the impact of investment and integration cost related to the pending acquisitions of both Hefei Sanyo and Indesit.","As Mike mentioned, our trade customers in China are reducing their inventories and anticipation of our integration with Hefei Sanyo, which is impacting both our GAAP and ongoing EPS guidance by approximately $0.50 per share. And the pending acquisition of Indesit in Europe is impacting our GAAP EPS guidance by $0.25 per share, as we incur additional investment expenses in 2014.","Our guidance for annual GAAP diluted EPS is now in the range of $10.30 to $10.80 per share, and annual ongoing business diluted EPS is now $11.50 to $12 per share, which represents a 15% to 20% improvement versus a year ago. Our expectations for 2014 free cash flow of $600 million to $650 million now reflect the impact of these two adjustments.","Overall, the underlying fundamentals of our business remain very strong as we continue to invest in our business and bring innovative products to our consumers across the globe. As I speak to the financial results on slides 30 to 32, you will see how we continued to expand our ongoing business operating margin in the first half, and expect to deliver another balanced approach towards margin expansion, resulting in an 8% plus margin for the full year.","For the first half, price mix was up 0.5 point, and we continue to expect to realize 0.5 to 1 point of margin, driven by our cost based pricing increases, innovative new product launches and growth beyond our core business. Our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives contributed another 0.5 point consistent with our full year guidance.","For the first half, our cost productivity more than offset material cost inflation of $100 million to deliver a positive quarter point of margin expansion. Our ongoing cost productivity for the year is on track to more than offset approximately $150 million to $200 million of year-over-year material cost inflation, and expected to deliver a positive 0.5 point of margin through 2014.","As planned and previously communicated, our increased marketing technology and product investments, primarily reduced margins by a 1 point during the first half. And we expect them to have a negative 0.5 to 1 point of margin impact for the year. Overall, our fist half margins were firmly on track with expectations and consistent with our expected full year improvement.","For the second quarter, ongoing business operating profit benefited from improved product price and mix, ongoing cost productivity and the benefits from cost and capacity reductions, lower volumes, largely attributable for the short-term impact from the World Cup in Brazil, higher material cost, unfavorable currency and investments in marketing, technology and products, negatively impacted results.","We continue to expect a stronger second half as we introduced a significant number of new products, productivity ramps up, Latin America price increases fully take effect and tougher first half currency comparisons are behind us. We believe our expected margin improvements combined with positive revenue growth will enable us to deliver strong double-digit improvement in ongoing business earnings per share during the second half.","Graph on Slide 33 illustrates expenses associated with our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives. The actions we have been taking over the past couple of years, and into 2014, represented generational change to our footprint in cost structure. The additional cost and capacity-reduction actions we took early in year, which we addressed this out by recovering European market and continued to expand our margins.","For the first half, we incurred approximately $63 million of charges, and for the full year, we expect approximately $100 million of charges and $80 million of ongoing benefits. As we continue to improve margins and grow revenues, our plans to deploy the cash generated from our business are solid, as shown on Slide 34.","We are funding the business for growth and significant product introductions in the second half, including capital expenditures between $625 million and $675 million for the year. We\u2019ve recently increased our quarterly dividend on the company\u2019s common stock and authorizing the share repurchase program.","Finally, as previously mentioned we are on track with our acquisition, majority stake in China\u2019s Hefei Sanyo and have recently announced our intention to purchase the majority stake in Italy\u2019s Indesit. In summary, given our profitable growth trends increased investment capacity and strong balance sheet, we will balance funding for all aspects of our business to ensure the best long-term value creation for our shareholders.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","","Thanks, Larry. I\u2019ll summarize our expectations for this year on Slide 36. As we mentioned, we are expecting to significantly ramp up our second half earnings, based on what we\u2019re seeing our improvement in global demand trends, our continued investments in our brands and new products will support a very strong lineup of new innovative product introductions during the second half. We are achieving higher prize mix, which should continue an accelerated rate in the second half, and finally, the normal higher seasonality of productivity, we fully expect to happen.","Additionally, as I mentioned in the previous remarks, the Hefei Sanyo acquisition provides us a true transformation on growth opportunity in China. We will more than buyback to our size in this very important emerging market. And the Indesit acquisition in Europe provides a various significant opportunity to position our European business for competitiveness, leading the growth and ongoing value creation; both of these transactions are on track to close by the end of the year. We remain confident in our ability to deliver another record year of operating performance in 2014.","Further out, I would like to turn to slide 37, which really highlights how we\u2019re creating multiple paths to profitable growth. First, I would remind that our North America region, we believe we are still in the early stages of the replacement cycle, as well as a multi-year housing rebound, and as we mentioned in the last call, we\u2019re beginning to see improvements in discretionary demand.","So we see several years ahead of us with good industry demand growth. Secondly, our pending acquisition of Indesit in Europe is a very important part of a comprehensive strategy and provides us to improve our competitive position in Europe, and very importantly, create a consistent and meaningful source of value creation for our shareholders.","And again, Hefei in China establishes a broad platform for growth in China\u2019s emerging market, which still has world levels of appliance penetration, as we will 10x our distribution throughout that country. We also have very good opportunities to increase appliance penetration and continue to gain market share throughout the Latin American regions, given our strong brands, our proven gains of innovation and overall cost leadership.","In addition, as we continue to expand globally, we have opportunities to fully leverage our fixed cost structure, and ongoing cost productivity programs to ensure our competitive position and continuing to improve our margins. We have a strong cadence of bringing innovative products to consumers and leveraging the best brands in the appliance industry around the world.","We are driving both revenue and margin world by also extending and expanding beyond our core appliance business, where such products that you\u2019ll see on KitchenAid small appliances line, which will now sell in the many, many markets around the world and also, our water business where we\u2019re growing in all parts of the world.","So in total, we believe these multiple paths to profitable growth provide us with great opportunity to achieve our value creating objectives and we will ensure that we continue to deliver strong value creation for our shareholders.","So with that, I\u2019d like to end our formal remarks and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from Michael Rehaut, JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Michael J. Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. good morning, everyone.","Jeff M. Fettig","Hi, Mike.","Michael J. Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","First question I had was actually, and obviously a lot of activity in China and Europe, but I wanted to focus on your biggest region, the North American market, and specifically, just get a little bit of incremental color if possible on the trends during the quarter, as you mentioned, volumes improved in the second quarter and maybe perhaps not enough to maintain the overall shipment guidance. But if you could go into a little bit more detail in terms of the competitive market, if you view from a competitive standpoint, if incentives or discounts in the industry are stable, how you\u2019re seeing some of the different end market drivers, new construction versus repair a model, any kind of interesting trends from both the end market perspective, and the pricing and discounting perspective.","Marc R. Bitzer","Hey, Michael, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer. Thanks for the questions, it\u2019s obviously, 10 questions embedded in one question. So let me try to give you \u2013 split it up in both industry and then our own performance in this quarter. First of all, on the industry, if you just look at the second quarter, the U.S., the market actually has grown 5.8% in T7, which basically the exact in the range of what we earlier indicated 5% to 7%, and the reason why that\u2019s exact from the range is because the underlying macroeconomic indicated are exactly what we have them, i.e., if you look at housing starts, we continue to see above $1 million, existing home sales (indiscernible) new number we always said it\u2019s slightly above $5 million, it is slightly above $5 million and unemployment rates are favorable, or getting better.","So I would say from a fundamental growth drivers from a market, nothing has changed, the only difference on a full year perspective is just kind of the last six or eight weeks that we have in Q1, I don\u2019t think the markets are strong enough to just mathematically make it up for rest of the year.","But the underlying run rate of the industry, we still see in the original 5% to 7% range, and that\u2019s an important factor and everything, which we see today on current trends are exactly confirming that direction. You ask about the overall promotional environment, I would say same comments as I made the last earnings call, by and large unchanged, there\u2019s always promotions in the market, we participate when we can create value for our brands and our shareholders. And if we don\u2019t see, we don\u2019t participate.","So we don\u2019t see a radical change in the second quarter, based on promotional activities. If you now come a little bit more to our own performance in the second quarter in the units and I also saw in the earlier analyst reports, I think there may be some confusion out there. Yes, it is true, that for Whirlpool North America, we published 0.6% volume decline.","However, it is very important that we made that point earlier, these units encompass way more when these T7 industry shipments, which typical people compared to. In these units, (indiscernible) 6% it\u2019s the T7, it\u2019s the additional major domestic, which we call T12, it also includes Mexico, it also includes Canada, and it also includes more domestic appliances.","If you would just go down to the T7, which we don\u2019t think we don\u2019t typically publish, but we have roughly a mid single-digit unit growth, which would indicate that we\u2019re pretty much held our market share by and large. And that is despite, and that is an important despite, us having availability issue on our laundry products, which is our biggest category. But it is also important to note these availability issues are behind us they were Q2 events and they are behind us and we are fully back on track.","Michael J. Rehaut \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","That\u2019s a great answer. I appreciate all the detail, just as quick second question for Larry, if I could, the guidance coming down about $0.50 on an operating basis, fully attributable to the China trade inventory issues, but additionally, your industry outlook for several regions was notched down a little bit. So I was wondering if there was anything in the overall view that\u2019s kind of offsetting a look for a little bit of reduced volume if that\u2019s from the margin side or corporate expense or any of the other line items?","Marc R. Bitzer","","Yes, Michael we mostly took down our industry guidance assumptions in North America, Latin America and you\u2019ve seen the Asia adjustment reflected in our guidance, I think the thing to point out is that if you look at countries like Latin America, where we are gaining share and we are benefiting from price increases that is largely enabled us to offset the industry guidance change.","Jeff M. Fettig","Michael this is Jeff, I would add to give the industry assumptions for demand are marginal. And they really reflect what\u2019s already happened in the first six months. So, on a go forward basis we feel actually pretty good about run rates for demand and on top of what we can do in the second half. So we see a actually improving demand revenue growth environment for the second half.","Larry M. Venturelli","","I just add Michael, if you look at the half point sales run rate we mentioned a few things, Marc mentioned January, Feb weather had a lot of currency in the first half, World Cup availability, China customer inventory reductions, if we strip that all away, our half one run rate is in the mid single-digit. And that certainly supports what we would expect in the second half of the year.","Marc R. Bitzer","Okay, next question.","Operator","We will take our next question from Denise Chai with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead your line is open.","Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, okay, thank you for taking my question. So just in terms of the laundry supply issues that you had in North America, can you kind of quantify how big that was?","Marc R. Bitzer","Hey, Denise its Marc, we are not going to go into the specifics of quantifying it. However it has been material, I mean, laundry is overall biggest category and majors and we basically in preparation for a major product launch which we have in Q3, we had to some what limit the production capacity as we go through this massive shift on the assembly line and the tools. So for temporary that was a about six week issue, but six weeks of laundry (indiscernible) availability have material impacts, I would just directly say its clearly above $10 million, clearly.","Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, got it. And then in \u2013 term can you talk a little bit more about the pricing increase that you are putting through this quarter, and what you are seeing for orders after the World Cup?","Michael A. Todman","Yes, Denise, it\u2019s Mike Todman. We had already talked about in our first quarter earnings call that we had executed that price increase. And what we said is that it would step up over the course of the rest of the year. And so what we are expecting is to see, significant step up in the third quarter and as we go into the second half for that price increase. And to date, July was still relatively soft is because of the World Cup; but what we are seeing is a pick-up in orders and inline with what our expectations.","Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great, thanks. Excuse me, and just lastly in terms of the Indesit acquisition can we get some kind of little bit more detail in terms of your high level thoughts there you mentioned seeing, you mentioned that a 7% to 8% operating margin might be possible in three years, what needs to happen, what do we need to see for that to happen. And what would be the casings of that kind of improvement presented from qualitative; you can into a little bit there. And also you are expecting $80 million of ongoing benefits in 2014 from restructuring, so far we haven\u2019t seen a whole lot. So is that still $80 million for the full-year of 2014?","Jeff M. Fettig","","Denise, this is Jeff, let me answer the last question first. Yes, we actually are seeing some of them Denise, in terms of the improvement of Europe, but they do accelerate in the second half and we will deliver at least $80 million worth of benefits on a full-year basis. As it relates to Indesit in Europe, and first of all, if you just take your public data that\u2019s combined companies are over $7 billion odd company. So we certainly gives us a competitive scale to accomplish a lot of things not similar to some of our past large scale acquisitions in terms of benefits.","In terms of the timing, I would start with and again just based on public data and certainly our business in improving. They indicated through their guidance that their business is improving. So there is a baseline that we believe we can build off of and without getting into all the details it would be really optimizing the opportunities we see of a much larger scale business across the value chain. So and again in terms of timing it\u2019s premature for us to talk about that, but Marc comments of 7% to 8% EBIT company is clearly within our expectations and it does take sometime to ramp up. You ought to think of a ramp up as opposed to waiting three years because we certainly wouldn\u2019t plan to wait for three years.","Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, and let me just slip one more in here. There was a pretty meaningful increase in inventory, could you talk about what was driving that was it timing or something else. And in terms of U.S. retail inventory levels of appliances, would you say that that correction is done because I think you were saying that all year long you had seen sell through exceed sell in.","Larry M. Venturelli","Denise, this is Larry. Our inventories as planned they are up year-over-year, we have significant number of new product launches in the second half of the year and due to that we did increase levels of inventory now. We will bring that level down throughout the balance of the year as we normally do, but we did plan for higher inventory.","Marc R. Bitzer","And Denise its Marc. To your question about U.S. retail inventories, I would say buy and large our sell through of our products during Q2 exceeded the sell in on our products which basically tells you that \u2013 you probably had a slight inventory burn in our branded products in the second quarter.","Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, can you see if that\u2019s done yet, any sense because it\u2019s been going on for quarter while now?","Marc R. Bitzer","","Well, the market is \u2013 consumer market is good, our brands were in high demand. So I think that I can\u2019t predict by retailer, but I think in total we expect to have good demand.","Denise Chai \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you so much.","Larry M. Venturelli","","Thank you.","Operator","","And we will take our next question from Ken Zener with KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Good morning gentlemen.","Larry M. Venturelli","Hi, ken.","Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","So busy quarter here, just we saw some pretty index for you guys (indiscernible) I would just reiterate the usefulness given you guys comments about the market and investors perception. Second, related to the U.S. market given the implied back half volume that you\u2019re talking about for the industry, which you\u2019ve already been doing. Given that it\u2019s a tougher comp in terms of the growth rates last year. What kind of \u2013 from a growth rate perspective given their higher growth rates, what gives you confidence of visibility into that? I mean is it the shipment; is it the declining inventory that you are seeing domestically?","Marc R. Bitzer","","Hey Ken, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer. First of all, I\u2019m commenting the second half against the background of industry assumption; back half is 5% to 7% consistent with what I said earlier. And the confidence which we have on our own volume growth in that environment is a) we have a massive amount of new product launches in particular laundry, but also KitchenAid and small domestic appliances throughout the entire third quarter and then laundry in the fourth quarter, so there is a large number of product launch is coming.","In addition, we know at least in our products trade inventories are low, and we see that as a business right now progresses, we have pretty strong shipments. So that gives us all the confidence for back half and of course we have a pretty firm indication of what we should expect around from the promotion period in Q3 and Q4. So put it all together we are very confident behind our plan.","Michael A. Todman","","Ken, the market data March through June is up 6.5%, July looks good. So we feel pretty confident with it as Marc said.","Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Good. And I guess Marc, you made the comment on or Larry is the $10 million related to the laundry. I\u2019m assuming that is that EBIT or is that sales $10 million?","Marc R. Bitzer","","Hey, Ken it\u2019s Marc. I said significantly above $10 million and it is EBIT.","Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Right, $10 million will be $0.09, okay, so that was good. Now moving on to another thing, such a risk quarter here, the $0.50 ahead in China or related at trade inventory. If tax affects that $50 million I mean again towards $40 million EBIT, my recollection was you guys had north of $200 million of sales. Could you correspond the high EBIT impact relative to the $200 million and why that was \u2013 I guess a surprise to you guys if that wasn\u2019t in guidance already?","Larry M. Venturelli","","Well, original guidance was profitability in China, and as Mike mentioned in his script, sales are down significantly. So it will be \u2013 our base China business which was a loss.","Michael A. Todman","","Yeah, and Ken, as Mike explained that the wildcard in the whole China situation is the timing of the approvals. They set many levels of approvals, we got through most of them very quickly in fact quicker than what we thought on our internal plan. But, we still have that \u2013 as Mike talked the equivalent of the SEC approval as well as the tax and all that. In fact \u2013 as though, our trade partners now believe that ultimately this is going to work out and they are preparing to do business with the new entity and the fact that they are preparing basically they didn\u2019t buy from us. And so we are basically \u2013 until we get this all combined, we\u2019re basically not selling anything in China. And I think we have new lines ready to go and so on and so forth, but again we just need to get this done. We are optimistic we will get it done soon, but there is a transition cost, it was not forecastable simply because the variable of approval.","Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","","Okay, as it sounds \u2013 it seems like the EBIT relative to the sales of $200 million-ish, would imply a very high incremental EBIT versus\u2026","Michael A. Todman","","Well, basically you have all fixed cost and the under absorption, not all was cash, because some of it\u2019s burdening stuff, but yeah, our whole fixed cost structure which we are now reducing very aggressively, but the fact as we\u2019re on, let\u2019s call on the small existing Whirlpool business, we basically don\u2019t sell anything.","Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Yes, we\u2019ve taken a beat in there. Well, I hope the guidance impact this year is a function of the upside when you choose to give guidance for that acquisition.","Marc R. Bitzer","Well, and as Mike said and I think you\u2019re still on the one chart, I mean it will be earnings and cash negative this year, as we absorb all these transition expenses and we do expect the approval this year, but we expect it to be a nice contributor to our overall operations beginning next year.","Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Very good, the next point, Europe, Marc, really we appreciate the 7% to 8% margin in guidance directionally in year three and my calculation that\u2019s roughly 450 in EPS, compared to roughly $0.60 today from Europe. so it\u2019s obviously, very meaningful. Could you address if any, the volume assumptions that would underlie that, or is that simply consolidation of the functions like distribution and overlay in production areas?","Marc R. Bitzer","Hey, Ken. First of all, let me come back to process where we are, we signed, but we have not completed and there\u2019s several approvals that what we have to go through. I would just argue, please bear with us until we close the transaction, and then we will show you all the details about baseline assumption, synergies, restructuring, industry forecast, breakdown and everything including cash flows by year. It is just premature and inappropriate given the state of a process where we are to go into these details.","Kenneth R. Zener \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets","Understood. Thank you very much, gentlemen.","Marc R. Bitzer","Thank you.","Michael A. Todman","Thanks, Ken.","Jeff M. Fettig","Thanks, Ken.","","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jay McCanless with Sterne Agee. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jay C. McCanless \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Good morning everyone.","Michael A. Todman","Good morning.","Jay C. McCanless \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","First question I had is on the small appliances in North America. can you discuss what percentage that is of revenues now, and quantify, and give us some numbers around what kind of growth you saw year-over-year in that business?","Marc R. Bitzer","It\u2019s Marc and first of all, we don\u2019t break down what we have FDA revenues for the rest of our business. However, let me just make a broader comments, we have on small domestic appliances, if you look the last three or four years, we had a really, really strong growth trajectory, very strong, clearly above market average and clearly above rest of the company. We have this year in North America a little bit of setback, which is related to two specific trade partners, who kind of took inventory down, there were some challenges, which I would say is not reflective of the overall long-term growth trend, and it\u2019s also not reflective of what we see for example, in Europe, they are small domestic a third growing heavily. Having said that, we have maybe, one of the largest product launches ever in Q3 in small domestic appliances, that\u2019s why I\u2019m very confident, we very quickly get back on the growth trajectory, but it was somewhat a negative for us in Q2.","Jay C. McCanless \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","All right. and then just one other question with the Maytag has been another \u2013 was a topic conversation in the last conference call and it sounds like a fairly large product launch coming for 3Q, directionally what should we expect for North American operating margins that there\u2019s still going to be a lot of SG&A loaded into there, if you could give us some guidance I\u2019d appreciate it?","Marc R. Bitzer","Yes. It\u2019s Marc Bitzer, again. First of all, in the product launches, the ones which I referred to earlier are multi-brand product launches that were basically, particularly on top-loaders, which is a bulk of our laundry business, where we have a number of launches pretty much from September this year until Q1 next year, almost the entire top-loader line. So that is obviously a big and significant and impact to all our brands.","In addition, we had a number of dishwasher launches, which also continued to progress and some of our product categories, so that is just giving the side of our laundry business is massive and impact of our North America business. As you probably also know, we don\u2019t give margin guidance by region and by quarter. I would just generally say that we have the North America 11 consecutive quarters on year-over-year market expansion and I don\u2019t intend to break that spring.","Michael A. Todman","","And the only thing I\u2019d add to Marc, if you look at our 0.5 margin and what we\u2019re guiding to for the full year, we do expect second half to have a nice margin increase and we would expect that in all three of our largest regions around the world.","Jay C. McCanless \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","","Great, thanks for taking my question.","Michael A. Todman","","Thank you.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David S. MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","","Yes. good morning, everyone.","Jeff M. Fettig","","Good morning, David.","Michael A. Todman","","Good morning, David.","Marc R. Bitzer","Good morning.","David S. MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","","Jeff, congratulations on this, it\u2019s a nice job there.","Jeff M. Fettig","","Thanks, David.","David S. MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","I guess I wanted to give Mike to talk a little bit about Latin America. and so far, the discussion is seemed to have been focusing around the impact of the World Cup, and not as much perhaps on the macro developments down there. and so is it safe to assume that your view on the weakness down there is largely associated with the World Cup and now that\u2019s behind us, we should begin reverting back to a more normal market condition, or is there bigger macro condition down there that really is at play?","Michael A. Todman","No, David as I said in the script, we think that the underlying macro environment is actually pretty good. When you look at on unemployment rates, they were down, real wages are up above 3%, inflation is kind of in that band, it\u2019s around 6%. So we\u2019re actually feeling pretty good about the macroenvironment. there are some things, the World Cup was won. there are some elections going on. so you never know what short-term impacts those are going to have. but largely, we think, we\u2019re going to get back to, certainly a better growth environment and scenario, and if you think about it, in the first quarter, the market was up 10%, and that was down 17% for the second quarter. so what we\u2019re expecting is the market to rebound, and certainly be flat to positive as we go forward.","Marc R. Bitzer","","And David, I would add, as we\u2019ve talked in the past, there\u2019s really three pieces of our Latin America business, as Brazil appliances, there is the appliance business is in all the other 30 market surrounding Brazil and there is our global compressor business. And in fact matter is our Brazil appliance business has been even in this environment, performing extraordinarily well. There was clearly a volume head in Q2, which we fully expected, but even with that, our appliance business performed very well. The real weaknesses have been more international, which I mean, Argentina, Venezuela, et cetera, et cetera, perhaps Colombia is really a strong market in that group.","Although we\u2019re now seeing that improve, and the other part was global compressors, which where we have the big presence in China and with a very, very double-digit decline in the first half of the year in refrigeration that impacted that. so all the pieces were coming back, but I think the one misconception is that our Brazil appliance business is weak and it is not, the market was weak, but our business was very strong.","David S. MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then Jeff, if I can get just you to talk about sort of the discussion that\u2019s in the public forum right now, concerning General Electric\u2019s appliance business and the possible sale of that business, your largest competitor in the builder channel, maybe you could talk about sort of the competitive strength of the competitor vulnerabilities of your builder channel business versus a change of ownership in that business. how does that influence your overall North American competitive situation?","Jeff M. Fettig","","David, I mean I only know what I read about, as you do. So I can't really comment specifically on that situation. I can\u2019t comment on our business is we feel very good about our position in the builder channel itself, we\u2019ve made significant inroads over the last five or six years. And those inroad and start with the fact that we got an outstanding brand portfolio.","We can meet the needs of virtually all price levels of the marketplace which is a huge advantage. So that supported by again that can, we hit even during the downturn. We invested heavily in new product innovation. And then thirdly, we built that market has specific system requirements from ordering, delivering, servicing et cetera, et cetera. And we built up our capabilities which were massive investments over a long period of time. And so we have those capabilities. As does the competitor you talked about. So anyway we\u2019re growing, we\u2019re winning new customers, it\u2019s a market that\u2019s going to continue to grow for sometime. And I don\u2019t see any change in the trend that we currently have.","David S. MacGregor \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","","Thanks, very much guys.","Jeff M. Fettig","Thank you.","Operator","And will take our next question from Megan McGrath, MKM Partners. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Megan McGrath \u2013 MKM Partners","Good morning,","Marc R. Bitzer","Good morning.","Megan McGrath \u2013 MKM Partners","Most of my questions have been answered. But just a couple of quick follow-ups. In Europe does the pending Indesit acquisition put any of your recent, I mean its cost saving initiatives on hold, until you get that completed.","Marc R. Bitzer","Hi Megan its Marc Bitzer. No we already announced restructuring initiatives up fully on track and will be implemented and executed. So that is not impacted by Indesit.","Megan McGrath \u2013 MKM Partners","Okay, great. And then just one final follow up on Latin America you\u2019ve talked about rising prices to offset higher inflation it looks like that didn\u2019t occur in the second quarter was that more of just a timing issue or was the inflation more aggressive than you had initially anticipated.","Jeff M. Fettig","","Yes, Megan, what we said actually at the end of the first quarter. We had already announced these price increases and that they would scale in if you will over the course of the year. And so what we are expecting is to benefit more from the price increases in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And as we\u2019ve go throughout the year, but it\u2019s the same price increase that we took its how we introduced in our real life.","Megan McGrath \u2013 MKM Partners","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, Jeff, Marc, Mike, Larry, how are you?","Michael A. Todman","","Good, thank you.","Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Most of my questions also have been asked and answered. But to also follow-up question. First regarding Larry the $0.50 item the trade inventory transition how much is that impact that $0.50 is in the back half of the year versus was already recognized in the second quarter.","Larry M. Venturelli","","$15 million in Q2 the balance would be in the back half.","Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And should we I guess Mike assume that this is a permanent impairment of your legacy Chinese business I mean at some I don\u2019t imagine that business is coming back even after the Hefei deal is consummated.","Michael A. Todman","","No, what we are expecting is to actually resume and grow from the business. And we \u2013 as we introduced new model lines, we\u2019re certainly expecting not only to recover, but to grow as we expand distribution into all the distribution outlet. So no it would not be permanent.","Marc R. Bitzer","So what was the reasoning behind the huge take down at retail I\u2019m confused. Well, if you think about it Hefei Sanyo is about (indiscernible). And so what the trade knows is that there would be new model lines coming in, there is probably some new terms and so what they are basically doing is kind of protecting at this point if you will there their inventory, they are marking sure that they don\u2019t have too much as they know these new lines are going to be introduced. And so it\u2019s kind of a one-time adjustment, but they will re-buy as we move forward and as the \u2013 and from the new combined entity as the transaction is closed.","Michael A. Todman","Okay, as I guess what was surprising about is that wouldn\u2019t have been flushed out within the due diligence process that that type of scale response would be a possibility.","Jeff M. Fettig","Sam, this is Jeff as I said before the variable is the timing approval, so that was \u2013 that is a variable and we saw this in the second quarter which was bigger and more than we previously thought, but the fact now is it\u2019s still dependent upon the approval, so that was hard to forecast it.","Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Understood. Last question, the acquisitions that you are making the two of them plus I\u2019m guessing the future restructuring that\u2019s going to occur in order to integrate, does that free cash flow usage preclude any share repurchase activity this year or next.","Jeff M. Fettig","No.","Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So we might expect share repurchase activity in the back half of the year once if you generate their free cash?","Michael A. Todman","What I would say Sam is we do intend to repurchase shares in the future and we continue to balance the various aspects of capital allocation we have, but our intention would be in the future, yes we would be repurchasing stock.","","Sam Darkatsh \u2013 Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, thank you both. Thank you all, appreciated.","Jeff M. Fettig","Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company","Thanks, two things. First of all on the \u2013 your performance versus the AM, I appreciate the distinction that it\u2019s a bit of apples versus oranges, could you just flush out a little further in 1Q I think your units were up meaningfully more than the industry number 4 versus 1 and then that reversed obviously this quarter from triple points ahead that\u2019s 6 or 7 points behind. You just explain a little more would change some markedly between 1Q and 2Q in that apples versus oranges comparison?","Marc R. Bitzer","Hey, Eric this is Marc Bitzer again, just coming back to my earlier comments I said that in Q2 if you look at the AMT-7 shipments that were mid single-digits, so I didn\u2019t say we are down, we actually were up mid single-digit, so which also means the rest of \u2013 difference to the overall unit shipments came from Canada small domestic and some other businesses, on the means on our AM shipments we are pretty much held market share year-over-year directly. In Q1 we picked up market share year-over-year and now we held market share.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company","I guess, sorry to make my question clear, the non T7 it looks like the performance was much weaker in 2Q than it was in 1Q that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to figure out what was different in 2Q versus 1Q?","Marc R. Bitzer","I think the biggest difference you would see I mean year-over-year is Canada and small domestic appliances.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company","And is that \u2013 can find the 2Q or is that ongoing, how should we think about that?","Marc R. Bitzer","I mean as I mentioned earlier we are very confident in our small domestic appliance business for the back half of the year, it\u2019s just back different number product launches.","Jeff M. Fettig","And again the AM market sluggish and it has been impacted by currency therefore having significant price increases and that\u2019s got to settle its way through.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company","Okay, and then the second question, Jeff, in Europe the 7% to 8% margin target three years out is I think more than you\u2019ve made in the past. I\u2019m just curious as you look at both the market and the new business or platform you will be operating there. What\u2019s different on either side of that that would allow this to make margins that you haven\u2019t achieved in the past?","Jeff M. Fettig","","Well, first of all we have achieved those in the past, that\u2019s been albeit a while. Second of all there is \u2013 I think if you look at the one or two companies they have big scale these are not new levels for the industry and Marc you might want to comment on kind of the parameters.","Marc R. Bitzer","","I mean, Eric to the earlier comment, I mean obviously we will give you all the details post-closing and many of you will understand the assumptions about scale, synergies, restructuring and baseline assumption. But I really want to refer back to Jeff\u2019s earlier comment. We made 7% plus margins in the 90s, we made 6% plus margin in 2000 and with a lower scale position. To Jeff\u2019s earlier point there are players in Europe, who make 8% or 9% operating margin on sustained base. So these are not of the normal margins, but obviously the key will be for you to understand post-closure of the ingredients and how we come up with that plan.","Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company","","Okay, thank you.","Jeff M. Fettig","","Okay, with that, we\u2019re going to conclude the call here. Thanks everyone for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with you next time.","Operator","","This does conclude today\u2019s program. You may disconnect at this time.

Fourth Quarter and Year End 2011 Earnings Release Call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Jel[ph]","Unknown Executive","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corp. Fourth Quarter and Year End 2011 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investor section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com. Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corp's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q as well as in the appendix of the presentation. ","Turning to Slide 2. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation. Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 37 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. With that let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Earlier this morning as you saw, we released our fourth quarter and yearend financial results. And I'd say to sum up Q4, we did exit the year with good momentum coming from improving price\/mix, significantly lower inventory levels and a continued strong cadence of new product introductions. With these positive trends, we are well-positioned for margin expansion, earnings growth in the coming year. Turning to Slide 4 we'll talk about our full year results. ","In 2011 we reported annual net sales of $18.7 billion, up 2%. Our GAAP net earnings per share were $4.99 compared to $7.97 in 2010. And as we discussed quite a bit last year, we did have higher material and oil-related cost which came in at approximately $450 million and that significantly impacted our results last year. ","Turning to Slide 5, you'll see a recap of the actions we previously discussed that we're focusing on to improve our operating results. As we expected, the global conditions remain challenging particularly driven by Europe, which is driven by the Euro debt concerns. However, we have made substantial progress on the actions, which we outlined last October. And those were to improve our operating profitability, to reduce our fixed cost structure, to realize previously announced price increases and to continue to deliver a very strong cadence of new product introductions. And these actions already have began to yield results that you see in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, our North American region delivered a 2x margin improvement year-over-year despite a 3% industry unit decline. We see the strength of our global brand portfolio is evident as we continue to see strong consumer preference for innovative new product offerings, and this is driving a positive mix and margin. ","Our cost reduction and capacity reduction actions which we announced last October are on track, and as we said then, we expect them to yield  $200 million in fixed cost savings in 2012 and another $200 million in 2013. We also continue to drive strong cash flow from our ongoing business operation, which has enabled us to fund a number of legacy liabilities in 2011. As a reminder, these included over $300 million related to a Brazilian collection dispute, $44 million related to antitrust resolutions and $298 million in pension contributions. In total, these legacy items were funded by almost $650 million, but even with these items, we ended the year in a very strong financial position and with $1.1 billion of cash at year end. ","Also, while we have benefited historically from both U.S. energy tax credits and Brazilian BEFIEX tax credits, we do recognize that this has created some difficulties in evaluating our ongoing business operations. Due to this, we have clearly defined our ongoing business operational performance by showing our baseline operating results without x items which are restructuring, U.S. energy tax credits and the monetization of BEFIEX tax credits. ","So then turning to Slide 6, looking at just our ongoing business operations, last year our net earnings per share were $2.05 compared to $4.47 in 2010. Our cash from ongoing business operations without legacy liabilities was approximately $400 million last year. ","Turning to Slide 7 and 8, you'll see our 2012 priorities and how the actions that we've outlined are expected to impact our results. Again, we are focused very strongly on margin expansion, and we expect the actions that we've already taken to have a significant positive impact for the year. We will continue to benefit from the global price increases we took last year as their  benefits carryover into 2012. In addition, we implemented price increases in several large markets, but went into effect at the beginning of January of this year. We also will continue the strong -- the cadence of strong product innovation which will contribute to overall revenue growth, mix and operating profit. ","Even in the fourth quarter, we have begun the benefits from our cost capacity reduction actions, which will accelerate throughout the year in 2012. And lastly, we still see this year 2012 estimated raw material inflation to be a headwind, and we're forecasting those increases to be between $300 million and $350 million, but we expect to more than offset these costs with our other normal strong productivity activities. ","Turning to Slide 9, it summarizes our current demand outlook for the year. Overall, globally, we expect flat to slightly positive demand growth around the world. In the U.S., we expect demand to be flat to up 3%, with the demand primarily being driven by replacement purchases as we saw last year. In Europe, we're forecasting a demand decline of 2% to 5% for the full year as consumer confidence in the Eurozone remains weak. We see -- continue to see strong underlying economic fundamentals in Brazil and other Latin American countries and are forecasting demand growth in the 2% to 5% range. And finally, we expect moderate growth of 2% to 4% in Asia this year.","So taking all these factors into account, our assumptions on the external environment, but more specifically the factors which we are executing and have put in place, we expect to deliver GAAP EPS this year, 2012, in the range of $5 to $5.50 per share and overall positive free cash flow of $100 million to $150 million. On an ongoing operational GAAP basis, x-ing out the items I previously described, our guidance this year is $6.50 to $7 per share, and we expect cash flow from our ongoing business operations to be $950 million to $1 billion. So with that, I'm going to turn over to Marc Bitzer for his review and comments on North America.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance for the quarter. As shown on Slide 12, we realized more than 2x profit improvement year-over-year, which is a clear indication that our previously announced actions are yielding intended results. All previously announced price increases are fully implemented, including the most recent 6% to 7% price increase effective January 1, 2012. As you know, these increases are necessary to mitigate higher material costs. As a result of a cost base price increases, our margins have substantially improved both sequentially and year-over-year. And we are well-positioned to expand margins in 2012. ","For the quarter, sales grew 1% despite an industry shipment decline of 3%, and margins improved significantly during the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the same period last year even if adjusted for the non-operating supply recovery and curtailment gain. However, raw materials continue to be a headwind for us, and we continue to take actions to adjust our inventory to industry demand. ","On Slide 13, you see our annual U.S. industry T7 units since 2005. For 2011, the year ended this demand bumping along the bottom at these recessionary levels we saw in 2009. It is clear that replacement is driving demand at this point. Approximately 60% of all consumer purchases are direct -- are replacement purchases. Based on this, we expect North America industry shipments to be flat to up 3% in 2012. ","On Slide 14, you'll see North America's financial performance in the fourth quarter. Regarding our overall unit volume, we saw our North America unit shipment down 3% in the fourth quarter, which is in line with the U.S. industry decline of 3%. The net sales of $2.6 billion grew 1% from last year, driven by improved product price\/mix. ","Turning to Slide 15, you can see a sampling of our innovative new products that we launched throughout the year. Before I hand it over to Mike, I want to highlight our business priority for North America in 2012 as shown in Slide 16. As Jeff had mentioned, we're primarily focused on actions driving margin expansion. In 2012 we will build upon the positive momentum we saw in Q4, but stable the price\/mix, and pricing carryover will continue and pricing would grow with the recently implemented January price increase. The cost and capacity reduction initiative that we introduced in the last earnings call are on track to generate the expected benefits. And we will continue to leverage our strong product innovation and higher-margin adjacent businesses for growth over long-term. ","Let me close with some comment on the antidumping petition we filed in December 30. We took necessary actions to promote a fair and open global trading system, protect American jobs and to innovate and invest in America by filing antidumping and countervailing due to petitions for large residential clothes washers with South Korea and Mexico. We expect to receive a final determination on this petition February 2013, and a final determination related to earlier open market refrigerator petition in May of this year. While neither investigation is yet complete, we remain very confident about both cases. And now I'd like to turn over to Mike for his review of our international operations.","Michael A. Todman","Thanks, Marc. I'll begin on Slide 18 with a review of our international business. During the year high material cost and soft demand were global issues, and we saw high inflation and low consumer confidence slow the rapid growth rates in emerging markets. Europe remained the most challenging region from an international perspective as the European financial crisis drove weak consumer demand across the Euro zone. We focused significant restructuring resources and significantly reduced production in the European region beginning in the fourth quarter to better align our cost with industry demand levels and lower our fixed cost structure going forward. We are confident that these actions will positively impact our future performance in Europe. ","In Latin America as you may know, the Brazilian government declared an appliance sales tax holiday in December. As a result, we monetized less BEFIEX during the quarter. The stimulus program set to expire on March 31 is similar to the program instituted by the Brazilian government in 2009 that drove increased demand in the region and lasted for 9 months. ","Irrespective of the stimulus program, however, we continue to be very positive about the prospects for our Latin America business. In Asia, we experienced growth in China, while high inflation dampened consumer sentiment leading to a reduction in demand in India for the quarter and the year. ","Turning to Slide 19. In the fourth quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased 8% year-over-year to $848 million with unit shipments down 4% compared to the prior period. Excluding the favorable impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 7%. The region reported an operating loss of $32 million versus the $29 million profit last year. Results were unfavorably impacted by weak consumer confidence, higher material costs and significantly lower production to adjust to a weak industry demand in the region and then slightly negative product price\/mix. We expect our cost reduction actions, ongoing productivity initiatives and previously announced price increases will have a positive effect on results going forward, and we will return to solidly profitable position this year. ","Slide 20 shows the summary of our Latin America fourth quarter results. The region reported sales of $1.3 billion, down 5% from the prior-year period with appliance unit shipments down 4%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 1%. Our demand decline was mix driven. Through pricing actions we purposely reduced our sales of lower end products such as microwave ovens and air conditioners, while maintaining our strong share in the critical categories of washers, refrigerators and cooking. Operating profit totaled $155 million compared to $193 million in the prior year. Favorable product price\/mix was offset by lower monetization of tax credits, higher material costs, unfavorable currency and reduced production levels. On an adjusted basis, excluding BEFIEX tax credits, operating profit for the quarter totaled $96 million compared to $112 million in the prior-year period. ","Our fourth quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 21. Net sales decreased 2% during the quarter to $200 million, down from $204 million in the prior year period with flat unit shipments. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 4%. The region's operating profit was $2 million for the quarter compared to $4 million in the prior year. Overall, favorable product price\/mix and volume improvement in China was offset by higher material costs and weak consumer demand in India. ","Turning to Slide 22, you can see just a few examples of our new products that we launched in 2011. We have innovative product launches in every major category around the world. ","Turning to Slide 23. We are focused on executing the margin expansion actions already in place. We expect to benefit from: one, our previously announced price increases in every region of the world; two, cost and capacity reduction initiatives in Europe; and three, ongoing productivity programs. Overall, we are well-positioned for a solid performance throughout the year. Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli for his financial review.","Larry M. Venturelli","Thanks, Mike, and good morning. Beginning on Slide 25, I would like to summarize the main drivers of our fourth quarter results. While we did have significantly improved year-over-year price\/mix during the quarter, our sales declined approximately 3% to $4.9 billion, primarily due to lower industry volume and the impact of currency. Excluding currency, sales were down 1 point on global unit volumes, which decreased 3.5 points from the prior year. Raw material and oil-related costs continued to be a headwind during the quarter, and given industry demand trends, we significantly reduced production to align inventory with the current demand environment. Overall, we ended the year with $2.4 billion of inventory, which is $700 million lower than where we were in June and more than $400 million lower than December last year. We are very well-positioned with our inventories entering 2012.","Based on volume and product mix, we monetized $59 million of BEFIEX credits compared to $81 million in the prior year, which was lower than expected due to the tax holiday that went into effect on December 1 in Brazil. For the year, $266 million of credits were recognized. ","Turning to the income statement on Slide 26, you will note that our operating profit was up slightly from the previous year. Results were positively impacted by continued improvement in price\/mix and cost productivity. Higher raw material cost, lower production to adjust inventories to weak global industry demand and lower monetization of Brazilian tax credits adversely impact the results during the quarter. Results also included significantly higher restructuring expense at the benefit of $96 million from a previously disclosed supplier recovery and benefit plan curtailment gain. ","Turning to Slide 27, you'll see that the income tax benefit we recorded in the quarter was primarily the result of recognizing approximately $110 million of energy tax credits. For the year, $366 million of credits are included in our results. As a note, it's important to point out that the energy tax credit program in the U.S. was not extended into 2012. Primarily due to the conclusion of this program, our 2012 effective tax rate will be in the 26% to 29% expense range. We reported diluted EPS of $2.62 per share in the quarter, compared with $2.19 per share in the prior year. ","Moving to our free cash flow results on Slide 28. We reported a free cash flow use of $55 million for the year compared to the generation of $502 million last year. It's important to point out that full year results include approximately $300 million in pension contributions and approximately $300 million for the first of 2 payments related to the Brazilian collection dispute. Specifically, you can see our working capital improvement in 2011 driven largely by significant inventory reductions. I will go into further detail regarding free cash flow from our ongoing business operations in a few minutes. ","Finally, included within other cash are the pension and legacy legal liability payments we made during the year. As Jeff introduced earlier on the call, our 2012 guidance is shown on Slide 29. For 2012, we expect to deliver diluted EPS in the range of $5 to $5.50 per share and positive free cash flow of $100 million to $150 million. As you will note, we are forecasting significant improvement in our ongoing business operations during 2012. To provide further clarity and comparability between both our reported GAAP results and GAAP guidance with our ongoing business operations performance, we have included a table on Slide 30, which I'd like to provide some comments and perspective on.","I'll first discuss tax credits which have been recognized as a direct result of our operating performance for the past several years and are either concluding or have a limited remaining life. First, you will note that our 2012 earnings guidance does not include any benefit from the U.S. energy tax benefit program given that, that program was not renewed at the end of 2011. Therefore, we're adjusting 2011 results to facilitate comparability between the years. Secondly, over the past several years we have realized BEFIEX tax credits through our operating performance in Brazil. I'd like to provide some detail regarding our remaining credits.","At the end of the third quarter 2011, $383 million of credits had not been monetized. During the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, we monetized $59 million of credits. Two additional adjustments to available credits were made during the fourth quarter. First, the strengthening U.S. dollar versus the real reduced credits by $24 million. Second, based on changes to government inflation index tables in Brazil, there was a $62 million reduction to future available credit monetization. Therefore, based on credits recognized to date, changes to applicable government inflation factors and currency translation, there's approximately $240 million of future cash monetization remaining. Given that these are near completion of monetizing, we have also adjusted both our 2011 actuals and 2012 guidance to facilitate year-over-year ongoing business operation comparisons. ","For 2012, our guidance includes $60 million to $80 million of BEFIEX credits compared to the $266 million recognized in 2011. As Mike mentioned last December, the Brazilian government announced tax breaks to consumers, which are essentially identical to the program enacted during 2009, which was extended and remained in effect for 9 months. This program significantly reduced the amount of BEFIEX credits we could recognize. For all of 2009, we recognized $69 million of credits. We are modeling our 2012 guidance similar to the previous program. Should the current 4-month program not be extended to 9 months, we would be able to monetize additional credits during 2012 of approximately $150 million. The remaining $60 million balance is associated with court order fees, which will be monetized in subsequent years. In addition to tax credits, we're also adjusting for restructuring expense. As you know in October, we announced the largest restructuring program in company history, which is expected to be completed during 2013 and will provide approximately 200 in benefits -- $200 million in benefits during 2012 and an additional $200 million in benefits in 2013. ","Slide 31 illustrates that we expect approximately $250 million to $270 million of a restructuring expense in 2012. Our total program remains at approximately $500 million of expense beginning in Q4 2011 through 2013. Finally, during 2011 we had several unusual items including settlement of legacy legal liabilities, supplier quality recovery and a benefit plan curtailment gain, all of which are being adjusted for year-over-year comparability. Taking into consideration all these items as shown on Slide 30, our ongoing operations from our business performance was $2.05 per share. You will note that our 2012 GAAP guidance of $5 to $5.50 adjusted for 2012 BEFIEX tax credits and restructuring expense translates into an ongoing business operation outlook of $6.50 to $7 per share. This represents a significant improvement from our ongoing business operation performance compared to 2011.","On Slide 32, we highlight the main drivers of our expected year-over-year ongoing business operations performance improvement. During 2012, we expect 2-plus points of margin improvement from price\/mix largely driven from material price increases implemented during 2011, as well as new price increases implemented in January, approximately 1 point of margin improvement from restructuring benefits, and we also expect that we will deliver between 0.5 to a Full point of margin expansion from our normal productivity. This includes offsetting approximately $300 million to $350 million of year-over-year material cost headwinds. And finally, higher marketing investment, increased benefit costs and unfavorable currency will reduce margins by approximately 1 point during 2012. ","On Slide 33 you will note we have $55 million in free cash flow usage during 2011 and our guidance of positive $100 million to $150 million in 2012. It's very important to note that we have significant cash outflows for legacy legal liabilities, which will be largely behind us after this year, and we also have the bulk of our restructuring program cash outflow during 2012. ","Slide 33 depicts the underlying cash flow we are generating through our operations after taking account the short-life cash requirements. Our underlying ongoing business operations' free cash flow improvement is largely driven by cash earnings, which is a direct result of the components of the profitability improvements I discussed earlier as well as lower capital spending, which is expected to be $500 million to $550 million compared to $608 million in 2011. You will also note that our pension contribution will be $250 million compared to $298 million in 2011. ","Before I close on Slide 34, I want to discuss our short-term cash flow priorities. First, it's important to point out that our legacy legal liabilities will be largely behind us after this year. Given these required cash outflows, our 2012 cash priorities are: funding the business, which includes capital expenditures and pension contributions; dividends, debt repayment, and as I previously mentioned funding the remaining legacy legal liabilities. Now I'll turn it over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","Thanks, Larry. Let me sum up our comments today. As I said at the beginning, we are pleased with the momentum that we had coming out of 2011. We are seeing and have seen improving price\/mix. Our inventory levels are in great shape, and we have the strongest innovative product lineup we've ever had in our 101 year history. On today's call, as we outlined in October, we talked in great detail about the actions that we've taken to accelerate our ongoing business operations posed to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. We are executing very rapidly these strong actions, and we expect them to continue to improve our operating margins through our cost and capacity reduction initiatives, our ongoing productivity and the previously announced price increases. Again, we're planning for a flat to a slight improvement in demand. We will have raw material inflation in the range we talked about, but we expect to fully mitigate those increases through our productivity. So overall based on these assumptions, we do expect 2012 to be a strong year with ongoing business operations improvement and driving strong shareholder value. ","So at that point in time I will conclude our formal comments and will open this up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the side of Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I'm looking at Page 32 in your presentation. The margin walk that you guys highlight. If you look at the puts and takes, how would you kind of rate the risk of each of these categories? If you could just give us some of that sensitivity to where the concerns are. Obviously I think the pricing capacity is probably a fairly secure forecast, but can you talk about the...","Jeff M. Fettig","This is Jeff. Again, this is very similar to what we outlined in October, but I would say this, is that we have already turned around what for over a year was a very negative price margin mix hit to our earnings. And certainly in the third quarter, we have turned that from negative to positive. You saw in the fourth quarter that ramped up very nicely. So we're entering the year with a lot of positive momentum. We're one month into the actions we took at the beginning of the year, and we're very committed to this. As you go around the world, we haven't seen a material impact on our business from a market share standpoint. This is enabled by a continuous strong flow of new product innovation. So we may be losing some business in some areas, we're making it up in other areas. But net-net given our margin levels, with external inflation, we decided early last year, this was a critical initiative that we're very committed to, and we remain committed, so I fully expect to deliver upon what we're saying here, that the cost and capacity is the restructuring benefits. I think, as you know, we have a very strong track record of delivering. I expect the full $200 million that we committed to in October we will deliver this year. The normal productivity of 0.5 to 1 point, I'd say that I feel very good about our actions. The 2 dimensions that affect that of course are raw materials, which sitting here today we feel comfortable with the $300 million to $350 million. That can change either way, and demand, which has an impact on conversion in the factory . So right now, we're very comfortable with what we're presenting, and I would say in any of these, that we have equal upside as we do downside, and we're confident that we're going to deliver this kind of improvement in operating performance.","Larry M. Venturelli","Ken, just a couple of things to keep in mind as we talk about carryover price increases from last year. As you remember those price increases really started building momentum here in the back half of the year. In fact, in the fourth quarter, year-over-year we had about 3 point improvement. So we're carrying over about 1 point to 1.5 points of price increases in the next year. The second thing to build on,  what Jeff said, if you think of the inventory takedown we had in the -- from the first half of last year to the end of the year, I mean that cost us, I would say from a conversion perspective, at least 1 point, so...","Jeff M. Fettig","I'll make one final comment, again, on these dimensions is, one is, the pricing we expect to see to fully reflected in the first quarter onward. Of course, in the second half of the year, we're up against different comps, but for the full year, it really -- has already started, whereas restructuring benefits and productivity will hold follow their normal build that they increase as we go throughout the year.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. Here's a question for Mark. Looking at the strength in  the 4Q margins in North America at 4.1%, which has led to -- connected to what looks like a 3% price gain. Can you talk about rebates and if you held to the 10 to 20 days you mentioned in the third quarter call, and if that discipline of rebates, how that was -- did the retailers followed you, what was their response if there's any confusion on their part? I appreciate that.","Marc Bitzer","Ken, it's Marc. Let me first clarify so 4.1% margin for North America. The 3% that Larry was referring to pricing was a global number. The North America pricing on a year-over-year has been substantial above that number and has been in improvement on sequential base, which is kind of unusual given what already occurred in Q4, and we feel very good about the pricing progress in Q4 and have been also the subsequent carryover to 2012. Specifically, to your question on the holiday period, and I do appreciate that there has been a lot of reports out there, not all of them are correct, I think pretty much -- it unfolded the way how we expected it during our last earnings call. And the fact that I say it's -- we said there's a high, high amount of consumer direct demand out there and in that market environment we didn't see very strong return investment and promotional activities, and we therefore reduced our investment compared to previous years. That's what we've done, and as a result of it, our pricing has been pretty good in Q4. Our overall promotion period was flatly short in previous year and that's how we managed it. We feel pretty much reflects the way we expected it.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess if I could have one last one is that favorable series of ITC rulings. You had 2 petitions so far. One's in a preliminary state of tariffs. How would that flow through results, and how should we look at it? So refrigerators that's already in place. Can you comment on the benefit that you actually saw in fourth quarter perhaps year-over-year realizing the washing machine is still very, very preliminary, but you should have already started seeing that, is there any clarification you can give us?","Jeff M. Fettig","Ken, basically we're not -- I mean, it's not done yet. As Marc outlined, there is another step of the process, which will be completed by early May. That's when the final determinations are made. I think what you're referring to is the fact that preliminary duties came out at the end of October, so basically [indiscernible] are potentially liable for after that date. So in that standpoint that is true. Our position is, we're not really willing to comment on any changes on that until the case is determined and over with.","Operator","We move next to the side of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Two, I'd love some clarification on. One, can you give us the quantification of what price\/mix was in 4Q and in total for 2011?","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes. I'd say -- first let's say answer your second question -- this is Larry. Price\/mix as you recall was down 2 points in the first half. That reversed in the second half, so price\/mix is essentially flat for the year. If you look at fourth quarter year-over-year on the margin, price\/mix is up 3 points.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","So 3 points in the fourth quarter, 2 points in the back half of the year and then on that same metric, the guidance is 2 points for all of 2012?","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes, we said 2-plus points.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And within this, what's changed, we saw obviously 2010 and into 2011, I guess beginning at 4Q '10 price\/mix was pretty bad and now it's changed. And I'm sure you always intend price\/mix to be positive. Is there something that's changed from a competitive dynamic or something that's changed in the market that's allowed you to make the progress that here you've obviously aspired to for a while?","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, Eric, it -- we really have to look at the cycle that we have seen here. It really began in the second half of 2010. We came off of a first half where we saw some -- somewhat ardent [ph] stimulus-driven growth, but good growth in the first half of the year. And then seemingly in the second half, the growth just stopped. And there was a lot of competitive dynamics at every level that drove us into a period of really 12-month period of very negative pricing, and I'm talking largely in the North American business. At the same time, coming into 2011, we, and I believe most companies were negatively surprised about the material inflation that accelerated. So you had basically negative demand, significantly negative pricing and very negative increases in cost. And that had a profound impact on margins across the board. Like I said, we took a decision for ourselves that we would -- given the innovation we had in our pipeline, given the level of margins that were unsustainable, that margin expansion was our number one priority, and we announced price increases early last year in the case of North America, and as we saw inflation ramp up even more, we took a second price increase and announced the third for January of 2012. We think those are the right decisions for the business. We obviously have higher margins to continue to invest in bringing more innovation and value to consumers. We're pleased with the progress. We're satisfied with the innovation that we're gaining, that our market share hasn't materially changed. And that's just the course one, I can't comment about others, but that's the path that we're on.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","And the second question, the Latin American business was down 3 or 4% in the back half of '11, and your, I think, guidance is for the market to grow 2% to 5% in '12. I'm curious about what you're seeing in the business or thinking about the business, even the early feedback on stimulus that's just the volumes you're going to turn from contracting in the last 6 months to improving over the next 12.","Michael A. Todman","It's Mike. What we did see, and similar to what we saw I would say in the last stimulus program was it actually drove about a 10% increase in the month of December, and we're continuing to see that kind of growth as we turn the page into the new year. So we do see that it's having a positive impact. Again, we don't know exactly how long that program is going to last, but the fact of the matter is it has driven some benefit. The other thing we're seeing is in markets outside of Brazil, we're continuing to see very strong growth in those markets. So we're feeling that this range that we've given is very appropriate.","Jeff M. Fettig","The only other comment, Eric I could think about Brazil and Latin America in general is that, not only did we have the stimulus in other words, the reduction in essence, sales tax on certain products. That has reignited the market, but also the government has taken -- they had taken some anti-inflationary steps earlier in the year to constrain demand. They've reversed those. There's a lot of talk of lowering interest rates, so there's balancing going on, and we're seeing a general pick up in total. At the same time, and it's similar to your question I referred to on North America is we did take a strong stance last year, throughout the year on pricing. We have achieved that pricing. We've also taken a strong stance on mix and we've really focused on stepping up the mix, and we're having good results with that.","Operator","And we'll go next to the site of Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First I want to rephrase an earlier question if I could. Specific to bottom-out fridges post-October, what did you see in wholesale industry prices and your specific market share?","Marc Bitzer","Sam, it's Marc. First of all, let me reiterate what Jeff was saying. Even with French Door [ph] [indiscernible] we are still in the preliminary phase of that entire process. So the final determination of this one is not happening before April of this year. So as long as the final are not out, I would expect that situation to be somewhat unstable. We saw in Q4 a slight increase of French Door prices, but I think it's too early to draw any broader conclusion on this one.","Jeff M. Fettig","Sam, again, I just add on this, both of the actions that we've taken. We are confident in the submission. We are confident in the process, and we're confident we'll have a positive outcome.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Second question I know people are beating to death the price\/mix assumption. I want to look at it in a different way if I could. It doesn't look like you're assuming for any material degradation in demand from the higher prices as it relates to elasticity, yet it seems as though demand, over the past couple of years, has been much more elastic to changes in price than perhaps anybody was looking for. So is that -- is there a reason why you think demand would be still impervious to these prices?","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, Sam there is, and again I would talk, it's a little bit different around the world. I would talk in the case of North America directly to answer your question, yes, we do think there's a very little relationship between change in prices and demand. And the reason we discussed before is that, that does not mean that there is not affordable products available to consumers. And we generally don't vacate price points, but we changed the value feature for price points, and the consumer who's in the market ever 10 years doesn't really have a preconceived notion about what that value feature content is. So as we've been through this the last 5 years, candidly, I don't think the price increases have any impact at all on demand. In other parts of the world, it's somewhat different. Where you have emerging markets where you're having first time consumers coming in where there is an affordability threshold, then we're a little bit more -- when we -- although we saw up the same need to raise prices, we're also innovating for the masses, if you will, in trying to bring more, let's say, continue to expand the affordability range with the consumers. So it's a little bit different around the world.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Last question if I might. It appears as though assuming that the IPI gets extended into the summer time based on your BEFIEX guidance, would that also assume then that the stimulus would be lasting that long as well? If the IPI actually does expire on March 31, how would that change your vision of Latin America and unit demands for the April 2012?","Jeff M. Fettig","Sam, we've got the 2% to 5% is Brazil and the rest of Latin America. The rest of Latin America already is at a higher run rate than that. So that -- and that's about 1\/3. So the other 2\/3 is Brazil. And I would say that short-term with the IPI, I think we're seeing the -- beginning -- December, January we're seeing higher much rates than that. So our balance 2% to 5% for the year, I think, depending on the broader general economic environment, I think whether they extend it or continue it, I think, if they extended, I would frankly expect higher demand. If they discontinue it, I think we're safe in the 2% to 5%, but of course then we'll be able to monetize BEFIEX through IPI. So that's kind of how I look at it.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So it sound like October and November were pretty soft prior to the IPI. I don't know how well advertised the IPI was ahead of time, maybe that pushed some demand into December, but it would seem as though the natural demand would be a little bit lower than the 2% to 5% based on what was happening prior to the IPI.","Jeff M. Fettig","A couple things, Sam. I mean, we did see a softness coming out in summer into the fall, some negative comps, but we're also comping up against a big increase the previous year. But you're exactly right with one exception, is that the IPI reduction was not well-communicated in advance. It was -- I mean within 2 days, the government met, they decided on it, and I think it was like the last day of November they communicated it and started December 1. We were prepared to respond to that on December 1, but we saw immediate -- actually an immediate change in direction from demand with that.","Operator","We go next to the site of Josh Pollard with Goldman Sachs.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you just walk through how much in additional price increases need to occur in order for you to achieve your 2%-plus overall price\/mix guidance for '12?","Jeff M. Fettig","None.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair. And when you look at the overall number for productivity and cost improvement, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm getting numbers that total about $650 million between the sort of big broad cost productivity program that you guys have run in $200 million, and then the additional sort of \"normal productivity\" that you guys expect in excess of commodity inflation. Can you walk us through just some of the bigger, broader buckets through which that should come, and then give us a cadence over which we should see those benefits for the year?","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes, Josh. This is Larry. Let me talk a little bit about the benefits that we put in our guidance. We did say through the cost and capacity reductions that, that'd be about 1 point. So if you just use this year's sales that will be $185 million. We said we had $300 million to $350 million in headwinds, but we would more than offset that with the -- and our total productivity in total would be 0.5 to 1 point. So if you net those off together, you're probably talking about $325 million net. If you want to gross up the headwinds, then you've got about $300 million to $350 million.","Jeff M. Fettig","And then again, Josh, net the productivity is completely over and above separate from the restructuring benefits, which we call out separately.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So if I do that math, I get a negative of $300 million to $350 million from commodities, but over and above that, you guys expect to get a 0.5 point to 1 point, so all in, that looks like that should be a benefit on my quick math of about $465 million in addition to the cost and productivity of $200 million. Am I thinking about that right?","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes. Again when we talk about productivity, it's net productivity, meaning that we have to generate enough productivity to offset all inflation, which includes raw material. It includes inflation in emerging markets, salary, et cetera, et cetera. So to net out 1 point, and 1 point is roughly $200 million to net out 1 point with $300 million to $350 million in inflation just on those 2 factors alone, we have to do $500 million to $550 million in gross productivity, and of course we have other inflation. So our gross productivity is in the $800 million to $1 billion range.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then if you could just update us on the cadence for margins for 2012. You guys made some comments about continued improvement as you get through the year. I wanted to see if you meant by those comments that you expect margins to go up sequentially on 1Q, and then if you could talk about how you'd expect those to progress throughout the remainder of the year.","Larry M. Venturelli","Let me talk in general. I would say we would expect margins to improve sequentially throughout the year and I'm talking about the ongoing business operations, okay? So obviously we'll have restructuring expense, but if you look in BEFIEX, but if you x those out, we would expect margin improvement throughout the year. Historically we've had -- we do have seasonality in our business, Josh, historically 45%, 55% from a volume basis. Due to carryover, our pricing will be more weighted to the first half of the year than the back. Our history, if you look at our history, productivity tends to be more back-end weighted, and the restructuring benefits, I would say, would be more 40-60 but more back-end weighted. And as we mentioned we're assuming that the extension of the IPI tax holiday occurs, so the BEFIEX will be more back-end weighted.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if I could just plug a last one in there. Pension expectations into the future, you guys sort of called that out as not a part of the ongoing expense, but for how long should we expect you guys to be in that $200 million to $300 million range on cash outflows for pension.","Larry M. Venturelli","I think it's a good question and obviously interest rates depend a lot on what we will pay out in any given year, and we're at historically low interest rates. So if rates were to stay this way for the next 4 years we'll pay probably around $200 million on average, but obviously if rates go up that number changes.","Operator","We'll go next to the side of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","So I just want to follow up on a couple of previous questions. There is no midyear price hike built into your guidance.","Jeff M. Fettig","David, we don't talk about any future pricing.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","With respect to the guidance, Jeff, is there...","Jeff M. Fettig","No. My comments was that, I think Josh asked the question, and my comment was based on the carryover from 2011 and what we've already announced and implemented that -- it's sufficient to do the 2-plus we talked about. Now regarding future price increases, that's a different discussion, and it's something we don't comment about.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Secondly on the BEFIEX credits, the assumption right now is that the program will conclude March 31. I think you'd indicated -- I just want to make sure I got is correct, but if it were to extend for the 9 months as it did in 2009 that there'd be an additional $115 million, 1-1-5?","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes. David, this is Larry. A couple of things. We're assuming -- we're modeling this year's tax holiday program consistent with what 2009 was, which ran for 9 months. So in our guidance we're assuming that carries over in the 9 months, and if you look at 2009, for the entire year, there was about $69 million of BEFIEX tax credits recognized. So we're being very smoothly between 60 and 80.","Jeff M. Fettig","David I think if it does conclude as currently prescribed on March 31, and there's no other changes, then we'd have initial up to $115 million more BEFIEX than what we were.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks for that correction. So if I do the math correctly using a 29% tax rate that's additional $1 per share of earnings. Would that take your guidance then up to $7.50 to $8?","Larry M. Venturelli","Again David if, in fact, the IPI tax holiday is not extended, and we will provide you with additional guidance on BEFIEX. The tax rate you should use would be more of a statutory rate in Brazil, which should be about 34%.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So it's approximately $1 a share. Would that be taking your guidance up by approximately...","Jeff M. Fettig","Let's be clear. The $6.50 to $7 x's out BEFIEX.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. How much of the cost savings of the $200 million actually go to the bottom line?","Jeff M. Fettig","All of it.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And then European pricing, Marc -- thanks very much for the specifics on your ASP lift in North America, can you give us a similar assessment for your European pricing?","Michael A. Todman","Yes, David it's Mike. We took an amount to price increase and went out in pricing and it was effective October 1. What we've seen sequentially, we have begun to realize some of that pricing had effect in the fourth quarter. It was up about 2 points from the third quarter. What we're expecting is to see continued, if you will, benefits from this pricing as we move forward into 2012. So we're already beginning to see that as we come into January, but we did see some sequential improvement, and we're expecting that to continue.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Free cash flow guidance for 2012, what's you're working cap delta?","Larry M. Venturelli","We ended at 5.1% we've got of cash flow, David, expect some improvement in cash flow, but not to the extent we saw this year.","Operator","And for that final question we'll go to the site of Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First on the -- I'm sorry to get back to the price\/mix, but I just wanted to make sure I understood for 2012. You said before, Jeff, it assumes no incremental pricing, but I was just curious how much of the information, how much of the expectation rather is from 2011 initiatives versus what you've begun to, and certainly you said you've already been able to fully realize a bit what was from the portion from what you've already done in '11 versus what you put into effect in 2012.","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes, Mike, this is Larry. We have about a little over 1 point carryover.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Second question on the European margins. It's a number that -- and obviously a lot of turnover in the region itself. But the European margin line certainly has moved around a lot this year. Just trying to get a sense of with the material amounts of benefits from the cost reduction program, how much of that would be in Europe, and how should we think about a European margin in 2012?","Michael A. Todman","Michael, this is Mike. What we did in the fourth quarter as we talked about, as we took production down significantly, that had a major impact. What we're expecting as we have going into 2012 is we're expecting to see improvement coming from price\/mix that we just talked about. We're expecting to see improvement from the restructuring, which we're already beginning to realize in the first quarter, and we're expecting to see improvement from normal productivity initiatives. So I would expect us to see a fairly significant over the course of the year improvement and the European operating margins.","Larry M. Venturelli","And I think, Michael, you asked about restructuring -- about a quarter of that benefit is within Europe.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Just one more if I could. Understand [indiscernible] in terms of the lower level of productivity in -- I'm sorry or production levels, which I assumed you also kind of translated into productivity, I was just trying to get a sense of how that negatively impacted North America and European margins in the fourth quarter, and if the rebound in the productivity levels is something that you're capturing in the net productivity gain of 0.5 point to 1 point that you're expecting in 2012.","Larry M. Venturelli","Michael, again I think the Q4 impact you're talking excess of 1 point due to do the productivity cost take on, actually that will be a good guidance for us going into next year.","Jeff M. Fettig","Well, thanks everyone. Thank you for joining us then. We look forward to talking to you next time.","Operator","And this concludes today's program. Have a great day, you may disconnect at this time."],"22449":["The WHR Celestial Group, Inc.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Chris Conley.","Chris Conley","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation fourth quarter 2014 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Vice Chairman, Mike Todman and Marc Bitzer; as well as Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with a presentation available on the Investors section of our Website at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on Slide 2 and in the appendix of this presentation. Due the complexities of our acquisitions and recent currency fluctuations we're also providing additional clarification on operating profit margin expectations by region for 2015. These expectations are being provided on a one-time basis, to provide clarity around our recent acquisitions and will not be updated on a go forward basis.","Turning to Slide 3. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 36 for a reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Fettig","Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. As we discussed at our investors day in December, 2014 was a milestone year for us. We delivered a record year of revenue and ongoing earnings and are creating an exceptional platform for growth and margin expansion for the future. During the year, we completed two very important acquisitions in China and Europe and we have accelerated the immigration activities of both. Overall for the year, we grew our revenue; we expanded our margins, drove ongoing productivity and delivered restructuring benefits. While at the same time we continue to invest our preferred brands and innovative products.","So as a result we generated a strong year of result including cash flow, we ended the year with a strong balance sheet and we have created multiple opportunities to create value going forward.","I'll now turn to Slide 6, where you see our financials. And as you can see again we delivered good results for the year slightly above our most recent guidance with record revenue and ongoing earnings. Excluding the impact of currency, our revenues were up 8% versus last year and our ongoing business earnings per diluted share increased to record level at $11.39 compared to $10.02 last year.","Our free cash flow grew year-over-year $164 million to $854 million, and we effectively deployed that cash in line with our priorities.","Turning to Slide 7, we highlight our business priorities for the year. First we remain confident in our ability to integrate our acquisitions and deliver these synergies which we previously communicated. We do expect top line growth, margin expansion, price mix improvement with our new product launches in our continued growth in our extend and expanding categories. We will execute our ongoing productivity programs and leverage a much broader global operating platform to improve the efficiency or our productivity actions in our investments.","And as we've seen over the last several years we do expect volatility for movements and things like currency which we've seen, raw materials and emerging market demand. But we do fully expect to offset these actions through our own actions throughout the course of the year.","So as a result I'll turn to Slide 8, and we're reiterating our financial guidance for 2015 as we announced in December we expect our ongoing business, diluted EPS outlook is to deliver $14 to $15 per share. Our free cash flow forecast for the year is this range of $700 million and $800 million and again that includes all of our restructuring and additional capital included with our new acquisitions.","I now would turn to Slide 9 and just briefly summarize our long-term strategy that we discussed about a month ago at our investors day. We have outlined multiple opportunities for growth and margin expansion which really follow under three main pillars. The first is geographical expansion. Our acquisitions provides with outstanding opportunities to truly transform and change our business position in both Europe and China, which we think will create substantial sources of value creation and a diversification globally of our earnings profile.","Additionally, we have great opportunities for growth as demand in the U.S. continues to recover which we expect will happen not only this year but over a number of years ahead and we're very well positioned to capitalize when growth does return to emerging markets such as Brazil, China, India and Russia. The second important pillar for us is our product and brand innovation. We continue to accelerate our investments in those relevant technologies in new products which clearly benefit our end consumers. We\u2019re also continuing to drive revenue growth in those areas that expand and extend with our core appliance business and we will continue to accelerate growth in these higher margin categories. And finally, we have a great opportunity to create value with what we believe is the best global cost structure in our industry. We will continue to drive ongoing cost productivity programs globally, leverage what we believe is our right size fixed cost structure with volume growth and we\u2019ll reduce complexity through our introduction of high volume global platforms. So in total, we are on track for another record year of business operating performance and we believe we\u2019ll continue to build a great global platform that will drive future growth and strong value creation. ","So with that, I\u2019m going to turn over to Marc Bitzer to give us a view on North America and Europe.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks, Jeff and good morning everyone. Let me begin on slide 11 by reviewing North America\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter, starting with the top-line. Net sales of $2.8 billion for North America were up 4.1% compared to a prior year period and up 5.1% excluding currency, this is number seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Our fourth quarter operating margins were 9% with operating profit of $255 million, compared to $301 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our operating margins were down in the quarter as ongoing cost productivity and higher unit volumes were offset by several drivers, the impact of product transitions, very unfavorable currency in Canada and Mexico and what is most likely the last quarter of higher material costs.","Similarly, while higher fourth quarter, our volumes were negatively impacted by very aggressive and value destroying promotions on import products. And as we\u2019ve consistently stated, we only participate in promotion activity where we can create value for our shareholders and our brands. Why we are not surprised by these results, we\u2019re not satisfied with them either, so we are taking actions to drive our margin to 10.5% to 11.5% in 2015 as shown on slide 12. The product transitions largely behind us, we expect the new product line to increase revenue and improve price a mix, we believe our business has a right sized fix cost structure with enough capacity to meet the demand of industry growth, as well as growth from our strong cadence of new product launches. Our business priorities for 2015, all things to grow beyond our core business in areas like KitchenAid small appliances, Gladiator garage products, and our recently introduced Swash product.","And from an operating perspective, we will continue to drive ongoing cost productivity. As Jeff mentioned, we believe raw materials will have a neutral to slightly positive impact in our operating margin. And as we have stated previously, we believe U.S. industries in the beginning of a multi-year recover. 2014 was up 65 and we expect the full year 2015 industry to be in the 4% to 6%. We continue to see improvements in housing trends, consumer sentiment and discretionary spending which we expect will translate into increased appliance demand in the U.S. Current trends of low real wage growth and unfavorable accounts you have a two factors that we believe have a potential to negatively impact our business. However, in total, we feel confident in our plans to mitigate both risks and deliver operating margin of 10.5% to 11.5% in 2015.","I\u2019ll now talk to a fourth quarter result for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region as shown on slide 14. Due to the timing of the acquisition, these results include a partial core of consolidated results. Sales were $1.7 billion compared to $800 million in the prior year. In addition to positive organic demand growth over 800 million of revenue growth was provided by the acquisition. Our cost and capacity reduction initiatives combined ongoing productivity programs moving of the product price mix and unfavorable currency to deliver another quarter of expanding operating profit. Ongoing operating profit was $101 million, as ongoing operating margin of 6.1%. It is important to note that our business along with Ignis', has strong seasonality impact, but has historically driven much higher margins in the fourth quarter.","For the full year 2015, we\u2019re expecting operating margin of 4% to 5% as shown on slide 15. Our integration activities are progressing very well and are on track to deliver synergies. We expect positive operating profit and margin expansion driven by growth beyond our core new product launches and continue benefit from our ongoing cost productivity programs. The margin environment in the Eurozone continues it slow recovery, so we\u2019re expecting industry to be flat to up 2% over year. Our raw materials are expected to be neutral to slightly positive, we expect a significant unfavorable currency impact which we plan to offset for productivity, accelerated integration activities and the benefits of previously announced cost base pricing. Overall, we believe our business priorities and mitigating action plans for headwinds will deliver operating margin of 4% to 5%.","And now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mike.","Mike Todman ","Thanks, Marc. Let me begin with our Latin America results in slide 17. During the fourth quarter, our Latin America region delivered record ongoing operating profit or operating in a challenging external environment; sales for the quarter were 1.3 billion, down 7.6% from the previous year, primarily due to unfavorable currency and reduced demand which was down approximately 2% during the quarter. However, our net sales excluding currency and BEFIEX increased just over 1% compared with the previous year. Our ongoing business operating profit for the quarter totaled $149 million or 11.7% of sales compared to $130 million and 9.7% in the prior year period. Previously announced cost based price increases, new product introductions and improved mix in our appliance business more than offset lower industry demand, higher material cost and unfavorable currency. ","Turning to Slide 18, we summarize our expectations for the region in 2015. We will continue to successfully manage through a challenging external environment as a result, we believe that price mix along with continued productivity and restructuring benefits will continue to help offset these external factors. We continue to focus on growth beyond our core and launching new models with exciting innovation across all product lines. As discussed in the past, we also believe that the low appliance penetration rates, real wage growth and other macroeconomic indicators in Brazil point to long-term healthy demand growth. Although currently, we face volatility in the short-term, we will offset it with appropriate actions which may include productivity improvements, cost reductions and price mix. Given this volatility, we expect industry demand to be flat to down 3% for 2015. However, we also expect to continue outperforming the industry and growing our revenue with industry leading brands and a strong cadence of new product introductions. As we look at the total business, we expect operating margins of 10% to 11%. ","Now turning to our fourth quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on Slide 20. So we closed on our acquisition at the end of October, it is important to note that these numbers include a partial quarter of consolidated results. Net sales were $282 million compared to $177 million in the prior year period. Over a $160 million of this revenue growth was provided by the acquisition. Consistent with our expectations, as we combine these two organizations, ongoing operating profit of $17 million improved by $7 million and ongoing were up slightly compared to prior year period. Growth related to our acquisition, continued strength in our India business, positive price mix and the benefits of cost and capacity reductions were partially offset by unfavorable currency.","Turning to Slide 21. We have been accelerating our integration activities and expect to see benefits beginning in 2015. We are excited to bring our trade customers and consumers new integrated product lines that leverage our global technology organization. And with the transition issues largely behind us, we are focusing on driving sales growth and cost synergies to deliver profitable growth and reinvest in our business. We are confident this acquisition has put us in a very strong position to leverage our new growth platform in China going forward. Operationally, we continue to execute ongoing productivity actions and benefit from previously announced cost based price increases across the region to offset inflation and currency. We expect favorable macro trends to continue in India and relatively neutral trends to continue in China. For the Asia region in total, we expect industry growth of 1% to 3%. For the full year 2015, we believe accomplishing our business priorities will deliver operating margins of 7% to 8%. ","Now I'd like to turn it over Larry.","Larry Venturelli","Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. Let me start with our fourth quarter results on Slides 23 and 24 and then transition into our guidance for 2015. Our fourth quarter results were largely in line with the guidance provided in mid-December as we delivered slightly stronger earnings per share and free cash flow. Reported net sales during the fourth quarter were 6 billion compared to 5.1 billion last year, excluding the impact of both foreign currency and BEFIEX credits, bills were up over 22% compared to the same prior year period. As Jeff mentioned, we were pleased to close on two major acquisitions late in the year. Our results include a partial quarter for the acquired companies which translated into approximately 1 billion of additional sales. Due primarily to acquisition related cost and the previous year benefit from BEFIEX credits, operating margins were down 2 points versus the prior year on a GAAP basis. However, fourth quarter ongoing business operating profit increased 18% driven by higher sales, ongoing cost productivity and the benefits of cost and capacity reduction initiatives. ","Lastly, our tax rate for the full year of 2014 was approximately 22%. The rate was lower than our guidance of 24 due to benefits from tax extended legislation in the U.S. that was approved very late in 2014. Our 2015 tax guidance remains at 24% for both GAAP and ongoing, while the range could be 22% to 25%. ","As a general reminder Slides 36 to 47 in the appendix will provide you with reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to reported GAAP measure. In total the business performed well and delivered another record year of ongoing earnings. Before I move on to our outlook for 2015, I would like to put the 2015 estimated impacts of cost headwinds into context by looking at our results over the past three years on Slide 25.","From 2012 to 2014, higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency have averaged approximately $300 million or just over 1.5% of sales. During this time period, we were successful in offsetting these external headwinds and our ongoing operating margins grew from less than 5% in 2015 to approximately 7.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Recently there have been fluctuations in several currencies around the globe, however we're also seeing a partial offset to currencies from positive trends in commodity prices. We currently estimate the net impact of headwinds in 2015 to be about 300 million which is consistent with what we've successfully managed through over the past few years. We expect to fully offset this year's headwinds to productivity, favorability and material cost of roughly 50 million, new product introductions and previously announced cost base pricing. In fact we have implemented prices increases in Canada and Russia during the fourth quarter, in addition to previously implemented price increases in Brazil.","Given the significant recent changes in currencies over the past 45 days, let me make some general comments regarding 2015 first half versus second half earnings expectations beginning on Slide 26. The normal seasonality in our industry and demand environment thrives a ramp up of both volume and productivity as we progress throughout the year. So the second half is typically more positive than the first half.","As we look the macro-variables for 2015, we expect currencies to have a greater impact in the first half of the year. On the other hand we're also seeing positive trends in commodities around the world. It is important to remember that the full impact of lower commodity costs take time to fully flow through our financial results due to hedges in contracts, but we're already beginning to see the impact of these prices softening and expect favorability to build throughout the year.","Additionally we expect to benefit from our acquisitions and restructuring activities to ramp up throughout the year and we expect positive benefits from our previously announced price increases.","Given the external factors effecting the first half we would expect to deliver approximately 40% of our ongoing earnings in the first half and approximately 60% in the second half which is slightly different than our historical trends.","Based on the actions we've discussed today we are reaffirming our full year guidance for 2015 as showed on Slide 27. Relative to the guidance we provided at our investor day in December we're expecting revenue to be towards the lower end of the $24 billion to $25 billion range given recent changes in currency. In spite of that change our full year ingoing business EPS guidance remains in the range of $14 to $15 which represents approximately 25% improvement versus our 2014 results.","We will have slightly stronger margin performance than previously expected due to price mix actions we have taken as well as higher productivity from recent commodity cost trends. Higher margin will offset the lower revenue guidance.","We expect to report full year GAAP net earnings per diluted share of 10.75 to 11.75 which includes acquisition related integration cost. Our expectations for 2015 free cash flow remained at $700 million to $800 million.","Turing to Slide 28, you will see how we intend to deliver approximately 7.5% to 7.8% ongoing business EBIT margin with another balanced approach towards margin expansion. And walking from our 2014 ongoing business EBIT margin of 6.9% to our 2015 goals, we expect to realize a full point margin in price mix driven by our previously announced cost base price increases, innovative new product launches and growth beyond our core business.","Benefits from our cost and capacity reduction actions are expected to contributed 0.5 point. For the full year of 2015 cost productivity is expected to deliver full point of margin expansion. We expect material cost to continue improving and are encouraged by recent downward trends. Our planned increases in marketing technology and product investments are expected to reduce margins by about 0.5 points. And the impact of currency is expected to reduce margins by 1.0 point to 1.5 point. These overall impact result in the range that previously communicated.","Our acquisition integration activities remain on track as you can see on slide 29. For 2015, restructuring related expenses contribute to be estimated at $300 million, which is primarily related to the acquisition integration activities. Benefits of approximately $175 million are primarily driven from acquisition synergies and benefits associated with previously announced restructuring actions.","As we deliver on our 2015 objectives, to continue to grow revenue, improved margins and deliver yet another year of record ongoing earnings, we have solid priorities to deploy the cash generated from our business as shown on slide 30. These priorities are consistent with what we've previously communicated. In summary, given our profitable growth trends, increased investment capacity and strong balance sheet, we continue to balance funding for all aspects of the business to ensure the best long term value creation for our shareholders. ","I'll turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff Fettig","Let me turn to slide 32, while I'm going to summarize our comments. Again we're focused on successfully integrating our businesses in Europe, in China and fully leveraging our new expanded global platform to create shareholder value. We will continue in ramping up investments in our brands and bring a very strong line-up of new innovative products to the marketplace, both in our core business and in our adjacent business. In total, we\u2019re very well positioned to capitalize on improving demand trends which are coming -- which are uneven around the world today, but we\u2019re seeing good demand trends in the U.S. and some volatile trends in some of the emerging market. We\u2019ll continue drive benefit that\u2019s through our ongoing cost productivity programs and despite continuing headwinds that Larry outlined like currency devaluations, we do remain confident in our ability to grow revenues, expand margins and deliver another record year of ongoing operating performance for the year.","And then lastly again strategically, we\u2019re very excited about our opportunities to grow geographically with our -- not only with our acquisitions but with our expanded presence in emerging markets. Our North America region is poise from off a year of growth, we never had a stronger innovative product lineup as we have today coming in the market and these things together give us lot of confidence on building revenue and margin expansion. And finally, we\u2019re not taking our eye off to the day operations of our business, we have many opportunities to fully leverage our fix cost structure and drive ongoing productivity around the world to both ensure our competitive position, but also to improve our margins.","So, we believe these multiple paths for profitable growth provide us with a great opportunity to really move and achieve our next level of strong operating performance and this will deliver significant value to our shareholders. So with that, I\u2019d like to conclude our formal remarks and open it up for question-and-answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Megan McGrath. Your line is open.","Megan McGrath","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask a little bit about your expectations for end market demand. You've altered them slightly in three of the major regions. So if you could just talk us through what's changed in your outlook since mid-December when you gave the initial guidance for those three regions?","Jeff Fettig","Yes. Well, let me ask Marc and Mike to discuss their regional expectations.","Marc Bitzer","Megan, its Marc Bitzer. Let me first talk about North America, as you know we basically -- that guidance for 2015 has not changed since our December meeting, which basically means, we remain bullish exactly to the same level as move mid-December. As you may recall that we issued the market demand guidance early 2014, initially it looked like the market would know its 6% and they actually ended up doing and we have a same reason to be bullish for 2015. Our housing demands, we believe both on existing homes sales will probably rise to somewhere around 5.2 million, new housing probably 1.1 plus or minus and these are still the most important demand growth drivers in the industry. However, I would still expect some seasonality in the growth rates. So that\u2019s a full year guidance, but it doesn\u2019t mean that you would exactly every quarter, every promotion period. ","But for Europe, we\u2019ve gotten a little bit more positive. As you may recall in December we basically expect flat and we right now see a flat to plus 2%, but big uncertainty in Europe very frankly is Russia demand. Russia was a main reason by we were on zero in December and right now it's actually about some reasonably stable in December and so far Q1. But still, but big uncertainty. The balance of the other markets was certainly being slightly positive.","Mike Todman","Megan, let me comment for Latin America and Asia because we did change both the outlooks for both regions. Latin America really focus on Brazil and what we\u2019ve seen since the time that we\u2019ve spoke is continued currency fluctuation and it's had an impact on the overall market there and we\u2019ve also seen the government come out with some new economic measures which has created a little uncertainty in the consumer base. So our view right now as we go in, we were flat before, we said flat to minus three. We think that the first quarter is going to be down because we\u2019re lapping against a very high first quarter last year. We think the second quarter will be up, because if you remember last year it was down significantly and then the balance of the year may trend flat to slightly down. So all-in-all we made that slight adjustment just given some of the volatility in the region.","For Asia, what we\u2019ve seen is China changed growth a little bit, I mean now it's flat we were seeing it be slightly up before and that\u2019s just due to kind of the same overall global economic situation with currencies and so on, India continues to be on track, we think that market will continue to be positive. So the change that we made for that region was from two to five to one to three and we think that\u2019s appropriate with what we see today.","Marc Bitzer","The only thing Megan is, if you take the pluses and minuses of the industry changes in total industry demand just given the weight of where the changes are is about what we said and during Investor Day.","Megan McGrath","Great. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then a quick follow-up, Marc, on North America. In terms of the pricing, that environment that you mentioned that happened in the fourth quarter, could you give us a little bit more color in terms of did you -- were you forced to follow at all with the pricing, or did you hold your pricing stable? I'm not sure how much of the sort of implied negative pricing in the quarter was just due to the currency mix shift, if we do the calculation there. ","Marc Bitzer","So Megan let me by enlarge repeat what I said in the earlier script. Yes we've seen a more aggressive from both environment by certain imports as we stated in the past and we stayed course on Q4 we did not follow our promotions all the way down because it distorts value for our shareholders for our brands and so in a certain way it had a negative volume impact related to market opportunities in Q4.","Operator","Our next question is from Denise Chai. Your line is open.","Denise Chai","Thank you. I had a couple questions. So again on North America, can you detail for us the product transition costs in the quarter, and how much more we should expect in 2015?","Marc Bitzer","Denise its Marc Bitzer again as I'm going to give a track it in. First of all let me repeat also what I said earlier yes, we were not surprised by our Q4 margins but that doesn\u2019t mean that we were satisfied with our Q4 margins. With Q4 margins were down year-over-year and they were not in line with how we delivered the first three quarters and our guidance for next year. Ultimately, beyond the promotion as I just referred to, we have the three major kind of issues which we have to deal with. One was the product transition, two was the extremely unfavorable currency in Canada, Mexico and hopefully we're pretty certain actually the last quarter of higher material cost. It's difficult to exactly give a number behind these three issues, but I would ballpark them all each of them around $20 million each. Now in terms of your question of timing, of course it's difficult to exactly predict what's going to happen in currency as we're going forward the currency part is still big for us. Canada has gotten a lot worse even in Q1, but product transitions are largely behind us, but they still play a factor in Q1 and material costs we're pretty certain are behind us.","Denise Chai","Okay. Okay, got it. And then a question on Europe. How much did weakness in Eastern Europe benefit Indesit -- or kind of your overall margins? And can you give us a sense maybe of growth rates in Western versus Eastern Europe? And just directionally how are margins in the existing Whirlpool business in Europe compared to Indesit, if you just kind of separate those directionally.","Marc Bitzer ","Denise it's a lot of question in one question. Let me try to just kind of simplify a little bit, so first of all Indesit historically have been ,more exposed to Eastern Europe and the Whirlpool standalone business, so of course a weak market demand hurts. What hurts even more is rapid currency move to the extent which we've seen. I would say the existing Indesit team but also the Whirlpool team did a fabulous job in moving fast as cost based price increases which basically reflect the currency. So if we want to say so, the pain which we could have experienced if we wouldn't have responded in Q4 is a lot less, but still that has been painful. And if you look at historical margins and I mean yesterday we commented on this one, the current margin in the Russia are not comparable to historical margins or leverage market could be in the long-term.","Denise Chai","Just last on a separate subject. In terms of hedges in contracts what do you actually hedge and when are those contracts rolling off?","Jeff Fettig","Denise we're kind of on a rolling forecast from a hedging perspective we continuously hedge some currencies more than others, but normally we can hedge anywhere from today through 36 months out depending on the currency, so it's hard to give you an answer as far as when they roll out what we try to do is to take volatility out from swings in currencies overtime I think we've done that successfully over the last few years what hurts us is we see sudden changes in currency it takes us a little bit longer to over kind of offset that but in general we do follow a hedging policy across most currencies and it's a rolling forecast type of currency so\u2026","Marc Bitzer","And Denise I'd add the same what raw materials commodity base metals and things like that we hedge it's where our philosophy is to take a rolling 12 month to 18 month view that we're always hedging if you will it's not to guess the market it's to smooth out the volatility so when base metals are going up we're generally under the curve for a while when they're going down we maybe above the curve but on average we smooth it out. ","Denise Chai","And if I heard you right you said that you expect to see a 50 million benefit from raw materials this year?","Larry Venturelli","That's correct.","Jeff Fettig","Yes that's everything including the base metal hedges.","Operator","Our next question is from David MacGregor. Your line is open.","David MacGregor","Just on Europe, stronger performance there than I had anticipated. I'm wondering, you've done such a nice job at the analyst meeting of quantifying the whole synergy expectation over the next few years. Is there any way you could quantify for us the extent to which synergies were realized in Europe in the fourth quarter?","Marc Bitzer","David its Marc first of all I'm pleased to hear what we gave positive price, but let me also reiterate a little bit what I implied in the earlier comments. Europe generally has the stronger seasonality in Q4 than for example North America that is on our base business coming from essentially two elements that's because you have more small domestic business which is very profitable for us and you have much higher microwave sale which is also very good business for us. On the Indesit side Russia more than any of market is a strong Q4 market so you put the three things together you should always expect that the Q4 revenues and operating margins in Europe are generally higher than full-year average, so don\u2019t extrapolate too much from the Q4. In addition very frankly it\u2019s been mix bag of ins and outs in Q4 which is normal to such acquisition. Having said that we\u2019re very pleased with the ramp up over for transaction integration and the synergies and we\u2019re at this point very confident that we fully delivered or over delivered the synergies which were presented at Investors Day.","Mike Todman","David, I would just add and I think we\u2019ve talked about in the Q&A as well. Those synergies as are on track it\u2019s moving very well, but the net effect is probably you\u2019d see kind of the full synergy delivery Q3 onward because again we\u2019re still forming new organization and doing all the all things in Q1 and they\u2019re actually very little, if any synergies in Q4.","David MacGregor","That was my sense but it\u2019s nice to hear you said. Where do you think your capacity utilization rate is today in Europe?","Marc Bitzer","David, again that\u2019s very blended average and it all depends on how many shifts you run in different factoring, but I would say particular the acquisition we have ample capacity to fill this factory. I mean it\u2019s clearly below over 75%, if that\u2019s your question.","David MacGregor","Okay that\u2019s helpful and then is there any way you can quantify the organic growth in Europe in the quarter?","Marc Bitzer","David again, it\u2019s Marc, it\u2019s a mixed bag because of the acquisition but let\u2019s say both businesses had underlying organic growth.","David MacGregor","Okay and then last question just CapEx guide to 8 to 8.50 for next year is at the new normal going forward?","Jeff Fettig","David, certainly for now we feel good about that number that includes absolutely the acquisitions which have their own capital spending plan. We do have a lot of product innovation and we do have a fair amount of capital supporting the integration of these things, so what we\u2019ve guided to is 3.5% of revenues is a good benchmark could be little higher could be little lower, but and of course on a much larger revenue base that gets you to 850 million.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Zener. Your line is open.","Ken Zener","Europe. The 6%. The last time you were there was 2007, and then the preceding year, so it was 2007. So it was actually third quarter was your higher seasonality. Understanding the comments around 4Q relative to your fiscal year guidance in Europe, could you talk to how we might think about the European countries being a little different in terms of the retail rhythm, if you will? So in 4Q in the US, you highlighted discounting. Does that happen as prevalently in some European countries? And when are you going to be having -- when is it normal to have the discussions with the retailers relative to your floor space in the retail market there? ","Marc Bitzer","Okay, Ken, it\u2019s Marc Bitzer. Without revealing too much competitive information here, but this could probably take an hour so let me just by I would say in general, you have in Europe because of the counter fragmentation probably less of a holiday impacted promotion impacted the more steady business in general terms despite trends like U.K. has started Black Friday there and that kind of stuff. But in general you don\u2019t have the spike over promotion holiday. I would say you have a very competitive environment period its overall land and you got to work through the mix and the other tools to generate margins. So I think the strongest countries you now see in Europe is still Russia which had very strong Q4 basis that\u2019s long historically. The other markets are reasonably balanced and if you see the seasonality is more driven by our product mix which sometime the strong and weak in certain quarters.","Ken Zener","Okay. And then kind of the housekeeping question. But just what's your interest expense? And then your guidance for Asia obviously includes two distinct regions, China and India. I apologize if I missed you breaking the growth rates for those two regions out. Thank you.","Marc Bitzer","Yes, Ken, interest figure around 190 and we said growth rate China would be around flat and India will be flat couple of point but may 3% to 5%.","Operator","Our next question is from. Sam Darkatsh. Your line is open.","Sam Darkatsh","Two or three, just clarification questions. So the EMEA EBIT in the fourth quarter was considerably better than what you were suggesting it would be in the analyst day slides, at least by my math, by $75 million or so of EBIT or so. I'm trying to understand what the positive variance was due to. Was it because that you were much quicker with the price increases than perhaps you were giving yourselves credit for back in mid-December? Or is it the synergies? Or what was the specific derivation of that magnitude of a positive variance? ","Marc Bitzer","Sam, it\u2019s Marc. As we note at Investor Day we gave a revise guidance which took all aspects into account, but from what I recall we did near-term break it down in Q4 guidance by region. Having said that, the synergies to Jeff\u2019s earlier point are small factor in the Europe Q4 numbers. There has been a good underlying business and a couple of our factors playing to it, but it was a strong underlying performance, which frankly we were proud of because typically these kind of acquisitions you would expect more disruption, more volatility and that we mentioned on both sides of equation very strongly.","Larry Venturelli","And the other thing, Marc did share today for the full year we expect 4% to 5% operating margins, that will ramp up quarter-by-quarter for two regions; one, just for a simple most to seasonality, I mean Marc talked about that before, but the large volume quarter is Q1 and then Q2, Q3, Q4. So Q4 should in normal circumstances always be the best quarter and then on top of that for this year, our synergies which are significant will largely be ramping up and kind of that run rate level begin in Q2 onward. So, I mean we\u2019re happy with Q4, I mean I hope these levels of EBIT in future are norm, not an exception as you pointed out. And that\u2019s really on the path, but Q4 should always be the highest margin quarter.","Marc Bitzer","And then I will just add, Q4 relative to competition our margin in Europe was pretty much in line with what we elsewhere.","Sam Darkatsh","And just a follow-up question or two here, if I could. Hefei on a pro forma basis, was that business up, down, and to what extent? ","Jeff Fettig","The Hefei business was slightly up and their own if you were the standalone business in Q4, we expect that to continue. As you know with the Whirlpool business, we were going through, we had destocking through the year, we then started in the November timeframe to floor new products and so we expect that business to start ramping up in the course of 2015.","Sam Darkatsh","And final question, if I could. Larry, do you have what the Company-wide gross margin would have been, excluding a lot of the deal-related costs that were broken out in the adjustments? ","Larry Venturelli","Margins, gross margins would have been Sam probably about a point higher than what you're seeing on a GAAP basis and that\u2019s because you got BEFIEX credits and some purchase price accounting adjustments and COGS.","Sam Darkatsh","It would have been 1 point higher year on year, or a point higher than the reported number? ","Larry Venturelli","It would have been a point higher year-over-year.","Operator","Our next question is from Eric Bosshard. Your line is open.","Eric Bosshard","Two questions. First of all, in terms of North America, I think your units were up 6 in an AHAM up 8.5 markets. I know those are slightly apples versus oranges. Could you talk about how you view your market share performance in 4Q and how you think that performs in 2015? ","Marc Bitzer","First of all, as you pointed out and implied already in your question, as you know the public AHAM numbers are not comparable to the unit numbers which we compare. One is, because it's 36, 37 and we also report a lot of other units in there. Second of all in our unit number we also have Canada and Mexico and in particular these markets with such strong currency moves, also a lot of volume volatility. So it's not fully comparable. Having said that, I would say our market-share, first of all on a full year base was 80% on Q4 base in product which we talked about, stable to slightly down and the slightly down came largely from our kind of lower participation of holiday sales due to reasons which I mentioned before.","Mike Todman","And of course where these promotional holidays where we talked about, we do use share in those periods of time where we choose not to participate because of value destroying, actions by certain competitor. And then typically when those promotional periods go out, we come right back up and that\u2019s our full expectation just like it's been for the last three years.","Eric Bosshard","And as much as you have visibility into 2015, into the promotional intensity and plans from your customers and perception on your competitors, how do you think that plays out in 2015? And then also again, how do you think your market share performance behaves in 2015 after you framed how 2014 played out? ","Marc Bitzer","Of course difficult to impossible to predict the promotional environment because it's driven by many factors. Our market-share objectives are not lose market-share clearly. They have to come through stronger and better products not for more aggressive promotions.","Eric Bosshard","Okay. And then secondly, you indicated 4Q, I think perhaps Larry or one of you, that 4Q was a little bit better than you had expected. Can you just give a little more detail of what performed better than you had thought in 4Q? ","Marc Bitzer","Eric, actually we were slightly a little bit better, I did mention the tax rate base business came in relatively closing to what we expect is just slightly better.","Mike Todman","And our European business as better.","Eric Bosshard","And, sorry. To follow on to that, the Europe comments, was this the underlying market is better? That the acquired business is performing better in terms of its market share, or your existing business' market share? What explains the Europe, do you believe? ","Marc Bitzer","I think it's a combination of all the factors but March was slightly better than we anticipated, but I would only say slightly, our internal performance again on both sides of the business was actually very strong. ","Operator","And our next question from Michael Rehaut. Your line is open.","Michael Rehaut","First question, just to clarify some earlier comments. Marc, when you mentioned that roughly speaking in the fourth quarter North America, the product transition costs, the currency, and the raw materials each was about a $20 million impact. How does that affect the movement into first quarter? You said you expect raw materials to subside, but would the product transition costs and the currency continue or intensify? ","Marc Bitzer","Michael let me just repeat what I said earlier so, I do expect the currency issues to still be with us, if you follow the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso it's gotten worse now we -- what helps on the mitigating side we have previously announced price increase in Canada for January, but of course now the currency moved again so in a certain way it's the same issue still around us the raw materials we do not expect in Q1 and the transition will be to a slightly lesser extent, but it's not going to be completely behind us.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. So would that result then, I know you don't like to go into quarterly margin guidance by region, but given the range of -- that you gave for the full year for North America, would that result in perhaps 1Q being a little bit below the low end of that range and improving throughout the year? Is that a right way to think about it, at least?","Larry Venturelli","Michael its Larry let me just speak in general for the company as far as margin progression goes and we talked to currency being a headwind more in the first half and the second half we talked about synergy building productivity building the segment have so what you're going to see is margins expand more in the second half than they do in the first half.","Jeff Fettig","And I would just add onto that, it's again there's a lot of changes in the environment that's not new. We tried to frame the comments around currency that currency happens immediately and we adjust we adjust through cost we adjust through pricing and so on in some markets it ultimately has an impact on demand so we have to adjust for demand so kind of my view or the view I would take today is that the currency stuff that happens already happened so it's having an immediate impact. The material cost have been coming down so that's as Larry pointed out is a partial offset. Our productivity will ramp up throughout the year as it normally does. And then we have taken in some cases due pricing based on these currency moves and then lastly in our case our synergies largely ramp up Q2 to Q4 so not all these things happen at the same time there is some volatility on our results because of that, but I think the view Larry gave about full year guidance confirmed 40-60 split is our best view of it right now.","Michael Rehaut","No, that's perfect. Understandable. Again, just trying to understand the context quarter to quarter. So thanks for that. Second question, just on North America overall in terms of 2015, you mentioned the 4% to 6% on the industry. Given if the promotional activity, just for argument's sake was similar in 2015 versus 2014, would you expect your volumes to be in line, above, or below that number?","Marc Bitzer","Michael its Marc again so let me first of all clarify and this is not specific comment to '15 just a general comment typically promotion activity doesn\u2019t increase the full year demand contrary to what many people may believe it just pulls demand forward in a certain time period. So having more or less promotion intensity will not drive more annual consumer impact. So [Mike], the dynamic of a market comes largely from overall strong consumer confidence, existing home sales which is one of the strongest drivers in our appliance demand and new home. ","Mike Todman","And then I would only add in the promotional activity as March said it probably it did worsen and the areas where we've seen dampening in the past is the areas we're continuously in. ","Jeff Fettig","Well that's again to everybody this appears to be the last question that we had. Thank you very much for joining us today and we look forward to updating you at our next earnings call. So thank you very much.","Operator","This does conclude today's program.

Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Chris Conley.","Chris Conley","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation third quarter 2015 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Vice Chairman, Mike Todman; President and Chief Operating Officer, Marc Bitzer; as well as Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our web site at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from those statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports as well as on slide one and in the appendix of this presentation.","Turning to slide two, we want to remind you, that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations, as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think these adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the appendix section of our presentation, beginning on slide 37, for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Fettig","Well good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. As you saw on our press release this morning, we reported record revenue, ongoing operating profit and earnings per share for the third quarter. Our integration activities in both Europe and Asia continue to progress well, and we expect to continue to deliver significant integration benefits during the fourth quarter. And during the quarter, our larger global operating platform, enable us to offset continued volatility in the global economic environment.","If you'd now turn to slide 5, we will look at our third quarter results; you will see where we delivered strong revenue growth in the third quarter with the revenues up 9% versus last year, and up nearly 25% if you exclude the impact of currency. Ongoing business earnings were a record $3.45 a share and additionally our free cash flow improved compared to the prior year.","On slide 6, you can see an update to our current year regional margin expectations versus last year. Here we expect substantial operating margin improvement and record performance in three out of our four regional businesses. Those three being North America, Europe and Asia. These regions are clearly on track for the year, and we are making meaningful progress towards our 2018 goals.","In Latin America and in Brazil specifically, we have taken actions to address the current market challenges, and we expect to continue to adjust as appropriate, to deliver margin improvements in this very challenging environment during the fourth quarter.","Turning to slide 7, we are outlining our current industry demand expectations for the full year. Based on recent demand trends, we are revising upward our North America business to a 5% growth. We are lowering our Latin America forecast to a minus 20% decline, and we are lowering Asia to a 2% decline, primarily coming from China.","Turning to slide 8, we are affirming the lower range of our previous guidance, which reflects the current currency in emerging market demand levels. We now expect to deliver record ongoing earnings of $12 to $12.50 per share and free cash flow of $600 million to $700 million for the year.","Globally, we continue to pursue opportunities for both growth and margin expansion. Including leveraging our newly introduced innovative products in many markets around the world, executing on ongoing cost productivity programs and delivering on our acquisition synergies.","So in summary, we are making significant progress towards our long range goals this year, despite a very challenging global economic environment with negative impacts of currency in emerging market demand. But having said that, we do expect to deliver a record year of revenues and ongoing earnings and earnings per share, along with strong free cash flow in 2015.","Before I move on to the regional sections, I would like to make a few comments on the leadership announcements we made earlier this week. On Wednesday, our Vice Chairman, Mike Todman has announced his planned retirement at the end of the year. We also announced that Marc Bitzer has been promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer for our company.","First of all, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank Mike for his more than 20 years of service to the company, serving in a wide variety of global leadership roles. Mike is leaving us with a strong legacy within our company as an enabler of our global expansion, and he has had a very positive impact on our entire global enterprise. Although Mike will be greatly missed, we all want to wish him the very best for he and his family in his retirement.","At the same time, I am also very pleased to have Marc move in to his new role, and I am confident that under his leadership, we will have a very positive impact, as we continue to execute our long term strategy.","So at this point, I am going to turn it over to Marc Bitzer.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. Let me begin on slide 10 by reviewing North America's performance in the third quarter. Overall, we are pleased that our third quarter performance, which included record ongoing operating margins of 12%. As you might recall, at the beginning of the year, we provided ongoing operating margin expectations of 10.5% to 11.5% for the year, and in this quarter, we have [indiscernible] deliver at the top end of that range.","Very strong operating margins in the third quarter, but primarily driven by our ongoing cost productivity programs and new product introductions, which more than offset nearly $30 million in unfavorable currency impacts. Our net sales of $2.8 billion for North America were unchanged compared to the prior year period and up nearly 3% excluding currency.","While we are pleased with our margins, we are obviously not satisfied with our top line performance, which has been trailing the market for several quarters. Up until now, our priority has been on the expansion of operating margins and we are very pleased with the result of that execution. Our focus in the fourth quarter and beyond will be on delivering strong margins, while clearly accelerating plans to achieve our expected revenue growth targets.","Turning to slide 11, we outline our actions taken to continue delivering strong results in the region. We believe the industry is in a middle of a multiyear growth cycle, which in combination, has historically strong seasonal demand in the fourth quarter, positions us for a record performance this year.","As mentioned previously, we expect to accelerate our plan to leverage the increase in consumer demand for our new products, drive improved price mix and volume growth in the fourth quarter. And finally, we will continue to deploy strong cost productivity plans, as well as focus on growing outside the core.","On slide 12, as an example of our product leadership, you can see our new multi-door Whirlpool branded refrigerator. This award winning product has nine storage zones and is designed to keep food organized to each family's preference.","I will now share the third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, as shown on slide 14; sales were $1.5 billion compared to $0.8 billion in the prior year, driven by the acquisition and continued recovery in the Western European demand. Ongoing operating profit was a third quarter record of $71 million, with ongoing operating margins at 4.9% compared to $9 million and 1.2% in the third quarter of 2014.","During the third quarter, strong execution of our integration plans and ongoing cost productivity more than offset approximately $45 million in unfavorable currency impact, primarily from the Euro and Ruble, that delivered yet another quarter of significantly expanded operating margins.","Slide 15, as we look toward the full year 2015, our priorities remain unchanged. There is a strong focus on integration activities, ongoing cost productivity and growth from new products, both within and beyond the core.","Slide 16, as an example of product leadership in region, you can see our new Whirlpool branded washing machine and dryer, with products combining Precision Cleaning, the Eco-Friendly Drying and have recently won the prestigious European iF design awards.","And now, I would like to turn it over to Mike.","Mike Todman","Thanks Marc. Let me begin with our Latin America results on slide 18; as you may recall on our Q2 call, we expected demand to be down 15% and their AI to be between 3 and 3.25. During the quarter, the macro environment in Brazil further deteriorated with increased inflation, volatile currency and lower demand. As a result, sales for the quarter were $751 million, down 34% from the same prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased 7%.","Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $31 million or 4.2% of sales, which represents operating margin consistent with our second quarter results. These results included a year-over-year unfavorable operating profit impact of nearly $40 million due to currency, and another $55 million due to reduced demand and lower production levels compared to prior year. These were partially offset by favorability from our previously announced cost based price increases and mix improvements from new product introductions.","On slides 19 and 20, we want to put our Latin America business in context, by providing additional detail about Latin America and Brazil specifically. Brazil's currency is experiencing the most volatile period in the last 10 years. In the third quarter, compared to the prior year, the reais devalued 55% versus the U.S. dollar, which had an approximately $300 million negative impact on our regional net sales, and as I mentioned earlier, a $40 million negative impact on operating profit.","Additionally, the deepening political crisis, increased inflation and falling global commodity prices has had a profound impact on Brazil's economy, and as a result, overall GDP is in the steepest decline since the global financial crisis.","On slide 20, we put Brazil's performance further into the context of the region. It is important to note that our LAR international Extend and Expand businesses, as well as the global compressor business are delivering solid performance this year, and with the impact of this year's currency devaluation and demand reductions, Brazil now represents less than 10% of our global sales.","To improve our performance in Brazil, we have fully deployed previously announced actions, and those actions have ally offset the impacts of currency and demand in the third quarter. We are prepared to take additional actions as necessary, targeting fixed cost reductions in the near future.","While, we will be lower than our long term margin expectations for Latin America, we believe we have the right actions to address the operating environment and expect improved operating margin in the fourth quarter.","On slide 21, we summarize our current priorities in Latin America. We are managing short term challenges through previously announced and executed cost base price increases. We have fully deployed previously announced actions to reduce fixed costs and have plans to deploy additional actions in the fourth quarter as necessary.","Finally, its important to remember, that while we are experiencing some short term issues in Brazil, long term fundamentals that will facilitate future growth in the country are still intact. We continue to invest in new products and will be well positioned to capitalized on growth, when demand returns.","Turning to slide 22, we are showcasing the new console refrigerator, that is designed with flexibility in mind. It offers adjustable shelving, and built-in containers that fit the needs of even the most demanding consumers.","Now I will turn to our third quarter results in the Asia region, which are shown on slide 24; net sales were $346 million, in comparison to $157 million in the prior year period, driven largely by the strength of our integration actions, we have delivered a record third quarter ongoing operating profit of $27 million. Ongoing operating margins were 7.7%, up significantly compared to the prior period, behind the benefits of those integration actions and record gross margins in India.","Turning to slide 25, we will continue to focus on our integration activities in China, with a special emphasis on continued distribution expansion and ongoing cost productivity programs. As a result, we will expect strong margin performance, driven by our larger growth platform.","Slide 26, we highlight our new Whirlpool refrigerator, that recently won the good design award for excellence in form and function. It offers food preservation with some of our most advanced moisture control and precision cooling technologies.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry.","Larry Venturelli","Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. Let me start with our third quarter results on slides 28 and 29. As Jeff mentioned, we had record net sales and ongoing operating profit during the quarter. Our revenues were $5.3 billion compared to $4.8 billion during the same prior year period, an increase of over 9%.","Currencies impacted our revenues by over $700 million, EBIT margins by two points, and net earnings by over $1 per share.","As a result of the actions we took in the first half of the year, to mitigate currency and emerging market demand headwinds, we saw solid sequential improvement, in both our margins and earnings during the quarter. Our recent acquisitions have strengthened our global footprint, and provide greater diversification of our regional profit contribution. This combined with cost and capacity reductions, ongoing cost productivity and an active cost base pricing actions, enabled us to deliver all time record ongoing earnings of $3.45 per share, despite weaknesses in emerging markets.","Allow me to make a few more detailed points on our financial results; we adjusted our third quarter ongoing earnings for $42 million, primarily to account for product warranty and liability expenses on heritage Indesit products. In addition, we adjusted our opening balance sheet for the Indesit acquisition, to reflect the warranty liability of approximately $275 million, with after-tax impact of about $220 million. We expect to substantially complete any actions related to these products by the end of 2017.","SG&A as a percentage of sales on a GAAP basis increased slightly. This increase is due to higher brand investment, acquisition related costs and the deleveraging effect of weaker demand in Brazil. We do however expect SG&A margins to return to prior year levels, as we realized integration synergies to additional fixed reductions and higher volumes in the fourth quarter. Interest and sundry expense was better than a year ago, primarily due to higher acquisition and legal costs in the prior year.","Finally, as shown on slide 29, and consistent with the range we previously provided, our effective tax rate year-to-date is now approximately 22%. This adjustment was made during the quarter.","On slide 30, we are narrowing the range of our previous guidance to incorporate incremental currency and emerging market demand risk. We now expect to deliver ongoing earnings of $12 to $12.50 per share. As Jeff mentioned, we are now forecasting approximately $600 million to $700 million in free cash flow, which includes $75 million to $100 million in working capital investments to support international product transitions.","Turning to slide 31, let me make some additional comments regarding our ongoing EBIT margin; the solid sequential margin improvement delivered during the third quarter is expected to continue into the fourth quarter as we exit the year. We expect continued improvement in price mix, driven by the actions we have taken throughout the year and our new product launches, and we are firmly on track with our cost and productivity reduction initiatives, and expect continued improvement in ongoing productivity during the fourth quarter. In summary, we expect margins to improve sequentially and for the full year, despite currency and emerging market demand headwinds.","On slide 32, you can see an update on the progress of our restructuring and integration activities in both Europe and Asia. We incurred $145 million in restructuring expense and realized $135 million in benefits year-to-date, which was consistent with our expectations. For the full year, we now expect $230 million in expense, and $200 million in benefits. It is important to note that the reduced expense forecast has had no impact on our synergy benefits that we expect.","As we continue to grow revenues and improve margins, we have clear priorities to deploy the cash generated from our business as shown on slide 33. Given our profitable growth trends, increased investment capacity and strong balance sheet, we continue to balance funding from all aspects of our business, to ensure the best long term value creation for our shareholders.","I'd like to turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff Fettig","Thank you, Larry. Let me add a few final comments about our view of the business and expectations for the year. This month, it has actually only been a year ago, where we closed on the acquisition of Hefei Sanyo in China and Indesit in Europe, what I believe are two historic acquisitions that is helping to transform our global footprint.","Throughout this year and 2015, we have seen emerging market demand significantly decline and the U.S. dollar rapidly strengthen against most of the currencies where we have significant exposure to. Most notably, the Brazilian reai, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Russian ruble.","Given the significant economic shocks this year, we believe that currencies have experienced a global reset, and we are prepared to operate this changed environment going forward.","Let me try to put this reset in perspective for you; currency alone is expect to impact us by reducing our revenues by over $2.5 billion versus the last year, and have a negative $4 per share and earnings per share compared to last year. And the impact from declining emerging market demand will cost us additional $1.75 per share. In total, currency in emerging market demands fundamentally versus last year, has cost us $5.75. But because of our larger global platform and our rapid responses to market change, we have been able to absorb both of these impacts and are on track to deliver record revenues in earnings along with free cash flow this year.","Putting a longer term perspective actually to turn to slide 36, where we outlined the actions which we introduced late last year, which we believe are key to deliver our long term growth value creation strategy, and they really, in our view, remain unchanged. And today, we continue to see multiple paths for profitable growth going forward, and today, we also have very high confidence, that our growth plan is giving us an outstanding opportunity to continue to deliver significant shareholder returns, as we continue to execute these long range plans. We will update all investors in detail on our 2016 expectations, as well as our progress towards our 2018 goals on our next earnings call in late January.","That ends our formal remarks, and I'd like to open this up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we can take our first question from Denise Chai with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Denise Chai","Okay. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations Marc and all the best to you Mike.","Mike Todman","Thank you, Denise.","Denise Chai","Thanks. So I know you have always been more focused on margins that on market share, and when we look at North America, you had such a tough comparison last year. But this quarter, the variance with AHAM was really outsized, and you also listed your industry guidance for the year. So what was behind the variance with AHAM and as you -- you said you are going to be shifting your focus a little bit more back to, I guess market share. Are you looking to maintain share or to regain lost share?","Marc Bitzer","Denise, it's Marc. So let me maybe expand a little bit. I will talk about margin, and our balance of margin versus revenues. Obviously, and I have stated that before, we are very pleased with the margins that we have achieved. 12% operating margins, that means we are pretty much now the twice the level of our key competitors, [indiscernible] profit, and I also would like to emphasize that 12% without any volume leverage. So it just gives you a good indication of how strong the underlying business is from a gross margin and the entire cost structure.","As much as I am pleased with the margin progress, we would be lying if we say we are satisfied with the revenue. We are not, okay, and we -- so far folks have been strong in margin expansion, and going forward, we will find a good balance between margin, a healthy margin profile and revenue growth.","So to be more specific on revenue growth, us trading Q3 versus market, its not what we intend. There are a number of reasons, and I am not going to get into all the reasons, but more important thing is, any constraint which we had so far is behind us, and we are right now, operating what I would call in a normal constrained environment. I.e., we have normal availability of products, normal capacity, that's behind us. It should not give us any reason why we don't achieve a revenue growth which we have in mind for Q4.","Jeff Fettig","Denise, this is Jeff, I'd just add to that. And again, as Marc clearly outlined, our priority to create value was first to fix the margins. We are on a great track to having done that, then grow, and I would say in supporting Marc's point, we have the tools to grow. We believe in earning market share, not buying market share and I think we are in a great position to do that going forward.","Denise Chai","Okay, great. Thank you. And just one more on LatAm, you have taken so much price, but volumes were a lot worse than we were expecting. So are you losing share in that market, and how much are your competitor's raising price? And also at some point, do you focus on market share in Brazil?","Larry Venturelli","Denise, let me address that. First of all, the market in Brazil was down by 27% in the quarter, so the market was fairly negative. And the fact of the matter is, that's just -- there is an impact on consumer demand, and so -- less consumers alike. Having said that, we are focused on both margin and share. We did lose couple of points a share in the quarter, but not significant, and we think we had the right plans in place with some of our product launches and the work that we are doing in order to recover that share. So we see that as a very short term item.","So I can't comment on what the competitors are doing, but we continue to do what we think is necessary from a pricing perspective and taking out costs to make sure that we maintain our margins.","Jeff Fettig","Denise, I'd say our profile in the total Latin America country wise is different than others, so it really depends on your country profile. I'd say, without a question, I think in Brazil, we are relative to our competitive Brazil market, where despite the difficulties, we are in a strong as a position as we have ever been.","Denise Chai","Larry Venturelli","I would just add Denise, keep in mind that in Brazil, we have been leading pricing increases and there is always a lag related to that.","Denise Chai","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Robert Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets.","Robert Wetenhall","Hey. Good morning.","Jeff Fettig","Good morning.","Robert Wetenhall","Hey, just wanted to focus on North America. It looks like unit volumes were flat year-over-year, and it seems like industry shipments are kind of mid-single digit growth; and I think that would suggest that, you guys would have very strong volumes going into fourth quarter, and I just wanted to see if I am thinking about that right; do you see a good spike in volumes, both on a sequential and on a year-over-year basis in North America?","Marc Bitzer","So Robert its Marc, let me first come to Q3 and then we can talk about Q4. In Q3, our volumes have been flat to very slightly down, which also implies that despite Canada and everything else, we had stable to slightly positive price mix, which is, I would say good achievement in a very competitive environment. But ultimately in Q3, we lost market share, even though as always and as we made comments in previous times, our units aren't exactly comparable to T6 or T7 market share, because there is more in our volumes than just T6 and T7. There is also Canada, Mexico, small domestic, etcetera.","Anyhow, having said about Q3, we lost market share -- there are certain elements of different shipment patterns between Q3 and Q4 last year, so that gives a little bit of a tailwind in Q4. But above and beyond, and more importantly, it\u2019s the -- final but fully effective for new product launches, which give us momentum in Q4.","Robert Wetenhall","Got it. And then, taking from that, you had a very strong third quarter margin performance in North America, 12% plus, and that's also at the -- above your full year guidance, top of the range for 11 to 11.5. So should we expect to see very robust margin performance in the fourth quarter ast well?","Marc Bitzer","Robert, as I stated in the previous comments, we expect to be at the top end of that range. Again in context, we gave 10.5 to 11.5. If you just do the arithmetic math, yes, we are at the very top end of that range. I think from a structure margin run rate, we do not expect any surprise, but the question is, how much volume leverage can be captured.","Robert Wetenhall","Got it. And if I could just sneak one more in, can you give a little color in terms of what you are seeing on industry growth trends in Europe and Asia year-to-date, and how kind of organic volumes are trending versus your expectations? Thanks very much.","Marc Bitzer","So Robert, it's Marc again. I am going to give a comment on Europe and then Mike will give a comment on Asia. On Europe, again it\u2019s a split market, if you want to say. But Eastern European market demand continues to be very slow and very much down, which is driven by Russia and Ukraine. As we know, these markets are also historically very volatile markets, so its always difficult to predict how long they will be down. Historically, we didn't see these markets to be down on an extended timing, but right now, year-to-date, they are down significantly, and keep also in mind that the acquisition we have a much higher footprint and exposure in these Eastern European countries, compared to previous years.","The western side, on the other side, I would say its stronger than anticipated. The most markets are in a very healthy and robust phase. But totally, if you add the two numbers together, that's basically 0% to 2% forecast and I would say right now, if Western Europe sustains, then we would be probably at the high side of that range, and that's what we would expect it from today's perspective.","Mike Todman","Okay, Robert. Just to give a little perspective on Asia. As you know, we took the Asia forecast down to about minus two, and that's largely driven by China. China has been slower in terms of market events than we expected, kind of coming into the year. Its at around minus 4% right now, and for that market, it\u2019s a big decline, although in general terms its not and we don't think that it should have a significant impact on our business.","India is a little bit different. We have had a couple of quarters of fairly strong market demand and then the third quarter more, because of seasonal issues it reduced. But we think India will stabilize at a small growth, and that's why we have about a minus two for the year.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Sam Darkatsh","Good morning Jeff, Marc, Larry and Mike how are you?","Jeff Fettig","Good morning.","Mike Todman","Good, Sam.","Sam Darkatsh","And Marc, congratulations and Mike congratulations to you as well, and it was a pleasure working with you over the years.","Mike Todman","Thank you.","Marc Bitzer","Thank you, Sam.","Sam Darkatsh","Couple of questions. First clarification, Marc, if I could peg you on this, what specifically were core shipments in the U.S., as it relates to AHAM comparable?","Marc Bitzer","Sam, its Marc. The key seven, as we look at it, is a plus 8.1% in Q3. That's basically -- and given our guidance of 5%, then you can make the math what it basically implies for Q4, i.e., 4% to 5% in that ballpark. That's what we -- again referring to the key seven units that's consistent with what we previously communicated.","Sam Darkatsh","That's the industry. I was looking for your units in the third quarter.","Marc Bitzer","Our units in the third quarter were almost minus 0.6%. All in, keep in mind, that's more than T7 versus significant impact for Canada in -- their Canadian market is very soft, and there is also impact for Mexico in there.","Sam Darkatsh","Well, I was specifically looking for T7, when you guys were doing in T7 in the quarter?","Marc Bitzer","Sam as you know, we don't typically drill down by U.S. T7 numbers. Directionally flat, slightly -- very-very slightly up, but its not to a level of a market.","Sam Darkatsh","Got you. And two more quick questions if I could, can you give an update, Marc, in terms of the $170 million in acquisition integration savings that you had originally planned for 2016 over 2015. What is that number now, based on currencies and volumes and what have you and how much of that actually do you expect to translate down to the bottom line?","Larry Venturelli","This is Larry. Let's first talk 2015, even with weaknesses in the Euro, we will exceed our 2015 synergy target. At Investor Day we did show 2016 our expectations between 2015 and 2016 would be approximately $170 million. We will update that, but we continue to believe we are going to have some really strong synergies in 2016, consistent with what we have talked about in the past.","Marc Bitzer","And Sam, it's Marc again. Just to add to that response; first of all, we will hit or even exceed the dollar synergy target, which means in local currency, we are actually quite a bit ahead of the original communicated plan. Given that synergies build over time, it shows -- gives you a lot of confidence going into 2016. So far, our integration is running very well and we remain fully committed and confident behind the numbers that we showed at Investor Day and communicate subsequently.","Sam Darkatsh","Thank you. Last question if I could, Larry; you took the free cash flow expectations lower for the year, but you took your CapEx and restructuring cash outlays lower also. I imagine as some of that might be slightly lower net income, but what is the other variable that I am missing in terms of -- like free cash flow is going down now versus prior expectations?","Larry Venturelli","Yeah I think the point I made in my remarks Sam was, we are going to carry a little bit higher inventory than originally expected, and that's primarily due to international product transitions, and that's obviously a timing issue.","Sam Darkatsh","That's already on the books, or that's planned into 4Q also?","Larry Venturelli","Well in the fourth quarter, a little bit higher in inventory than we previously said.","Sam Darkatsh","Got it. Thank you very much gentlemen.","Operator","We will take our next question from Michael Rehaut with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning everyone and congrats also to Marc and best of luck to you Mike.","Mike Todman","Thank you.","Michael Rehaut","The first question, I just -- I guess you [indiscernible] in a couple questions on this already, but I think its going to be -- one of the big focuses coming out of the call and I am referring to North America margins versus volume, and Marc, you kind of mentioned that. You still expect to generate healthy margins, and you have done a lot of heavy lifting in terms of really strong improvement over the last two years. But at this point, it kind of sounds like you are shifting the pendulum a little bit back in the other direction, where you are still going to -- like you said, have healthy margins, but try and achieve some better revenue growth and it sounds like you were maybe a little disappointed with 3Q. Is that the right way to think about it? In other words, the 12% that you have got into 3Q, should we kind of think about that as more or less a high water mark, and maybe when you say, still healthy margins, maybe that could be something a little less than that for next year?","Marc Bitzer","Michael, its Marc. These are obviously several questions embedded in one question, and obviously we don't give guidance at this point for next year. So first of all, on high watermark on peak margins. Keep in minds, the number that are floating around half a year ago, I presume peak margins, we have already proven. And I don't want to nail down whatever is the peak margin. But the only thing which I want to reemphasize, we achieved 12% in Q3 without any volume leverage, which is a big deal.","Having said that, and you mentioned that its not margin versus volume its margin and volume, and I think ultimately for us, it means a better balance between margin expansion and volume growth. Its not margin versus revenue, its margin expansion versus volume growth, and to be very honest, yeah, we will put a strong emphasis on revenue growth without diluting our strong margin profile.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. So in other words, I guess embedded in my first question, what was lacking there was that -- you can't necessarily think about giving up margin, because you are kind of ignoring the leverage benefits from the better volume and as you said, you are still hoping to hold on to the margin levels and maybe just dial back the expansion from here. Did I understand that right?","Marc Bitzer","First of all, again, we are not going to give a 2016 margin guidance, and I am not going to try to say we will hold the margin. [Indiscernible] our emphasis on margin expansion versus revenue growth, and that's what we will kind of carefully balance going forward.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. Appreciate it.","Larry Venturelli","Michael, just keep in mind, the longer term goals for North America, back in December were 12 plus. We are at -- as Marc mentioned, we will be at the higher end of this year in the range of 10.5 to 11.5. So we are very much on track with the longer term perspective of the company, and to Marc's point, we will balance that with revenue growth.","Michael Rehaut","That's there. Appreciate it. Just a few technical questions I guess; you mentioned about the progress with Indesit and at this year, you're exceeding your synergy target. I believe you'd called for $80 million and as you said, $170 million, which will be updated. If you are exceeding this year, and you still remain on track for the full amount of $350 million over the next three years, does that mean that -- maybe you could give us a sense of where you are in 2015 versus the 80 originally expected, and in effect, we should think that perhaps you are holding on to the full $350 million, but some of 2016 is coming into 2015?","Marc Bitzer","Michael, its Marc. Let me try to answer. So first of all on the $80 million, you are correct, that's mostly anticipated restructuring benefit in U.S. dollars. We are in U.S. dollars at the $80 million or slightly above, which means also, compared to our original euro assumption, we are actually trading quite a bit ahead from operating synergies. And again keep in mind, euro is our operating currency in Europe. So I mean, from an -- everyday, what we deliver from synergies, it looks very good. Which also means yes, we are confident on the previously stated $170 million and we are confident on the previously stated $350 million.","The other thing that you got to bear in mind, what we did not anticipate coming in the year, but we have been able to mitigate it for additional actions, there are significant currency issues in Europe, that comes from a weaker euro, because you have a lot of dollar buy in Europe, largely from China, and other Asian areas, and particularly with Ruble and from [indiscernible]. So we have massive currency headwinds. Again I am very pleased that through better synergies and better ongoing cost productivity, we have been fully able to mitigate kind of any currency headwinds.","And if you drill down the European number, what I am particularly pleased with is, the massive margin progress year-over-year is very healthy between gross margin benefits and SG&A improvements. So we are kind of fitting in on both sides.","Larry Venturelli","And Michael to be clear, because you have talked about in both markets. In terms of our direction, that's why we put the margin chart in this. North America, Europe and Asia are falling on track, and I would say also falling on track on our 2018 long range goals. The outlier this year from a regional business, has been Latin America, because of -- again I won't repeat, the currency and the decline in the market, we are dealing with that. But in terms of the expectations, we maybe getting there a slightly different way in Europe, more synergies offset by current transactional currency costs and things like that, but directionally, all three of these regional businesses are on track for a record year and are on track for our 2018 long range goals.","Michael Rehaut","All right. One last one if I could, the tax rate, I believe and then I believe I will hop off. The tax rate guidance at 22%, I guess that's now at the low end of the prior range of 22% to 25% if I have that right. Is that a number, that 22 now for 2015 that we can use for 2016 all else equal, or there are other some one time things and we should think of a tax rate of 22% to 25% long term for the company?","Larry Venturelli","Again Michael, its kind of hard to forecast really long term tax rates. But I would say, going into next year, we would expect our range to be what we stated at the beginning of this year, a similar range.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David, please check the mute function on your phone.","David MacGregor","Yeah, there we go. Sorry about that. Good morning everyone.","Jeff Fettig","Good morning David.","David MacGregor","I guess, I think Michael had the right point, this is truly -- North America is going to be the focal point of the call, wanted to better understand, just some of the moving parts here. It seems as though you don't want to break out Canada and Mexico, maybe just this one point, you may want to make an exception on that, just because it seems to be such a core concern for investors today. But I want to understand kind of the price mix being up 350 basis points and I think gross margins in North America, about 200 basis points. It looks like maybe you are walking away from some unprofitable business, but maybe you could just peel back a little bit and give us a little more color on the moving parts there.","Marc Bitzer","David, its Marc Bitzer. Again in terms of the specific breakdown on Canada, Mexico, we won't provide details, but however I will you a couple of hints, which we will also present at the investor conference. Canada historically has been a $1 billion business for us roughly, that's what we showed -- depending on the currency, that's what we showed all semester day. If you look at the exchange rates, you basically had to do about 25% or almost 30% devaluation over last 18 months. So just do a math on the entire year North America business, it gives you a sense about how much of revenues we are losing in Canada.","To a much smaller extent, but still to an extent, you have Mexico also, but our Mexican business is not the same size as Canada.","So yes that has been impacting, but the reality is, we don't have sufficient growth -- didn't have sufficient growth in Q3 on our U.S. core business, and that's what we will change going forward.","David MacGregor","So are you walking away from a profitable business and maybe just talk a little bit about U.S. or domestic market share?","Marc Bitzer","I mean, David, I wouldn't say we are walking from unprofitable business. I would say, it\u2019s a combination of two things; one, we have not yet found a full leverage of all our new products, as we talked a lot about the massive amount of product introductions, the Kitchen Aids, the new VBL. So we don't yet have the full leverage of all different products in the market. And yes, there is also elements -- as always, there are certain promotions which are non-value creating. We only participate in what value creating promotions, and there has been a slightly higher promotion pressure by certain competitors, more imports in the markets.","David MacGregor","So how much of the apparent share losses occurring on long weekend sales of that is versus day-to-day business?","Marc Bitzer","David, we don't drill it down by promotional times and regular business. But if you connect it back to my previous comments, yes, there has been a slightly higher promotional pressure by certain imports, and that typically comes with extended promotion periods and deeper discounts from promotions.","David MacGregor","I just noticed, that upon the expiration of these retail sales events, MSRPs are popping right back into map line, which would suggest that most of this promotion is happening on sales events. So I am just wondering if that's where your share vulnerability lies?","Marc Bitzer","Not entirely David. Again, typically, yes you would expect during certain promotions, our share may not be exactly the same as during non-promotion periods.","Jeff Fettig","And David, I would say that pattern has not changed on the heavily promoted, particularly the ones that -- the major holidays. We would typically lose share and we bounce right back afterwards. And that pattern hasn't really changed, but I would just say to Marc's point is that certain competitors turn weekend promotions into month long promotions, and that has been a little bit more problematic and we are figuring out ways to deal with it, and we will, and I'd also like to point out that our -- again, I feel very good about the tools we have available. We had some issues to get them all available in the marketplace. As you know, this time of the year, you don't change [indiscernible] everyday, so we are working customer-by-customer and again, I believe we are in a great position to grow and candidly with our good margin structure, its very value creating for us to grow.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Megan McGrath with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.","Megan McGrath","Good morning. Thanks. I guess, just to drill down on this a little bit more, and then I am going to move to Brazil. But one of the things, Marc, you just said is obviously on the promotions, and then you sort of mentioned you haven't found full leverage of the new products, and you have had a pretty robust slate of new products, let's say for the past 10 months or so. Can you point to any reasons why you think those new products haven't taken off as fast as you thought? Is it just because the promotional environment has been higher, or have there been execution issues with getting them out? Can you dig deeper a little bit into that one for us?","Marc Bitzer","So Megan, let me try to address the two points, promotion and the new products. Just to be very clear, our new products, the way how we look at the new products, when we floor and do a turn, I do a sell-through, and that is going very well. I think the uplift, which we get, whenever we have our new products floored, is we are very pleased, to a point where, we sometimes even have capacity constraints. When I talk about the leverage, yes, I mean, as we refer to all the previous calls, there has been a slight delay on how we ramped up the new product, how we get the full production capacity. That impacts the pace at which you can flow the product and subsequently the sell through.","But the important thing is, whenever we have a flow, it sells very well and we are very pleased and that's what gives us a lot of confidence going forward.","On the promotions, it\u2019s the same comments as before. We are participating than we believe we can create value with certain promotions, and in Q3, there have probably been a slightly higher share of promotions, which we would consider clearly non-value creating.","Megan McGrath","And then, can you then walk us through why you think 4Q is going to be different?","Marc Bitzer","First of all, we know what is our ramp up pace of the new product. We know how many were floored and this retail concentration which we have in North America is pretty -- you can't predict pretty well -- depending on the floored units, what rotation you get, and we have a good indication rotation.","Obviously, we also have a certain order pipeline that we know and have a pretty good sense, October-November, that gives us a lot of confidence, and we are certain, as I hinted before. There are certain seasonality elements between Q3, Q4 last year, which are slightly different this year. So a combination of these three factors give us the confidence we have for revenue growth in Q4.","Megan McGrath","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then shifting really quickly to Brazil, I guess one of the things I am trying to get a handle on here is -- I know, I think last quarter, the quarter before you presented the chart around GDP and how it usually bounces back and obviously we are not seeing a bounce back. So what's different in your strategy now, as you look at Brazil versus your strategy three months ago?","Mike Todman","Well Megan, I'd say, our strategy is unchanged. We are essentially executing what we said we were, which is new product introductions and innovations. But we are having to -- and managing our brands in the marketplace, the way we have talked about it. What we have had to do though, is react to a volatile environment. And so, when currency changes, then we have to react to that, when demand goes down, we have to react to that, and our ability to react to that has been very quick. And so we have managed that.","The difference in the Brazil environment right now than I think in some of the past, is you have a political crisis going on now as well. And so, that has just introduced kind of another factor, which has driven some volatility.","What I can tell you is, I feel really good about our ability to respond to that, our ability to -- if you will, change our business profile quickly, but continue to execute our long term strategy. That hasn't changed at all, and I am confident that as we manage through this, we will see improvements in our margins, and when growth returns, we will really like the answer.","Megan McGrath","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.","Ken Zener","Good morning gentlemen.","Jeff Fettig","Good morning Ken.","Ken Zener","Apologize if there is background noise. Look, I think in America, you guys are going to be focused on profitable growth that you are talking about. So Marc, if you could just say, you ran some degree short of your metric [indiscernible]. What percent of that was -- if you don't want to give us market share, how much of that was self-inflicted? Self-inflicted meaning you had products ramping up, etcetera, as opposed to the promotional. Would you say half of it was self-inflicted half of it was promotional?","Marc Bitzer","Ken its Marc. We don't break down how much of a market share was self-inflicted that you call versus promotional environment. At the end of the year, it was market share in a competitive environment, by definition you do 100% in a competitive environment. However I would say, directionally about half of it has been driven by certain constraints, which are under our control, but the other half is particularly focused on certain product categories, where we had a slightly higher promotional pressure intensity by certain imports.","Ken Zener","Okay. And then what would you say, relative to that competitive import pressure; because I believe the tariff review for a large residential loss, which is one of the two effective complaint you guys filed, was actually reduced. Could you comment on that?","Marc Bitzer","So first of all, Ken, and without getting into the details of a dumping discussion, the previous dumping cases which we won, there is a very important aspect; the tariff, referring to certain countries and reductions, some of the imports have shifted their production source. What is in our view, a certain mention on efforts of trying to circumvent the existing tariff, we have been, I think on the investor conference, we have been talking about it that we monitored very closely. And yes, there is a strong correlation between the promotion intensity and where this production has been shifting to, and we are observing it very closely, monitoring very closely. But I don't want to, at this point, reveal what we have or might have as an anti-dumping strategy going forward.","Ken Zener","Understood. Jeff, if we look at LatAm, so your margins as we enter the year, when you guys took guidance from 2014 to 2015, down to 12 to 13. [Indiscernible] to Brazil about currency and demands continue to fall. If we were to sit in that April quarter, your view was that you were going to be ramping up in the second half, towards the longer term 8% to 9% of EBIT. That was deferred obviously in 2Q as reported, because demand is fading. You thought it would be exiting the year, at 8 or 9. And now it says that, you guys, while not giving 2016 guidance, talk about it being below that long term growth rates. Could you give us an understanding of how that long term growth EBIT margin is actually impacted by the contraction we had within that core market being Brazil? Is it possible to hit that 8 to 9 if you just don't have the volume? Because you are not going to go in and restructure your whole footprint, like you have done in various regions.","So are we really shooting at -- if volume is down 30%, let's just say it is [indiscernible] are we going to be sitting more at a 6% to 7% from the total segment?","Jeff Fettig","Ken, to your point and particularly in Brazil; but there is a few other countries also, I would -- to Latin America. We have literally seen three waves so far this year of currency devaluation, which there is a first quarter wave, and then it stabilized for a while, and then there is a second quarter wave and now the third quarter wave, and we have seen the currency from last year go from an average of about 2.30 to 2.35 to now almost 4, and obviously no one forecasted that and nor did the financial markets forecast that.","Now with that, then came an accelerated decline of demand, and those comped, as you can, in a rapidly changing economy like that, you know right now, and all of our forecasts are updated to 20% down in Brazil and about a 4.0 reais and based on that, we are very confident about increasing our margins and forecasting and so on and so forth.","What we really need to see is stability, whether in currency and demand, whatever levels they are; because we adjust, and we have adjusted very rapidly every quarter to these exchanges, but we are chasing a down market right now. Is it going to stabilize in the fourth quarter, I don't know, but to your bigger question, maybe your medium term question is, whatever the reais is and whatever demand levels are, its down 20% or 30%, once it stabilizes, I absolutely believe, given our market position, given our brand equity, we will, number one, continue to have a very strong share position of their share and we will be able to drive at least 8% plus margins, because that's a choice and that's what we would choose to do.","The key is, it\u2019s the rapid profound volatility that you have to adjust to, and it doesn't take us years to adjust, we adjust now within months. We just still -- but we'd have to adjust several times. And so what we really need to do is just wherever the bottom is, see stability, we will start building margins back up from there.","Ken Zener","I appreciate that. And I am going to ask another follow-up question related to LatAm, and if you could -- comfortable to expand on it. Marc, you highlighted Canada at your investor day was $1 billion, there is currency that has changed. Jeff, Marc or Mike, do you guys do the same for LatAm in terms of -- you had Brazil at the same point in December 2014. Could you tell us what percent of LatAm it is today, and if you would, directionally, talk about margins I guess within that segment being brought outside of Brazil, and Brazil, if you would -- because I think on the increment, people are really trying to understand is, if you are looking for stability in Brazil, you haven't found it yet, but we also want to understand how Brazil is different than those two other pockets that I just mentioned, because that's also going to point to the stability, if those businesses exchange table, and are deteriorating. Thank you very much.","Mike Todman","Ken, maybe let me just take a quick shot at that. If you go back to our presentation, we kind of gave you a view, 2014 and then to 2015, what sales look like if you broke them down in LatAm and what the percentages were. What it showed is the compressor business went from 32% to 37% of our LatAm business, that are -- Extend and Expand in international went from 15 to 22, and then it showed that Brazil core went from 53 to 41. So you can see kind of what the rebalancing in sales have been. I can tell you that our compressor business continue to perform, and the margins in our compressor business are exactly where we thought they would be. And remember, this is a global compressor business.","So yes, it has some impact in LatAm and it has an impact in some other regions of the world, but there is some balance, because it also provides product in North America and Europe, etcetera, etcetera. So the margins in that, we have been able to manage, and they are very good.","Our LAR international and Extend and Expand businesses have also performed very well in this environment, and are delivering increases in both sales and we are taking market share in LAR International as well as maintaining a very high margin level.","So the reality is, as we look at the rebalancing, the impact of Brazil core has become less and less on the total. And so we are pretty confident that we are continue to perform in those other businesses, and that's going to allow us to perform in Latin America.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.","Eric Bosshard","Thank you. Two things, first of all, in terms of material cost savings, input savings, if you could update us on 2015 and some thoughts on 2016, and also curious on how you think about those savings relative to the investments that you are considering within the North American business?","Larry Venturelli","Yeah Eric, this is Larry, we have said in the last call that we expect raw material benefits of around $100 million and if trends were to continue, we'd expect it to be north of that, and certainly we would say would be north of that. Its also important for 2015. Its also important to note that, many of the currencies around the world are U.S. dollar based. So when you are in emerging markets, there is a partial currency offset to that. But based on rates we are seeing right now, we'd say north of $100 million for 2015.","Jeff Fettig","And Eric, going into next year, if current trends hold, we will see some further improvement. Based on today's rate, wouldn't be as much next year as this year, because we are already accruing some of those benefits this year. But we have activities. We have productivity activities, we have continued -- the way we look at it is called total cost productivity, which includes not all raw materials, but productivity programs as well as our restructuring synergy. So we are very positive about our ability to generate those next year. We have not -- again, I don't necessarily buy the question, leading to the -- we are going to spend margin money in the marketplace. We are going to be competitive in the marketplace. We have got the right tools, we have got great innovation, great brands, and I fully expect that we will do it in a value creating way.","Chris Conley","With that, we will wrap up the call for today. We would like to thank everybody for your participation, and we will talk to you again.","Jeff Fettig","Thank you everyone for joining us and we will look forward to talking to you next time.","Operator","And this does conclude today's program. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"22923":["Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call April 23, 2019  8:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Max Tunnicliff - Senior Director of Investor Relations","Marc Bitzer - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","James Peters - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","David MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Samuel Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities","Curtis Nagle - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Kenneth Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to Whirlpool Corporation's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Release Call. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Max Tunnicliff.","Max Tunnicliff","Thank you, and welcome to our first quarter 2019 conference call. Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with a presentation available on the Investor Section of our website at whirlpool.com.","Before we begin, I'll remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and other periodic reports.","We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations.","We also think the adjusted measures will provide you a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be open for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 3, we show our first quarter highlights. As you saw in our press release, we delivered another quarter with strong results, including a record first quarter ongoing earnings per share of $3.11. Although revenue growth was impacted by softer demand in certain countries, including the U.S., Canada, Mexico, China, and several European countries, we delivered global EBIT margin expansion of 30 basis points driven by excellent price\/mix progress and sustained fixed cost discipline.","Additionally, our North America region delivered very impressive results with EBIT margin expansion of 90 basis points despite continued macro pressures. This performance gives us continued confidence in delivering our full-year guidance, which remains unchanged in total and raw material favorability is offset by lower industry demand expectations.","Turning to Slide 4, I\u2019ll discuss our first quarter results in more detail. Excluding currency, we delivered global revenue growth of 1% and very strong price\/mix more than offset unit volume declines. Ongoing EBIT margin was 6.3% for the quarter compared to 6% last year driven by very strong price\/mix.","Finally, our first quarter free cash flow reflects normal seasonality of cash usage and was unfavorably impacted by the timing of certain payments. Overall, we are very pleased with our first quarter results and believe we are well-positioned to deliver on our full-year commitment.","Turning to Slide 5, we show the details of our first quarter margin performance. We delivered approximately 300 basis points of margin improvement as we realized the carryover benefits of prior year pricing actions as well as new pricing actions during the first quarter primarily in the United States.","We continue to expect margin benefit from price\/mix throughout the year, which will moderate slightly on a year-over-year basis as we begin to compare against higher pricing in the second half of 2018. These benefits were partially offset by approximately 250 basis points of cost inflation and unfavorable currency.","Now I'll turn it over to Jim to review our regional results.","James Peters","Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7, I'll review the first quarter results for our North America region. We delivered very strong results in the quarter with revenue growth and strong EBIT margin expansion despite a challenging macro environment, which included a 7% decline in industry demand and continued cost pressures.","Overall, we expanded EBIT margin by approximately 90 basis points as very strong price\/mix was partially offset by over 125 basis points of cost inflation. Our results in North America once again demonstrate the strength of our underlying business and our ability to overcome significant external pressures and is a testament to our strong brand and product portfolio, fixed cost discipline and flexible supply chain.","Turning to Slide 8, we review the first quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales increased nearly 2%, while unit volumes increased 5%, in line with our prior guidance and our improvement actions to stabilize volume. EBIT margins improved 40 basis points, primarily from the benefits of our fixed cost reduction actions and volume improvement, which were partially offset by lower production levels as we continue to right size our business.","Additionally, EBIT margins were unfavorably impacted by approximately 60 basis points as we continue to liquidate our remaining inventory in Turkey. As it relates to our improvement actions, we are on track to complete the exit of our Turkish domestic sales operations and Hotpoint-branded small appliance business by the end of the second quarter. And we continue to actively market our South Africa operations for a potential sale.","Now we turn to Slide 9 to review the first quarter results for our Latin America region. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales increased approximately 7%, driven by unit volume growth, share gains, and positive price\/mix, despite negative industry demand in Mexico.","EBIT margin benefited from the carryover impact of our previously announced cost-based price increases plus additional improvements through continued cost discipline. These actions offset unfavorable currency of over 100 basis points. Lastly, prior year results were favorably impacted by the monetization of approximately $22 million in certain tax credits.","We now turn to the first quarter results for our Asia region, which are shown on Slide 10. Excluding the impact of currency net sales decreased 12%. Our India business had another excellent quarter and delivered solid unit volume growth with share gains and EBIT margin improvement. However, this was offset by significant volume weakness due to sharp decline in industry demand along with increased brand investments in China. As we transitioned from Sanyo branded products to the Whirlpool brand.","Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Marc to review our guidance.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks, Jim. On Slide 12, our guidance assumptions for 2019 remain unchanged. In line with our long-term goals, we expect to drive organic net sales growth of approximately 3%. As before, we expect to deliver ongoing EBIT margins of 6.5% to 6.8%, a 40 basis point improvement compared to 2018.","Consistent with previous guidance, we expect free cash flow of $800 million to $900 million progressing strongly towards our long-term cash conversion goal of 5% to 6% of net sales. Our first quarter results strengthen our confidence in delivering on our full-year financial commitment, and we continue to expect to deliver ongoing earnings per share of $14 to $15.","Turning to Slide 13, we show the updated drivers of our EBIT margin guidance. We expect approximately 150 basis points of improvement related continued price and mixed benefits in 2019, in line with our previous guidance. We now expect to deliver net cost improvement of 50 basis point based on revised industry demand and related lower production volume expectations.","Although macro economic pressures remain elevated, raw material inflation has slowed down, leading us to revise our cost inflation guidance favorably by 25 basis points for the full-year. In total, our margin guidance remains unchanged and we continue to expect meaningful margin expansion versus the prior year.","Now, Jim will cover our regional guidance and cash priorities.","James Peters","Thanks, Marc. On Slide 14, we show our regional industry and EBIT margin guidance for the year. Our regional industry guidance ranges are unchanged with the exception of North America. Based on weaker than expected, U.S. industry in the first quarter, we are revising our guidance range to negative 2% to flat for the full-year.","Although industry demand guidance is unchanged for the remaining regions, we are trending towards the low-end of the range in Latin America and Asia, as Mexico and China both experienced negative industry demand in the first quarter.","In North America, we continue to expect EBIT margins of at least 12% as benefits from price\/mix actions are partially offset by lower industry demand and raw material and tariff inflation.","As we look to the second quarter, we have two items that will cause North America margins to more closely resembled the first quarter rather than the normal sequential quarterly improvement that you would expect. We plan to reduce production volumes to right size inventory levels and increase marketing investments in support of product launches.","In EMEA, we remain confident in our ability to deliver above breakeven results for the full-year, as we continue focusing on restoring volume and right sizing our business. We anticipate exiting the second quarter at a breakeven rate, meaning third quarter results should reflect the first full quarter of positive EBIT in the year. Lastly, our guidance for Latin America and Asia remains unchanged.","Turning to Slide 15. I will discuss the drivers of our 2019 free cash flow. With margin guidance unchanged, we continue to expect cash earnings to positively impact free cash flow, partially offset by the sale of our Embraco compressor business. We remain committed to driving sustainably lower working capital, which is expected to result in $200 million of working capital improvement in 2019.","We continue to anticipate lower restructuring cash outlays, leaving guidance unchanged at $100 million for the year. And as previously discussed, our first quarter free cash flow was unfavorably impacted by the timing of certain items, primarily the partial French Competition Authority payment of approximately $50 million. The remaining balance of approximately $50 million will be paid in the second quarter. In total, we remain committed to delivering free cash flow of $800 million to $900 million, excluding the anticipated proceeds from the sale of Embraco.","Turning to Slide 16. We show our capital allocation priorities. Our capital allocation priorities for the year remain unchanged. We will continue to make significant progress towards our year-end gross debt-to-EBITDA target of 2.0.","In addition, we raised our quarterly dividend for the seventh consecutive year, which is a reflection of our confidence in the business and our ability to generate strong free cash flow going forward. Lastly, we repurchased approximately $50 million of common stock in the quarter and anticipate a similar level of quarterly repurchases for the remainder of the year.","Now we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David MacGregor from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","David MacGregor","Yes. Good morning, everyone.","Marc Bitzer","Good morning, David.","James Peters","Good morning, David.","David MacGregor","Congratulations on a good quarter in a tough environment. But I guess, I wanted to talk about the price\/mix, and you're implied price\/mix [was 110] basis points and how much of that was price versus what was realized from an improved mix? And I guess how sustainable do you feel you\u2019re pricing is given your reduced North American industry volume guidance? And I have a follow-up.","Marc Bitzer","David, it\u2019s Marc. Let me just take this question. So I'm not exactly sure, which 800 basis points you\u2019re referring to. First of all, again a) is the average sales value is not necessarily what we would refer to what margin impact coming from price\/mix.","So our price\/mix overall in terms of margin impact was significantly positive. It's been one of the strongest we ever record as company. It's deemed as a title, not only North America, but also \u2013 regions and across most categories. That is ultimately still reflection of \u2013 as you know, we have cumulative significant material cost increases over two years in the tune of $650 million and we had several rounds of cost-based price increases. As you know, I can't give a forward-looking statement of pricing, but the need for us in terms of mitigating this cumulative material costs impact is still there.","Yes, we've got a little bit of relief, small relief on the increase in material cost, but the fundamental cost inflation is still in place. And we executed what we had to do from a price increase. And I would say our team has done a very good job in managing these price increases.","I would also like to emphasize with all the new product introductions, we have opportunities for price\/mix. We've done that so far. And I think there is more price\/mix opportunity, particularly with the new products coming out there, which should help us on a full-year basis.","David MacGregor","Okay. Second question just on Europe. Can you give us a little more detail on your first quarter efforts to get relisted with European retailers and what we see evidence of that success in the second quarter results?","Marc Bitzer","Yes. So David, I mean as you know for Q4 earnings release in January, we indicated we want to have or we should expect to see about 5% volume growth in Europe and that's what we've seen. So I would say Q1 marks for first quarter where we kind of stemmed this volume decline, which is I would say an early indication of success of getting relisted on a number of floors.","But it would be also \u2013 first one to say a lot more needs to be done. We are 5% up in Q1. We're still below where we have been one or two years ago. So there are still more to be done. But I would read the Q1 numbers from a relisting perspective as an encouraging first milestone, and hopefully we see more milestones along the way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Samuel Darkatsh","Good morning, Marc. Good morning, Jim. How are you?","Marc Bitzer","Good, Sam. Good morning.","James Peters","Hi, Sam.","Samuel Darkatsh","Two questions. First, I wanted to explore production versus shipments in North America. I think last year \u2013 I think your production was down maybe call it 10% versus shipments, which is really a significant drag on last year's margin. Jim, could you help color in terms of what that might have been from a quantification standpoint in terms of what the headwind was last year from that lower production? I know you're mentioning that you're going to cut production in the second quarter, but your 2019 guidance, what does that assume for production versus shipments in 2019 maybe excluding the second quarter reset?","James Peters","Yes. Sam, overall our assumption for 2019 is that production will be slightly lower than shipments because we've targeted additional working capital takeout, which obviously primarily comes from inventory. So the assumption for the full-year is a similar level of not to the extent we had in 2018.","Now specifically Q1 in North America if you look at what the U.S. industry did, and again it was below our expectations, so we had to adjust our production late in the quarter, and most of that will actually be adjusted out to reduce our production levels to shipment levels in the second quarter.","Year-over-year it's not going to be a significantly material amount, but we will have a little bit lower production in Q2. And then pretty similar for the rest of the year if you look at where we're assuming the industry is as you get to the back half of the year, production levels should be relatively similar year-over-year.","Marc Bitzer","Sam, it\u2019s Marc. Maybe just to add an additional comments before you get into your second question. Again, on last year\u2019s impact, volume leverage is a factor in our industry, okay, in our business and most of you guys tend to work with $0.10 or $0.15 per inventory dollar, which is in total not a wrong number.","But you need to keep in mind, it can be very, very different product by product and that just depends on the fixed cost intensity on respective factory and manufacturing loaders. But it is a factor. And last is inventory reduction as such was a drag on our overall profit, which we knew about and that's just the reality.","Q1 from an inventory perspective looks good year-over-year, it's still up versus year-end. And in all transparency kind of the market was a touch softer than we expected and particularly North America, and you also know you can\u2019t just from one week to never adjust inventory levels, and we will do so in Q2 because very simply we committed, we don't want to have elevated inventory levels and we will deal with bit, whenever we feel it's kind of time to adjust it and we will do it in Q2. So that will be an impact on our overall profitability. Having said that, it is baked into our guidance.","Samuel Darkatsh","Thank you. Second question, Marc. I know you mentioned that your inventories at least domestically are a little higher than you expected. How would you characterize the channel inventories also? Are we going to see some drawdowns at retail as well?","Marc Bitzer","Yes. Sam, I mean \u2013 and again, we \u2013 as you know, we have some information that particularly refers to the inventory relates to our products with most of the retailer. I would say right now the inventory level is actually pretty balanced. Last year, at the same period, there were some inventory moves are driven by a number of factors out there, which kind of probably elevated the Q1 sell-in number from industry a little bit. Right now, I would say the inventory BEFIEX trade is reasonably balanced. So we don't see significantly elevated inventory levels right now with retailers and that's pretty much across the board.","Samuel Darkatsh","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Rehaut from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. First question, I just want to make sure because there \u2013 we\u2019ve got some questions last night, this morning around the inventory levels and appreciate the guidance and the thoughts around there. So just want to get a sense then when you say that to clarify, I guess that first quarter \u2013 I'm sorry, second quarter North American margins to be similar to a year-ago that's about 40 basis points of a sequential decline.","Are we to take it that that is the full impact of the inventory drawdown or the reduction in inventory, the reduced production levels, and perhaps you can just give a sense of what are some of the pluses and minuses there, because obviously you had a strong 90 bps year-over-year improvement? Now you're talking about flat, perhaps it's more of a 90 basis point impact. Just trying to get a sense of the degree of magnitude and what type of dollar inventory reduction you're shooting for as a result.","Marc Bitzer","Yes, Michael, it\u2019s Marc. First of all, on the \u2013 let me start with North American margins. As you know, we don't give quarterly guidance on the total \u2013 on the region. Having said that, we guided the full-year North America was 12% plus EBIT margin, and starting the year with Q1 was 12.3%. I would probably say we're somewhere between confident and very confident on the 12% plus.","Okay, that's a reality, and I don't think you should expect any irregular or abnormal move than any of the quarter for the year. So we see that right now and we've demonstrated that over last year, a very steady, very strong performance. So any kind of inventory moves are baked in, in this one, and we have a comment I want to make on the inventories. Let's not take without a proportion.","So year-over-year, our Company inventories are down. That\u2019s a good starting point. But I think you've seen it also over the last two years, we've been very disciplined in managing our working capital. That was a big part of our cash flow story.","And we want \u2013 at the moment, we see even a slight increase of inventory versus where we want to have, we will adjust it. So it is not a big, a massive move, but it's something which we will do in Q2. And as such, you should not see a big impact on the margin, but more steady margin also on a sequential basis.","James Peters","Yes, I mean Michael, this is Jim. I think as Marc pointed out, if you look at our overall working capital, last year we were close to as a percentage of sales on net working capital at 7% in Q1 and now we're closer to 4.5%. If you look at our cash flow statement, you see we built an incremental $100 million of inventory this year versus last year. And that's really indicative of the amount that we look to get out sooner in the second quarter here. So not a massive amount, but an amount that we're very focused on, reducing in the near-term.","Michael Rehaut","That's very helpful. And the stability overall in the operating margins is pretty notable and impressive, so congrats on that. I guess secondly, as you look to continuing to execute the actions in Europe, obviously you've got some progress there from a volume standpoint this quarter, still kind of working your way through some of the other restructuring items as you gave us that update as well.","How should we think about the longer-term margin targets that you've set? I think initially two or three years ago it was that 8% number for EMEA. I think now you've kind of ratcheted it back to like a 4% or 5% number. How should we think about the timing over the next couple of years in terms of achieving that mid single-digit margin target? Should we be pushing it out? Is it on track? Anything around the timelines of how to think about kind of that that improvement walk of profitability over the next couple of years?","Marc Bitzer","Yes, Michael, it's Marc. So again, let me maybe also put that in context. Obviously, we haven't made a loss in Europe for last several quarters. Our key are \u2013 80% or 70% of our focus is on the operational levers to turnaround the business.","And that has been largely around recovering volume, doing additional restructuring actions, exiting Turkey, domestic markets and the small domestic appliance on the Hotpoint-brand and potentially selling the South Africa business.","All of these actions on track, but not completed. I would say probably with the exception of South Africa, most of these ones will be completed for our Q2. So I feel good about where we are from an operational turnaround.","And as Jim indicated and as we repeatedly said, we expect the full-year in Europe to breakeven are 0% to 1% operating margin and we expect to exit Q2 with a number which is close to breakeven. So I would say from an operation perspective on track.","We've also \u2013 why we're doing these operational priorities, we have redefined our strategy for Europe last year, and that is starting to take place. We would put several actions in place and that is largely around \u2013 focused around how we regain lost market share in particular from a kitchen business, which is a very profitable business and how we can further mix up the business. Now we always said these strategies take longer to implement, but I feel good about where we are from first step.","Now with all of that in mind, we lost time against this famous 8% targets. We lost probably two years. And that's just what we lost. So we still believe the business is structured capable of delivering 8% EBIT margin, but we as evidenced by some competitors. So this industry in Europe can deliver 8% EBIT margin. But we lost time.","On the exact time line about what we expect the mid-term and long-term, I would actually ask Mike, we will give an update at our Investor Day in New York, so we will show you both the mid-term targets and the long-term targets, but long-term target will be 8%, but we'll give you more specific timeline about what we expect over the next two or three years.","Michael Rehaut","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Susan Maklari from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Susan Maklari","Thank you. Good morning.","Marc Bitzer","Good morning, Susan.","Susan Maklari","My first question is just around broader U.S. demand. It seems like from a unit level that the industry is sort of implying that there's a much softer economic backdrop than what we're actually seeing. I mean in spite of housing sort of being weaker in the first quarter, you're still seeing unemployment and GDP and all those kinds of things that are supportive. And so can you just help us maybe understand where the disconnect is? How you're feeling about the business as you exited the first quarter? And maybe how we should think about these two opposing dynamics coming together as we move through the year?","Marc Bitzer","Yes. Susan, it\u2019s Marc. Let me take this one. So the U.S. demand in particular, I mean as you\u2019ve seen \u2013 the trailing four quarters have been negative, and Q1 and Q4 last year from sell-in was soft, and frankly also a little bit softer when we did expect. I would say, first of all \u2013 and we indicated that already a little bit in Q4, but also Q1 the sell-through is stronger than the sell-in right now, which is partially a reflection of \u2013 last year around the same time it was quite a bit of elevated inventory of a trade driven by a number of factors. That is one element.","And right now, I would say the trade customers out there they don't start Q2 with an elevated inventory levels, it\u2019s pretty much normalized. So there's some inventory moves, so the sell-through is not as soft as you right now would read from a pure sell-in.","Now having said that, the overall market has been, call it sluggish or moving sideways, it was slightly down. That is ultimately driven by two factors. One is, the two basic components of demand being replacement and discretionary demand. For replacement one \u2013 and we started seeing that over last year. We now comping from replacement against the low cycle pretty much 10 years ago. We knew that coming in.","The offsetting item was always the discretionary demand, which is coming largely from housing and remodeling. And as you've seen the housing market over the last six months has been soft, not very soft, but it's been kind of softer than most people expected. And when you see existing home sales of $5.1 million and housing starts below $1.2 million, that is probably a little bit softer, touch softer than most people expected, including us.","Having said that, and we said that in both the last two earnings calls, we believe the fundamental dynamics of the U.S. housing market are still intact and that is largely driven. We always said that housing market has been supply constrained from the early days on. It's still supply constrained. And what happens now is that with mortgage rates rise over last year and the appreciation of home prices, which probably was a little bit faster than you would expect from a cycle that led to a little bit a suppression of demand, particularly Q4 and we saw some of it in Q1.","Having said that the fundamental demands from demographic development, household formation, if you look at the age of both rental and owned housing stock is very encouraging in terms of driving demand going forward. So we just don't see the housing market coming down. We see it stabilizing and potentially growing at low single-digit over the next couple of years. And that's why we also still our fundamental confident that the U.S. overall clients demand remain stable.","Susan Maklari","Okay. Thank you for the color. That's helpful. My second question is just around the update in terms of the inflation and the raw material side of things. Can you just give us a little more color on what's been going on, especially with steel and resins? And then within that, also what are you including in terms of tariffs? I know that the 25% step up was initially in there with that seeming to be much, much less likely in there. How do we think about the role that that's playing in the $200 million to $250 million?","Marc Bitzer","Susan, again it\u2019s Marc. So as you've heard from our pre comments, overall, we see less of a headwind from a raw material tariff side. And that\u2019s why we slightly adjusted the margin walk, and we basically took the kind of headwinds down by a quarter from a margin point on a full-year basis. That part is largely coming from raw materials, but not only \u2013 let me just give you a little bit more color.","On raw material side, I would say steel is by and large where we expected and we kind of, trends pretty much confirm what we have in mind. Having said, but in Q1 we still had year-over-year increases. Raw and plastics are stable. But frankly, there is a little bit uncertainty around the recent appreciation of oil prices and we got to see how that all plays out. And we ever raw materials gave us a little bit of relief and relief versus our original inflation assumption. It is still in total year-over-year increase and we should not lose side of that.","So I would say the biggest part of a reduction of headwinds came from probably slightly better outlook and raw materials. On a tariff, there is a marginal change, which is also included in these numbers. And that is largely coming from the List 3 on Section 301 tariffs, where we originally had 25% as of April in mind and from what it looks right now, it will probably remain at 10% at least for the time being and until we get new news.","I think in an earlier call we said bad impact on its own is about 2 million or 3 million every month. So yes, that is a slide positive impact and that is we ever component and why we reduce the overall raw material in tariffs. I just also want to \u2013 in my context also remind again our uncertainties on raw materials and tariffs and other elements.","So we still have oil price, which is right now at 66. The currencies are concerned around the world to give you one example of Brazilian reals is at $393 million and the mid-quarter Q1, it was around $365 million. So there are other moving pieces. Again, we included all of these moving pieces factored within and that's why we feel this confidence, but our guidance right now is the right guidance for the year.","Susan Maklari","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Curtis Nagle from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Curtis Nagle","Good morning. Thank you very much. Would you guys be able to give the demand split in the U.S. between replacement housing and discretionary? I believe at least the last numbers I saw were something the order of 50% and then 25% and 25%, is that still hold?","Marc Bitzer","Yes, Curtis. This is Marc. First of all, there's a big caveat, there is no scientific definition of replacement market versus discretionary markets. In our definition and we can give you and Max can give you a follow-up. We right now would estimate for 2019, about 54% or 55% of the total market is about replacement versus discretionary. I think the more important thing is the absolute numbers.","On replacement side, we've seen that now, I would over the last one and a half years that replacement side stabilizers starts coming down and that is simply reflection of the appliance demands kind of 10 years ago, which is a typical replacement cycle kind of getting into a trough. And the discretionary side right now is, I've would say moving sideways and we would have expected by now \u2013 of discretionary side to probably show a little bit more strength than we originally had in mind.","James Peters","Yes, and you're split on the discretionary, you had 25%, 25% on the \u2013 typically it's more bus, 15% is new housing and the remainder is remodels and other discretionary. So just to give you the full split out there.","Curtis Nagle","Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate it. Yes and then I guess just a follow-up on China. I guess first how much we're volumes down and look I mean, I guess if things don't progress, I know you are going through a transition in terms of brands, if you don't stretch us in progress, what would you consider exiting the market? Just given you guys are probably positioned; maybe number five or so in terms of market share. The climb up probably is it would take awhile and it \u2013 I mean take awhile to actually start doing some profitability there. So yes, I guess how are you thinking about positioning in that market?","Marc Bitzer","So Curtis, this is Marc. So first of all, as you indicated China was a soft Q1 and obviously in our overall Asia numbers, but shows unit down 10%. That is a reflection of India, Southeast Asia, but including Hong Kong, there's a very strong performance in Q1, strong market share, strong EBIT performance, but China was soft. But China soft you really alluded to a branch transfer. I would first start with the market environment.","As you know the market data in China and not a 100% accurate always and become a certain delay, but right now it's fair to assume it, but China market in total was high single-digit down or low double-digit down. So we saw a significant market softness, which doesn't make it easier. We are in the mist of the branch transfer and that will be with us for a number of years, and we saw very strong growth of Whirlpool brand, but we of course tend the opposite effect on the Sanyo brand, which is coming down.","So the net effect between industry brand transfer. We had significant volumes down in China. We are committed to do a brand transfer. That's why you've also seen in significant more investments in brand advertising in China in Q1 and you will see that going forward. So we are committed to make this brand transfer successful.","And keep all this in mind when we talk about China, China as far as a very important production base. We've produced microwave pretty much throughout the world. We have a very sophisticated and strong four-door refrigerator coming out of China. We have more and more exports. So China is for us beyond the domestic market, which of course it's challenging, I agree. It's a very important and also long-term important production base for us.","Curtis Nagle","Okay, fair enough. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Dahl from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Michael Dahl","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Marc Bitzer","Good morning.","James Peters","Good morning.","Michael Dahl","I wanted to follow-up, Marc and Jim, just as a clarification, the 2Q commentary around North America margins. I thought in the opening remarks, the comments were that margins would be resemble first quarter margins in North America rather than year-ago margins. So I just want to clarify that because 12.3% is still a pretty solid number in the context of the pressures that you're talking about on production takedowns?","James Peters","Yes, Mike. This is Jim. And I think, when you look at it quarter-over-quarter, again as we've said for the full-year, we expect North America to be 12% plus. So it implies that we're going to \u2013 and as Marc said earlier, we don't give quarterly guidance, but that we're going to be close to that number throughout the year.","And that \u2013 within the first quarter, we did have a slight benefit and as I say, slight benefit of some incremental production above our shipment levels that will correct in the second quarter, but it won't be a significant deviation. So I think you should think about it that way.","Michael Dahl","Got it, okay. And my second question, I think you guys adopted new lease accounting this year, and I was hoping you could give us a little more detail on what, if any impact it had on the P&L? Where it's coming from sundry expense was an income line. So I don't know if there was something impacting that or if it somewhere else, but just any detail you can give us on the lease accounting and maybe also the sundry?","James Peters","Yes. So if you step back, Mike and listen and look, lease accounting was a U.S. wide change that was made to the accounting rules that you had to adopt by now. And effectively, you put all your leases now on your balance sheet rather than having in this off balance sheets. So we put over $800 million on our balance sheet that that offsets \u2013 that there's an offset for a future payable on that.","The impact of the P&L is nothing, because you were currently flowing that through as a lease expense. You still follow that through in a similar way, still have similar cash payments. It's just the way that you now have to put these on your balance sheet versus you had them off your balance sheet before.","In terms of the sundry, what we had within that line is we had a \u2013 we carved this out of ongoing, so it's only in our GAAP results. We had a significant gain in Latin America. On a legal case, we won regarding some operational taxes. So we recognized about an $85 million gain and that's net of income taxes on it and success fees, legal success fees. And again that's carved out, but that sits down in that that interest in sundry line. So again we \u2013 it's nothing that's \u2013 that affects our ongoing results within there.","Michael Dahl","Okay. Thank you.","James Peters","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zener from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Zener","Good morning, everybody.","Marc Bitzer","Good morning, Ken.","James Peters","Good morning.","Kenneth Zener","Nice North America margins as well as new picks in your presentation. I'm sure you're going to be addressing this stuff at your Analyst Day. So I only really have one question for you. Given the strength of your North American margins, obviously that alleviates up, I think near-term pressure, people thought might have occurred from new production coming into America. It's going to be a long debate obviously.","But my question to you is operationally. So you help guidance \u2013 you obviously got a lot of price. What other levers would you have had offset the decline in U.S. production. But for the tailwind you had from the lower input cost.","So I mean would \u2013 except for the lower input cost, would you have had to cut production? Or I mean were there other levers that you could have pulled? And I think it just goes to kind of the operating flexibility that the platform might have and no way am I taking obviously anything away from the price strength you've had. I'm just wondering if you could address that one piece. Thank you very much.","Marc Bitzer","Yes. So Ken, let me maybe try to take that one. And again, we will give a more strategic perspective on North America in Investor Meeting. But just operationally, first of all, I want to emphasize, if you look at North America margins, this has not been a one quarter wonder. We had now very strong margin for an extended period and particularly if you look at the last \u2013 the trailing four quarters, the industry was down. And in North America also even though we don't show regional inventory, over the last four quarter, we took even inventories down in a broader negative industry.","So I would say the team has successfully and impressively demonstrated we can expand margins despite these tough environments. So in any given quarter, you have some pluses and minuses of industry, et cetera, but over last four quarters, we have a sustained margin run rate and we're now kind of on 12% or 12% plus. So I feel very good about it. It will be a little bit too easy to just [say that] in Thailand [indiscernible] pricing.","Yes, I feel very, very good about the pricing. The team has done an excellent job in executing price, remaining disciplined, staying focused on value creation for any kind of promotions, so we've done that very well. But we also had our fixed cost base very well intact.","In such an environment or particularly two or three years ago, you would have been tempted to expand fixed costs and particularly with strong margin. We were very disciplined in managing the fixed costs, and we will remain so ultimately in the future.","The other elements and that in particularly going forward, we are getting better in finding more traction and managing down this massive cost inflation, which again is not just raw materials and tariffs, it is logistic cost and everything else. It's been very painful. We start seeing now, I would say progress in managing these costs down, and of course going forward, we have to turn around the negative cost environment and find actions, which are now controlled to mitigate whatever inflationary pressure we have around us.","So in short, I would really emphasize that the cost take out opportunities despite a still broad inflationary environment, which we will add to the equation beyond managing price\/mix in a disciplined manner.","Kenneth Zener","Thank you very much.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Marc Bitzer","Yes. Again, first of all, I want to thank you all for your questions. Very good questions. As you've seen before, we finished a very strong Q1. We are not going to get carried away. We feel very good about the year, and we feel very good about the pricing progress, we feel very good about our North American margins coupled with strong performance in Latin America. I think you've all seen that our European turnaround actions are on track, yet a lot still needs to be done, but we remain confident on full-year.","So with that in mind, I really look forward to hopefully seeing many of you at our Investor Day in New York, but in particular, we can also spend a little bit more time talking about your rightful questions about the mid-term, the long-term and what our margin guidance is by region and for the Company total.","So with that, I thank you all and wish you a very nice day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"22918":["Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 25, 2018  8:00 PM ET","Executives","Max Tunnicliff - IR ","Marc Bitzer - CEO","Jim Peters - CFO","Analysts","David MacGregor - Longbow Research","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse","Curtis Nagle - Banc of America Merrill Lynch","Michael Rehaut - JPMorgan","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James","Ken Zener - KeyBanc Capital","Sam Eisner - Goldman Sachs","Megan McGrath - MKM Partners","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to Whirlpool Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Call. Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Max Tunnicliff.","Max Tunnicliff","Thank you and welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 conference call. Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available at the Investors section of our website at whirlpool.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports. ","We want to remind you that today\u2019s presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We also think the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks, and good morning everyone. On slide 3 we show our fourth quarter highlights. As you saw in our press release, our Q4 ongoing earnings per share were $4.10 in line with expectations. GAAP earnings were impacted by a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $420 million related to a tax reform. We are pleased that despite continued promotional intensity in many countries, we delivered positive global price mix in the quarter and are positioned well on price mix going into 2018. It was our first quarter with positive global price mix since Q4 2015. ","We delivered strong margins of 11.8% in our North American region, a 60 basis points improvement. Since last quarter\u2019s announcement, we\u2019ve made significant progress in global price mix and our fixed cost reduction initiatives. These are progressing ahead of expectations and we remain confident they will be a catalyst for margin expansion in 2018. ","As a testament to the underlying strength of our business, we returned record $1.1 billion to shareholders this year. We repurchased $750 million in common stock and paid more than $300 million in dividends, and we expect to continue returning strong levels of cash in 2018. ","Before I turn to our financial results, I want to quickly discuss the outcome of our safeguard petition on washers. After nearly a decade of litigation, we are thankful that US government has announced an effective remedy. This decision is a victory for American workers and will enable new manufacturing jobs here in United States, including the [new 200] [ph] jobs we have announced at our Clyde, Ohio manufacturing plant. At this point however it is too early to quantify the financial impact on 2018. But this is without any doubt a positive catalyst for Whirlpool. ","Now turning to slide 4, we show our financial results as it relates to our long term goals. We delivered revenue growth of approximately 1% during the quarter and a full year growth of 2.6%. Our fourth quarter growth was impacted by weaker demand in the US and certain countries in Europe. ","Ongoing EBIT margins were 6.6% for the quarter, 70 basis points a bit lower than the same period last year. For the full year we delivered 6.4% ongoing EBIT margin. I will discuss the factors that contributed to our reduced margins on the next slide. ","Free cash flow was 707 million for the full year, an improvement of nearly $80 million versus the prior year, but below our own expectations. The key reason for softer unexpected free cash flow was elevated inventory as a result of weaker than expected industry demand in the US and several other major countries. ","I\u2019m confident that the margin recovery actions we\u2019ve taken in 2018 including the actions launched last quarter and a renewed focus on inventory management will deliver significant earnings and free cash flow improvement in the coming years.","On slide 5, we show the drivers of our fourth quarter and full year margin performance. During the quarter, we improved price mix year-over-year. Cost takeout and raw material inflation were in line with expectations, and for the full year we delivered positive net cost take out more than offsetting significant increased raw material inflation. Finally in the fourth quarter we had higher technology and infrastructure expenses compared to the prior year, primarily due to a quarterly timing of certain [indiscernible] and product related expenses. ","On slide 6, I will discuss our price mix performance in more detail. In total, fourth quarter price mix improved by approximately 50 basis points, compared to the prior year. In North America, we mixed positively towards the cooking category and the KitchenAid brand. In addition we slightly reduced our participation in some Black Friday promotions. ","For the full year price mix was approximately flat in North America, as our strong exit rate offset unfavorable price mix earlier in the year. In the rest of the world, price mix was unfavorable for the year, primarily due to category demand mix in Latin America and the impact of brand transitions and selling through obsolete inventory in Europe. ","Overall, we are pleased with our exit rate or price mix and we are confident that the improvement we saw in the fourth quarter will continue through 2018. ","With that I\u2019d like to turn it over to Jim to review our recent financial results. ","Jim Peters","Thanks Marc and good morning everyone. Turning to slide 8, we review fourth quarter results for our North America region. Net sales were $3.1 billion, flat to the prior year. The US industry grew below our expectations and we reduced our participation in certain non-value creating holiday promotions in the fourth quarter. While revenue was flat, we are pleased with our performance in North America. ","Overall margins improved 60 basis points to 11.8%, despite a 75 basis points impact from raw material headwinds. We are confident that we are executing the right actions to deliver significantly improved price mix in the coming year, while maintaining appropriate share positions and driving growth. ","On slide 9, we review the fourth quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Net sales were $1.4 billion, up 1.5% versus the prior year. Operating profit was 4 million, down versus the prior year. Compared to the prior year, our operating margins were negatively impacted by approximately $20 million of raw material inflation or 150 basis points. ","We experienced holiday demand below expectations in several key countries. We also experienced unfavorable price mix of approximately $25 million, as we continue to progress through brand transitions partially offset by our pricing actions. ","As we enter 2018, we are focused on completing our (inaudible) integration and clearing remaining obsolete inventory early in the year. This will likely unfavorably impact our margins during the first half of the year. We expect to ramp up from improved price mix, product availability, and marketing spend efficiency in the second half. ","Turning to slide 10, we review the fourth quarter results for our Latin America region. Net sales were $905 million, an increase of 5% versus the prior year. Operating profit was $64 million and margins were 7.1%. Raw material inflation impacted margins by approximately $15 million or 150 basis points. Despite these headwinds we delivered solid margins. ","The industry began to shift back to refrigeration from washers, lessening price mix pressures. Additionally, we realized the favorable impact of selling and monetizing certain tax credits in Brazil. ","We now turn to the fourth quarter results for our Asia region, which are shown on slide 11. Net sales were $333 million compared to $352 million in the prior year period. We recorded an operating loss of $1 million for the quarter and margins were impacted by continued raw material inflation of approximately $10 million. Our results were also impacted by approximately $10 million from a charge related to the revaluation of brand intangibles. ","Our India business continues to perform well with strong growth, continued market share gains and margin expansion in the quarter. In China, we prioritized price mix improvements, but volumes were negatively impacted as we focused on profitability. ","Before we turn to 2018 guidance, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that we will report and guide our regional results on an earnings before interest and taxes basis starting with Q1 2018. Additionally, as of January 1, 2018, we have realigned our Mexico business as part of our Latin America segment and will shift certain adjacent business from North America segment to the Asia segment. These changes allow us to align with the company\u2019s new leadership reporting structure. ","Now I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Marc to review our guidance for 2018. ","Marc Bitzer","Thanks Jim. Turning to slide 13, we\u2019ll review our guidance assumptions for 2018. We expect to grow revenues in line with our long term goal of 3% to 5%. In addition to our previously announced cost based price increases, we are bringing compelling new product to the market which will have a positive impact to mix. In particular, we are excited about the global launch of our new connected Kitchen Suite, which will be a catalyst for strong volumes and mix in 2018. ","Finally, we expect to benefit from continued industry growth in many of our major countries including the US and Brazil. We expect to deliver ongoing EBIT margin of approximately 7.5% in 2018, an improvement of 110 basis points. I will discuss the drivers of our EBIT margin guidance on the next slide. ","We expect earnings growth for margin improvement to generate a majority of our free cash flow growth in 2018, and in addition we expect to generate free cash flow improvement for working capital optimization primarily focused on reducing inventories from the elevated levels we experienced at the end of 2017. Overall, we expect to deliver ongoing earnings of $14.50 to $15.50 per share. ","Turning to slide 14, we show the drivers of our EBIT margin improvement in 2018. We expect approximately $250 million of net benefit from improved price mix as well as a $150 million from our fixed cost reduction initiative. Together we expect this to improve margins by approximately 175 basis points. ","We will also continue to focus on delivering ongoing cost productivity and expect to deliver approximately $175 million in productivity and another $100 million from restructuring benefits, all of which is incremental to our fixed cos initiatives. ","The combined impact to deliver 125 basis points margin improvement more than offset in continued raw material inflation which we expect to be approximately $200 million to $250 million higher than the prior year. Finally, we plan to continue investing in our business with increased new product introductions in 2018, including a global connected suite which I mentioned earlier. ","Now Jim will cover our recent guidance and cash priority for 2018. ","Jim Peters","On slide 15, we provide regional industry and EBIT margin guidance for the coming year. We expect low-single digit industry growth in all regions and our businesses will benefit from this growth throughout the world. We also expect to benefit from favorable price mix and strong cost take-outs. As a result, we expect to deliver at least 12% margin in North America in 2018. ","In EMEA, our margins are expected to expand to approximately 2% through improved price mix and completing the final phases of our brand and product transitions. We expect to improve our margins in Latin America to approximately 7%, as we benefit from industry growth, favorable price mix and continued cost takeout. Finally, we expect to deliver approximately 5% margin in Asia, with continued strong performance in India and improved price mix and cost takeout in China. ","Before I get to our free cash flow guidance, let me briefly outline our view on the impacts of tax reform. We see the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act as a significant benefit for the competitiveness of US companies and a positive development for consumer demand, and we fully expect the tax reform to have a positive medium and long term impact to Whirlpool. ","The changes included in the tax act are broad and complex, and there is still potential for changes to provisions and other legislative actions. As a result, our estimates may change as we refine our calculations. Our current tax rate guidance for 2018 is for the mid-20% for both the effective and cash tax rates. We will continue accessing the impact on our tax rates and update you on the first quarter call as necessary. ","Turning to slide 16, we show the drivers of our improved free cash flow for 2018. We expect to drive the majority of this improvement through stronger cash earnings. We will also continue to focus on working capital optimization, primarily related to our inventory in North America and EMEA. This guidance is inclusive of higher restructuring cash outlays versus 2017 related to our global fixed cost reduction initiative and recently announced closure of a compressor facility in Italy. In total, we expect to drive significantly higher free cash flow in 2018 with conversion of approximately 5% of sales. ","Turning to slide 17, we show our capital allocation priorities for 2018, which are largely unchanged. We will continue to fully fund our business for growth and be prudent about our capital structure to maintain a strong investment grade rating. We also plan to be balanced in how we return cash to shareholders. ","We currently have approximately $2 billion remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization and we expect to continue repurchasing this year after repurchasing 750 million of our shares in 2017. ","Now I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Marc. ","Marc Bitzer","Thanks Jim. Turning to slide 18, I would like to review our long term value creation framework. We did not make as much progress on our long term goals in 2017 as expected; however, we do expect that the actions we put in place during the fourth quarter have positioned us to get back on track to those goals this year. We expect to drive growth in line with our goals, positive industry growth, improved product availability in Europe and the global launch of our compelling new Connected Kitchen Suite will be candidate for growth. We also expect to drive significant EBIT margin improvement. ","Global price mix and our fixed cost reduction initiatives will be the primary catalyst, and we are fully focused on ensuring that these actions are effectively and successfully implemented. To be clear, our primary focus in 2018 is on margin expansion, and we remain committed to achieving our goal of 5% to 6% free cash flow as a percent of net sales this year. ","Now I will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our questions from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. ","David MacGregor","Let me begin with just a question on the European business. You highlighted the negative impact Europe has had on the price mix and called out the obsolete inventory challenge. Now I realize you\u2019re pursuing pricing and there\u2019s product availability issues you\u2019re working on, and you\u2019re also taking a highly cautious stance on your guidance at 2% EBIT margins which is well below our EBIT guidance during your analyst meeting last May. ","From where you stand today Marc, what exactly do you need to do to deliver on that 8% goal you discussed at your analyst meeting last year. ","Marc Bitzer","David, first of all in Q4 in Europe as you saw, we delivered above breakeven, but that\u2019s certainly not where our expectations should be and was. We expected a strong result. There are certain things around promotion and demand which was a little bit weak in key countries like UK and we had in Russia some market places disruption due to consolidation. ","Having said that at the end of the day 2017 was a setback and we were the first one to admit that. I think with our system integration and complexity and some external challenges, I think we lost about a year or 1.5 on our integration timeline and that\u2019s a reality. Having said that does not change where we strongly believe we can take the business, but we also as evidenced as how some of our competitive performance. So with 8% we still strongly believe in the steady state 2018 will be a year where we complete the integration and then we\u2019re kind of really more in a steady state mode. ","So I strongly believe that the path to 8% is there. It is achievable as evidenced by the competitors. You call 2% a little bit conservative and very honest our internal targets are more aggressive, but given that we missed them particularly in Europe, several times we took a slightly more conservative stand on the regional guidance. ","David MacGregor","That makes sense. So my second question is just regarding innovation. When we speak with almost anyone in the industry today they\u2019ll know the key contributing factor to the success of the Korean manufacturing which has been a proven ability to bring to market product innovations that really capture the consumes attention and for which the consumer is prepared to pay a premium price. ","Whirlpool is innovation leader, there are many out there that would say that you are the innovation leader. So I guess you are now taking over the leadership of the company that has consistently spent 6% to 7% of its revenues developing innovation, a number that\u2019s now approaching a 1.5 billion a year. I guess my question is, what do you do as the new CEO to achieve a higher level of productivity from that annual investment, so that investors need to rely less in the future on cost reduction and cost productivity to achieve the company\u2019s financial goals. ","Marc Bitzer","David that obviously was a very broad question. First of all to clarify the numbers, we invest roughly every year about 600 to 700 million in capital, which is not all new products but a majority goes in products, and we invest roughly in total another 600 million in engineering. So the total, but it\u2019s just different line items. That investment has been steady, with a slight increase, but it\u2019s steady as a percentage of sales. ","Now we may have referred both in investor day to this and also in earnings calls. We have done a fundamental realignment of our entire product development organization systems and structure, and that was pretty much 1.5 years ago. So we\u2019ve done massive changes and I would say we start seeing the fruits of these changes in terms of our innovation pipeline which is actually very encouraging. ","But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that this is a highly competitive market place, and I wouldn\u2019t give the companies you mentioned the credit for innovation, but that\u2019s obvious to me. But it\u2019s a highly competitive market place. So you got to run faster. I think the changes which we\u2019ve done internally on our product development we\u2019re well positioned to drive growth of effectiveness but also the efficiency of these investments. ","And again it\u2019s just also if you would have walked the CES Show, you see our kitchen suite and what\u2019s happening in that space, I feel we\u2019re very well positioned when it comes to the innovation pipeline. ","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Susan Maklari of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","Susan Maklari","I wanted to talk a little bit about your North America guidance. On that slide you pointed 2% to 3% industry growth there. And given what we saw in \u201917 you ended up at about 6% in units which is the high end of that range. In the fourth quarter, we did see some shift towards maybe focusing more on price as opposed to volumes. Can you just talk to maybe how you\u2019re thinking about that going into \u201918 and how we should think about these different pieces coming together?","Jim Peters","Susan this is Jim and I\u2019ll start off here. As you look at 2018 for North America, we expect our volumes to grow in line or slightly above the industry. And again we will continue to, obviously with the new products we are launching, we expect to continue to gain shares in certain categories. But also we expect to continue our focus on value creating promotions and making sure that any promotions that we participate in are value-creating. So again as I said, overall we believe the unit demand for the industry is stable within the US and we see that our growth will be in line with that and maybe slightly ahead of it. ","Marc Bitzer","Susan, it\u2019s Marc, maybe to add to Jim\u2019s point. At the end of the day last year industry in terms of shipment to the trade came in at the low end of our initial guidance or even slightly below. But it was still solid, and essentially we\u2019re signaling the same. We see robust demands in the lower single digits and so it\u2019s a continuation pretty much of focus on \u201917. ","If you would look at factors which could surprise us on positive, I would say, consumer confidence may be also related to tax reform to wage increases that could be a positive, because we sense a certain confidence and optimism out there. But concerns are still constraints on the housing market, supply constraints, and you see that in existing home sales and new home builds. But overall I think there are a couple of factors which gives a positive momentum to markets. Keep also in mind, we always indicated that as the housing cycle progresses, we will move more and more to a stage of roughly 2% to 3% annual growth which from a manufacturing perspective, I would consider a very healthy growth rate; we all love spikes. It\u2019s that kind of a growth rate we like. ","Susan Maklari","And then just in terms of maybe some of the inflation. You\u2019re continuing to point to that 200 million to 250 million for this year. Can you just give us some sense of maybe what\u2019s going in to that? Is there anything that has changed relative to where we were and maybe potential to come in at the higher or the lower end of that depending on how things move this year?","Marc Bitzer","So Susan it\u2019s Marc again. So stepping back a little bit, we entered \u201917 with a lot lower assumption on the raw material inflation. You may recall we entered the year with an estimate of 100 to 150 and we had to change that quite drastically in the summer and the fall to roughly about 350. So I would say the first major shift on the raw material landscape, we saw pretty much around summer for the last year, and now also as the year kind of progressed towards year-end, we saw that it\u2019s not going to be slowing down, it\u2019s fully continuing. That\u2019s why we refer to that over two year period, \u201917-\u201918 we have roughly 600 million headwinds of which 250 are still ahead of us, 200 to 250. ","The initial culprits if you want to say is over steel and resins and they both are still very elevated, and you also know that while we - typically on normal contract on steel on resins you can\u2019t go out too long on contracts. So I would say there\u2019s still heightened uncertainty around resins. Unfortunately we see also now this inflation creeping in in other aspects like car parts. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with oil and what does it mean for freight and warehousing. So I would say we feel confident about the current guide of 200 to 250 and that internal forecast has now been stable for several weeks and months. But I will be lying to you if I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s uncertainty on raw material side, because we just see the inflation trends creeping in on many parts of our value chain. ","Operator","We\u2019ll move to Curtis Nagle of Banc of America Merrill Lynch.","Curtis Nagle","Just quickly on the tax rate. If you guys could clarify what corporate tax rate in the US you guys are embedding in the guide mid-20s for 2018?","Jim Peters","The tax rate we\u2019re assuming is the new tax rate obviously of 21%. But with that there are certain parts of the legislation that we\u2019re still trying to understand especially how it effects some of our tax planning strategies globally, and the impact on those on how that will impact our US tax rate. The other thing you always have to keep in mind is as I said, we see the tax reform as a very positive thing and we believe over the next coming months we\u2019ll have a much better understanding where those tax planning opportunities sit. But also keeping in mind that 45% of our taxable income is generated outside of the US.","So also when you start to blend the rates together, you have to remember that we still have a large portion of our business outside the US that is in now countries that have a higher tax rate than the US. And so it\u2019s only going to have partial impact on our tax rate in the long run, but we don\u2019t see this right now having a negative impact from a cash perspective. And in fact as we look forward, we expect it to be positive in the mid-to-longer term. ","Curtis Nagle","And then just as a quick follow-up, I was kind of curious why you guys aren\u2019t expecting a higher margin in Latin America. I think it implies about, I think a little bit less than a point of growth. Just given all the cost taking you guys have done and the market positioning and some volume growth, I would have intended it to be a touch higher, do you perhaps needed maybe a little bit more volume say Brazil or some of the other markets to get to higher rate?","Marc Bitzer","It\u2019s Marc, the background probably of what you described as conservative is probably coming from two areas, one, we do not expect a significant rebound in the Brazilian demand prior to the elections or the election outcome. So I would say it certainly not going to get worse, but we don\u2019t see strong single digit or double digit growth in Brazil in the short term, maybe more as the year progresses in both elections. That\u2019s the one factor. ","The other factor is the global compressor business is a highly competitive environment with quite a bit of success capacity. And that as you know it sits in our Latin America business where the opportunities for significant growth are just limited. ","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan. ","Michael Rehaut","First question just want to drill down a little bit in North America, which continue to be a bright spot for you despite the continued competitive backdrop obviously outside of what may occur following the safeguard petition decision. With the guidance of over 12% margins or at least 12%, I was hoping to get a sense of the key drivers of that. Obviously you\u2019ve talked to positive price mix in the kitchen suite rollout, and if there is \u2013 maybe if it\u2019s possible to break it down between pre to mix volume leverage and perhaps if there is additional productivity or cost reduction. And if that improvement should be kind of steady throughout the year or weighted to one-half versus the other. ","Marc Bitzer","Michael, its Marc, let me try to answer it. And as you know we don\u2019t give recent volume or detailed driver breakdown. Having said that, the fundamental levers and drivers are in North America very similar to the global, maybe it\u2019s a slightly different timing. And what I mean by that is, we have announced in North America cost base, try to increase our kitchen business, and we\u2019ve done that in October. That coupled with further price mix opportunities i.e. even more to kitchen age and to a new product might give us a lift on the year-over-year price mix that is true for North America, and for the rest of the world and maybe we see some of these benefits in North America a little bit early when some of our part (inaudible).","On the volume side, you heard our industry forecast, and what we said is also true for North America. We expect to grow in line or above the industry growth. So again, the overall trends are very similar, but also in terms of raw materials exposure. So in a certain way the margin what we gave for the globe is also true for North America, maybe with a slightly different timing.","Michael Rehaut","So I\u2019m kind of hearing that perhaps it might get a little more benefit from price in the first half if I heard that right. Secondly, just going to the other end of the spectrum with the continued challenges in Europe, you mentioned that it\u2019s kind of been a disappointment throughout 2017, and fourth quarter not being an exception to that. I wanted to get a bigger picture from you Marc on, given that this has been the fourth quarter in a row where you\u2019ve had to downwardly revise your expectations and guidance for the segment. Certainly there\u2019s been a lot of challenges in terms of all the factors that you\u2019ve enumerated, the integration, the inventory work-down, the skew count, the tougher promotional environment in the UK. ","But in a bigger picture level, what has been the biggest challenge of not getting it right in terms of putting out a guidance that you\u2019re able to hit. And are you looking at kind \u2013 how are you looking at to change that or fix that? Is it a personnel issue in terms of getting better execution in the region or is it a matter of getting better information to put together a better set of guidance going forward. ","Marc Bitzer","Michael, its Marc again, let me push that back in terms of a European integration. As you may recall, kind of a first 1.5 almost two years, the integration was going very well, frankly even ahead of our expectations. We hit all our internal milestones. And as you pointed out, we had a coup le of quarters now, four or five quarters where we disappointed. And in hindsight you always have perfect 20-20, but I would say it\u2019s a combination of a couple really unforeseen external events like the Brexit, like what I would recall and we had some Russia currency issues, coupled with the accumulation of a complexity of an integration, which is as you know system, factories, products, brands, which is a lot once it comes altogether. ","And that\u2019s why we had in \u201917 what we call a disappointing 2017. It doesn\u2019t change where we have our long term side in terms of where we can take the margins. So the 8% of 8% and we strongly believe we can achieve that. I think we\u2019re pre-conditioned to really get fair in order to get through some more predictability is it essentially comes down to stability in our systems and supply chain where we had a lot of disruption, a lot of back and forth.","The good news is we have achieved a lot better stability in the entire supply chain already in Q4 and I feel a lot better how we go in to the next year. We\u2019ve also done internally a number of management system changes to get to more predictability. And frankly and the last, and I mentioned that before, I would say our internal targets are higher than we\u2019ve given as an external region guidance, because on this one we want to probably air more on the conservative side. ","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James. ","Sam Darkatsh","There\u2019s a couple of questions, first getting back to EMEA and I see that is conservatively crafted the margin guide. Specifically to the UK, I think your number one competitor has Turkish labor based cost and has used the weak currency to price aggressively which obviously exacerbates the already very challenging conditions for you. ","My question, have you folks contemplated hedging the Turkish Lira versus the euro and\/or moving production to Turkey. I\u2019m just spit-balling here, but if you don\u2019t do that and the Lira continues its slide versus the euro what gives you the confidence in really EMEA margin target going forward. ","Marc Bitzer","Sam that\u2019s obviously a very detailed question. First of all on UK, it\u2019s not only about Turkish competitor who forms a competition, but a very significant factor and yes your right the Turkish lira versus the British pound gave them probably longer protection and we also know ultimately inflation creeps also in to weak currencies. So a lot of the raw material input in steel etcetera will also ultimately show up in the Turkish production cost. ","But it\u2019s nothing we can do about the hedging, it\u2019s more like ultimately that inflation will also rise on that part of the business. Having said all that the UK market in Q4 was still a very soft one. So we feel better about our price margin realization in UK. So the markets in UK in December have been more promotional was actually surprisingly soft, even softer than the previous quarter. ","If you want to see any encouragement, but it\u2019s obviously way, way too early to read it. In January the British pound regained some strength which of course takes some pressure of our margins. But I would say that in the early, early data point and we got to see how the British pound evolves over the next couple of months. ","Sam Darkatsh","My other question will be much more broad and probably as too simplistic, but your 3% sales growth guide company-wide does that include or exclude FX. I think FX might be, maybe as much as a two point tail wind and with the industry growth expectations you gave along with price that would have imagined that your overall sales growth guide would have been higher than three points if you\u2019re including FX. ","Jim Peters","Sam, this is Jim, and right now when we put that out we were assuming FX was slightly positive but closer to neutral. So I think right now and again where FX rates are currently they would say, yes we would have a tailwind on sales. But it\u2019s January and as we know things will progress throughout the year. So right now that does not assume a significant tailwind from any kind of currency or FX changes. ","Marc Bitzer","And Sam may be just to add a (inaudible) and that\u2019s also what I had in my prepared remarks. Our focus is on margin expansion, and that is, we lost last EBIT margin 7.5% is one point above this year and that\u2019s our number one focus which has to come from the slight increases which we already announced the mix and the fixed cost reduction program, and that\u2019s our number one focus. ","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Ken Zener of KeyBanc Capital.","Ken Zener","Jim I wondered if you could comment, do you have a first, second half split in terms of how EPS earnings will fall within your guys\u2019 guidance and then could you guys be expletive around tax rate. I mean mid-20s, I think everyone\u2019s going to assume 25% is that what you want us to assume?","Jim Peters","I\u2019d say Ken on the tax rate I think 25% is a safe assumption for right now, and so that\u2019s when we say mid-20, that\u2019s where we believe it will be at. That\u2019s kind of in line with what we used to say we thought our historical structural run rate will be. And as we said once we get further in to the year, we will give an update in terms of what we think the impacts longer term and mid-term could be from tax planning strategies. In terms of split between first half and second half of the year, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be much different than any of our prior years. Obviously we have some seasonality that affects us in the first half of the year as well as the ramp up of some of our cost reduction initiatives that are launching right now, and have launched and some of the previously announced cost based pricing that we took is beginning to run in here in the first quarter.","So, again I think you\u2019ll see a little bit of a tailwind coming in to the second half of the year, but it won\u2019t be significantly dissimilar from some of the prior years where we\u2019ve been anywhere between 45 to 55 in that type of a range. ","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Sam Eisner of Goldman Sachs. ","Sam Eisner","Just going to free cash flow, I think we haven\u2019t discussed that yet. I\u2019m trying to reconcile your $700 million starting point for this year. It looks like it\u2019s inclusive of about $120 million of other items, and so I just really want to understand how do you walk from what you guys have generated this year in terms of free cash flow to the roughly 1 billion to 1.1 for next year. What are the moving pieces I see that in there, but it feels like that there\u2019s a different starting point that you\u2019re using. So I just want to make sure we are apples-to-apples.","Jim Peters","I think Sam the one thing, as you assume and we already talked about in here is working capital mixture we see to be at least 125 million, and if you look where we ended on inventory, we think there\u2019s a significant benefit there to some of the things that show up in there that sale of very expensive assets or tax credits. ","Again we have things like that that go on continuously and obviously we don\u2019t guide on them, but we\u2019re working on them even as part of our value creation strategy to make sure that we\u2019ve got the right asset base for our business. So I don\u2019t think that that will have a significant impact year-over-year in terms of our cash flow. ","Sam Eisner","So said another way, your $1 billion to 1.1 billion of free cash flow does include about $120 million or so of other items, is that fair to say?","Jim Peters","I would say it assumes an assumption that obviously if there are opportunities there we will take advantage of them. But we don\u2019t see any significant headwinds coming against it based on things that we had this year. ","Sam Eisner","That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just going to raw materials, so oil prices are up 35% since November, steel prices are up 20%. Those two commodity buckets are roughly combined almost 20% of your COGS. So I\u2019m a little bit confused how you\u2019re holding your guidance from October yet there\u2019s been significant moves particularly in oil which, oil goes in to benzene, benzene in to major portion of your COGS. Just help me better understand why we should feel confident in the 225 million [debt]. ","Marc Bitzer","Sam, its Marc. First of all to clarify also the indication which we gave in October about the 600 million that was not based on spot prices in October. That is based on our models which we have internally about projected raw material cost development. So if you take [steel], we have our models where we take input cost in to consideration, supply-demand etcetera. So it\u2019s a fairly complicated and complex model. So that was our forecast not the spot price. And right now what we see is that the spot price is actually up pretty much in line with our forecast, maybe even slightly higher than the forecast. But our amounts were pretty active in prediction. ","That doesn\u2019t mean that we have, as I mentioned before, about 250 or 200 to 250 is firm. There could be risks, we don\u2019t know yet, but that\u2019s today kind of our best view in the current year. ","Operator","We\u2019ll move to Megan McGrath of MKM Partners. ","Megan McGrath","Since pricing is such a big part of your strategy and guidance this year, I wanted to get a little more tactical color. In terms of the fourth quarter, how much of if you can tell us, how much of the positive price mix was really sort of apples-to-apples pricing, how much were you able to raise price in the market, and how much was mix? And if mix is a big part of this, how do you from a practical perspective make that better mix happen. Is it just coming out with new products that\u2019s more expensive or is there some sort of marketing effort you\u2019re doing to mix more towards the products you want to mix to?","Marc Bitzer","Let me try to answer it, so first of all we have internally our tools where we know exactly what we call like-for-like pricing, what is mixed and what comes from promotional investments or trade [burn] investments. We typically don\u2019t publish this one, because I think we would reveal a little bit too much competitive information. ","Having said that, as I indicated, Q4 was over positive price mix, and I would say a portion of us was already related to some price increases which we announced in certain parts of the world like in Asia. A certain amount was probably from less promotional intensity. As I indicated before and particularly North America, we saw certain promotions which we didn\u2019t see for value creating and we didn\u2019t participate. ","So I would say it\u2019s a combination of list price increases and reward of a less promotional intensity and lastly we still see the benefits and we\u2019ll see probably more next year from new product introductions. We had last year KitchenAid as a new suite which is flying, I mean it\u2019s really going extremely well. We know we will have some carry over benefits. We know we launched the Whirlpool Kitchen suite that will give us quite a bit of mixed opportunities. ","So to your question, to do large products with new prices, no. What we typically try to do is involve the products with new features where people voluntarily mix up, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean higher price on a like-for-like price, but it\u2019s a richer product and people are encouraged to mix up. ","Megan McGrath","And as I felt I understand that it\u2019s too early to really talk too much about the (inaudible), but wanted to get your sense on where you think inventory levels are? Do you get a sense that maybe there was some stuff in the channel or a loading of products in to the US ahead of the tariff announcements do you have any feel for that?","Marc Bitzer","Let me maybe at first a little bit further expand and we talk about the safeguards position. First of all, as I said before, we are very thankful that the ITC, the USDR and this administration has finally put an end to this long story of dumping. Recently a press reported, sometimes few people confuse offenders with victims. So the LG and Samsung have been dumping for a number years, there\u2019ve been several times we\u2019ve seen proof and evidence and decisions that dumping has been confirmed. So the safeguard finally puts an end to what we call this country hopping and the dumping. So it\u2019s an incredibly good outcome, it\u2019s a good catalyst for Whirlpool Corporation. It\u2019s also encouraging that finally trade laws are being enforced. ","With that in mind, the reason why we couldn\u2019t specify what is the bottom line impact on our company is, has a couple of reasons. One is exactly to your point, we do not know exactly how much inventory has been built up. We have certain customs data until December , but we don\u2019t have the January data. We saw significant amount of preloading already in December and that probably continued to January. So we can\u2019t exactly estimate, but I would think its a few weeks to a couple of months of kind of preload. ","Two, we have a certain mechanics around the quota which are not yet fully specified in terms of our quota by country or by competitor. And thirdly, and that\u2019s the most important thing is that it ultimately comes down to the question, will the offender stop the dumping. I can\u2019t give you that answer, but that\u2019s of course the key question in terms of we of course firmly would expect the safeguard measure in place that finally the dumping ends. But we don\u2019t know with certainty. ","I would say as the next couple of months unfold, we would see a lot more clarity around how all these three factors come together, and maybe we can give you a better picture about what it all means. ","Operator","We\u2019ll move next to Alvaro Lacayo of Gabelli & Company. ","Alvaro Lacayo","Just on a follow-up on the safeguard petition and sort of the chatter around the inventory loadings from competitors. In the past when you had those trade related victories, I think they followed a similar playbook where they\u2019ve done inventory loading in anticipation. Maybe if you could talk about a little bit of what were the dynamics you saw in the past and how that impacted the business and how long was that sort of effect felt?","Marc Bitzer","Alvaro its Marc again. And again we do not know exactly the inventory levels. We have the customs data until December. I would just say, judging from the past, depending on which dumping actions were typically a couple of weeks to a couple of months inventory which may typically found a way in to the market over a couple of months. I think this time it\u2019s different. It\u2019s different in that respect that in the past they used the bridge to kind of move factories in to other countries. That is a safeguard measure and I think it\u2019s sort of impossible, just not possible.","The only kind of way out, which is a positive for a country is that they start producing in US and we all know of our certain timeline. So I would say, you should expect, probably should expect that that inventory flushes through in the next couple of months, and that\u2019s it, and (inaudible) probably just the level of supply. ","Alvaro Lacayo","And then secondly just on the price mix guide on a global basis, but more focused in terms of just thoughts on North America in terms of, you mentioned the levers to drive the price mix which I think have been levers that you have in the past employed, and you had big product launches before and you\u2019ve had cost based price increases and price mix over the last few years have been a little bit more stubborn. ","Maybe if you could just highlight of what you think about this time, in terms of what\u2019s different and what gives you the confidence to sort of hit those numbers. And then just from an order of magnitude, where do you see most of those price mix benefits happening across the footprint. ","Marc Bitzer","Again it\u2019s a little bit region by region different. First of all, pretty much in all regions we work on cost based price actions and price mix opportunities in some regions also in terms of promotional investment or a triparty investments. But it differs region by region. To give you for example, one example because it\u2019s already behind us. In China, the raw material cost increases are so big and the mix opportunities are somewhat limited, we relied heavily on like-for-like cost based price increases. That is already behind us. ","I think in US we have in particularly the product pipeline and the brand portfolio. We have more mix opportunities available to us than in other markets. So in US you would probably see a combination of the effect of a kitchen price increase which we already know, but again also the product pipeline which we have. It\u2019s not \u2013 I mentioned it early, but I keep saying about the carryover benefit, but the [Work With] suite launch is significant for us. It impacts a lot of products and if connected suite gives us a lot of opportunities to mix up. ","And again we know the product that we are launching and they are not year-end launches, they come throughout Q1 and Q2, so very inside and maybe it will drive certain mix and that\u2019s why we are confident about it. ","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Marc Bitzer for closing comments. ","Marc Bitzer","Let me just may be just summarize key message from this call, and that\u2019s again on slide 20 if you want to look it up. First of all again, global price mix and fixed cost initiatives we announced last quarter are progressing ahead of expectations and that\u2019s a very good news. And we are very encouraged by the price mix, exit rate and strong margins in North America, and we expect to deliver significant improvement to EBIT margin this year and we are committed to further margin expansion in the coming year. ","We also expect strong free cash flow growth this year as a result of a margin improvement. And we expect to continue to returning strong levels of cash to shareholders in a balanced way.

Today's call is being recorded.","For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Chris Conley. Please go ahead.","Chris Conley","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation first quarter 2016 conference call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Marc Bitzer; our President and Chief Operating Officer and Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our Web site at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before we begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call, we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and our other periodic reports, as well as on Slide 1 of this presentation.","Turning to Slide 2, we want to remind you, that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations, as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations. We also think these adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on our Investor Relations website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Fettig","Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. As you saw in our press release this morning, we reported record operating results for the first quarter of the year. Our ongoing earnings per share were up 23% and our ongoing EBIT margins were up a whole point. We also stated in the statement that we are reaffirming our full year guidance after what we view as a good start to the year. Our integration activities in Europe and Asia have progressed well, and we\u2019re firmly on track to deliver a significant level of cost synergies for the year. As you will see from our results, consistent with our full year goals, our strong execution more than offset currency and emerging market demand challenges in parts of the world. ","Now, I will turn to Slide 5 where you see our first quarter results. Our revenues were up 1% versus last year excluding currency. Our ongoing business earnings were a record $2.63 a share, again up 23% in line with our guidance for the year. Free cash flow declined slightly versus last year in the quarter, however we are on track to meet our full year goal. ","On Slide 6, you\u2019ll see our guidance which once again we reaffirmed. We expect the year to deliver ongoing earnings of $14 to $14.75 a share which represents over 15% growth versus last year. We also continue to expect to deliver free cash flow in the range of $700 million to $800 million, which is a strong improvement over the last year. So overall our expectation is to continue to build on what we see as positive momentum that developed throughout the quarter and as we manage through a challenging environment we\u2019re starting executing and also expect to deliver another year of record results. ","On Slide 7, we do highlight a few items in our 2016 capital allocation plans. In overall, the priorities here remain unchanged, which are to fund the business, to support strong returns to shareholders and to continue to evaluate value creating M&A opportunities. As you saw during the quarter, we did complete our existing share buyback program with $225 million in share repurchases. In last week, our Board authorized a new $1 billion share buyback program and 11% increase in our quarterly dividend. With our strong business performance, we believe that we have the appropriate flexibility to continue to execute our capital allocation priorities in order to drive long-term value creation. ","Finally on Slide 8, you can see our 2016 business priorities. Overall our focus is to continue to grow revenues and expand operating margins through a numbers of levers. First, by delivering our restructuring and acquisition cost synergies of $175 million for the year. Secondly, we are seeing and do expect to continue to see mix improvements and revenue growth as we benefit from our new product introductions and the strength of our industry leading brands.","We continue to see and target growth opportunities in our adjacent businesses and we are leveraging our cost productivity actions to continue to deliver benefits to expand our operating margins. So with these actions, we will generate improved free cash flow from the year which will enable us to continue to create shareholder value through our capital allocation plans. ","So at this point, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Marc Bitzer. Marc?","Marc Bitzer","Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 10, we will review North America\u2019s performance in the first quarter. We performed in line with our expectations by growing revenues 5% excluding currency and expanding operating margins 70 basis points to 10.5%. We delivered another quarter of sequential T-6 market share improvements and our units sell out in the first quarter outpacing the industry. Behind the strength of our recently launched products and the investments we made to drive profitable growth. Our strong operating margins were driven by our ongoing cost productivity programs and operating leverage from revenue growth, which more than offset 30 million in unfavorable currency impact in Canada and Mexico.","Turning to Slide 11, we outlined our 2016 operational priorities for the North America region. Our expectation is that the industry will show 5% to 6% annual growth behind strong housing trends in consumer sentiments. We expect to grow at or above the industry rates for the year as we accelerate the growth of our new products and continue to make targeted investments to drive profitable growth. Our strong cost productivity programs will continue to drive margin improvements and we remain focused on growing on our adjacent businesses.","Turning to Slide 12, we highlight our exciting new top load laundry platform. It represents a new era in laundry with an industry leading capacity and intuitive front tough controls. We saw significant first quarter growth in the top load laundry, with very positive consumer and major trade -- and customer support and we expect this trend to continue. ","I will now share the first quarter results for our year for Middle East and Africa region as shown on Slide 13. Sales were $1.2 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year, excluding currency sales declined 3%. The topline was a little soft across Europe due to a slightly weaker industry down 1%, the market was down slightly but is strong and what would believe temporary demand declines in the UK and Russia where we have a much larger business. Ongoing operating margin was 4.9%, at 220 basis points increase compared to prior year and in line with our expectations for full year margin improvements. Strong execution of our integration plan and ongoing cost productivity more than offset 20 million in unfavorable currency impact. ","On Slide 14, our 2016 priorities remain unchanged with a strong focus on integration activities. Ongoing cost productivity and growth from new products. We expect the industry to be flat to up 2%. Over the year, we continue to expect to grow in line with the market and to deliver margin expansion consistent with our full year guidance of 7% to 8%. ","On Slide 15, we\u2019re proud to feature Europe\u2019s first fully connect appliance suite. These products work together seamlessly to give consumers the performance they expect while offering flexibility and peace of mind.","Now, I will discuss our Latin America results on Slide 16. Sales for the quarter were $705 million excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased 4%. Industry in Brazil was down 13% which was in line with our forecast of down 10% for the full year. However, through the strength of our brand and products, we gained market share and continue to outperform the industry. Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $42 million, nearly 6% of sales compared to 6.6% on prior year. It is important to note that the first quarter of 2016 was the beginning of last year's significant real devaluation and industry decline. We have readjusted our business for today\u2019s operating environment through previously announced cost based price increases, new product introductions and substantial cost and capacity reductions and are on track to deliver our full year operating margin guidance. ","On Slide 17, we\u2019ve summarized our priorities in Latin America. We expect to manage through continued volatility through strong cost productivity programs and by maintaining our right sized fixed cost structure. We will continue to invest in new products and remain well positioned with consumer demand with best returns. Based on our expectations of demand down 10% and with a benefit of our offsetting actions, we expect to successfully navigate short-term challenges and deliver on our full year guidance.","On Slide 18 is our Consul 3 standing range. It is a value based price product for Brazil that includes several premium cooking features that deliver great value for consumers. The initial sales results for this product have been very strong. ","Now we turn to our first quarter results in the Asia region which are shown in Slide 19. Net sales were $371 million in comparison to $378 million in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, our sales increased 3%. Our ongoing operating profit was 27 million compared to [26 million] (ph) in the prior period. Ongoing operating margins were 7.3%, an increase of nearly 0.5 point driven by revenue growth and ongoing cost productivity. ","Turning to Slide 20, we share our 2016 priorities for our Asia operations. We will continue to focus on growth for distribution expansion and ongoing cost productivity programs. Our expectation continues to be flat in the same region with stronger demand in India and slight weakness in China.","Overall, we expect strong margin performance of 7% to 8% driven by our larger group platform and the benefits of our strong innovation pipelines.","On Slide 21, we showcase our new top build larger products over China market. Similar to our North American product, it features front touch controls and innovative wash technology for improved fabric care. This is a great example of leveraging our product development capability across regions.","And finally, on Slide 22, we summarize our regional margin guidance for the full year. Our first quarter performance was consistent with these goals, which remain unchanged as we continue to see opportunities for strong margin expansion in all regions. And now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Larry.","Larry Venturelli","Thanks, Marc and good morning, everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we have solid performance in the first quarter that was in line with our expectations. Our earnings momentum entering the second quarter and expected run rates for the second half are strong.","Turning to our first quarter results on Slide 24, revenues were $4.6 billion, currency had a top line impact of nearly $300 million, and excluding currency, sales were up 1%. We achieved record ongoing earnings of $2.63 per share, which was up 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by acquisition synergies and ongoing cost productivity programs. We achieved these results while absorbing a currency impact of over $0.50 per share or approximately 1-point of margin. Our ongoing EBIT margin improved by a full-point during our lowest volume quarter, and we are on track for the full year guidance of 8% to 8.5%. In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter.","Turning to Slide 25, we expect another record year performance and are reaffirming our full year guidance. As Mark discussed in the regional reviews, we are confident in our operational plans, and as a result, expect to deliver 15% plus growth in ongoing earnings per share in 2016 and approximately $700 million to $800 million in free cash flow.","On Slide 26, we outline our expectations for EBIT margin expansion. As previously communicated, we expect to expand our margin by over a point, primarily driven by ongoing cost productivity, favorable price mix and acquisition cost synergies. We expect to continue funding our global brand and product innovation and to absorb between a point and a point and half of margin impact from currencies. Currencies, very recently have strengthened versus the dollar. While we are not adjusting our currency assumptions at this time, should trends continue, we would see lower headwinds.","On Slide 27, we highlight the cadence of the first-half versus second half earnings drivers; first, given seasonality of our business, we expect volume to be stronger in the second half of the year; second, we should also have lower currency headwinds in the second half of the year; third, we expect strong results from cost productivity programs and our acquisition synergies will continue throughout the year. As a result, and consistent with prior disclosures, we would expect full year earnings to approximate 40% in half one and 60% in half two.","On Slide 28, we share some details on our first quarter free cash flow results and capital allocation actions. Our free cash flow declined slightly versus prior year, primarily due to higher restructuring cash, legacy product warranty actions and temporary working capital funding related to the integration of product transitions in Europe. We executed a balanced approach to capital allocation by funding the capital needs of our business and returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and the completion of our share repurchase program.","Our plans to generate $700 million to $800 million in annual free cash flow are on track. With our recently announced 1 billion share buyback program, we have appropriate flexibility to continue with the balanced approach to capital allocation throughout the year.","On Slide 29, you can see an update on the progress of our restructuring and integration activities. We incurred $47 million of restructuring expense and delivered $58 million in benefits in the first quarter. For the year, we expect $250 million in expense and $175 million in benefits, consistent with previous communications. In summary, our strong first quarter results support the run rates needed to deliver our full year guidance. Given our results and strong balance sheet, we also believe we have the right plans in place to deploy cash in ways that will maximize shareholder value.","Now I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff Fettig","Thanks Larry. I\u2019ll turn to Slide 31, which summarizes again our 2016 priorities, which are built around revenue growth margin expansion and delivering strong free cash flow for the year. Four months in the year, we feel like we have very strong and robust plans to deliver on all of these priorities and we remain confident in our full year guidance. And as I outlined on Slide 32, we continue to execute our value creation strategy, which is unchanged. And this gives us an outstanding opportunity to continue delivering significant shareholder returns.","So with that, I\u2019d like to conclude our formal remarks and open up to Q&A right now. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Rob Wetenhall with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Rob Wetenhall","Larry, I just want to talk about currency for a minute. First, FX exposure in North America, you guys called out a $30 million headwind and I was kind of trying to understand when you think that headwind will abate and kind of it looks like it's a little bit more than just translational and you guys done very-very confident in your guidance and I wanted to understand do you think there is potential upside to your guidance because of what's going on in FX and should we try to quantify that.","Larry Venturelli","Yes Rob, as I said in the prepared remarks you know we saw currencies begin to strengthen towards the end of the quarter and we've seen over the last couple of weeks or so that that continued strengthening, so if I was kind of bracketed I'd say you know if these trends continue to be positive and we see the continued strengthening we expect probably the lower end of our currency headwind guidance you know we said 1 to 1.5%, it'd be closer to that 1%, so that would be approximately $0.50 a share. Again I think currencies are moving in the right direction, the earnings that we posted in the first quarter is fully in line with our expectations and support our full year guidance. Operationally as Mark mentioned things are going well, and so that gives us the confidence in our full year guidance.","Rob Wetenhall","Got it, and I was hoping Mark could you talk for a second about what you're thinking revenue trends in Europe, it sounds like demand was a little bit softer than you might have otherwise expected do you think this is kind of something that's going to persist or do you think this is transitory and how should we think about revenue growth accelerating in tandem with your abilities to get synergies from Indesit.","Marc Bitzer","Hey Rob, it\u2019s Mark, so let me actually put the European performance little bit in context. First of all on the full year base as you know we guided towards 7 to 8% margin, we guided the market demand to be flat above zero, F up 2% and we said we would grow in line with market, we also said we have a lot of focus on server margin expansion in Europe. With that in mind and as I indicated in my prepared remarks we're actually very pleased with our performance in Europe in Q1. We delivered a substantial margin improvement 220 base points, and we continue to deliver integration cost synergies and I would argue we're fully on track towards the full year margin target. On the revenue side and I said that in my remarks, we perceive that as a slight toughness versus what we had in mind but to underline that we characterize that as a temporary softness but particularly driven by the UK and Russia where as you know post Indesit acquisition we have a significant exposure where we saw some weakness. From what we see today we do not this as structural affirment we consider this very temporary issue.","Ron Wetenhall","Okay, that's helpful and final question, switching around to Latin America, it sounds like I'm just trying to understand a little bit, it sounds like you had a tough comp, with 1Q '15 and then I'm trying to put that in context. Was Brazil in line with your internal expectations for the quarter or is it something else going on with the other segment in the Latin America business, I'm just trying to understand how you're thinking about demand and profitability with the three businesses in the segment.","Marc Bitzer","Rob, it's Marc again, the simple answer is we're 100% aligned with our internal plans in Q1. To give a little bit more color keep in mind the decline of particular of Brazilian macroeconomic environment, started pretty much Q1 last year but really accelerated as we went through the year. And you saw the same on the currency, so Q1 was I would say kind of the toughest comparison if you want to see, because it was just the beginning of a recession, so we saw a significant impact obviously on the topline converted back to US dollars and then awesome demand side. We knew that coming through the year and that's why we put the plans wherever plans are and I would say we're extremely pleased with how the team performed on price margin realization i.e. on delivering cost based and inflation based price increases and better speaking we're very pleased with how the team has been managing capacity and fixed costs, and the result is our margins which are particularly keep the topline in mind very promising and we're very confident that we will deliver on our full year guidance margin.","Rob Wetenhall","Are the other businesses performing well inside Latin America.","Marc Bitzer","Rob there is always gives and takes but I would say the compressor business is performing solid or strong and consistent with what we see in the last couple of quarters, our client business out of Brazil had some issues largely driven by the introduction of import tariffs in Ecuador and Colombia, but again these are typical one time effects were just pipeline issues.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan, please go ahead.","Michael Rehaut","Thanks, good morning everyone. Wanted to first kind of dive into the North American region a little more if possible. You know you mentioned that the 1Q sales I believe outpaced the industry and just wanted to get a sense you know where did that strength come from, was it any particular product categories and you know offsetting it because you did have 5% volume growth and I know that includes some other of the categories in Canada, Mexico and maybe give us a sense of how those regions did as well.","Marc Bitzer","Michael it's Marc, so let me try to answer your question. First of all, I'll heed that from prior calls, as we said in a number of calls, our reported unit shipments versus the T-6 market share units are not comparable, we\u2019re not doing an apple-to-apple comparison because obviously now our unit shipments raised a lot more than what is typically the AMT-6. So, don\u2019t fully compare that. Anyhow, having said that and taking that into context, our unit shipments in Q1 in North America were up 5%, the technique it would say it's slightly trading versus what the AM numbers would show, even though as I mentioned before we\u2019re not fully comparable.","What is however very important to keep in mind and I indicated that before, our shipment volumes, i.e. sell in volumes after a weak start in January, we had a very strong cap in March and that momentum continued and carried into Q2 and even more importantly we mentioned which we internally look at are so called sell-out volumes, i.e. what is so true on the trade partner level. And on that level we even outpaced the overall markets. So we're actually very pleased with the U.S. shipment trends and the momentum we\u2019re carrying. To your question, more than one category, no it's not one category but of course we feel in particular that we\u2019ve regained strength in our laundry category which as you know is our flagship and last year we had some issues and we saw a strong growth in laundry but it carried through other categories as well.","Michael Rehaut","Yes, it\u2019s a great run down and I certainly appreciate the apples-to-apples is not comparable there. So thanks for that additional detail. I guess secondly on the margin itself, if you kind of adjust for the 30million FX hit as well as the top line, I\u2019m actually calculating like 11.5% adjusted North American margin. So, I was wondering if that\u2019s correct Larry and maybe just kind of drive through what were some of the puts and takes of that. And certainly would assume that overall as particularly as currency headwinds lessen you'd still be very much on track to hit the full year margin guidance. So, just trying to get a sense of the different benefits that you\u2019re seeing on the margin side, again, excluding the currency headwind it looks like it was about a 100 basis points above the reported number. ","Larry Venturelli","Mike let me take this again. As you know we guided full year North America margins 11.5% to 12.5%. If you would take the midpoint of that, that will be 0.7% higher than last year\u2019s actual, if you would take the midpoint of that range. Q1 was exactly 0.7% higher than last year. So, quarter Q1 year-over-year with exact in line with the midpoint of what we guided on a full year basis, which obviously gives us confidence we are very well on track to work out for you guidance. And that typically as you also know and particularly as you follow our share for long time. There is a lot of seasonality in our Q1 business.","So, there's a couple of factors like small domestic appliances which are much stronger in Q4 and Q3 and that\u2019s a normal issue. If you would go back to the last couple of years, you always see a margin lift as the year progress. So again that\u2019s very typical and that\u2019s why we\u2019re very confident. Particularly with regards to your question on FX, yes you\u2019re probably correct particularly in Q1 our FX burden was high. In North America the two currencies, very simple it's Canadian dollar and Mexican Peso. First of all both finding and regained some strength to work the end of the quarter. However, on a quarter average, in particular compared to last year this was a tough comparison. That comparison get a lot less challenging as the year progresses.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Denise Chai with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Denise Chai","Okay. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask in North America what you\u2019re seeing in the competitive environment and specifically can we get an update on the anti-dumping suit?","Marc Bitzer","Denise, let me first talk about the competitive environment. Again, it\u2019s kind of, this is a market where you will always see promotions and we are set for promotions in terms of value creation or if I don\u2019t create value. Right now we saw, and I mentioned in my last earnings call we saw a slightly elevated level of promotion in Q4. We adjusted to that and that\u2019s pretty much the same level in Q1. So, it\u2019s kind of -- I wouldn\u2019t describe the situation as overly concerning or surprising to us. We operate very well in that environment, we delivered strong sales growth and again as I mentioned before we\u2019re very pleased with our sellout momentum which ultimately as you know transit into selling. So we are actually very confident about the overall volume growth and our ability to find and regain some market share which we lost last year. ","Jeff Fettig","Denise regarding the dumping, let me give you a brief update on that. I believe we told you last time, end of January the ITC commissioners unanimously voted to proceed with the investigation in the wash or dumping trial process that we filed. It is tracking in line with our knowledge of the process and our expectations. On a high level we would expect by midyear or just beginning in the third quarter that the department of commerce will complete their investigation and establish dumping levels and cash deposits for violating companies.","Typically there will be six months where the Department of Commerce releases it's final anti-anti-dumping determination and then it goes back to the ITC which we would expect within the next month, and have a final conclusion to that. So, from our perspective, it's progressing as it should. Again, we feel very strong that this has been going on for some period of time, quite a long time really a continuation of the previous washer dumping, which we bought. And so we expect the process to continue in this path.","Denise Chai","And just one more, so in terms of raw materials are you still expecting to see I think around north of 100 million in benefit of this year and mostly in the first half? And just related to that, how should we think about the North America pricing down 2% on an average unit basis? Are we seeing you reinvest some of the raw material savings?","Jeff Fettig","Yes, Denise, I think our guidance for full cost productivity, which includes the 100 million plus in raw materials is still very valid. I mean we\u2019re very confident in that and our Q1 results fully support what we expect for the full year from a productivity perspective.","Marc Bitzer","Denise, let me just, it's Marc again. Let me just comment on what you referred to the minus 2%; again, very important to highlight the revenue growth excluding currencies. As we said, the published revenue growth for North America is plus-3, excluding FX it's plus 5, which exactly matches our unit growth. So, on an average sales value per unit we\u2019re exactly flat year-over-year.","Operator","And our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research.","David MacGregor","You touched already Marc on the fact that you\u2019re happy with the recovery in the North American business. I wanted to just go back to that a little bit, a couple of earnings calls you go, you\u2019d indicated that that may cost you over 100 basis points of market share. And I guess the question is can you update us on the progress on the product availability issues from last year? And do you feel this recovery positions you to regain the 100 basis points plus of market share that\u2019s been you previously indicated the situation cost last year?","Marc Bitzer","So David to that point, yes, you\u2019re correct. Last year, our availability issues, which are very large related to the huge amount of product introductions, because there is a market share. And when we guided on a fully base to grow in line with market above market that they\u2019ve imply to the weakening that market share. I will characterize in particular on the sequential base the Q1 is fully on track towards recovering that lost market share. And I would also expect that number in Q2 that turns throughout the year-over-year improvements. And yes there is large by the larger category, but we had some product introduction issues. So, and that is not fully on track and have seen very strong performance.","David MacGregor","And question for Larry, you talked about the 175 million of benefit this year. I guess the question is how much of that goes to margins versus how much of it ends up being reinvested elsewhere in other initiatives?","Larry Venturelli","Well, I think you\u2019re referring the synergies, and synergy benefits and David that all would flow in the margins.","Jeff Fettig","David, the way I guess I would look at it is if you go to the margin walk page, basically and then particularly in the case of Europe and China where we talked about acquisition synergies, it was squarely are positioned and these would be brought to bottom line expand our margins. And to-date that\u2019s been the case. You\u2019ve got other moving parts, raw materials cost productivity mix price et cetera and currencies, and so there is give and takes. But as a general principle the restructuring and M&A synergies we\u2019re using in those particular parts of the world clearly to expand margin.","Larry Venturelli","And if you\u2019re looking at Europe David certainly some very nice solid margin improvement, probably 3.5 points of synergy but that\u2019s being partially offset that just deployed from the unfavorable currency that we\u2019re building.","Operator","Our next question comes from Megan McGrath with MKM.","Megan McGrath","I wanted to follow up a little bit on the North American competitive environment. We see a lot of signage and so for the big box store here around a spring Black Friday event, just wanted to get your thoughts on that in terms of appliances. Is it about the same as last year, or is this new initiative for them in terms of more aggressive promotions in the spring?","Marc Bitzer","Megan it's Marc. First of all from an overall competitive environment, trade environment, promotions are just the nature of the North America business. You will have spring Black Friday, Earth Day, you would have more the Labor Day, and Red White & Blue. So there is a lot of promotional holidays, that\u2019s just the nature of the U.S. market but it doesn\u2019t drive the entire market. So, as we\u2019ve said in the past, or to the name of the game and how we effectively play between promotion environment and the regular ongoing business environment.","On promotions, we on a case by case base make the decisions, does it create value for us and our customers or not and then we make a situation assessment. As I mentioned before, we saw slight increase in promotion environment in Q4 and that carried into Q1 as evidence from our margin expansion I think we can create value, grow the business and add -- expand margins despite that environment, so we\u2019re not overly concerned about it.","Megan McGrath","And then wanted to follow-up on the share buybacks, obviously you put a new large share buyback into place you seem to be pretty opportunistic in the first quarter on buying back shares, so how are you looking at that $1 billion authorization, are you thinking about just continuing to be opportunistic are you going to put some things that is more regular in place, do you have a goal in terms of keeping your shares outstanding at a certain level, if you could give us some more color that would be great.","Jeff Fettig","Yes Megan, this is Jeff. You know the way I guess we have would -- the best way for us to frame it is, this is part of our capital allocation process and you know on an ongoing basis we have dialogue with our board in terms of opportunities to create value for shareholders and over time they vary or different opportunities occur. Certainly some leaving the last year we purchased we felt it was a very good use of capital for our shareholders, we are funding our business at appropriate levels now to deliver product innovation to the market place around the world.","We are funding the business for restructuring opportunities with our M&A acquisitions which are delivering great cost benefits, you know in the past we've demonstrated when we saw great M&A opportunities we can move very quickly when we have and we also have certainly returned to shareholders for exhibiting the share repurchase and you know again we've given our long range view of what our financial performance we expect to be and obviously that makes our shares based on that in our view have great opportunity to increase in value and we balance all of those we make different decisions during different periods. But the point of all that is we have the ability to look at all these opportunities and then get very tight any period of time and act on them.","And that's what we've been doing, we will not, nor have in the past given specific timeframes for when we expect to complete this. You should expect we, as we have been at today's levels it\u2019s highly likely we'll be a buyer can even be a buyer this year of our shares but we don't have a defined period of time by which we\u2019re going to complete it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.","Ken Zener","Good morning gentlemen. Should we interpret for North America, the five rough squiggly line 5% plus to be now you're saying 5 to 6% I mean are you taking that up a percent for the industry guidance or is that just a rounding error, and I guess and the reason I'm asking that, seems like North America is obviously they have started off better could it be whether or not, but I think with some people it's maybe surprising with the higher demand side of [indiscernible] that wouldn\u2019t have impacted your guys guidance at all to the F side.","Marc Bitzer","Ken it's Marc. So taking your speaking we're taking it up half a point because that's the average of 5 to 6% but all joking aside we do see strength from a North American market in Q1 and we expect some of that strength to carry through as the year progresses. Behind this we are and we remain confident about the US housing market. I know there have been some somewhat sluggish numbers about housing starts we do see that being corrected over time so we're still counting on 1.15 to 1.2 housing starts and we're still counting on existing home sales of 5.3, 5.4 in that ball park and we continue to see that as we observe in the market every day, so that's why we said it\u2019s 5 to 6% could it even be more, could be, we do not see weakness today on the North American market demand.","Ken Zener","And then related to last year's product launches and the divided issues you were juggling last year, why wouldn't or why aren't we seeing a greater lift as you, you know you talked about 100 basis points margin so you're covering but why don\u2019t we see more of a lift if that was something you called out last year for your comping against and very easy comps and [indiscernible] vigorous product line in North America.","Marc Bitzer","And Kenneth, it's Marc again, obviously we're going to see how the mix progresses I can only say in particular related to what I mentioned before our sell out in Q1 has been very strong and we're talking about high single digits, low double digits sell out. Which is the indication of a newly floor product the new product introduction are working on the floor, if you know the product are working on the floor and they're selling on the floor you know the shipments will come, so that's why we're bullish on what we said before, we will grow in line or above market and obviously outlook is in on above market.","Jeff Fettig","And Ken the trend is really is there, I think you know we kind of had the full impact of this in late summer Q3, we improved Q4 versus Q3, we improved Q1 versus Q4 to Marc's point you know the real important thing is what are consumers buying not necessarily what you're shipping that will follow and that's very positive so I think we like the trend we've been on particularly over the last eight-ten weeks and our performance through all the markets should be good.","Operator","And we'll go next to Sam Darkatsh with Raymond James, please go ahead.","Sam Darkatsh ","Good morning Jeff, Marc, Larry how are you? Three real quick questions if I could, Larry first I want to make sure I understood your commentary around FX, or specifically did I understand it to mean that if you were to mark to market current FX rates than the benefit incrementally to guidance or at least to EPS would be $0.50. Is that accurate?","Larry Venturelli","Yes, I\u2019d say, if we continue -- and again it\u2019s still early on, if we continue to see the same trends that we've been seeing in the last couple of weeks or so that would translate to my comments would be approximately $0.50.","Jeff Fettig","Let me just add on that. Obviously there is a lot of talk for over a year about currency. Our big parameter is we gave guidance for the year in February, we're really about the things that have been the most volatile which are our currency levels and demand levels, particularly emerging markets demand levels. In the first quarter, we were able to operate within those parameters. Late in the quarter, the currency portion and so far in April has been better than our assumptions. The demand is not, it\u2019s about in line and some markets are worse and the few markets are better. But in our view was particularly with what we\u2019ve seen volatility wise and in the case of Brazil, the political chaos and so on and so forth. It\u2019s way too early for us to change our currency assumptions, but to Larry\u2019s point if you take our two big parameters, currency levels and demand, our view is if they get better we\u2019ll get better. ","Sam Darkatsh","Where I am confused is you\u2019re saying if trends continue, so for example if the reais went from $0.26 to $0.28 during the quarter. Does the mean it has to continue to strengthen at that rate?","Jeff Fettig","Hold on. We said -- reais is actually 4:1 dollars in February. It\u2019s now 3.55, so a 10% strengthening, built around a political scenario. So, our view is that if it stays at 3.55 which is where it is today we\u2019ll do better in Latin America, same with the Europe which was probably 1.08 or so in February, it's 1.12 - 1.13 that\u2019s the translation effect there. Now, for the most part, the part we have a couple of negatives around the world, but net-net whereas currency was bad all year last year we have a little bit of stabilization which we view as a good thing but it\u2019s way too early to adjust any guidance based on that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.","Tom Mahoney","This is Tom calling out for Eric. Quick question on the Europe revenue decline, interesting how the 1Q organic trends compares to what you guys did through 2015. I guess really looking to pinpoint the timing of when you guys cycled the Russia headwind?","Marc Bitzer","Tom it's Marc Bitzer. So first of all as you know on a full year basis last year Europe revenue was pretty much flat and that\u2019s where we kind of based the market assumptions pretty much expecting all through this year directionally. So Q1 on constant FX or in local currency, with minus fees of kind of trailing fee point pretty much behind where we want to be from the revenue side. Again, as I mentioned before where it is largely driven by Russia and UK for different reasons.","UK there is a British pound weakness, we announced some cost based price increases. As you all know we have a safety recall action -- it's a temporary UK issue. Russia, the market remains soft throughout Q1. As we said also on Investor Day, Russia is a market of extreme volatility and we saw in previous and described that kind of market come down very quickly and also comes up very quickly.","It started already last, pretty much around February or Q1 over Q1, there was a slight weakness even though we worked till the end of the quarter some signs of stabilization in the Russia markets. But it\u2019s very hard to predict how the Russia market develops going forward. Again the latest trends have been a little bit more encouraging but it still remains very soft. ","Tom Mahoney","Great. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go next to Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James.","Sam Darkatsh","I\u2019d better ask all my questions once before the moderator gets the finger [indiscernible]. I have two other quick questions if I could. First off on slide 27 which is the timing of earnings walk first half to second half. If my notes hold, the costing capacity reductions that used to be two pluses in the back half and now it\u2019s one plus, if that's accurate what\u2019s the derivation of that? And then my final question would be, in Latin America you said the price mix you\u2019re happy with could you help quantify what price mix was year-over-year in the Latin American segment?","Larry Venturelli","Hi Sam, this is Larry. You\u2019ll probably note from the slide in the deck there that we had very strong costing capacity from the synergies in Q1. So we\u2019re delivering a little bit ahead of our pace on the synergies and that\u2019s the only reason we adjusted the chart from the previous. But we expect -- obviously expect continued strong productivity and continued strong synergies for the remainder of the year. ","Marc Bitzer","Sam this is Marc, on Latin America and we will note that figure ready on you. Just putting in context, so in Latin America we had a minus 22 unit growth in Q1 excluding currency our revenue were minus 4, so that gives you a lot of the answer about the massive progress we made there on driving up our price mix.","As you also know this is a blend of multiple different businesses, you also have the large national business in there and there is quite a bit of differences in Brazil between what we call T3, T9, T12, anyhow if you peel back beyond and in particular in our all important T3 categories, we had substantial improvement on price mix and we were successful in fact doing several cost based price increases into the market. So in short we\u2019re pleased that how the team mitigates the negative impacts of inflation currency on to price. So we\u2019re very pleased with the progress.","Sam Darkatsh","Can you help quantify that market if you could, even if it's a range of what price mix was in the quarter?","Marc Bitzer","On the core, as you know Sam, you don\u2019t give detailed numbers on price mix. But on the core Brazil and particularly if you look at the T3, again that\u2019s an element of a core business, we had year-over-year almost double-digit is the improvement.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to David MacGregor with Longbow. Please go ahead.","David MacGregor","You talked in the past about the importance of having market share leadership at the country level in Europe. And in the sense you want the virtues of this acquisition is it enhances that country by country leadership position. Can you just talk about how your market share, your leadership countries may have changed versus the non-leadership countries?","Marc Bitzer","David, its Marc. And I mean as you know, we typically don\u2019t break down market share progress quarter-on-quarter country by country. Having said that, I reaffirm that one of the key strengths of the acquisition has been the market share strength and position, which we have in several key countries and that is to be honest one year or one and half years into the integration has been fully reconfirmed. Our business in particular, Italy, France, UK and Russia and Poland remained very strong and are very strong. We do not see for your question a decline in market share, significant decline in some of the smaller markets. It's just I think what is reconfirm the structural benefit of having a strong market position, but we don\u2019t see a dramatic shift year-over-year between weaker and stronger markets.","Jeff Fettig","And David over time I think you will see it demonstrated through our continued ability to build our overall margin structure. And I think the other point Marc made in Q1 is when you look at overall market, we also have the market mix and having strong share of Russia and UK having those markets down more, which would weight our overall mix a little bit close to the market that\u2019s really in our view a temporary situation.","David MacGregor","And then second just a quick follow up, you mentioned twice in your Slide deck the adjacencies business is a growth driver. What kind of growth is achievable in this business? And do you expect margins in this business to be greater in 2016 than they were in \u201915?","Jeff Fettig","Yes, they\u2019ve been -- overall, that business there is a number of things in it, but two that you know very well, one is our KitchenAid small appliance business. And in the case of North America we have a consumer products business. We have a commercial laundry business, and then everywhere around the world slightly different. But these businesses are each one of them are somewhat different. But our view is we\u2019d like to be able to consistently grow this at least double-digit and that will be SDA that the consumer products ultimately commercial laundry and so on given our position.","We also have some more businesses like this in Brazil. We\u2019re developing them now, Europe, with the acquisition. We don\u2019t yet have these businesses in China. So there is a little bit around the world. But on average, yes, these are nicely margin business, probably at least double our margins so that we have them in our, our core or major appliance business. And so again when we talk about capital allocation and that sort of things, we do focus on what are the opportunities to grow these businesses could be by adding product lines could be by expanding in new markets around the world and so on. And we focus on that very strongly.","Operator","And we also have a follow up from Ken Zener with KeyBanc Capital.","Ken Zener","Marc, following up on the question, or your statement that you grew point of sale was high single low double versus the industry shipments. Could you expand on that and give us some context? Is that due to your easy comps last year? Has that happened in the past? What does that mean for your inventory levels and\/or your utilization rates? Because I think Larry you said 40% of your EPS will fall into the first-half, which are your midpoints about $3.11. So just trying to understand how those comments might impact your inventory shipments and just context to see that type of various happens often occasionally, rarely?","Marc Bitzer","Ken, its Marc. So obviously our sell through or sell out has been slightly higher than the sell in. So that sales up by definition as the reduction of trade inventory in the quarter, and that is by definition. So, no matter how you turn into the ending inventory for retailers is lower than the coming in. I would say it's a combination of both. I think some retailers were slight behind inventory coming through the quarter, but right now I would argue the strong sell through momentum of our product, we will see and we are seeing the shipments coming, catching up. So this is not a structural inventory reduction, it's temporary and ultimately as Jeff pointed out before selling always follow sellout.","Operator","Thank you. We also have follow up from Michael Rehaut with JPMorgan. ","Michael Rehaut","Thanks. Just want to make sure I heard right on the Europe segment that you were -- that revenues down 3% ex-FX, even if down 4%, and did I hear right that you saw the market flattish so you underperformed a little bit. And just wanted to get sense of what the drivers were there, sorry if you've covered this already, just want to make sure I fully understood that and if that\u2019s the case how do you anticipate kind of getting back in line with market growth for the full year which I think was still you're looking flat, flat to, well closer to flattish.","Marc Bitzer","Michael it's Marc. So first of all what I said is are you going to grow with minus 4 and we think the market was about minus 1 on a total level. So technically yes that would translate into we lost something versus the market, however embedded what Jeff highlight before it's very important to note that our country profile is not exactly the average of the overall market. I.e. we are exposed more to Russia, UK, Italy and France so I would say the overall market profile is not exactly identical to our data profile and in this case and just being a number situation swing slightly up in direction we're more or less more impacted by the Russia decline, but again we consider that temporary. ","Michael Rehaut","And then just Larry couple of technical questions on the income statement could you give us a sense what the share buyback, how we should think about fully diluted shares for the second quarter as well as the full year assuming nothing incremental from here and also just the tax rate expectations for the full year if you can revisit that as well.","Larry Venturelli","Tax rate Michael we said last call our guidance was 22 to 24% and in Q1 we're 22 and I'd expect that to hold for the rest of the year and I believe your first question was on shares absolute shares used. Weighted average shares, I would just use what you see in Q1.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions at this time, I'll return the floor to Jeff Fettig for closing remarks.","Jeff Fettig","Well again everyone, thank you for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you at our next call, thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude today's program, thanks for your participation, you may now disconnect and have a great day."],"22921":["Whirlpool Corp.

LLC","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to Whirlpool Corporation's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Release call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Max Tunnicliff.","Max Tunnicliff - Whirlpool Corp.","Thank you, and welcome to our third quarter 2018 conference call. Joining me today are Marc Bitzer, our Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Peters, our Chief Financial Officer. Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the investor section of our website at whirlpool.com.","Before we begin, I'll remind you that as we conduct this call we will be make forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and other periodic reports. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to results from our ongoing business operations.","We also think the adjusted measures will provide you a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations. Listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the Investor Relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.","At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following our prepared remarks, the call will be opened for analyst questions. As a reminder, we ask that participants ask no more than two questions.","With that, let me turn the call over to Marc.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. On slide 3 we show our third quarter highlights. As you saw in our press release, we delivered record ongoing earnings per share of $4.55, as well as ongoing EBIT margin expansion in three of four regions.","For second quarter in a row we delivered very strong price and mix in all regions, as we continue to realize the benefits of the price\/mix actions we took earlier this year. Additionally, our North America region delivered impressive results, driving strong top and bottom line growth. We expanded ongoing EBIT margins in North American regions despite soft U.S. industry demand and continued cost pressures as we increase our share positions while also delivering very strong price\/mix.","Operational and external challenges continue to weigh on our European results, but we are encouraged by the sequential progress we made on slowly restoring volume in the third quarter. And today, we are announcing further actions to refocus and improve our Europe performance in 2019, which Jim will discuss later in the call. Additionally, as part of our ongoing initiatives to respond to external factors, including raw material tariff and currency headwinds, we have recently announced new cost base price increases, including our U.S. kitchen and Brazilian major home appliance business. Finally, we have taken multiple actions related to recent changes in U.S. tax legislation, which favorably impacted our effective tax rate for the quarter, most notable a voluntary prepayment of a portion of our long-term pension obligation.","Turning to slide 4, I will discuss our third quarter results. Excluding currency, we delivered global growth of approximately 1.5%, driven by unit volume growth in North America and Latin America and strong global price\/mix. Ongoing EBIT margin was 6.2% as price\/mix was more than offset by continued cost inflation and increased marketplace investments related to recent product launches.","As mentioned earlier, we made a voluntary contribution of approximately $350 million to lower our long-term pension obligation funding, which impacted our free cash flow year-to-date. We will discuss our guidance in more detail later on the call. Our ability to successfully execute cost-based price increases and drive improved mix across multiple regions while maintaining strong cost discipline furthers our confidence that we are well positioned to deliver margin expansion and improve free cash flow conversion over the upcoming quarters.","Turning to slide 5, we show the drivers of third quarter margin performance. As mentioned earlier, our global price\/mix improved sequentially as well as year-over-year and was positive in all four regions. Our previously announced fixed-cost reduction actions continue to progress in line with expectations. During the quarter these benefits were offset by three main drivers. First, with the net cost, we experienced rising freight costs as well as volume deleverage, primarily related to our inventory reduction action. Second, raw material inflation continued to be a significant year-over-year headwind, impacting third quarter margin by approximately 175 basis points, while unfavorable currency impacted margins by 50 basis points. Finally, our margin was impacted by additional investments related to product launches, primarily in North America, which Jim will discuss in more detail later in the presentation.","Turning to slide 6, we once again demonstrated our commitment to delivering significant price\/mix performance. In total, third quarter price\/mix improved by approximately 250 basis points compared to the prior year and we delivered positive price\/mix in all regions. On a sequential basis, every year, every region either maintained or improved price\/mix, driving quarter-over-quarter improvement of 50 basis points globally. These results demonstrate the success of the initiatives we've implemented over the past several quarters. Finally, we recently announced additional cost-based price increases in multiple regions, including our U.S. kitchen and Brazil businesses, which will become effective during the fourth quarter.","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jim to review our regional results.","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Thanks, Marc. And good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 8, we review the third quarter results for our North America region. We delivered very impressive results in the quarter with both revenue growth and ongoing margin expansion, in spite of a challenging external environment. Net sales increased 5% despite an industry demand decline of nearly 2% in the quarter. We delivered this growth through strong price\/mix as well as volume growth due to market share gains, primarily in the kitchen category. Overall, we expanded our ongoing EBIT margin 20 basis points to 12%, as our strong performance overcame more than 200 basis points of raw material, tariff and freight cost inflation. These strong results once again demonstrate the success of our proactive price\/mix and cost initiatives and show the fundamental strength of our business in North America.","Looking forward, we expect to deliver continued strong results in the region as our previously announced price\/mix actions and recently announced U.S. kitchen cost-based price increases are expected to offset continued cost pressures next year. In addition to these actions, we expect to deliver continued growth and margin expansion as we improve volume and mix through a steady offering of innovative products, including those shown on slide nine.","In the third quarter, we completed the launch of a number of connected kitchen products under the Whirlpool brand. These products combine modern design and compelling features, including Yummly-Guided Cooking and voice command capabilities. Also, within our North America business, we have made two massive laundry platform investments totaling approximately $100 million. In the fourth quarter we are launching our brand-new frontload laundry line, including a connected all-in-one washer and dryer. These products feature industry-leading innovations.","The second major laundry investment brings significant upgrades to our top load platform and launches later in 2019. This new connected washer and dryer pair will offer brand specific and consumer relevant innovation in both the mass and mass premium segments. While we continue to focus on cost containment and managing price\/mix across our portfolio, we are truly excited about the growth and margin expansion opportunities that these and other new products will enable for our business.","Turning to slide 10, we review the third quarter results for our Europe, Middle East and Africa region. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales were down 8%. Volume remains a challenge, but we are beginning to see sequential progress with improvement in most countries. EBIT declined versus the prior year as positive price\/mix was more than offset by unit volume declines and unfavorable productivity due to reducing inventories. Additionally, the combination of raw materials, inflation, unfavorable currency and operational challenges in Turkey impacted results by approximately $40 million or more than 350 basis points.","Turning to slide 11, I would like to update you on the strategic actions we are taking to refocus the EMEA business and return to profitability. First, we have taken specific actions to recover and restore volume across the core EMEA business. We saw some improvement in the third quarter and expect further improvement in the fourth quarter, but the pace and magnitude have been slow. In order to drive a fundamental change in our volume year-over-year, we're focused on rebuilding relationships with our trade customers and recovering floor spots lost during the peak of the integration. We are also committed to refocusing our marketplace investments towards our most profitable segments to ensure that we not only drive higher volumes, but also capitalize on new product innovation to expand margins.","Second, as we announced last quarter, we have begun to reevaluate certain aspects of our EMEA business. As part of that effort, we are announcing several new strategic actions to refocus and right-size our business. We will be exiting a number of lossmaking businesses, including our Turkish domestic sales operation which does not include the factory operations, as well as our Hotpoint branded small appliance business. Additionally we are evaluating our South Africa operations for a potential sale as we refocus on our core European business. Together, these three businesses represent approximately $230 million in revenue and a sizable EBIT loss of $60 million for the full year of 2018.","Finally, we have announced a new $50 million fixed cost reduction initiative for the region, which is expected to deliver benefits in 2019. This initiative is an addition to the $150 million global fixed cost reduction announced last year. As a result of all of these actions, we expect to drive approximately $100 million in annualized EBIT improvement in EMEA before exit cost as actions are completed throughout 2019. This represents a step function improvement to our regional cost structure and is the first step to restoring profitability and getting back on track toward our long-term margin targets for the region.","With that, we turn to slide 12 to review the third quarter results for our Latin America region. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales increased approximately 2%. Ongoing EBIT increased 11% as strong price\/mix and volume growth more than offset $15 million of raw material and currency headwinds driving margin expansion. We delivered these strong results through unit volume growth, share gains and positive price\/mix. We are well positioned to deliver margin expansion in Latin America in the coming quarters through strong cost discipline and realizing the benefits of recently announced cost-based price increases in the region.","We now turn to the third quarter results for our Asia region, which are shown on slide 13. Excluding the impact of currency, net sales declined 4%. We delivered EBIT of $13 million, a solid improvement versus the prior year. Our third quarter results were positively impacted by EBIT improvement in China and positive price\/mix. We delivered strong results despite raw material inflation of approximately $10 million and productivity headwinds related to lower volume levels and temporary industry demand weakness.","Now I'd like to turn it back over to Marc to review our guidance.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Thanks, Jim. On slide 15, we will review our updated guidance assumptions. We continue to expect total revenue to be flat to the prior year, as strong price\/mix improvement is offset by lower unit volumes. Despite the success of our global price\/mix and cost reduction initiatives as well as the continued strength of our business in North America, we are slightly revising our ongoing EBIT margin expectations as a result of weaker than anticipated results in Europe for the second half. We now expect to deliver free cash flow of approximately $600 million, primarily driven by our voluntary pension contribution. Absent of our voluntary onetime items, we expect to deliver approximately $800 million in underlying free cash flow this year. Finally, we expect an ongoing 2018 effective tax rate of approximately 10.5% for full year, driven by our voluntary pension pre-funding and additional tax planning actions.","As a result of these adjustments, we are narrowing our ongoing earnings per share guidance towards the high-end of our previous range. We now expect to deliver ongoing earnings of $14.50 to $14.80 per share, which will be an all-time record.","Turning to slide 16, we show the updated drivers of our ongoing EBIT margin guidance. We continue to expect to deliver approximately $400 million or 2 points of net benefits from improved price\/mix as our global cost-based price increases have delivered strong results in line with expectations. Our previously announced fixed cost reduction actions remain on track to deliver $150 million benefit this year. However, we have reduced our expectation for net cost as volume weakness has impacted conversion and fuel price inflation has continued to impact our freight cost. Finally, our guidance for raw material inflation, currency and marketing investments are unchanged. Overall, we now expect to deliver 6.4% ongoing EBIT margin this year.","Now, Jim will cover our regional guidance and cash priorities.","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Thanks, Marc. On slide 17 we show our regional industry and EBIT margin guidance. We now expect the U.S. industry to continue to build on the growth we saw in September and deliver modest growth of approximately 1% for the full year. And we continue to expect to deliver approximately 12% ongoing EBIT margin in North America for the full year. In EMEA, we now expect to deliver EBIT margin of approximately negative 2% to 3%. Finally, our guidance for Latin America and Asia is unchanged.","Turning to slide 18, our total free cash flow guidance for 2018 remains essentially the same as our previous guidance. We have reduced our guidance for cash earnings as a result of our performance in EMEA. Capital expenditures have been slightly reduced due to changes in the timing of certain projects. Excluding the impact of discrete voluntary items, our full year 2018 free cash flow expectation is approximately $800 million. Our updated free cash guidance reflects approximately $350 million of pension pre-funding we discussed earlier, as well as the benefits of a real estate portfolio optimization opportunity expected in the fourth quarter.","Turning to slide 19, we show our capital allocation priorities for 2018, which are unchanged and on track. We continue to expect to close the sale of our Embraco compressor business in early 2019. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $100 million of common stock and we expect to continue repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $1.3 billion in cash to shareholders, which already represents an all-time record on an annual basis.","Now I'll turn it back over to Marc.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Thanks, Jim. Now turning to slide 20, I would like to take a moment to provide a few assumptions regarding our current expectations for 2019. We expect modest global industry growth in the low single digits, with the U.S. industry showing growth of approximately 1%. A positive view on the U.S. appliance industry is based in part on our perspective regarding the U.S. housing market. While we recognize the sluggish trends in housing starts and existing home sales, there are some more favorable fundamentals related to housing supply and demand that are getting less attention.","First, the housing recovery has been held back by massive supply constraints. Since the end of the recession, housing starts have remained well below the 25 year average of 1.3 million units per year. Further, the current age of the U.S. rental stock is now 40 years and 100% of the new apartment supplies since the recession has been fully absorbed. Secondly, supply constraints have led to a strong appreciation of home prices. In essence, the home prices paced well ahead of where you would expect them to be in the cycle. This, coupled with mortgage constraints and rising interest rates has tempered demand.","And thirdly, we are now seeing a scenario where slowdown of home price appreciation and a slight increase in inventory will meet strong demand fundamentals, including favorable demographics, a homeownership rate at a 52 year low and a strong need for rental homes and apartments. We expect the combination of these factors to lead to continued recovery in the housing markets well perhaps at a slower pace, which in turn would help ensure continued healthy demand for new appliances.","While we believe the U.S. industry will continue to grow in the coming years as a result of these factors, we also want to be clear that our North American business is well positioned to deliver strong results in any environment, as evidenced by our performance this year. Shifting to costs for 2019, we currently expect raw material and tariff inflation of approximately $300 million, similar to what we faced in 2018. We do expect our previous and recently announced cost-based price increases to fully offset this cost inflation by continued cost discipline and focus on cost takeout will enable us to expand margins in the coming year.","Finally, we anticipate to significantly reduce restructuring expenses and an ongoing effective tax rate in 2019 of less than 20%. At this point, I also want to remind you that we will provide our guidance for 2019 on our fourth quarter earnings call in January.","Now, we will end our formal remarks and open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take a question from Ken Zener of KeyBanc Capital.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Good morning, Ken.","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Good morning.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So it's been quite a year, very steady U.S. results as you're gaining price amid lots of international volatility. So just because Europe was such a big adjustment, I would say, this year, and I think it's important what you're doing in your small business appliance, so you're walking away from $230 million of revenue, which is a $60 million loss. Just for perspective, was that business, businesses, were those making money in, let's say FY 2016 and FY 2017? And I ask because I'm trying to understand if you can shrink your way to profitability given your, I believe, FY 2020 margin targets, which are still below your long-term targets of 7% to 8%. I'm just trying to understand how you might be able to get there sooner on the margin basis.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Yeah. So, Ken, it's Marc. So let me actually maybe split the answer in two pieces. First, because you started the U.S., obviously, we are very pleased with our U.S. result in Q3. We had revenue growth, we had share growth, pricing found traction, we overcame a lot of headwinds and delivered 12% margin, which I think is a very, very strong result given the overall environment. So we're really pleased with our U.S. performance. Specifically on European, the actions which we announced basically fall into a bucket of we call noncore business, it's the Hotpoint SDA business, the Turkey domestic sales, it's not for production, it's the domestic sales and we are looking at option for South Africa. As you saw in the presentation that's roughly around a $230 million revenue, $60 million loss this year.","Now specifically to your question, if I would look back at full year 2016, these are businesses which even over longer term did not create a lot of value for us or no value at all. Specifically Turkey, even Turkey in health environment is a tough business because you have strong local competitors and there's a strong franchise network in stores which is always difficult to get into. So I would say even in a normal environment, it's a tough market, and basically this was under the headline we want to stop certain bleeders where we also didn't see a long-term perspective to create value.","Now also linked to your point about shrinking your way to profitability, no, what we are doing with these actions is we want to eliminate some bleeders. We want to give the team a chance to focus on the core businesses. We are making money and we can make a lot of money in our core markets where we are strong. So this is very much about the focus. The ultimate way to profitability beyond restoring volumes, which is more in the short term, ultimately comes back to what I referred to in the previous conference call. We have to strengthen our so-called built-in business, which is the kitchen business. That's our path to profitability beyond the short-term actions of restoring volumes.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. Was that two or one, can I ask another one, Marc?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Sure.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Well in the U.S. looking at the volume and price, I had thought looking at 2012, when you guys got about 5% price, which is where you're kind of running, volumes in the industry or your volumes actually had fallen 5% that year, realizing there's Canada and Mexico in there. Do you think the elasticity we saw in 2Q where you got price, volume was very weak, now you outpace the market with 5% price. Is there elasticity after a certain period of price introduction, which is to say you're gaining share, is that because the price increase has abated and\/or we receive lots of questions from clients about the Koreans, LG, Samsung perhaps having run out of pre-tariff product. Could you just talk about price and volume dynamics related to those two items, elasticity and the Korean tariffs? Thank you.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","So, Ken, it's Marc again. So first of all, on the question of elasticity, I'm always a little bit careful to give a precise number on elasticity for a number of reasons. First of all \u2013 and particularly if you look at the current quarter, there is sometimes difference between sell-in, i.e., what you sell in through trade, sell-through and other elements. I would always argue on a full year base there is limited overall category price elasticity on the consumer side, i.e., I would say on a full year base, consumer prices do not necessarily impact consumer demand in a strong way.","Having said that, of course, it's a highly competitive environment, so at any given point you have competition out there, which drives a certain amount of elasticity. But I would argue what we're seeing this year in U.S. has probably been our strongest price\/mix execution by any historical standard. So we are very pleased about the traction, how the team has implemented it. And you're referring to laundry I want to remind us also our first price increase was in kitchen. So this was a cost-based price increase and additional mix actions throughout our entire business, not just the laundry, it's also on the kitchen side. And we are really, really pleased with that, and I think we've proven that we understand how we manage certain categories in a highly competitive marketplace.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Rehaut of JPMorgan.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, good morning, everyone. First question, if I could go back to Europe for a moment and think it makes a lot of sense, obviously, exiting some loss-making regions or product lines. But if I'm looking at what you're expecting to lose for the full year this year, it will be a little bit above $100 million. So my question is, as you look towards 2019, are there other areas, perhaps top line recovery, that you think could get you towards being in the black for 2019?","And specifically I'm thinking about trying to stabilize or recover some of the volume loss, and obviously it's easy to lose flooring or share, and it's sometimes much harder to gain it back. So just want your thoughts around what additional items you need to do to push yourself back into the black and how you're thinking about the timing and the fruits of some of the upcoming labors around trying to recover some of that volume?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Michael, I mean, first of all, on these actions which we announced were critical, were necessary, but they are only part of the answer, as you point out. First of all, beyond exiting certain loss-making business, keep also in mind we announced a fixed cost reduction which structurally lower our infrastructure cost base, so that's a sustained benefit. But you have to do right, I mean we have to stabilize the volume, that's what we always said. And frankly even where we've seen improvement, the improvement has been slow. In the first half, as you saw in the presentation, we lost 18% volume, which obviously given the fixed cost intensity of a business has a massive impact on how you deleverage and the cost you carry.","In Q3 we have been able to slightly improve it to minus 12%, I mean from minus 18% to minus 12%, yes, that's an improvement, but it's slow, very simply because it's very difficult midyear to regain floor spots, to re-motivate trade customers given certain annual agreements. Q4 starts better as you saw in the presentation. We expect roughly minus 8%, so it's a further improvement. But ultimately it comes back to we want to exit the year with pretty much a flat trend from a volume perspective and that is the starting point to have a profitable business in Europe.","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","And, Michael, on top of that \u2013 this is Jim \u2013 I would say that if you look at some of the inventory actions that we've taken to reduce our inventory levels year-over-year, a significant portion of that does come within EMEA. So there is additional deleveraging due to volume that was on top of just the volume \u2013 the share loss we had within EMEA.","Michael Jason Rehaut - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thank you. I guess the second question to shift towards your 2018 margin walk, where you have reduced the net cost benefit for the full year from 125 bps to 75 bps. I think if you look at what you've been able to do so far this year in the first quarter you hit that 75 bps mark, the last couple of quarters it's been more like 25 bps, if I'm looking right on that line item. So it would imply a much stronger number for the fourth quarter, I believe well over \u2013 obviously just the math dictates well over 100 bps, 125 bps of a benefit. So what's driving that 4Q weighting in terms of either are certain actions that you expect to kick in or better just productivity from a higher growth number or higher volume number or revenue number? What's driving that 4Q payoff, so to speak?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Michael, it's Marc. So first of all, just as a point of clarification, what we have in the net costs is also including freight inflation, which as you know has been massive, and particularly in the U.S., but for most parts of the world. So what you see is the raw material tariff inflation is literally only raw material and what we see in tariffs. Anything which we see on freight costs, labor inflation, all these elements are kind of a negative sitting in the net cost. Just for point of clarification.","Specific to your question between Q3 and Q4, I want to come back to a point which Jim made before. We made a very significant inventory reduction as a company in Q3. As you may recall, end of Q2, we pretty much had flat inventories year-over-year, if you include the Embraco inventory and end of Q3 we are $300 million down. But as you all know, every dollar of inventory captures a certain cost leverage, or cost benefit, so that weighs heavily on our Q3 net cost takeout, because we are deleveraging, because we took so much volume out sits in Q3. So in a certain way, that part will not be a burden in Q4 and that explains why we are kind of in Q4 back to I would say the run rate which you would have expected coming out of Q1 and Q2.","Operator","Our next question is from Sam Darkatsh of Raymond James.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, Marc, good morning, Jim. How are you?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Good morning, Sam.","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Good morning Sam.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Two questions, first with respect to the implied fourth quarter guide for U.S. industry shipments. At least the math would suggest that it looks like you are guiding for AHAM essentially to be up mid-single digit. That optically to some could appear aggressive, especially if the Sears inventory in the channel gets bled down. Now favorably I think I'm guessing you're baking in some pre-buy at retail ahead of your price increases, but how should we think about how you're thinking about sell-through at retail in the fourth quarter and why sell-through would improve in the fourth quarter versus what we've seen earlier this year?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Sam, so first of all, your observation is correct. I mean, Q3 sell-in was minus 1.7%. Keep also in mind that was still strongly impacted by a soft July and August. September started to come better. Actually in September we saw finally kind of the overall getting closer to what we've seen through a sell-through on a full year base. And we already in the previous earnings call we said sell-through we see running between 0% and plus 1% or sometimes plus 2%. So our expectation of full year is basically that the sell-in is very similar to the sell-through which is around this plus 1%. Particularly on Q4, to your question, first of all, I would not overestimate the Sears inventory impact, because I think it's a lot less than you might assume. Second point is, yes, we do expect some industry shipments particularly in November\/December related to our already announced cost-based price increases. And we also see right now even on the sell-through trends in September and early October that's kind of the \u2013 as we are heading into the promotional periods, I think the sell-through is actually fairly solid.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Next question, you have a lot of moving parts with free cash flow in 2018 with tax, with restructuring, with discretionary items, all that stuff, you have the long-term target of 5% to 6% of sales for free cash flow. I don't want to peg you on a specific free cash flow for 2019, but can we \u2013 how realistic is it to think that 2019 might see free cash flow in that 5% to 6% range knowing how many noise there was this year in free cash?","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Yes, Sam, this is Jim. And I think that's a safe assumption as you look forward. Because a couple of things that will happen here is one, obviously this pension contribution was a onetime item, $350 million. And it's the equivalent of what would've been our next five years of pension contributions. So we have accelerated that piece and that comes out of the future years. Additionally on the restructuring cash, we are at the peak of the payout of the restructuring cash. And so that should come down over future years. And then as we look forward, while we will have a significant benefit this year from working capital, we still believe that our working capital opportunity is not the same level, but there are working capital opportunities as we go forward into 2019.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So 5% to 6% is realistic for next year?","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","It is, yes.","Sam J. Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from David MacGregor of Longbow Research.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Yes, good morning.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Good morning, David.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","I guess lot to talk about this quarter, boy, a lot of moving parts, you guys got a lot going on. I guess we haven't really talked about Kenmore yet, so with this year's exit, maybe you could just talk about that. I know a lot of people are trying to make sense of this. Can you talk to the extent you can about potential inventory liquidation and what kind of impact that should have on the business, maybe to the extent you're seeing order cancelation right now as a consequence of this by not just Sears but maybe other retailers looking to get their inventory levels down? Just any kind of color you can provide around that I think would be helpful to people.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","So David, it's Marc. Obviously a lot has been written about Sears and Kenmore, and I don't need to add a whole lot to it. First of all, as we already in our announcement last week, the impact on our business is very limited. You saw in our, kind of, announcement, we had \u2013 at the end of the day we had a receivable exposure of roughly around $30 million, which is very low if you could have looked at historical standards. So we managed that down in a very proactive manner. You will also see in our details we accrued for more than half, or about half of it and there is uncertainty around it.","Now obviously, Sears is in the Chapter 11 process, there's a lot of moving pieces right now. I would expect that Sears will be active in the market with a certain store footprint in Q4, and we're right now \u2013 while we protect our own interest, we're at the same time in a very constructive dialogue with Sears about what it all means for Q4 and going forward. And I would see some Sears activity also happening in Q4 and we will be part of that. But again, there's a lot of moving pieces, but I think we're very well engaged in the process, we have the right support and we will manage it appropriately and accordingly as you would expect it from us.","Particularly on the questions of the inventory and the inventory liquidation, you should assume that the Sears inventory position was not very high. Sears, first of all, historically always had a very efficient and effective supply chain. So Sears would have historically even been not the big inventory holder, and that inventory came further down over last year. So in any model you have, I would remind, don't overestimate the Sears inventory which is out there because it's very limited.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","But Sears is also responsible for whatever work is in process with the manufacturers, so I guess it's a little bit bigger than just the inventory they had in their RDCs. And is there any way you can sort of give us some kind of an assessment, when it look like a month or a couple of months' worth of shipments?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","So, David, I can give you answer for us as a manufacturer, keep in mind we are not an overseas producer, we are largely a domestic producer.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","Right.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","So we have the benefit of a very short and responsive supply chain. So basically our Sears products historically, they are what you would call a build-to-order. We produce once we get the order and the forecast. So we don't have big ships coming over across the Pacific with lot of inventory, we build-to-order have a short supply chain and that's also probably the reason why our impact on our business is very limited. So if you think there is some big warehouse somewhere in Ohio where we keep a lot of Kenmore units, the answer is no.","Operator","Our next question is from Susan Maklari of Credit Suisse.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning. My first question is I wanted to think about a lot of the moving parts that are coming through in terms of how the fourth quarter margin could come together. It feels like you've got some tailwinds as it relates to some of the pricing actions that have been taken, some of the volume and maybe even some of the pull-forward that can come in there. How should we think about that relative to some of the more normal trends that come through in terms of sort of promotional events and things like that? And I guess what I'm trying to get to is could that fourth quarter margin in North America actually have some of its normal seasonality negated by some of these tailwinds?","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","No, I would say that you will see within the fourth quarter for North America a similar type of margin seasonality and all that, because as you mentioned, the big drivers within there, one, it is a highly promotional period and that's very similar year-over-year. But then two, we also \u2013 that's our kitchen \u2013 our countertop appliance business, that's the prime season for that. And so those are the two big drivers that affect the Q4 margins in North America, and we don't see any significant differences this year.","Susan Maklari - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then on the slides, you noted that inflation is expected to stay around that $300 million range and there are no changes. Can you just give us some context of what you've been seeing in terms of your key raw material inputs and what the outlook is for those?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Susan, it's Marc. So first of all, we said, this year we will expect raw material inflation and tariff inflation of around $350 million. As we pointed out, that is largely driven this year by steel prices, including the Section 232 effect and plastics in all forms. So these were the biggest items behind the raw material inflation. And on top of that, we have a tariff impact which impacts certain strategic components like motors or electronics. We do expect a similar effect for next year as you've seen in our presentation. At this point, we would assume around a $300 million raw material tariff increase which again says it's sustained, but it's certainly not higher than what we would have seen in 2018.","And that largely comes from one element is just the carryover element of the tariff which you can quantify, and the other element is on steel, we see a stabilization or actually slightly coming down from its peak. There's still some uncertainty particularly around the oil-based products. That uncertainty still remains. And once we see more developments, we will give updated guidance on the real raw material outlook for 2019 in January.","Operator","Our next question is from Curtis Nagle of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Curtis Nagle - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Marc, just a quick follow-up on, yeah, the $300 million in (41:02) you guys are expecting next year. I guess could you be a little more specific on what steel price that's based on? Is it the current, does it assume continued walk-down in price? And I don't know, I guess how much cushion do you think you have in that $300 million, and I guess the confidence that we don't see another round of increases in the assumptions like we did last year and the year before?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Curtis, again first of all again to clarify, whenever we give a raw material outlook, it is against the forward expectation. It's never against the current spot price because we typically don't \u2013 in particular with big raw material items, we don't buy spots, we have long-term contracts or we have hedges. The only element which we buy more short-term is plastics, because you can't hedge it and you can't have a full year contract. So our outlook is against expected forward rates, not against current spot prices.","Now of course, spot price always, to some extent influence what you expect on a go forward base. So what we basically outlook right now is based on steel price development and based on certain spot price, this is what we would expect to lock in on a full year base with the current assumptions. So on the \u2013 I think in the next two or three months we will get a lot more clarity around this one. The uncertainty still remains about plastics. I also want to remind ourselves that in particular in 2018, the big surprise in raw material in Q1 and Q2 was around the plastics and the sudden development of plastics. And then on top of that you had the tariffs which frankly we did not have on our horizon when we started the year. So the tariffs are now known, so we know what we're counting on this one. But of course in an environment in which we're living with a lot of inflation, there's always some uncertainty around raw material and inflation associated with that.","Curtis Nagle - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Fair enough. And then just a question for Jim. Yeah, I guess could you help us bridge in some detail the free cash flow for the year? I mean had a pretty big deficit, I understand that 4Q is a quarter where you generate cash flow, but at least historically it looks like the gap is pretty big. So yes, just kind of in working order, what are the biggest pieces and then how confident are you in hitting that $600 million target for the year?","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Yes, Curtis, so the biggest driver of it overall right now year-over-year is working capital. And as I mentioned earlier, our inventory levels are significantly below where they were last year but we reduced those inventory levels in Q3 of this year versus Q4 of last year. And when we reduce them in Q3, you will also see a lower level of accounts payable, which means we have significantly less that we pay out within the fourth quarter this year versus last year. That's the first biggest driver that we see.","The next thing that we see on that, while we've said CapEx will be slightly lower this year than we originally expected, most of that is coming the fourth quarter, and that's just due to the timing of some of the investments that we are making as we expect those to flow through. And then the other thing that I mentioned in the prepared remarks earlier was the real estate portfolio optimization opportunities that we have that are partially offsetting the pension contribution. And those are about $125 million, which is coming in Q4 this year, which would be different from Q4 last year.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Dahl of RBC Capital Markets.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. My first one is actually a follow-up on free cash, and I wanted to ask two different things about it. The first, just touching on that last response regarding working capital, just given the significant adjustments you've talked about making this year, how should we think about working cap as it relates to kind of a baseline for 2019 and whether there is further room for improvement or if it should be more neutral?","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Well, as I said earlier, for this year, it will be a significant item for us, and a significant opportunity. As we look forward the opportunity will be smaller, but there will be continuing opportunities to reduce working capital. But this year, we are looking at that being approximately an incremental $125 million above last year. I would say next year it will not be at this year's level, but will continue to reduce our working cap. And that primarily comes through inventory, that's where most of our opportunities sit as we look both globally, but as well as throughout our entire product portfolio, we see opportunities to reduce our inventory levels and maintain the same levels of service.","Michael Dahl - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Okay. And the second related question is really, and this ties in taxes as well, but just I want understand better the change in tax rate expectations. And to the extent that the pension funding contributed to the lower tax rate this year, I would assume that it also is having some benefit on your cash earnings. And so I wanted to understand, kind of, you're pointing out the $800 million of, excluding voluntary items, but it seems like tax rate would've been higher if not for the pension funding. So what's the cash impact of that from a tax benefit standpoint, and then on your overall tax rate?","James Peters - Whirlpool Corp.","Yes. So again, you are correct that this has an impact on our overall tax rate of about 3% for the year. So as you look at that go forward, and that's why we've said we are at 10.5% this year, we expect to be below 20% in the future years, but that 3% right now would obviously not repeat itself next year. In terms of impact to cash earnings, it's relatively small this year. If you can just think about the benefit overall on $350 million is around $40-some-million. And so again, not all of that comes as cash within this year also, so that has a very small impact on our free cash flow for this year.","Also, looking at the tax rate go forward and the change we made throughout the year, what's happened is the tax regulations have evolved a lot, and it's allowed us to \u2013 at the beginning of the year, most of our tax planning strategies we had in past were no longer available, but it's allowed us to identify new opportunities. And so, we've continued to refine that as we've understood it better.","Operator","Our next question is from Alvaro Lacayo of Gabelli & Company.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","Good morning, everyone. Just one question regarding EMEA. You talked about the noncore business exits, the fixed cost reduction. Can you maybe just give us an idea of timing on when you expect to see the brunt of these benefits? And then if you can quantify how inventory reductions impacted EMEA in 2018, that would be helpful as well.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Alvaro, so on the first of all, on the timing of these actions, we said it over the next few quarters, so you should think probably about the next two or three quarters where we try to exit some of these businesses. And so, the actions are underway, but it will not be done in one quarter. So it could be fast in the Hotpoint small domestic business, on Turkey we got to exit certain franchise networks, so I would say over the next few, i.e., next two or three quarters. That's when you should expect them and that's when you should see the benefits ramping up. The same is probably true on the fixed cost where you should start seeing some benefits as of Q1 next year and then slowly ramping up.","Alvaro Lacayo - Gabelli & Company","And just on the inventory reductions on what kind of an impact it had on EMEA in 2018?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","So on the \u2013 Alvaro, what you have, first of all I mentioned earlier the overall company year-over-year inventory reduction of $300 million, now big part of that is actually related to Europe. So you add in Europe, the combination of both lower volumes from sales side and an additional inventory reduction. So you should assume that kind of our entire European production base ran this year roughly with about minus 20% volume. So you had a very significant cost deleverage effect sitting in the entire 2018 numbers in Europe.","Operator","Our next question is from Doug Clark of Goldman Sachs.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, great. Thanks a lot. I have two related questions on North America. First is in terms of the price increases that you're taking, earlier in the year you took some price increases a bit more aggressively earlier than some of the competitors. So I'm just curious if these price increases are going to be replicated throughout the industry, or if heading into the holiday season that might just cause some noise. That's first question. And then second question is I'm curious if you can give us a sense of how much of your North America business in particular is purchased through financing and if the rising interest rate environment has any impact on that?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","So, Doug, it's Marc. Honestly, on pricing, I can't tell you what the other competitors will be doing, that's their decision. We take the pricing when we see cost pressures which we can't fully mitigate for mix or additional cost takeout actions. That's what we've done late last year when we announced the kitchen base and then early this year when we announced the laundry one. As you saw from or heard from our comments, we expect raw material and cost inflation also next year and that's why we announced the price increase which will be come in effect in the kitchen side in early January. Obviously as you will understand I can't make comments about our planned or unplanned price increases because we never do it. And again, I can't tell you what the competitors will be doing. All I can say is just judging on the past is that our team has been able to execute these price increases very well. The fact that we picked up market share in Q3, I think speaks volumes to how well we executed these price increases.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then my question on...","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","On the financing.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, on financing.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","I was just coming to it. I would say over in North America, the pure consumer financing I would say outside the homebuilding industry is somewhat limited. It is actually a fairly small part. There are other parts in the world like Brazil or what I mentioned earlier Turkey, where you have a significant amount of consumer financing. But the actual consumer financing on appliances in the U.S. is somewhat limited, so if you would see an impact of rising interest rates, if at all you would've seen and you've seen it already is more on the homebuilding side, where you have to finance. But it's not so much kind of on the single unit purchase on the appliance side.","Doug Clark - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then quick follow-up, just (52:04) last quarter and you've been talking to kind of the 4% EBIT margin target in 2020. Is that still the right timeframe or has that moved a bit?","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","Yes, Doug, we still expect by 2020 to have an EBIT margin of 4% to 5% in Europe. So that is consistent. But obviously it all is contingent on us showing now the short-term improvement both in Q4 then for 2019. And we will obviously give more precise guidance around this one in the January earnings call.","Marc Robert Bitzer - Whirlpool Corp.","So I guess with that, I think we are at our last question. So let me maybe \u2013 as we close, let me just step back and give a little bit of additional perspective on 2018 even though it isn't over yet. And obviously this has been a year where the external headwinds in the form of raw materials, tariffs and currency were far greater than anybody could assume at the beginning of the year when we issued our guidance. In fact, these additional challenges amount to more than $200 million on top of the original $200 million we already planned for.","Now being able to reconfirm today an all-time record ongoing earnings per share guidance in this tough environment is a result of not only a favorable tax rate, but also very strong execution of our price and cost actions. Three of our four regions have delivered margin expansions and growth and we will also turn around our disappointing Europe performance. We've also taken number of actions throughout the world to refocus and right-size our business including a significant global fixed cost reduction, sale of Embraco and a number of strategic actions now underway in Europe. We have and we will continue to take all the actions necessary to manage for external challenges and improve profitability in every region.","As I look forward to 2019, I am confident that the actions we've taken and the underlying strength of our business will together deliver significant value for our shareholders. So thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter earnings call on January 29.","Operator","This does conclude today's Whirlpool Corporation's third quarter 2018 earnings release conference call.

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Director of Investor Relations, Joe Lovechio.","Joseph Lovechio","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Whirlpool Corporation First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. Joining me today are Jeff Fettig, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Todman, President of Whirlpool International; Marc Bitzer, President of Whirlpool North America; and Larry Venturelli, our Chief Financial Officer. ","Our remarks today track with the presentation available on the Investors section of our website at whirlpoolcorp.com.","Before you begin, let me remind you that as we conduct this call we will be making forward-looking statements to assist you in understanding Whirlpool Corporation's future expectations. Our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10-K and 10-Q as well as in the Appendix of this presentation.","Turning to Slide 3. We want to remind you that today's presentation includes non-GAAP measures. We believe that these measures are important indicators of our operations as they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We also think that the adjusted measures will provide you with a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operation. ","Listeners are directed to the Appendix section of our presentation beginning on Slide 36 for the reconciliation of non-GAAP items to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. ","With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. As you saw earlier this morning, we released our first quarter financial results. Overall, we had a very strong start to the year as we benefited from our margin expansion efforts and our continued innovation investment. Our previously announced and implemented cost-based price actions, along with our cost-reduction initiatives, have put us on track to deliver our full year 2012 guidance. We have particularly strong operating performance in our North America and Latin America regions. In fact, in North America, ongoing operating business profits tripled year-over-year despite a 10% industry unit decline in demand.","I think the strength of our global brand portfolio is evident as we continue to see strong consumer preference for our innovative new product launches, which, overall, is driving very positive mix in many of our key markets. And despite the weaker-than-expected demand, our working capital in the first quarter is at a record low, driven largely by lower inventory levels.","As a reminder, during our last call, we clearly defined what we call our ongoing business operational performance, which excludes unusual items, restructuring expense and tax credits. You can see our results for the quarter on Slide 6.","Sales were relatively flat despite weaker appliance demand, unfavorable currency and the effects of a lower BEFIEX monetization. Our diluted earnings per share from ongoing business operations improved to $1.41 a share compared to $0.64 a year ago with our operating earnings more than double. And we saw year-over-year improvements in our free cash flow from business operations, which we'll discuss in detail later.","Turning to Slide 7. You'll see a summary of our current demand outlook for the year. Overall, our outlook remains unchanged as we continue to expect flat to slightly positive demand growth around the world for the year. However, in different parts of the world, we've seen a slower start to the year, but overall, globally, we see the same demand levels as we originally forecasted. ","In North America, we're currently seeing demand trending towards the lower end of our previous flat to plus 3% range. In Latin America, in part due to a continuous -- continuation of the Brazilian tax holiday program, combined with strong underlying economic fundamentals both in Brazil and other Latin American countries, after a very good first quarter, we see demand at the high end of our plus 2% to plus 5% range for the region for the year.","In Europe, we continue to forecast an industry decline ranging from minus 2% to minus 5% for the full year as consumer confidence in the Eurozone remains weak. ","And finally, in Asia, we expect our full year demand in Asia to be at the lower end of our previously stated plus 2% to plus 4% after a relatively weak demand level in Q1.","I'll now turn to Slide 8, which shows our key business drivers for the year and how they are tracking versus our previous guidance. As I mentioned, overall, we continue to benefit from the already announced global cost-based price increases. As we progress through the year, we will comp against the 2011 global price increases, so we do expect price\/mix to continue to be a positive driver of margin expansion throughout the year, but at a lesser rate than we saw in the first quarter. Our restructuring costs and capacity initiatives are on track and these benefits will ramp up and accelerate throughout the year in 2012. In addition, we will continue to bring the cadence of strong innovation which will contribute to the overall improvement in our revenue growth, our mix and overall operating profit.","And finally, we estimate raw material inflation to be at the higher end of our $300 million to $350 million range, but we still expect to more than offset all this inflation through strong productivity benefits, which will ramp up in the second half of the year. ","So overall, we're pleased with the very good start in the first quarter. We are -- as we look out through the rest of the year, we believe we are on track to deliver our EPS and free cash flow guidance for the year.","At this point in time, I'll turn it over to Marc Bitzer for an update on our North America operations.","Marc Bitzer","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by giving my perspective on North America's performance for the quarter. As shown on Slide 10, overall U.S. industry unit shipments decreased 10% during the quarter. Despite a very weak industry demand, our ongoing business operations margin grew to 6.7% during the quarter, up from the 2.3% in the prior year. This is largely the result of our previously announced and fully implemented cost-based price increases and an overall improved product price\/mix. ","It is important to note that our market share is up sequentially, which clearly speaks to the success of our innovation in the marketplace and our flawless execution of the price increases. Raw materials continued to be a headwind for us, and we have announced an additional cost-based price increase effective July 1. In addition, our cost and capacity-reduction initiatives are on track for the region. ","Turning to Slide 11. Net sales of $2.2 billion decreased 1% from last year driven by an overall unit volume decline. We saw our North America unit shipments down 7% in the first quarter, which is slightly ahead of the U.S. industry decline of 10%. Operating profit reached $151 million versus the $59 million in the previous year. Ongoing business operating profit was also $151 million as compared to $52 million in 2011, which means we nearly tripled our operating margin.","Turning to Slide 12. You can see just a few examples of our innovative cooking product launches. You also see a picture of our new Cleveland, Tennessee manufacturing facility. The facility officially opened early this month and includes a state-of-the-art production facility and distribution center and will be the largest premium cooking plant in the world. ","As demonstrated by our improving market share, despite our cost-based price increases, it is clear that our innovation is a competitive advantage and key to our success in the marketplace. We have a strong cadence of new product innovation planned throughout the year. ","I want to highlight the progress we've made against our business priorities for North America during the quarter as you can see on Slide 13. As mentioned before, we have successfully implemented our cost-based price increases, but the cost and capacity reduction initiatives as well as our ongoing productivity programs will ramp up during the second half of the year and are on track to generate the expected benefits. We were also able to leverage our strong product innovation during the quarter, realizing not only sequential margin improvements but sequential share gains.","Now before I turn it back over to Mike, I want to take a moment to address the recent ITC decision related to our bottom-mount refrigerator antidumping petition. We know the fact clearly demonstrated that bottom-mount refrigerators from South Korea and Mexico were being dumped in the United States market. And in March, the Department of Commerce confirmed that, in fact, dumping has occurred, and issued a final antidumping and countervailing duty determination, assigning both antidumping and countervailing duty margins. Obviously, we are extremely disappointed with the ITC decision and we will explore every option, including appeal to resolve the apparent disconnect between Commerce's final determination that dumping is occurring and the final ITC determination that these dump imports did not cause injury to the U.S. industry and their workers.","In addition, and this is very important, going forward, we will continue to monitor foreign producer behavior in the marketplace. If we see a reversion to the dumping activities that prevailed prior to 2012, we will take all appropriate legal actions. It's very important to know that this decision does not influence the actions that we took last December when we filed antidumping and countervailing duty petitions for large residential clothes washers from South Korea and Mexico. ","Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for his review of our international operations.","Michael A. Todman","Thanks, Mark. You'll find an overview of our international business performance on Slide 15. We had solid performance in our Latin American region, both within and outside of Brazil. The region reported sales of $1.3 billion, up 3% from the prior year period, with appliance unit shipments up 2%. Excluding the impact from currency, sales increased 7%. We saw improved price\/mix across the region. There was strong demand for T3 products, which include washing machines, refrigerators and ranges. While it was previously discussed, we elected to move away from lower-end, unprofitable microwave ovens and air conditioners. Strong sales and product price\/mix gains were partially offset by higher material costs and lower monetization of Brazilian BEFIEX tax credits. ","As we discussed on the last call, the Brazilian government declared an appliance sales tax holiday in December. The program, originally set to expire on March 31, was extended for an additional 90 days through June 30, 2012, as expected. Irrespective, however, of the stimulus program, we continue to be very positive about the prospects for our Brazil and Latin American international business. Europe remained challenging during the quarter with continued weak consumer demand across the Eurozone. Our cost-based price increases and cost-reduction initiatives are expected to progressively yield margin improvement sequentially throughout the year. In Asia, Q1 industry demand in India and China was lower than expected. China's economy grew at its weakest pace in nearly 3 years in the first quarter of 2012, and inflation in India continued to dampen demand. However, we continue to expect recovery throughout the year as we comp against easier numbers.","If you turn to Slide 16, you'll see our Latin America first quarter results. Operating profit for the quarter totaled $121 million compared to $174 million in the prior year. Favorable product price\/mix was offset by lower monetization of tax credit, unfavorable currency and higher material costs. On an adjusted basis, excluding Brazilian tax credits, operating profit for the quarter totaled $114 million compared to $108 million in the prior year period.","Turning to Slide 17. In the first quarter, our Europe, Middle East and Africa sales decreased 8% year-over-year to $688 million with unit shipments down 4% compared to the prior year period. Excluding the impact of currency, sales decreased approximately 3%. Operating profit of $5 million improved sequentially from the $32 million fourth quarter loss, but was down from last year -- prior year of $25 million.","Our first quarter results in the Asia region are shown on Slide 18. Net sales decreased 3% during the quarter to $202 million, down from $208 million in the prior year period with unit shipments increasing 1%. Excluding the impact of currency, sales increased approximately 2%. The region's operating profit was $9 million for the quarter compared to $11 million in the prior year. Overall, favorable product price\/mix and volume growth was more than offset by unfavorable currency and material costs.","Turning to Slide 19. You can see just a few examples of our international product launches during the quarter. In addition to the products you see here, our Bauknecht brand expanded into Hong Kong, allowing us to reach consumers in super premium segment in that growing market. And in Latin America, we've launched the region's first premium front-load laundry pair leveraging our new global laundry platform for Brastemp brand consumers.","And in India, starting in March, we are launching more than 150 new products during the year across 6 appliance categories, the largest launch in the region's history. The products deliver innovation, designs and features that consumers want and at price points that make the products accessible to every consumer segment.","In China, as you will see on Slide 20, we established a strategic alliance with the retailer, Suning, expanding our ability to large numbers of consumers through a respected trade channel. As part of the strategic alliance, we have preferential access to Suning's national distribution network of 1,700 retail outlets throughout China and preferential access to fast-growing market segments into China's smaller but faster-growing cities. This relationship demonstrates our strong commitment to the China market. Suning's distribution network, as well as its excellent reputation as a leading electrical appliance retailer in China, make it the ideal choice for this partnership, which is a key enabler to our China growth strategy to become the leading international appliance brand in China and grow our domestic sales to $1 billion over the next several years.","Turning to Slide 21. You'll see the progress our international business made towards our operating priorities. While demand remains soft in some markets, we are beginning to see signs of growth returning for our business in emerging markets. Our margin expansion efforts are on track through improved price mix, productivity and realizing the committed restructuring benefits. And lastly, we are supporting our business with a strong year of innovation, which is driving the growth and price\/mix improvements we are seeing across the company.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Larry Venturelli for his financial review.","Larry M. Venturelli","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. First, let me start by putting into context our first quarter performance relative to full year guidance. During our last call, as shown on Slide 23, we guided to annual GAAP EPS of $5 to $5.50 per share and ongoing business operations EPS of $6.50 to $7. Free cash flow guidance was $100 million to $150 million with our ongoing business cash flow of $950 million to $1 billion. Our first quarter results are well on plan to deliver annual guidance, which we are reconfirming this morning.","You may recall that guidance reflected essentially flat industry growth for the year and was based on margin expansion, driven from price and mix improvement; restructuring benefits from our costs and capacity reduction programs; ongoing productivity, which we expect during the second half of this year; the loss of material cost headwinds; and finally, we are increasing our marketing investment to support a significant new product innovation we're introducing this year.","As we discussed on our last call, we expect annual ongoing business operating profit margin to be between 5.5% to 6%. On Slide 24, you'll note that our ongoing business operating profit margin essentially doubled from 2.7% in Q4 to 5.3% in Q1, essentially at the bottom of our full year range. We are very pleased with our margin progression and remain confident in our guidance for the year.","On Slide 25, you'll note that for the quarter, GAAP EPS was $1.17 per share compared to $2.17 last year. It's very important to note that last year included $1.54 per share for BEFIEX tax credits and the energy tax credit program, which was not extended this year. Our 2012 first quarter results reflect only $0.08 per share from the BEFIEX tax credits. Adjusting for restructuring expense and the previously mentioned tax credits, our ongoing business operations delivered $1.41 per share, more than doubling from the $0.64 last year.","Slide 26 shows the drivers of our year-over-year ongoing business operations improvement, which was entirely driven by margin expansion. Price\/mix contributed approximately 4 points to our margin expansion during the quarter. We expect strong year-over-year price mix for the first half of the year and will begin to comp against last year's price increases during future quarters. Our cost and capacity reduction program is on track and contributed proximately 1 point to margin improvement. We remain confident in achieving the $200 million or 1 point of margin improvement this year as these benefits continue to build throughout the year. And additionally, we expect 1 point of margin improvement from this program in 2013.","We did generate approximately 0.5 point of margin improvement from normal productivity. Our productivity, consistent with our project pipeline, will build throughout the year and we expect to more than offset material headwinds during the second half of this year. Material headwinds negatively impacted margins by approximately 2.5 points. And as Jeff mentioned, we currently estimate headwinds to hit the higher end of our previous 3 to 3.5 -- $350 million range. In summary, delivering a 5.3% ongoing business operations margin during the first quarter, which is our lowest volume quarter of the year, puts us well on track to achieving our annual guidance of 5.5 points to 6 points. ","I wanted to briefly discuss 3 items. First, our effective tax rate was 27%, which was consistent with our annual guidance of 26% to 29%. And It's important to note that last year, we benefited from $54 million of energy tax credits. Secondly, restructuring expense was $34 million, up significantly from last year. Slide 29 illustrates that we continue to expect the total expense of our restructuring program to be approximately $500 million through 2013. And as I previously mentioned, we are own track to deliver the $200 million in benefits in 2012 with an additional $200 million of benefits in 2013. Thirdly, BEFIEX tax credits, included in our GAAP results, was $7 million compared to $66 million last year. The biggest driver of this decrease was a tax break program initiated by the Brazilian government, which reduces the amount of BEFIEX credit we are able to monetize. The program, which started December 1, 2011, was extended an additional 3 months through June 30, 2012. ","During our last call, we told you that our 2012 guidance includes $60 million to $80 million of BEFIEX credits compared to 260 million -- $266 million recognized in 2011. We modeled our 2012 guidance similar to the government's previous program, which was extended to 9 months. Should the current 7-month program not be extended to 9 months, we would be able to monetize additional credits of approximately $45 million. And just as a general reminder, both restructuring expense and BEFIEX credits are excluded from our ongoing business operation results and guidance, along with last year's energy tax credits and other one-time items.","Moving to our free cash flow results on Slide 30. As expected, we reported a free cash flow use of $515 million for the quarter, compared to a use of $336 million last year. These results include the final installment of $275 million related to the Brazilian collection dispute. In comparison to last year, we also had higher pension contributions, higher restructuring cash outlays and significantly lower monetization of BEFIEX tax credits.","Slide 31 depicts the underlying cash flow through our operations after taking to account these short-term cash requirements. As you can see, we are driving improvements in our cash flow from ongoing business operations as we largely put our legacy legal liabilities behind us this year. Overall, working capital is at a first quarter record low, driven largely by lower inventory levels.","On Slide 32, you'll see that our 2012 cash priorities remain funding the business, including capital expenditures and pension contributions; dividends; as I've previously mentioned, funding the remaining legacy legal liabilities, which will largely be behind us after this year; and debt repayment. ","Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff.","Jeff M. Fettig","Well, let me sum up our comments today. As you heard, we are on pace  to deliver our earnings and cash flow guidance for the year. Even as we continue to expect flat to slight demand improvement, we are executing very well against all of our key initiatives and remain confident in our ability to meet our margin expansion targets. Overall, we delivered a very strong first quarter, and we expect the full year 2012 to be a very strong year of operating profit performance improvement.","Long term, we remain very confident in the opportunities that we see to grow the business as we've outlined in Slide 35. In shorter term, we will continue to rapidly adjust our overall business to adapt to changes that continue to take place in the overall global marketplace. ","So with that, I'll conclude our formal remarks. And at this point in time, I'd like to open it up and take any questions that any of you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] With that, we'll take our first question from the side of Eric Bosshard.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","Curious about North America, specifically. You showed good progress with price and units obviously were softer, I think softer than what you would have expected. As you look through the balance of the year, how are you seeing retailers respond to how things played out in 1Q and if you think this is a sustainable situation?","Marc Bitzer","Eric, it's Marc. Let me try to answer your question, put it into 2 different buckets: one is the units, the other is the pricing, as you mentioned. First of all, unit. As we reported, units were down on industry shipments, 10%, which is slightly worse than we expected. At the same time, you got to also know that during the quarter, we saw quite a bit of trade inventory reduction, which is, as you know, difficult to peg, but I would peg it at around 3%. So through sell-through about probably minus 7%. And in addition, if you compare to previous year quarter, there was industry inventory build. So you've got to take that into account. With that in mind, we still forecast the full year industry shipments to be roughly flat, which is at the low end of our previous guidance. So that's the unit side. On the pricing, our pricing stuck. But what is more important even is the quality of our pricing because it was not just like-for-like, we also had a very strong mix in our Q1 performance and we see that continuing. So we remain, in fact, very confident at our full year, which is in line with our previous guidance.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","I guess to refine the question a little bit, how are the retailers looking at pricing and promotion? With sell-through down 7% in the first quarter, how are they thinking about the balance between unit sell-through and profitability?","Marc Bitzer","And Eric, and as you know, most major retailers, they report their numbers in a month from now. It's a good thing, but I would argue that most retailers see similar benefit as we have. You can sustain a softer unit environment if your price realization for the entire industry value chain is healthier. But it's too early to say that. And at the end of the day, we've got to waive off the retailers' report.","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes. Eric, this is Jeff. I would add just maybe to Marc's comments is this is really, as we talked about, particularly at the second half of last year, this is a replacement market. As we look through the data and see the type of purchases, it's not a discretionary market due to where consumer confidence is now. If you look at the retailers that have reported over -- at this point, the smaller retailers, the ones that are doing well are expanding their margins. They're benefiting from -- they understand that it's a replacement market. They're benefiting from margin improvement and they're getting comp store sales increases because of those higher revenues. And that's something that, I guess, as you think about it, being a fundamental replacement market is easy for them to understand.","Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company","I guess following on to that, you commented that you thought price\/mix would be the most favorable in 1Q and would ease a little bit 2Q to 4Q. It sounded like that was a function of comparisons. But should we be thinking that there's any change or erosion in what took place in the 1Q on the price and promotional change? Help us understand a little bit better if you would.","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, Eric. No, that is not the case. What  we talked about, the plus -- 4-plus points of price\/mix in Q1 year-over-year, it's based on the comparison. As you perhaps recall, we began -- it varied per market, but we started -- we had a very significant price increase in North America, I think, April 1 of last year. So the issue -- it is not an erosion of current pricing or mix, it is a comparison of against the pricing we took last year.","Marc Bitzer","Eric, it's Marc Bitzer. In addition to this one, first of all, the 4% that Jeff referred to is globally. North America was north of that number. The other thing is we have announced a price increase July 1 so that is already out there in the market, and we are executing that.","Operator","We'll move next to the side of David MacGregor.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","I guess just on the price increases, if we could pick up from where you just left off, Marc. What percentage of your current North American revenues will be impacted by that? My understanding is this is going to be a more selective kind of a price increase. I'm just trying to get a sense of breadth here.","Marc Bitzer","David, it's Marc Bitzer. We don't communicate the details. I mean, of course, our trade firms make up the price list and that is well out the market. I can only characterize in general terms, it's not in the same magnitude as the April last year one, but it's -- we're serious about this one and we have real mature cost increases, and we'll reflect them in our cost-based price increases.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And to what extent have all your competitors gone along with this, so far?","Marc Bitzer","David, honestly I can't comment on -- you probably need to ask -- sorry.","David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC","And I know it's pretty difficult to -- doing business in Europe right now, but presumably you've got raw materials cost inflation there as well. So how do you go about securing a price increase in Europe if, in fact, that's possible right now?","Michael A. Todman","Well, David, as you know -- this is Mike Todman. We announced price increases in Europe and we're in the process of executing them. We actually did see some positive price mix in the first quarter. We expect for that to progressively get better as we go throughout the year. And then we're just being -- we're sticking to and committed to the increases that we've announced.","Operator","We'll move next to the side of Michael Rehaut.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, just going back to better understanding pricing relating to the raw materials. Conceptually, should we be thinking that the price increase announced for July 1 to roughly offset the impact of the higher raw materials, is that a good way to think about it and maybe not just in North America but to the extent that you're trying to do this on -- continue to push price on a global basis?","Marc Bitzer","Mike, it's Marc. Let me just comment on North America. The answer is yes. So July 1 is conceptually reflecting the real material cost increases we have, as well as the last 4 ones also reflected a long-term trend of material cost increases.","Jeff M. Fettig","Michael, the more micro question globally is absolutely we do expect to offset raw material increases in part via price and the other part productivity, not only in North America but around the world. We have already announced in -- either implemented or have announced in other markets in Latin America and India and other places, price increases also where we have high inflation. When you have a high inflation environment, there's really not any other options other than to do that.","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes, Michael, this is Larry. Just for reference, if you go back to the last 3 years including 2012, we're absorbing close to $1 billion of higher material cost inflation, so we obviously are taking up pricing to recover that.","Michael Rehaut - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great, I appreciate that. And just as a follow-up, thinking about margins on a longer-term basis, kind of a two-parter. One, can you just remind us how you are thinking about incremental operating margins company-wide for incremental sales? What is that on an incremental margin basis -- operating margin basis? And if you can also, longer term, kind of walk us through from a timing perspective, the 8% consolidated operating margin goal that you've laid out in the past. I believe on your Analyst Day a year ago, correct me if I'm wrong, I think you were thinking that, that could be achievable by 2015, was it? And if there's just any update on how you're thinking about that playing out.","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, Michael, this is Jeff, let me take the last part first. Actually the day we had talked back to the -- actually fall of 2010 when we had the Investor Day, we outlined our expectations to drive the business to at least 8% plus operating profit by 2014. And as I said, last fall and in February, our expectations haven't changed. Clearly, last year was a setback, given the environment. But as we announced last October, we took very strong actions with our #1 priority being margin expansions. So this year, based on what we gave in the guidance and what we've outlined in our plans, we expect to be at 5.5% to 6% operating profit this year. We also, as a reminder, will have next year approximately $200 million, which is roughly a full point restructuring benefit in addition to what we get there. And we will continue investing in innovation. We will continue to do the things that we need to do to drive mix and expand margins. But we reiterate, it was our expectations that we'd get to the 8% plus by 2014. Now shorter term, your question, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Larry M. Venturelli","Yes. And just to add to Jeff said, Michael, in that guidance, we're not assuming a huge improvement in demand in the global industry when Jeff talks about that margin. And we believe that we have the visibility to get there based on the things that we can control. The question you asked on incremental margin, if you look at our business and the costs that we've taken out over the last several years, our cost of goods sold is highly variable in nature today. And if you look at our SG&A, it's, I would say, split between variable and fixed, so that should help you with your incremental question.","Operator","We'll move next to the side of Ken Zener.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","It's too bad the ITC ruling doesn't sync with any logical extension of what dumping damage means. And I'm interested if you guys have a better understanding of what damage to an industry means. But with the U.S. volume down as much as it is, it does stand in contrast to consumer recovery we're seeing in some other durable items, housing, nascent [ph], cars. Can you comment on the apparent disconnect and if in your opinion, how it might be related to price? I know you talked about the absence of elasticity, but it does seem surprising that the volume is not clicking up at all.","Marc Bitzer","Kenneth, it's Marc Bitzer. Let me just try to answer that. First of all, on the question as to why it's more -- of more instant [ph] recovering. I would argue without being too much [indiscernible], the rational factors when you look at housing affordability, mortgage rates, housing costs would speak in favor of a faster recovery of the demand, what stands in the way is still consumer confidence, which is still lagging behind. We do not expect a major recovery of consumer confidence until the end of the year. And that will be the center point in terms of when see the industry improving. So I think it's already in the back of consumer confidence, not necessarily the rational factors. They would clearly speak in favor of a faster recovery. The second point of your question, pricing versus demand. As Jeff mentioned before, we're basing our intention in all replacement markets, which historically has been and is now also confirmed is not elastic to pricing. It's just not -- I mean, if you're a replacement consumer, you buy and that is not necessarily driven by if there's a 10% discount or not.","Jeff M. Fettig","The only thing I'd add, Ken, is that again on the pricing question, I mean, if you look at our average pricing, all of those are still below where they were 3 years ago. So in a time where we had tremendous inflation, and to reinforce Marc's point, is the business that we are seeing is upgrading the mix. So again, I stick by what we said. I don't think pricing has had any impact on consumer demand in this market. On the first comment of the ITC, Marc really clearly laid out our position. I'd only reinforce 2 points. One is the Department of Commerce conclusively determined there is dumping taking place in this marketplace from those markets at a large magnitude, particularly for our type of industry. The ITC rule was determined whether that was cause of material damages to the industry, and in this case, Whirlpool. And it is unexplainable to us how that conclusion could have been reached and -- but we will not have the public opinion for probably another several weeks anyway. So until we see that, there's really nothing more we can say about it.","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Understood. When you guys get that public opinion, obviously, I hope you continue to post it to your Investor Relation page. The ITC, it's -- you can get things from there, but it's complicated. And is there any just broad comments you could make? Because to us it's unexplainable. However, despite your very rational decisions, you have behavior that might undermine your rational decisions. I mean if there's any color you have to add, I think that would be useful. And has there been any Brazilian land development by competitors?","Jeff M. Fettig","I'm sorry what was the last?","Kenneth R. Zener - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Brazilian land development by your competitors.","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, we can't give a lot of color right now on this other than a couple of points. One, I think anybody who's followed -- follows trade is as shocked as we were about this decision. I think clearly the people who did the work and came to the conclusion there is dumping, it was crystal clear. So in the end, you have a group of folks who have their discussions and deliberations. And that's where they came out and I cannot add any color to that. I can only reiterate Marc's point that we don't accept that outcome based on what we know. And that we were going to continue every avenue possible on all fronts to ensure that illegal dumping in the United States that impacts American investment and jobs is not acceptable in this global trade -- under global trade law. So Larry, you want to talk?","Larry M. Venturelli","And I think you asked questions on developments of new manufacturing in Brazil from competitive perspective. And then there's -- from what we've seen so far, no. There has been no new developments from -- and I think you're referring to Koreans.","Operator","We'll go next to this line of Sam Darkatsh.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First off, I thought, Mike, in your prepared remarks you mentioned that you were walking away from microwave and air conditioning units in Latin America. If true, could you help quantify the impact of that in the quarter on your units? And then also help reconcile -- the guidance for the year for Latin America units, does that include or exclude the walk-away business. If you could help put some color around that.","Michael A. Todman","Yes, yes, I will, Sam. First of all, we haven't completely walked away. What we have done is on the lower-end, lower profitable segments of those categories, particularly microwaves, air conditioners, vacuum cleaners, we've just elected not to sell. It actually, if you look at total units, had upwards of 6 points, if you will, on the total unit sales. So it was fairly significant, but it was a decision that we think makes a lot of sense. And as we look at our guidance for the marketplace, in total, we have included a total T9 as we call it in Latin America view. So it includes microwaves, it includes some air conditioners. It doesn't include some of the other items that we sell.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So we should expect then inferring from your words then that the industry growth closer to the high end of the range less whatever the impact would be, in this case 6 points for Whirlpool units for the year, is that how to look at that?","Michael A. Todman","No, actually, let me maybe give you some more specific. If you look at T3 units, in the first quarter, they were up around 20% in the industry. We were up well over that in T3. So if you expand it to the other ones, the industry was up about 11%. And what we said is, right now we've seen this stimulus, if you will, extended the tax holiday through the second quarter. And so that's the only visibility that we have. So we're just calling the industry now up to the high end of our range, 5% and it includes everything, okay? Now the T3, we expect to continue to be higher than that 5%.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","But the 2% to 5% is the T9?","Michael A. Todman","That's correct.","Sam Darkatsh - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Last question, and I'll defer to others. There's been some chatter in the marketplace about Daewoo, specifically, coming up for bid and perhaps your potential interest in it. I understand that there's probably some sensitivities around talking about that specifically. But Jeff, could you talk about your appetite for acquisitions and where it might make sense going forward?","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, Sam. First of all, we don't comment on rumors. As Larry laid out our priority for the year in terms of our investments, M&A was not on the priority list. And we're very focused on -- we have some great investments in innovation that we're getting, we expect to get great returns on. Funding the business, funding the dividend and pension, paying off legal liabilities, those are our priorities for this year.","Operator","And we have time for one last question. For that, we'll go to the line of Josh Pollard.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","There was no change in your guidance post pending what seems like a pretty material piece of business with Suning in China. Is this a relationship that doesn't go into place until 2013? Or do you need to build facility to begin a material ramp? I'm just trying to understand why that isn't having more of an impact on your numbers?","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes, Josh. First of all, in terms of the guidance, we're tracking very well through the first quarter after a very strong start. It's April, and so there was no -- we just felt confident in reinforcing the guidance that we have. The Suning relationship has been built over a very long period of time and it is actually driving significant revenue growth off of a very small base in China. So I don't expect -- it will have a material impact on our China business, but that not -- has not yet grown to a size where that's having a material impact on the total Whirlpool business.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So in other words, you guys already have a relationship with Suning. You...","Jeff M. Fettig","Well, absolutely.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You went to preferential status. Does that increase your what you would expect to sell to them by 20%, 50%, double it?","Jeff M. Fettig","At least double.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that's a double over 5 years? Or is that a double as soon as...","Jeff M. Fettig","Well, based on where we are now, this year or this year or next year.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. But it's not very significant to your overall business?","Jeff M. Fettig","Not yet, but it will be.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And when I think about for promotions, we're moving a little closer towards the holidays. I wanted to understand how much you budgeted for promotions last year, how that compares to this year and sort of on a quarterly basis, how you guys think about spending those figures.","Marc Bitzer","Josh, it's Marc Bitzer. As you know, we don't give specifics on promotion guidelines several quarters out. I mean, the only comment I want to make, we have said as a key priority, price margin realization is very key. And we will stick within these guidelines, but we will never give specific guidelines on promotion spend per quarter.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. If that's the case, can I sneak one more in?","Jeff M. Fettig","Sure, Josh.","Joshua Pollard - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to follow up on the previous question about your volume of 2% in Latin America. 20% was the industry on T3, you guys are much higher than that. T9 was up only 11%. I'm trying to understand the real impact on your business. Are you saying if you would have had all your normal volumes, your volumes would have been up 8%?","Jeff M. Fettig","Yes. Josh, again, the T3 refrigerators, washers and cooking products, that is the predominant revenue source in our business. But over the last several years, microwaves and air con, as far as the T9, have grown very largely. But in short, it was a very cool season, so the air con business was down dramatically. And as Marc reiterated and Mike, our -- we had -- our priority was to -- is to expand margins, so we sold a much, much better mix and we didn't sell a lot of units that were low. So I mean, the fact of the matter is, I mean, the simple answer to your question is on the T3, which is the core part of our business, we were up substantial. The market was up 20%. We were up more than that. So the rest of this stuff was basically profitless units that weren't sold.","So with that, we're going to conclude here. But again, I would just end, again we're very pleased with the progress we've made, thus far, in the year. There are some moving parts, but we feel like the actions we've put in place are going to allow us to deliver a very strong year of operating performance. So thank you for joining us today. We'll look forward to talking to you next time.","Operator","And this conclude today's program. Have a great day. You may disconnect at this time."]}}
